Item 1.

BUSINESS

General

Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation, doing business as Wabtec Corporation, is a Delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 Air Brake
Avenue in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania. Our telephone number is 412-825-1000, and our website is located at

www.wabtec.com

. All references to “we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company” and “Wabtec” refer to
Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. Westinghouse Air Brake Company (“WABCO”) was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from American Standard, Inc. (ASI). The Company’s
operations date back to 1869 when founded by George Westinghouse. In 1999, WABCO merged with MotivePower Industries, Inc. (“MotivePower”) and adopted the name Wabtec.

Today, Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based equipment and services for the global rail industry. We
believe we hold about a 50% market share in North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a leading position in North America for most of our other product lines. Our highly engineered products, which are intended to enhance safety,
improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, can be found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars and subway cars. In 2006, the Company had sales of approximately $1 billion and net income of approximately $85 million.
Sales of aftermarket parts and services represented over 50% of total sales in 2006.

Management and insiders of the Company own
approximately 6% of Wabtec’s outstanding shares, with the balance held by investment companies and individuals. Executive management incentive compensation focuses on earnings, cash flow, working capital and economic profit targets to align
management interests with those of outside shareholders.

Industry Overview

The Company primarily serves the worldwide freight and passenger transit rail industries. The worldwide market for rail equipment has been estimated at
about $70 billion annually. Our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity, financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad industry. Many factors influence the industry, including general economic
conditions; rail traffic, as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership; government investment in public transportation; and investment in new technologies by freight and passenger rail systems. Customers outside of North America accounted
for about 22% of Wabtec’s sales in 2006.

In North America, railroads carry about 42% of intercity freight, as measured by ton-miles,
which is more than any other mode of transportation. They are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system, serving nearly every industrial, wholesale and retail sector. Through direct ownership and operating
partnerships, U.S. railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in Canada and Mexico, forming what is regarded as the world’s most-efficient and lowest-cost freight rail service. There are more than 500 railroads
operating in North America, with the largest railroads, referred to as “Class I,” accounting for more than 90% of the industry’s revenues. Although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods, coal is the
single-largest item, representing about 40% of carloadings in 2006. Intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastest-growing market
segment in the past 10 years. Railroads operate in a competitive environment, especially with the trucking industry, and are always seeking ways to improve safety, cost and reliability. New technologies offered by Wabtec and others in the industry
can provide some of these benefits.

Outside of North America, many of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger
transit, rather than freight. In recent years, however, railroads in countries such as Australia, India and China have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems. Throughout the world,



government-owned railroads are being sold to private owners, who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and
new technologies. These investment programs represent additional opportunities for Wabtec to provide products and services.

Demand for our
freight related products and services in North America is driven by a number of factors, including:

•

Rail traffic.

The Association of American Railroads (AAR) compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry. Two important
statistics are revenue ton-miles and carloadings, which are generally referred to as “rail traffic”. According to preliminary AAR estimates for U.S. railroads, 2006 was a record year, with revenue ton-miles increasing 2.5%, carloadings
increasing 1.2% and intermodal units increasing 5.0%. As rail traffic increases, we believe that our customers will increase their level of spending on equipment and equipment maintenance.

•

Demand for new locomotives.

Currently, the active locomotive fleet for Class I railroads in North America is about 23,000 units. The average number of new
locomotives delivered over the past 10 years was about 1,100 annually. In 2006, about 1,200 new, heavy-haul locomotives were delivered, compared to about 1,100 in 2005.

•

Demand for new freight cars

. Currently, the active freight car fleet in North America is about 1.3 million. The average number of new freight cars delivered
over the past 10 years was about 53,000 annually. In 2006, about 75,000 new freight cars were delivered.

In the U.S.,
passenger transit is a $32 billion industry, dependent largely on funding from federal, state and local governments, and from fare box revenues. With about 40% of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles, New York City is the largest passenger
transit market in the U.S., but most major cities offer either rail or bus transit services.

Demand for North American passenger transit
products is driven by a number of factors, including:

•

Replacement, building and/or expansion programs of transit authorities.

These programs are funded in part by U.S. federal, state and local government
programs. In 2005, the U.S. federal government passed new legislation, known as SAFETEA-LU, which provides federal funding for transportation projects. The legislation authorizes funding of $45 billion from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2009, with average
annual increases of about 8%. The average annual number of new transit car deliveries over the past 10 years was about 600 units. In 2006, 738 transit vehicles were delivered.

•

Ridership levels

. Ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities, which use the funds primarily for equipment and system maintenance. Based on
preliminary figures from the American Public Transportation Association, ridership on U.S. transit vehicles increased about 3.0% in 2006, the fourth consecutive year that ridership has increased. Given the strength of the U.S. economy and the high
price of gasoline, the transit industry expects ridership to continue growing.

Business Segments and Products

We provide our products and services through two principal business segments, the Freight Group and the Transit Group. The Freight Group primarily
manufactures and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives, builds new switcher locomotives and rebuilds freight locomotives. The Transit Group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger
transit vehicles, typically subway cars and buses, builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars. Both business segments serve original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and provide aftermarket sales and services, with the aftermarket
accounting for over 50% of net sales. Some business units within the operating groups serve both freight rail and passenger transit rail customers. Beginning in 2006, the Company transferred certain operations between the Freight and Transit Groups
to reflect a shift in the markets and customers served by those operations and to



reflect the information used by the chief decision maker in evaluating the operations of the Company. All prior-period segment results have been adjusted for
this reclassification. In 2006, the Freight Group accounted for 65% of our total net sales, and the Transit Group accounted for the remaining 35%. In 2006, the Freight Group generated 50% of its net sales from the aftermarket and 50% of its net
sales from the OEMs. The Transit Group generated 58% of its net sales from the aftermarket and 42% of its net sales from OEMs. A summary of our leading product lines across both of our business segments is outlined below.

•

Braking equipment and related components

•

Brake assemblies

•

Draft gears, couplers and slack adjusters

•

Air compressors and dryers

•

Railway electronics, including train control systems, event recorders, monitoring equipment, and end of train devices

•

Friction products, including brake shoes

•

Rail and bus door assemblies

•

Heat exchangers and cooling systems

•

Commuter and switcher locomotives

We manufacture, sell and service high-quality electronics for railroads in the form of on-board systems and braking for locomotives and freight cars. We harden our products to protect them from severe conditions, including extreme
temperatures and high-vibration environments. Recently, we have concentrated our new product development on extending electronic technology to braking equipment and control systems.

We have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products, technological capabilities and new product
innovation. Our new product development effort has focused on electronic technology for brakes and controls. Over the past several years, we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic brakes and train control equipment that
encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols. In early 2007, for example, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) approved the use of our Electronic Train Management System

®

, which offers safety benefits to the rail industry. The Transit Group also focuses on
new product development and has introduced a number of new products during the past several years. Supported by our technical staff of over 500 engineers and specialists, we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines, which enables
us to provide comprehensive, systems-based solutions for our customers. We currently own over 1,000 active patents worldwide and 500 U.S. patents. During the last three years, we have filed for more than 150 U.S. patents in support of our new and
evolving product lines.

For additional information on our business segments, see Note 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

Competitive Strengths

Our key strengths include:

•

Leading market positions in core products

. Dating back to 1869 and George Westinghouse’s invention of the air brake, we are an established leader in the
development and manufacture of pneumatic braking equipment for freight and passenger transit vehicles. We have leveraged our leading position by focusing on research and engineering to expand beyond pneumatic braking components to supplying
integrated parts and assemblies for the locomotive through the end of the train. We are a recognized leader in the development and production of electronic recording, measuring and communications



systems, highly engineered compressors and heat exchange systems for locomotives and a leading manufacturer of freight car components, including electronic
braking equipment, draft gears, brake shoes and electronic end-of-train devices. We are also the leading manufacturer of commuter locomotives and a leading provider of complete door assemblies and couplers for passenger and transit vehicles.

•

Breadth of product offering with a stable mix of OEM and aftermarket business

. We believe that our substantial installed base of products to the OEMs is a
significant competitive advantage for providing products and services to the aftermarket because end-users often look to purchase safety and performance-related replacement parts from the original supplier. In addition, we believe our product
portfolio is one of the broadest in the rail industry, as we offer a wide selection of quality parts, components and assemblies across the entire train. Over the last several years, approximately 50% of our total net sales have come from our
aftermarket products and services business.

•

Leading design and engineering capabilities

. We believe a hallmark of our relationship with our customers has been our leading design and engineering
practice, which has, in our opinion, assisted in the improvement and modernization of global railway equipment. We believe both our customers and the federal authorities value our technological capabilities and commitment to innovation, as we seek
not only to enhance the efficiency and profitability of our customers, but also to improve the overall safety of the railways through continuous product improvement.

•

Significant barriers to entry

. We believe that there are a number of company and industry specific factors that represent meaningful barriers to entry:

•

Proprietary product offering

. We have an established record of product improvements and new product development. We have assembled a wide range of patented
products, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. We currently own over 1,000 active patents worldwide and 500 U.S. patents. During the last three years, we have filed for more than 150 U.S. patents in support of our new and
evolving product lines.

•

Substantial installed base.

We believe our installed base presents a meaningful barrier to entry in both the new product market and the aftermarket. As OEMs
and Class I railroad operators attempt to modernize fleets with new products designed to improve and maintain safety and efficiency, these products must be designed to be interoperable with existing equipment. We believe our dedicated research and
development staff and comprehensive product offering enables us to leverage our installed base to maintain our leadership position with OEMs and the Class I railroads. Similarly, we believe our substantial installed base makes us a preferred
supplier in the aftermarket, as end-users typically prefer to source performance and safety-related replacement parts and service from the original product supplier.

•

Regulatory nature of the rail industry.

Oversight of the U.S. rail industry is governed by the AAR and by a number of federal regulatory agencies, including
the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the FRA. These groups mandate rigorous manufacturer certification and new product testing and approval processes that we believe are difficult for new entrants to meet cost-effectively and
efficiently without the scale and extensive experience we possess.

•

Experienced management team

. Our executive management team has over 100 years of combined experience with the Company. The team implemented numerous
initiatives that enabled us to manage the cyclical downturn in the rail supply market in 2001 and 2002. These initiatives include the Wabtec Performance System (WPS), an ongoing program that focuses on “lean manufacturing” principles and
continuous improvement across all aspects of our business, including product development. As a result of these initiatives, our management team has improved our cost structure, operating leverage and financial flexibility and placed us in an
excellent position to benefit from growth opportunities in an improving market environment.



Business strategy

Using the Wabtec Performance System (WPS), we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies, as outlined below. Through WPS, we believe we can build on what we consider to be a leading position
as a low-cost producer in the industry while maintaining world-class product quality, technology and customer responsiveness. Through WPS and employee-directed initiatives such as Kaizen, a Japanese-developed team concept, we continuously strive to
improve quality, delivery and productivity, and to reduce costs. These efforts enable us to streamline processes, improve product quality and customer satisfaction, reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments. Over
time, we expect these lean initiatives to enable us to increase profit margins, which would improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies:

•

Expand aftermarket sales

. Historically, aftermarket sales are less cyclical than OEM sales because a certain level of aftermarket maintenance and service
work must be performed, even during an industry slowdown. Wabtec provides aftermarket parts and services for its components, and the company is seeking to expand this business with new customers such as short-line and regional railroads, or with
customers who currently perform the work in-house. In this way, we expect to take advantage of the rail industry trend toward outsourcing, as railroads and transit authorities focus on their core function of transporting goods and people, rather
than maintaining and servicing their equipment.

•

Accelerate new product development

. We continue to emphasize research and development funding to create new and improved products. We are focusing on
technological advances, especially in the areas of electronics, braking products and other on-board equipment, as a means of new product growth. We seek to provide customers with incremental technological advances that offer immediate benefits with
cost-effective investments.

•

Expand globally and into new markets

. We believe that international markets represent a significant opportunity for future growth. In 2006, total
international sales increased slightly to $370.1 million, including export sales from the Company’s U.S. operations of $134 million. We intend to increase our existing international sales through strategic acquisitions, direct sales of products
through our existing subsidiaries and licensees, and joint ventures with railway suppliers having a strong presence in their local markets. We are specifically targeting markets that operate significant fleets of U.S.-style locomotives and freight
cars, including Australia, China, India, Russia, South Africa, and select areas within Europe and South America.

•

Seek acquisitions

. We intend to explore acquisition opportunities using a disciplined, selective approach and certain financial criteria. We will be focused
on looking for companies that will help Wabtec to grow profitably, while helping to dampen any impact from potential cycles in the North American rail industry.

Recent Acquisitions

In 2006, Wabtec completed two acquisitions in support of its growth strategies.
In October, the company acquired Schaefer Equipment, Inc. (Schaefer) a leading manufacturer of forged brake rigging components for freight cars, for approximately $36 million in cash. Schaefer, based in Warren, Ohio, has annual sales of
approximately $30 million. Schaefer manufactures a variety of forged components for body-mounted and truck-mounted braking systems. In December, Wabtec acquired Becorit GmbH, (Becorit) a leading manufacturer of friction products for the European
transit railway industry, for approximately $51 million in cash. Based in Germany, Becorit has annual sales of approximately $30 million. Becorit manufactures a variety of brake shoes, pads and friction linings for passenger transit cars, freight
cars and locomotives, and also makes friction products for industrial markets such as mining and wind power generation.

Backlog

In 2006, over 50% of our sales came from aftermarket orders. Aftermarket orders typically carry lead times of less than 30 days, so they are not recorded
in backlog for a significant period of time. As such, the Company’s backlog is primarily an indicator of future original equipment sales, not expected aftermarket activity.



The Company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions, including
cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages. Substantial scope-of-work adjustments are common. For these and other reasons, completion of the Company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled. The railroad industry, in
general, has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation.

The backlog of firm customer orders as of December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2005, and the expected year of completion are as follows.

Engineering and Development

To execute our strategy to develop new products, we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, we invested about $32.7 million,
$32.8 million and $33.8 million, respectively, on product development and improvement activities. Approximately 40% of these costs comprise activities solely devoted to new product development in any given year. These engineering and development
expenditures, in total, represent about 3.0%, 3.2% and 4.1% of net sales for the same periods, respectively. Sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities, customers and other railroad product suppliers.

Our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies, with an emphasis on applying
electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment. Electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years, but freight railroads have been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability, connectivity and durability. We
are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hard-wired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads.

We use our Product Development System (PDS) to develop and monitor new product programs. The system requires the product development team to follow
consistent steps throughout the development process, from concept to launch, to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets.

Intellectual Property

We have more than 1,000 active patents worldwide. We also rely on a
combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property.

Certain trademarks, among them the name WABCO

®

, were acquired or licensed from American Standard Inc. in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the North American operations of the
Railway Products Group of American Standard. Other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business, or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program.

We have entered into, as licensor and licensee, a variety of license agreements. We do not believe that any single license agreement is of material
importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole.



We have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in Japan,
Nabtesco and Mitsubishi Electric Company. The licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key Japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in North America. We believe that our relationships with
these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in North America.

Customers

Our customers include railroads throughout North America, as well as in the United Kingdom, Australia, Europe, South Africa and India; manufacturers of
transportation equipment, such as locomotives, freight cars, subway vehicles and buses; lessors of such equipment; and passenger transit authorities, primarily those in North America.

In 2006, about 78% of our sales were to customers in North America, but we also shipped products to 108 countries throughout the world. Over 50% of our
sales were in the aftermarket, with the rest of our sales to OEMs of locomotives, freight cars, subway vehicles and buses.

Our top five
customers, Electro-Motive Diesel, GE Transportation Systems, Trinity Industries, Union Pacific Railroad, and Bombardier accounted for 26% of our net sales in 2006. No one customer represents 10% or more of consolidated sales. We believe that we have
strong relationships with all of our key customers.

Competition

We believe that we hold about a 50% market share in North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a leading market position in North America for most of our other product lines. Nonetheless, we operate
in a highly competitive marketplace. Price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very cost-conscious.

In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery, and customer service and support. Our principal competitors vary to some extent across
product lines, but most competitors are smaller, privately held companies. Within North America, New York Air Brake Company, a subsidiary of the German air brake producer Knorr-Bremse AG, is our principal overall OEM competitor. Our competition for
locomotive, freight and passenger transit service and repair is primarily from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ in-house operations, Electro-Motive Diesel, GE Transportation Systems, and New York Air Brake/Knorr. We
believe our key strengths, which include leading market positions in core products, breadth of product offering with a stable mix of OEM and aftermarket business, leading design and engineering capabilities, significant barriers to entry and an
experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace.

Employees

At December 31, 2006, we had 5,317 full-time employees, approximately 41% of whom were unionized. A majority of the employees subject to collective
bargaining agreements are within North America and these agreements generally extend through 2007, 2008, and 2009.

We consider our
relations with our employees and union representatives to be good, but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us.

Regulation

In the course of our operations, we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities. In the
United States, these include principally the FRA and the AAR.



The FRA administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. These
regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce.

The AAR oversees
a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters. The AAR also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that
provide equipment for use on railroads in the United States. New products generally must undergo AAR testing and approval processes.

As a
result of these regulations and those stipulated in other countries in which we derive our revenues, we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell.

Effects of Seasonality

Our business is not typically
seasonal, although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

We are dependent upon key customers.

We rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. For the fiscal year ended December 31,
2006, our top five customers, Electro-Motive Diesel, GE Transportation Systems, Trinity Industries, Union Pacific Railroad, and Bombardier, accounted for 26% of our net sales. While we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good,
our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. In addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as needed basis and operate in cyclical industries and, as a result, their order levels have varied
from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations. As a result of our dependence on our key customers, we
could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products.

Our business operates in a highly competitive industry.

We operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the United States and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than us.
Price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious purchasers, has



historically limited our ability to increase prices. In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality,
reliability of delivery and customer service and support. There can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations.

We intend to pursue future acquisition strategies that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits.

One aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and other business combinations that we
believe will improve our market position and realize operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings. Acquisitions, joint ventures and other business combinations involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including:

•

difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products;

•

diversion of management attention from other business concerns;

•

the assumption of unknown liabilities; and

•

unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. If we are unable to
identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate synergistic and strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. In
addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at
all.

As we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business.

We have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. Decisions to develop and
market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. Moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which
our customers may have a substantial capital investment. There can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new
products or services that may be introduced by competitors.

Our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit
markets and changes in government spending.

The railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to
overall economic conditions, the level of use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government spending on railroad transit projects. In economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain
expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. Reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products.

The passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical. New passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit
authorities. A substantial portion of our net sales has been, and we expect that a material



portion of our future net sales may be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and Amtrak. To the extent that future
funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of
business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a
result, us.

Prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.

Unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the United States and internationally (including as a result of terrorist activities and the
military response by the United States and other countries) could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. To the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts,
longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

A growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international
level.

In fiscal year 2006, 22% of our consolidated net sales were derived from sales outside of North America and we intend to
continue to expand our international operations in the future. We currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India,
Italy, Mexico and the United Kingdom. As a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including:

•

lack of complete operating control;

•

lack of local business experience;

•

currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations;

•

foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls;

•

difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights;

•

the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and

•

economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against American interests.

In addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-U.S. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash
flows.

We may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate
debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. There can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. Any
material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us.

We may have liability arising from asbestos litigation.

Claims have been filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the United States by
persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. Since 2000, the number of such claims has increased and the resolution of these claims may take a significant period of



time. Most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, Railroad Friction Products Corporation (RFPC), and are based on a product sold
by RFPC prior to the time that the Company acquired any interest in RFPC. On April 17, 2005, a claim against the Company by a former stockholder of RFPC contending that the Company assumed that entity’s liability for asbestos claims
arising from exposure to RFPC’s product was resolved in the Company’s favor.

Most of these claims, including all of the RFPC
claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. We cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by
insurance or that the indemnitors will remain financially viable. Our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.

It is Management’s belief that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present for a
variety of factors, including: (1) the limited asbestos case settlement history of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, RFPC; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the uncertainty of
asbestos litigation in particular. Despite this uncertainty, and although the results of the Company’s operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, Management believes that the final
resolution of the Company’s asbestos-related cases will not be material to the Company’s overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In general, this belief is based upon: (1) Wabtec’s and RFPC’s
limited history of settlements and dismissals of asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to RFPC’s product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to
demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss.

More specifically, as to RFPC, Management’s belief that any losses due to
asbestos-related cases would not be material is also based on the fact that RFPC owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. To date, RFPC’s insurers have provided RFPC with defense and indemnity in these
actions. As to Wabtec and its divisions, Management’s belief that asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former
owners of Wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue. To date, Wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of which confirmed
Wabtec’s position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain Wabtec assets. Although Wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have
not been material, and the Company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future.

We are subject
to a variety of environmental laws and regulations.

We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing
discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. We believe our operations currently comply in all material
respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply
with such requirements.

Our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims.

We warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. Accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the
event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers’ specifications. In addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same
level of historical warranty experience. Although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently



maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure you that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that
insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation.

Labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.

We collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 41% of our employees. Our current collective bargaining agreements generally extend
through 2007, 2008, and 2009. Failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. If we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient
number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. We cannot assure you that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. Such labor
disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business.

From time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers.

From time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. These disputes are
generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us.

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our
financial health.

At December 31, 2006, we have total debt of $150 million. If it becomes necessary to access our available
borrowing capacity under the Refinancing Credit Agreement, along with carrying the $150 million 6 7/8% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. For example, it could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;

•

place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and

•

limit our ability to borrow additional funds.

The indenture for our $150 million 6 7/8% senior notes due 2013 and our Refinancing Credit Agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses.

The indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion.

The Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from declaring or making
other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of
assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow
ratio.



The indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit
among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.

The integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating
synergies or may take longer to realize than expected.

In the fourth quarter of 2006 we completed the acquisition of 100% of the
stock of Schaefer and Becorit for a combined $87.2 million, net of cash received. Although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense
reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained. The management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations, including:

•

the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results;

•

significant expenses to integrate;

•

diversion of management attention;

•

departure of key personnel from the acquired business;

•

effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making;

•

integration of different information systems;

•

unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and

•

impairment of assets.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based
products and services for the global rail industry. Our products are found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles, as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world. Our products enhance safety,
improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles. Wabtec is a global company with operations
in 11 countries. In 2006, about 34% of the Company’s revenues came from outside the U.S. and about 22% came from outside of North America.

Management Review and Outlook

Wabtec’s long-term financial goals are to generate free cash flow in excess of net
income, maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital, increase margins through strict attention to cost controls, and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy, including global and market expansion, new
products and technologies, aftermarket products and services, and acquisitions. In addition, management monitors the Company’s short-term operational performance through measures such as quality and on-time delivery.

Freight rail industry statistics, such as carloadings and orders for new freight cars increased in 2006. Based on preliminary figures, deliveries of new
freight cars increased 9% and orders increased 14%, compared to the same period in 2005. As a result, at December 31, 2006, the backlog of freight cars ordered was 85,826. Sales in our freight segment have benefited from that trend. Following
are quarterly freight car statistics for the past three years:

reflect minor adjustments subsequent to that period from figures reported by the Railway Supply Institute.)



Carloadings and Intermodal Units Originated have increased over the past three years reflecting higher
rail traffic and ultimately better opportunities for maintenance and aftermarket sales for the Company:

Deliveries of transit cars were 738 and 918 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Deliveries of locomotives were 1,244 and
1,106 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In 2007, the Company expects conditions to remain generally
favorable in its freight rail and passenger transit rail markets. Demand for new locomotives is expected to be slightly higher than in 2006, while demand for new freight cars is expected to be slightly lower. Rail traffic volumes, which set a record
in 2006, started off slightly lower in January 2007, due in part to weather conditions. In the passenger transit rail market, the Company believes that increases in ridership and federal funding will continue to have a positive effect on the demand
for new equipment and aftermarket parts. In addition, the Company has a strong backlog of transit-related projects, some of which are expected to generate increased revenues in 2007.

In 2007 and beyond, we will continue to face many challenges, including increased costs for raw materials, higher costs for medical and insurance
premiums, and foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, we face general economic risks, as well as the risk that our customers could curtail spending on new and existing equipment. Risks associated with our four-point growth strategy include the
level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the Company, and risks inherent in global expansion. When necessary, we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in
market conditions and risks.

On July 19, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan to improve the profitability and
efficiency of certain business units. As part of the plan, Wabtec downsized two of its Canadian plants, in Stoney Creek and Wallaceburg, by moving certain products to lower-cost facilities and outsourcing. Wabtec recorded expenses of $6.8 million,
pre-tax, in 2006 for restructuring and other expenses, as a result of the approval of this plan. These expenses were comprised of the following components: $1.2 million for employee severance costs associated with approximately 240 salaried and
hourly employees located at our Wallaceburg and Stoney Creek locations; $2.2 million of pension curtailment for those employees; $2.9 million related to asset impairments for structures, machinery, and equipment; and $541,000 for goodwill impairment
specific to the Wallaceburg facility. As of December 31, 2006, the employees associated with the restructuring program had been terminated and none of the severance had been paid. Severance costs are contractual liabilities and payment is
dependent on the waiver by or expiration of certain seniority rights of those employees.

The restructuring plan will result in additional
charges in 2007 primarily for pension-related settlement charges. Pension funding will be subject to regulatory review and approval and funding is anticipated to be made in 2007.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table shows our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years indicated.

2006 COMPARED TO 2005

The following table summarizes the results of operations for the period:

Net sales increased by $53.6 million to $1,087.6 million in 2006 from $1,034.0 million in 2005.
The increase is primarily related to increased sales from our services, radiator and electronics business units of about $41 million, increased sales from contracts to build locomotives of about $27 million, increased revenues of about $22 million
related to higher industry freight car deliveries, incremental sales related to acquisitions consummated in the fourth quarter of about $10 million and increased transit sales of about $6 million as a result of increased spending by transit
authorities. These increases were partially offset by volume decreases of about $30 million due to lower industry sales of intermodal cars, and about $21 million for certain U.K. operations primarily related to overhaul contracts. The Company did
not realize any significant net sales improvement because of price increases or foreign exchange.

Net income for 2006 was $84.8 million or
$1.73 per diluted share. Net income for 2005 was $55.8 million or $1.17 per diluted share. As part of a restructuring plan, Wabtec recognized $6.8 million, pre-tax, in 2006 for restructuring and other charges. Net income improved primarily due to
sales increases, improvement in total operating costs as a percentage of sales, lower interest expense of $7.1 million, reduced other expense of $1.7 million, and a reduction of the overall effective income tax rate in 2006 to 31.7% from 35.6% in
2005 as a result of the reversal of previously established valuation allowances related to deferred state tax assets. Offsetting these improvements was an increase of about $5.9 million related to stock based compensation expense.



Net sales by segment.

Beginning in 2006, the Company transferred certain operations between
the Freight and Transit Groups to reflect a shift in the markets and customers served by those operations. Prior period results have been adjusted for comparability purposes. The following table shows the Company’s net sales by business
segment:

Industry deliveries of new freight cars for 2006 increased to 74,943 units as compared to 68,657
in 2005. Transit Group sales were higher due to increased commuter locomotive revenues.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased
to $296.8 million in 2006 compared to $259.6 million in 2005. Gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing, sales volume and product mix. In 2006, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 27% compared to 25% in 2005. The
restructuring plan charges impacted gross margin, with $6.3 million being recorded in cost of sales. In addition, specific reserves for transit related excess and obsolete inventory of $3.6 million were also recorded in cost of sales in 2006. Gross
profit improvement is due to a variety of factors including improved performance of a locomotive module contract which was profitable in 2006 compared to a loss in the prior year. The remaining improvement is due to cost savings realized from
sourcing raw materials from lower cost suppliers, reduced labor costs, and continuing improvements in our manufacturing processes.

The
provision for warranty expense was $3.1 million higher in 2006 compared to 2005, which negatively impacted gross profit. Part of the increase is due to $1.8 million of reductions in 2005 of specific reserves related to certain overhaul contracts and
transit door components that we established in 2004, which were deemed to be no longer necessary. Also, specific reserves of $1.4 million were established in 2006 for bus door components for our North America operations. Overall, our warranty
reserve increased at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005 by $1.2 million.

The following table shows our operating
expenses:

Operating expenses.

Operating expenses increased $8.8 million in 2006 as compared to
2005. These expenses were 15.4% and 15.3% of sales for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase is primarily due to an increase of $5.9 million in 2006 related to stock-based compensation expense as well as incremental costs associated with higher
sales volumes. The increase in stock-based compensation expense in 2006 is primarily a result of $2.5 million of expense related to non-vested restricted stock granted in 2006, incremental expense of $1.8 million related to incentive stock awards
and $1.3 million of expense incurred for stock options as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123 (R)). In addition, 2006 operating expenses
included $657,000 related to our 2006 acquisitions that occurred in the fourth quarter.



Income from operations.

Income from operations totaled $129.6 million (or 11.9% of sales)
in 2006 compared with $101.3 million (or 9.8% of sales) in 2005. Higher operating income resulted primarily from higher sales and improved operating performance in 2006.

Interest expense, net.

Interest expense decreased 81.7% in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the Company’s lower debt level during 2006 and higher interest income due to improved cash
balances.

Other expense, net.

The Company recorded a foreign exchange loss of $1.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively,
in 2006 and 2005, due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non U.S. dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings.

Income taxes.

The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 31.7% compared to 35.6% for the year ended
December 31, 2005. The lower effective rate in 2006 was primarily related to the reversal of previously established valuation allowances for deferred state tax assets.

Net income.

Net income for 2006 increased $29.0 million, compared with 2005. The increase was due to in large part to higher sales and
improved gross profit performance as a result of continuing improvements in our manufacturing process.

2005 COMPARED TO 2004

The following table summarizes the results of operations for the period:

Net sales increased by $212 million from $822 million in 2004 to $1,034 million in 2005, primarily
as a result of volume increases of about $85 million related to increasing freight car deliveries and strong demand for locomotive components, the acquisition of the friction product assets of Rutgers Rail S.p.A. (“CoFren”) resulting in
additional sales of $25 million, and incremental sales of $48 million from the ramp-up of a locomotive module contract in 2005. Aftermarket parts sales also increased by $53 million because of strong carloadings and intermodal units originated. The
Company did not realize any significant net sales improvement because of price increases or foreign exchange. Net income for 2005 was $55.8 million or $1.17 per diluted share. Net income for 2004 was $32.4 million or $0.71 per diluted share. This
increase in net income was primarily due to increased sales.

Net sales by segment.

Beginning in 2006, the Company transferred
certain operations from the Freight to the Transit Group to reflect a shift in the markets and customers served by those operations. Prior period results have been adjusted for comparability purposes. The following table shows the Company’s net
sales by business segment:



Industry deliveries of new freight cars for 2005 increased to 68,657 units as compared to 46,292 in 2004.
Transit Group sales were slightly higher mostly due to increased OEM demand.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased to $259.6
million in 2005 compared to $205.2 million in 2004. Gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing, sales volume and product mix. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to increased sales related to both aftermarket sales
increases and volume increases in freight car deliveries with gross profit of $41 million, the CoFren acquisition in the first quarter of 2005, and decreased warranty expense of $7 million. These positive factors were offset by reduced gross profit
from the ramp-up of a locomotive modules contract of $2 million and certain discrete restructuring costs of $3.1 million. In 2005, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 25% compared to 25% in 2004.

The provision for warranty expense was $7.1 million lower than the prior-year, which positively impacted gross profit. The most significant reason for
the reduction is due to non-recurring specific reserves established in 2004 for Canadian transit door contracts and certain electronic products. Overall, our warranty reserve decreased in 2005 by $1.3 million as claims were paid related to the 2004
specific reserves discussed above.

The following table shows our operating expenses:

Operating expenses.

Operating expenses increased $8.6 million in 2005 as compared to
2004. Operating expenses are higher in 2005 due to the addition of CoFren, a $1 million reserve for a note receivable that is considered uncollectible and overall higher costs from inflation and sales activity of about $4 million. The year ended
December 31, 2004 included a $3.2 million unfavorable litigation ruling in to GETS-GS which was settled in 2006. As a percentage of sales, total operating expense declined to 15.3% in 2005 from 18.2 % in 2004 due to the Company keeping
operating expenses relatively consistent in 2005 when sales increased 26%.

Income from operations.

Income from operations
totaled $101.3 million (or 9.8% of sales) in 2005 compared with $55.4 million (or 6.7% of sales) in 2004. Higher operating income resulted primarily from higher sales in 2005.

Interest expense, net.

Interest expense decreased 24.7% in 2005 as compared 2004 primarily due to the Company’s lower debt level
during 2005 and higher interest income.

Other expense, net.

The Company recorded a foreign exchange loss of $3.3 million and
$1.2 million, respectively, in 2005 and 2004, due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non U.S. dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings.

Income taxes.

The effective income tax rate was 35.6% for 2005. In 2004, Wabtec recorded a $4.9 million tax benefit after resolving certain
tax issues from prior years. Without this benefit, the overall effective income tax rate was 36.5% for 2004. The 2005 rate was lower due to increased income in lower tax jurisdictions.

Net income.

Net income for 2005 increased $23.3 million, compared with 2004. The increase was due to higher sales.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is provided primarily by operating cash flow and borrowings under the Company’s unsecured credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks (“credit agreement”). The following is a summary
of selected cash flow information and other relevant data:

Operating activities.

Operating cash flow in 2006 was $151.0 million as compared to
$84.3 million in 2005. This $66.7 million increase was the result of increased earnings as well as certain changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net income for the Company increased $29.0 million as a result of higher sales volumes and gross
profit. Accounts receivable increased cash flows in 2006 by $99.2 million primarily as a result of the collection of large milestone payments related to long-term locomotive contracts in 2006. Negatively impacting operating cash flows in 2006 is the
use of cash of $46.1 million from accrued liabilities and customer deposits, the majority of which relate to the long-term locomotive contracts discussed above. Also, negatively impacting operating cash flows by $9.3 million is the result of
increased inventory as compared to 2005.

Operating cash flow in 2005 was $84.3 million as compared to $53.5 million in 2004. This $30.8
million increase was the result of increased earnings as well as certain changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net income for the Company increased $23.4 million primarily as a result of the higher sales volume for 2005. Accrued income taxes
increased operating cash flows by $16 million in 2005 due to the timing of tax payments in 2004. In particular, tax liabilities recognized in 2003, were liquidated in 2004. Accrued liabilities and customer deposits generated operating cash flows of
$36.6 million more than the prior year. In particular, customer deposits from certain locomotive contracts accounted for the majority of this increase. Net other assets and liabilities generated approximately $13.9 million in cash related to
increasing liability balances related to pensions, post retirement healthcare, and long term incentive plan liabilities. Negatively impacting operating cash flows were accounts receivable which used operating cash of $38.8 million and accounts
payable decreased using cash of approximately $20.8 million. Accounts receivable had increased as a result of the correspondingly higher sales for 2005. Accounts payable decreased as the Company reduced trade payables.

Investing activities.

In 2006 and 2005, cash used in investing activities was $104.8 million and $57.6 million, respectively. In 2006, we
acquired 100% of the stock of Schaefer Equipment and Becorit for $36.3 million and $50.9 million, respectively, net of cash received. The remaining use of cash consisted almost entirely of capital expenditures, net of disposals. In 2005, we acquired
the assets of Rutgers Rail S.p.A. for $35.9 million, net of cash received. The remaining use of cash consisted almost entirely of capital expenditures, net of disposals.

Capital expenditures for continuing operations were $20.9 million, $22.7 million and $19.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The majority of capital expenditures for these periods relates to upgrades to
and replacement of existing equipment.

Financing activities.

In 2006, cash used by financing activities was $1.8 million
compared to cash provided by financing activities of $27.8 million in 2005. The decrease relates to reduced proceeds received related to stock option exercises in 2006 as a result of an overall decrease in options exercised in 2006 as compared to



2005. Also, on July 31, 2006 the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to $50 million of the Company’s outstanding
shares. Through December 31, 2006 the Company had repurchased 673,900 shares for an aggregate cost of $18.9 million.

The Company
realized proceeds of $14.6 million and $29.8 million from the exercise of stock options during 2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2004, long term debt was reduced by $40.1 million. The Company also realized proceeds of $22.8 million from the
exercise of stock options during 2004.

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu with all existing and
future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture under which the Notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence
of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. The Company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these
measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities.

The following table shows outstanding
indebtedness at December 31, 2006 and 2005. The revolving credit agreement and other term loan interest rates are variable and dependent on market conditions.

Cash balance at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $188.0 million and $141.4 million,
respectively.

Refinancing Credit Agreement.

In January 2004, the Company refinanced its existing unsecured revolving credit
agreement with a consortium of commercial banks. This “Refinancing Credit Agreement” provided a $175 million five-year revolving credit facility expiring in January 2009. In November 2005, the Company entered into an amendment to the
Refinancing Credit Agreement which, among other things, extended the expiration of the agreement until December 2010. At December 31, 2006, the Company had available bank borrowing capacity, net of $23.9 million of letters of credit, of
approximately $151.1million, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.

Refinancing Credit Agreement borrowings bear variable
interest rates indexed to the indices described below. The Company did not borrow under the Refinancing Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2006.

Under the Refinancing Credit Agreement, we may elect a base interest rate or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rates of Interest (“LIBOR”). The base interest rate is the greater of
LaSalle Bank National Association’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% per annum. The LIBOR rate is based on LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 62.5 to 175 basis points depending on the Company’s consolidated
total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The current margin is 62.5 basis points.

The Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the
Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions
including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments;
capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio.



The Refinancing Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including payment defaults,
failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect, covenant defaults, defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the Company, bankruptcy, certain judgments against the Company, ERISA defaults and “change of
control” of the Company. The Refinancing Credit Agreement includes the following covenants: a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3, maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 3.25 and a minimum net worth of $180 million plus 50% of consolidated net
income since September 30, 2003. The Company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities. See Note 9 of “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

Management believes that based on current levels
of operations and forecasted earnings, cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements. If sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the Company’s cash
requirements, the Company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available, and, in any case, such new financing, if available, would be expected to
be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place.

The Company entered into an amendment to its Refinancing Credit
Agreement in February 2007. Prior to the amendment, the Refinancing Credit Agreement prohibited the Company from making acquisitions past a certain dollar limit without the prior approval of the bank consortium. The Refinancing Credit Agreement now
permits the Company to complete acquisitions as long as certain financial parameters and ratios are met.

Effects of Inflation

In general, inflation has not had a material impact on the Company’s results of operations. Some of our labor contracts contain negotiated salary and
benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses, which would cause our labor cost to automatically increase if inflation were to become significant. However, higher costs of metals have reduced gross margin. Other areas of
higher costs include medical benefits for active and retired employees.



Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and have certain contingent commitments
such as debt guarantees. The Company has grouped these contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements into operating activities, financing activities, and investing activities in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of
Consolidated Cash Flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information. The table below provides a summary of contractual obligations and
off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2006:

(1)

Purchase obligations for the purposes of this disclosure have been defined as a contractual obligation that is in excess of $100,000 annually, and $200,000 in total.

(2)

Future minimum payments for operating leases are disclosed by year in Note 15 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this
report.

(3)

Annual payments to participants are expected to continue into the foreseeable future at the amounts or ranges noted. Pension benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using
current assumptions for discount rates, expected return on long-term assets and rate of compensation increases. The Company expects to contribute about $13.7 million to pension plan investments in 2007. See further disclosure in Note 10 of the
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

(4)

Annual payments to participants are expected to continue into the foreseeable future at the amounts or ranges noted. Postretirement payments are based on actuarial estimates using
current assumptions for discount rates and health care costs. See further disclosure in Note 10 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

(5)

Interest payments are payable January and July of each year at 6 7/8% of $150 million Senior Notes due in 2013.

(6)

Scheduled principal repayments of outstanding loan balances are disclosed in Note 9 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15
of this report.

(7)

Shareholder dividends are subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, currently at an annual rate of approximately $1.9 million.

(8)

The annual capital expenditure budget is subject to approval by the Board of Directors. The 2007 budget amount was approved at the December 2006 Board of Directors meeting.

(9)

The Company has $23.9 million in outstanding letters of credit for performance and bid bond purposes, which expire in various dates through 2010.



Obligations for operating activities.

The Company has entered into $28.2 million of material
long-term non-cancelable materials and supply purchase obligations. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for rental of facilities and equipment. Estimated pension funding and post retirement benefit payments are based on actuarial
estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, expected return on long-term assets, rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Benefits paid for pension obligations were $7.8 million and $7.5 million in 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Benefits paid for post retirement plans were $2.2 million and $2.7 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Obligations
for financing activities.

Cash requirements for financing activities consist primarily of long-term debt repayments, interest payments and dividend payments to shareholders. The Company has historically paid quarterly dividends to shareholders,
subject to quarterly approval by our Board of Directors, currently at a rate of approximately $1.9 million annually.

The Company arranges
for performance bonds to be issued by third party insurance companies to support certain long term customer contracts. At December 31, 2006, initial value of performance bonds issued on the Company’s behalf is about $103.3 million.

Obligations for investing activities.

The Company typically spends approximately $15 million to $25 million a year for capital
expenditures, primarily related to facility expansion efficiency and modernization, health and safety, and environmental control. The Company expects annual capital expenditures in the future will be within this range.

Critical Accounting
Policies

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Areas of uncertainty
that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives, environmental matters, warranty reserves, the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, proceeds on assets to be sold, pensions and other
postretirement benefits, and tax matters. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates, and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to
prepare the Company’s financial statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and the



financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. A discussion of the judgments and uncertainties
associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in Notes 2 and 18, respectively, in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”
included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the
Company’s operating results and financial condition.







Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may
adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt. There was no outstanding variable rate debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Management had entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap contracts that mitigated the
impact of variable-rate debt interest rate increases. These interest rate swap contracts were terminated in 2004. In 2003, we had concluded that our swap contracts qualified for “special cash flow hedge accounting” which permitted
recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations. As of December 31, 2006, we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2007.

We entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Forward contracts are agreements with a
counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. There is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. At the delivery date we can either take delivery of the currency
or settle on a net basis. All outstanding forward contracts are for the sale of U.S. Dollars (USD) and the purchase of Canadian Dollars (CAD). As of December 31, 2006, we had forward contracts with a notional value of $48 million CAD (or $42.7
million U.S.), with an average exchange rate of $0.89 USD per $1 CAD, resulting in the recording of a current liability of $1.3 million and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $825,000, net of tax.

We are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 66% of Wabtec’s net sales are in the United States, 10% in Canada, 2% in Mexico, 4% in Australia, 1% in Germany, 9% in the United Kingdom, and 8% in other
international locations. (See Note 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report).

Our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at December 31, 2005.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that
it has taken or expects to take on a tax return. FIN 48 is effective in the first quarter of 2007. The cumulative effects, if any, of applying this Interpretation will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the
period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this statement on its financial statements.

In September 2006, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),” (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the
funded status of each of its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability in its statement of financial position with an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income, and to recognize changes in
that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income. This Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS 158 as of December 31, 2006. The provisions of SFAS 158 are to be applied on a prospective basis; therefore, prior



periods presented have not been restated. The adoption in 2006 had no effect on the computation of net periodic benefit expense for pensions and
postretirement benefits. See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for the impact of the adoption on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2006.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 becomes effective for Wabtec on January 1, 2008. Upon adoption, the provisions of SFAS 157 are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions. The adoption of SFAS 157 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, Wabtec adopted SFAS 123 (R), which requires the company to
recognize compensation expense for stock-based compensation based on the grant date fair value. This expense must be recognized ratably over the requisite service period following the date of grant. Wabtec has elected the modified prospective
transition method for adoption, and prior periods financial statements have not been restated. Prior to January 1, 2006, Wabtec accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
(APB 25), “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations. As a result of the adoption, stock-based compensation expense for 2006 includes $1.3 million of expense related to stock options that previously was not
recognized under APB 25.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

Wabtec’s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of
Wabtec’s “disclosure controls and procedures,” (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of December 31, 2006. Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that
Wabtec’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Wabtec in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Wabtec in such reports is accumulated and communicated to Wabtec’s management,
including its principal executive officer and principal finance officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There was no change in Wabtec’s “internal control over
financial reporting” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2006, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Wabtec’s internal control over
financial reporting. Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of the registered public accounting firm are included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

“Company”) were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts that are based on
management’s best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the 10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.

Management also recognizes its responsibility for conducting the Company’s affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and reflected in key
policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business activities within the laws of host countries in which the Company operates and potentially conflicting outside business interests of its employees. The
Company maintains a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order
to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Management has excluded Schaefer Equipment, Inc. (Schaefer) and Becorit GmbH (Becorit) from its assessment of
internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 because Schaefer and Becorit were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations effective October 6 and December 1, 2006, respectively. Schaefer and
Becorit are wholly owned subsidiaries whose total assets and net sales represent 11.8% and 0.9%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Management’s
Certifications

The certifications of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act have been included in Exhibits 31 and 32 in the Company’s 10-K. In addition, in 2006, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer provided to the New York Stock Exchange the annual CEO certification regarding the
Company’s compliance with the New York Stock Exchange’s corporate governance listing standards.

Technologies Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. Our audits also included
the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board

the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As explained in Note 10 to the
consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of
FASB Statements No. 87, 88,106 and 132(R)”. As explained in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, for the year ended December 31, 2006 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (R),
“Share-Based Payment”.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that
Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Schaefer Equipment, Inc. and Becorit GmbH, which are included
in the 2006 consolidated financial statements of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and constituted 11.8% of total assets as of December 31, 2006 and 0.9% of net sales for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Schaefer Equipment, Inc. and Becorit GmbH.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.



We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 and our report dated February 23, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

and Wabtec also sold products or services in 108 countries around the world.

2.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. Such statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Sales between subsidiaries are billed at prices consistent with sales to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific
allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $3.6 million and $4.1 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
Inventory costs include material, labor and overhead.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment additions
are stated at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements are capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The Company provides for book depreciation principally on the straight-line method.
Accelerated depreciation methods are utilized for income tax purposes.

Leasing Arrangements

The Company conducts a portion
of its operations from leased facilities and finances certain equipment purchases through lease agreements. In those cases in which the lease term approximates the useful life of the leased asset or the lease meets certain other prerequisites, the
leasing arrangement is classified as a capital lease. The remaining arrangements are treated as operating leases.

Intangible
Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Other intangibles (with definite lives) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible
assets are reviewed annually for impairment and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present.

The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value (including goodwill). The Company uses a
combination of a guideline public company market approach and a discounted cash flow model (“DCF model”) to determine the current fair value of the business. A number



WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecasted operating cash flows, including markets and market
share, sales volume and pricing, costs to produce and working capital changes. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its business are estimated. However, actual fair value that could
be realized could differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.

Warranty Costs

Warranty costs are accrued
based on management’s estimates of repair or upgrade costs per unit and historical experience. Warranty expense was $10.9 million, $7.8 million and $14.9 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Warranty reserves were $17.4 million and
$16.2 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws. The provision for income taxes
includes federal, state and foreign income taxes.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123 (R), “Share-Based Payment,” (SFAS) 123 (R)) which requires the Company to recognize compensation expense for stock-based compensation based on the grant date fair
value. This expense must be recognized ratably over the requisite service period following the date of grant. Wabtec has elected the modified prospective transition method for adoption, and prior periods financial statements have not been restated.
Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
interpretations. See Note 13 for a detailed discussion of the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.

Pro Forma Effect Prior
to the Adoption of SFAS 123 (R)

The Company’s net income and earnings per share for 2005 and 2004 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts shown below if compensation expense had been determined based on the fair value
at the grant dates in accordance with SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”.

Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company periodically enters into
interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on its variable rate borrowings. Interest rate swaps are agreements with a counterparty to exchange periodic interest payments (such as pay fixed, receive variable)
calculated on a notional principal amount. The interest rate differential to be paid or received is recognized as



WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

interest expense. The Company has concluded its interest rate swap contracts qualify for “special cash flow hedge accounting” which permit
recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss) on the balance sheet. The Company’s last interest rate swaps matured in 2004.

The Company also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Forward contracts are
agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. There is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. At the delivery date the Company can either take
delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. All outstanding forward contracts are for the sale of U.S. Dollars (USD) and the purchase of Canadian Dollars (CAD). The Company has also concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts
qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2006, the
Company had forward contracts with a notional value of $48 million CAD (or $42.7 million U.S.), with an average exchange rate of $0.89 USD per $1 CAD, resulting in the recording of a current liability of $1.3 million and a corresponding offset in
accumulated other comprehensive loss of $825,000, net of tax.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries, except for the Company’s Mexican operations whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date while income and expenses are translated at the average
rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from transactions, and the translation of financial statements are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements based upon the provisions
of SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation.” The effects of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions and balances of a long-term investment nature are accumulated and carried as a component of shareholders’
equity. The effects of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non U.S. dollar denominated amounts are charged or credited to earnings. Foreign exchange intercompany transaction losses recognized in income were $1.1
million, $3.3 million and $1.2 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as net income and all other non-owner changes in shareholders’ equity. The Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, foreign
currency hedges, foreign exchange contracts and pension related adjustments

.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is
recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletins (SABs) 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements” and 104 “Revision of Topic 13.” Revenue is recognized when products have been shipped to the respective customers,
title has passed and the price for the product has been determined.

The Company recognizes revenues on long-term contracts based on the
percentage of completion method of accounting. The units-of-delivery method or other input-based or output-based measures, as appropriate, are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts. Contract revenues and cost
estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined. Provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts.

Certain pre-production costs relating to long-term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the life of the
contracts. Deferred pre-production costs were $6.5 million, $4.9 million and $5.3 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Significant Customers and Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company’s trade receivables are primarily from rail and transit industry original equipment manufacturers, Class I railroads, railroad carriers and



WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

commercial companies that utilize rail cars in their operations, such as utility and chemical companies. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs

All fees billed to the
customer for shipping and handling are classified as a component of net revenues. All costs associated with shipping and handling is classified as a component of cost of sales.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004, the Company incurred costs of approximately $32.7 million, $32.8 million and $33.8 million, respectively.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, approximately 41% of the Company’s workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are generally effective through 2007, 2008 and 2009. Agreements
expiring in 2007 cover approximately 19% of the Company’s workforce.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per common share
are computed by dividing net income applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income applicable to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities (such as employee stock options).

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified, where necessary, to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
amounts could differ from the estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN
48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements
uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return. FIN 48 is effective in the first quarter of 2007. The cumulative effects, if any, of applying this Interpretation will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as
of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this statement on its financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),” (SFAS 158). SFAS
158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of each of its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability in its statement of financial position with an offsetting amount in accumulated other
comprehensive income, and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income. This Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS 158 as of December 31, 2006. The provisions of SFAS 158 are to
be applied on a prospective basis; therefore, prior periods presented have not been restated. The adoption in 2006 had no effect on the computation of net periodic benefit expense for pensions and postretirement benefits. See Note 10 for the impact
of the adoption on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2006.



WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” (SFAS
157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of this standard apply to other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS 157 becomes effective for Wabtec on January 1, 2008. Upon adoption, the provisions of SFAS 157 are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions. The adoption of SFAS 157
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

ACQUISITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On
October 6, 2006, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of Schaefer Equipment, Inc. (Schaefer), based in Warren, Ohio, a manufacturer of forged brake rigging components for freight cars. The purchase price was $36.3 million, net of cash
received, resulting in additional goodwill of $23.9 million. Schaefer manufactures a variety of forged components for body-mounted and truck-mounted braking systems. In addition, on December 1, 2006, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of
Becorit GmbH, (Becorit) a manufacturer of friction products for the European transit railway industry. The purchase price was $50.9 million, net of cash received, resulting in additional goodwill of $30.0 million. Becorit manufactures a variety of
brake shoes, pads and friction linings for passenger transit cars, freight cars and locomotives, and also makes friction products for industrial markets such as mining and wind power generation.

On February 1, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of the assets of Rütgers Rail S.p.A, a business with operations in Italy, Germany,
France and Spain. The company formed to hold the purchased assets of Rütgers Rail S.p.A. is named CoFren S.r.l. (“CoFren”). CoFren is a manufacturer of brake shoes, disc pads and interior trim components for rail applications in
Europe. The purchase price was $35.9 million, net of cash received, resulting in additional goodwill of $5.7 million.

The acquisitions
were accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the respective assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Due to the timing of the acquisitions, we are still in the
process of finalizing the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities, and therefore the purchase price allocations are preliminary and subject to change once finalized. Operating results have been included in the consolidated statement of
operations from the acquisition date forward.



WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

For the acquisitions that occurred in 2006, the following table summarizes the preliminary estimated
fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition:

For Schaefer, of the preliminary allocation of $4.2 million of acquired intangible assets,
exclusive of goodwill, $1.9 million was assigned to customer relationships, $1.2 million was assigned to trademarks, and $1.1 million was assigned to energy supply contracts. The trademarks have been identified as infinite lived assets while the
weighted average useful lives of the customer relationships and energy supply contracts is 20 years. For Becorit, of the preliminary allocation of $10.4 million of acquired intangible assets, exclusive of goodwill, $6.2 million was assigned to
customer relationships, $3.2 million was assigned to the trade name, $700,000 was assigned to patents, and $300,000 was assigned to backlog. The trade name is considered to have an infinite useful life while the patents and customer relationships
average useful life is 19 years.

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents income statement results as if all the
acquisitions listed above had occurred January 1, 2005:

With the 2005 acquisition of Rütgers Rail, S.p.A., the Company decided to offer for sale a
non-core product division. As part of the purchase accounting, the carrying value of this division had been adjusted to its estimated net realizable value and had been classified as assets held for sale, which is included in other noncurrent assets
on the balance sheet.

At March 31, 2006, the sale of this division was completed for approximately $1.4 million in cash, including a
working capital adjustment of approximately $600,000 which was established with the buyer in the fourth quarter 2006. The assets sold primarily included transit car interior products and services for customers located in



WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Europe. This sale resulted in a loss of approximately $1.7 million including the working capital adjustment. This adjustment is subject to review through
independent arbitration and a ruling is expected sometime in late 2007. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company decided to liquidate its bus door joint venture in China, which resulted in an impairment charge approximating $1 million.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, the operating results of
these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for all years presented and are summarized as of December 31, as follows:

4.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW DISCLOSURES

On July 31, 2006, the Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of the Company’s outstanding shares. The Company intends to purchase these shares on the open market or in negotiated or block trades. No time limit was set for the completion of the
program which qualifies under the Refinancing Credit Agreement, as well as the 6


/8% Senior Notes currently
outstanding. During 2006, 673,900 shares were repurchased at a total cost of $18.9 million.

5.

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

On
July 19, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan to improve the profitability and efficiency of certain business units. As part of the plan, Wabtec downsized two of its Canadian plants, in Stoney Creek and Wallaceburg, by
moving certain products to lower-cost facilities and outsourcing. Wabtec recorded expenses of $6.8 million, pre-tax, in 2006 for restructuring and other expenses, as a result of the approval of this plan. These expenses were comprised of the
following components: $1.2 million for employee severance costs associated with approximately 240 salaried and hourly employees located at our Wallaceburg and Stoney Creek locations; $2.2 million of pension and postretirement benefit curtailment for
those employees; $2.9 million related to asset impairments for structures, machinery, and equipment; and $541,000 for goodwill impairment



WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

specific to the Wallaceburg facility. As of December 31, 2006, the employees associated with the restructuring program had been terminated and none of
the severance had been paid. Severance costs are contractual liabilities and payment is dependent on the waiver by or expiration of certain seniority rights of those employees.

The restructuring plan will result in additional expenses in 2007, primarily for pension-related settlement charges. Pension funding will be subject to
regulatory review and approval, and funding is anticipated to be made in 2007.

In the first six months of 2005, the Company recorded
restructuring and asset impairment charges totaling $2.3 million related to consolidating two U.K. facilities into one, relocating a product line from Canada to the U.S., and completion of a data center migration. These charges consisted of
severance costs of $593,000 for 43 employees, relocation and other costs of $469,000 and asset impairment of $1.2 million. All but $235,000 of these costs were paid for as of December 31, 2005 with the remaining costs paid in 2006.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded restructuring charges of about $800,000 relating to consolidating two Australian facilities into
one. During 2006, an additional $74,000 of restructuring charges was recorded. The total charges consisted of severance costs of $647,000 for 14 employees, relocation and other costs of $71,000, and an asset impairment of $56,000. As of
December 31, 2006 all but $527,000 of these costs have been paid, which includes $305,000 of unpaid employee severance costs.

PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT

The major
classes of depreciable assets are as follows:



WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

Depreciation expense was $21.7 million, $21.7 million and $22.8 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

8.

INTANGIBLES

Goodwill and other intangible assets
with indefinite lives are no longer amortized. Instead, they are subject to periodic assessments for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. The fair value of these reporting units was determined using a combination of discounted cash flow
analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information. Goodwill still remaining on the balance sheet is $173.3 million and $118.2 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company’s trademarks had a net carrying amount of $24.0 million and $19.9 million, respectively, and the

LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt consisted of the
following:

Refinancing Credit Agreement

In January 2004, the Company refinanced its existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks. This “Refinancing Credit Agreement” provided a $175 million five-year
revolving credit facility expiring in January 2009. In November 2005, the Company entered into an amendment to the Refinancing Credit Agreement which, among other things, extended the expiration of the agreement until December 2010. At
December 31, 2006, the Company had available bank borrowing capacity, net of $23.9 million of letters of credit, of approximately $151.1 million, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.

Refinancing Credit Agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below. The Company did not borrow under the
Refinancing Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2006.

Under the Refinancing Credit Agreement, we may elect a base
interest rate or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rates of Interest (“LIBOR”). The base interest rate is the greater of LaSalle Bank National Association’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus
0.5% per annum. The LIBOR rate is based on LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 62.5 to 175 basis points depending on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The current margin is 62.5 basis points.

The Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from declaring or making
other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of
assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio.



WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Refinancing Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including payment defaults,
failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect, covenant defaults, defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the Company, bankruptcy, certain judgments against the Company, ERISA defaults and “change of
control” of the Company. The Refinancing Credit Agreement includes the following covenants: a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3, maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 3.25 and a minimum net worth of $180 million plus 50% of consolidated net
income since September 30, 2003. The Company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants.

The Company entered into an
amendment to its Refinancing Credit Agreement in February 2007. Prior to the amendment, the Refinancing Credit Agreement prohibited the Company from making acquisitions past a certain dollar limit without the prior approval of the bank consortium.
The Refinancing Credit Agreement now permits the Company to complete any acquisitions as long as certain financial parameters and ratios are met.

6.875% Senior Notes Due August 2013

In August 2003, the Company issued $150 million of Senior Notes due in 2013 (“the
Notes”). The Notes were issued at par. Interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 6.875% per annum and is payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year. The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the
Company’s existing credit agreement, and for general corporate purposes. The principal balance is due in full at maturity.

The Notes
are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture under which the Notes were issued contains
covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company sponsors
various defined benefit plans including pension and post retirement benefits as disclosed below. In addition, as previously stated, the Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS 158 as of December 31, 2006, excluding the elimination of the
early measurement date, which is not required until December 31, 2008. The provisions of SFAS 158 are to be applied on a prospective basis; therefore, prior periods presented have not been restated. The adoption in 2006 had no effect on the
computation of net periodic benefit expense for pensions and postretirement benefits. The following table illustrates the incremental effect of applying SFAS 158 on individual items on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2006.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that cover certain U.S., Canadian, German and United Kingdom employees and which provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service of the employee.

The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for the U.S., Canadian and German plans. The U.K. plan uses an October 31
measurement date. The following tables provide information regarding the Company’s defined benefit pension plans summarized by U.S. and international components.

Obligations and Funded Status



WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The aggregate accumulated benefit obligation for the U.S. pension plan was $47.8 million and $49.3
million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The aggregate accumulated benefit obligation for the international pension plans was $116.2 million and $92.8 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Benefit
obligations exceeded plan assets for all pension plans at the end of both years.

Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost

During 2006, the Company recorded decreases in the minimum liability, net of tax, for the U.S.
plan and international plans of $3.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively reducing the accumulated other comprehensive loss. During 2005, the Company recorded increases in the minimum liability, net of tax, for the U.S. plan and international
plans of $3.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively increasing accumulated other comprehensive loss.

The weighted average assumptions in
the following table represent the rates used to develop the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for the year listed and also the net periodic benefit cost for the following year.

The discount rate is based on settling the pension obligation with high grade, high yield
corporate bonds, and the rate of compensation increase is based on actual experience. The expected return on plan assets is based on historical performance as well as expected future rates of return on plan assets considering the current investment
portfolio mix and the long-term investment strategy.

As of December 31, 2006 the following table represents the amounts included in
other comprehensive loss that are expected to be recognized as components of periodic benefit costs in 2007.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Pension Plan Assets

The composition of all plan assets consists primarily of equities, corporate bonds, governmental notes and temporary investments. This Plan’s target and actual asset allocations at the respective measurement
dates for 2006 and 2005 by asset category are as follows:

Investment policies are determined by the respective Plan’s Pension Committee and set forth
in its Investment Policy. Pursuant to the Investment Policy for the U.S., the investment strategy is to use passive index funds managed by the Bank of New York. The Company is evaluating allocation policies for its international plans. Rebalancing
of the asset allocation occurs on a quarterly basis.

Cash Flows

The Company’s funding methods are based on governmental requirements and differ from those methods used to recognize pension expense, which is primarily based on the projected unit credit method applied in the
accompanying financial statements. The Company expects to contribute $5.9 million to the U.S. plan and $7.8 million to the international plans during 2007.

Benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants are as follows:

Post Retirement Benefit Plans

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company has provided certain unfunded postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for a portion of North American employees. In January 1995 the postretirement
health care and life insurance benefits for U.S. salaried employees was modified to discontinue benefits for employees who had not attained the age of 50 by March 31, 1995. The Company is not obligated to pay health care and life insurance
benefits to individuals who had retired prior to 1990.

The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all post retirement plans.

INCOME TAXES

The Company is responsible for filing
consolidated U.S., foreign and combined, unitary or separate state income tax returns. The Company is responsible for paying the taxes relating to such returns, including any subsequent adjustments resulting from the redetermination of such tax
liabilities by the applicable taxing authorities. The components of the income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for the Company’s domestic and foreign operations for the years ended December 31 are provided

Consolidated income tax provision is included in the Statement of Income as follows:

A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income
tax rate on continuing operations for the years ended December 31 is provided below:

The effective income tax rate for 2006 includes a tax benefit for the release of a valuation
allowance related to certain deferred state tax assets in the amount of $5.3 million based on management’s determination that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize these assets.



WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The overall effective income tax rate in 2004 includes a tax benefit of $4.9 million, which is
primarily related to the reversal of certain items that had previously been provided for and that have been closed from further regulatory examination.

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes. These deferred income taxes will be recognized as future tax benefits
or costs when the temporary differences reverse.

Components of deferred tax assets and (liabilities) were as follows:

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. State and foreign net operating loss carryforwards exist in the amount of $131 million and $9 million, respectively, and are set to expire in various periods from 2007 to 2026. A valuation allowance still
exists and/or has been established for certain of these net operating loss carryforwards.

Federal tax credits of approximately $5 million
related to Research and Experimentation credits and Alternative Minimum Tax credits have been fully utilized in 2006. State tax credits of approximately $501,000 are available and consist of various Machinery & Equipment, Research and
Experimentation, and Jobs related credits.

Options to purchase approximately 4,400, 13,000 and 589,000 shares of Common Stock were
outstanding in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price exceeded the average market price of the common shares.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

As of
December 31, 2006, the Company maintains employee stock-based compensation plans for stock options, non-vested restricted stock, and incentive stock awards as governed by the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the 2000 Plan). The 2000 Plan
was amended effective February 16, 2006 to increase the maximum shares then available for future grants under the existing plan of 719,512 by 2,000,000 shares. As of December 31, 2006 shares available for future grants under the 2000 Plan
is 2,424,012 shares. No awards may be made under the 2000 Plan subsequent to January 31, 2016. The Company also maintains an Employee Stock Purchase Plan and a Non-Employee Directors’ Fee and Stock Option Plan (Directors Plan).

Stock-based compensation expense was $9.2 million, $3.3 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The Company recognized associated tax benefits related to the stock-based compensation plans of $3.4 million, $1.2 million and $0.5 million for the respective periods. Included in the stock-based compensation expense for 2006 above is
$1.3 million of expense related to stock options, as a result of the adoption of FAS 123 (R) on January 1, 2006, $2.5 million related to non-vested restricted stock, $4.9 million related to incentive stock awards, and approximately
$500,000 related to awards issued for directors’ fees. The accounting for the non-vested stock and the stock awards under the incentive plan was not impacted significantly by the adoption of FAS 123 (R). At December 31, 2006, unamortized
compensation expense related to those stock options, non-vested restricted shares and incentive stock awards expected to vest totaled $10.9 million and will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Stock Options

Under the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan), stock options are granted
to eligible employees at a price not less than market prices on the dates of grant. Generally, the options become exercisable over a three-year vesting period and expire ten years from the date of grant.

The Directors Plan, as amended, authorizes a total of 500,000 shares of Common Stock to be issued. Generally, options issued under the plan become
exercisable over a three-year vesting period and expire ten years from the date of grant. In addition, as compensation for directors fees, total of 10,500 shares have been awarded to non-employee directors in each of the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. No awards may be made under the plan subsequent to October 31, 2016. The total number of shares issued under the plan as of December 31, 2006 was 222,000 shares.

As part of a long-term incentive program, in 1998, the Company granted options to purchase up to 500,020 shares at $20 per share, to certain executives
under a plan that preceded the 2000 Plan. No further grants may be made under this plan.

A summary of the Company’s stock option
activity and related information for the year ended December 31, 2006 follows:

The total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004 was $14.5 million, $16.2 million and $8.2 million, respectively.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The dividend yield is based on the Company’s dividend rate and the current market price of
the underlying common stock at the date of grant. Expected life in years is determined from historical stock option exercise data. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The risk-free interest rate is
based on the U.S. Treasury bond rates for the expected life of the option.

Non-Vested Restricted Stock and Incentive Stock Awards

In 2006, under the 2000 Plan, the
Company issued 200,500 of the non-vested restricted stock to executives in February 2006. The non-vested stock generally vests over four years from the date of grant. In addition, the Company has issued incentive stock awards in 2004, 2005 and 2006
to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain three year performance goals for each three year period ending December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2006, stock awards issued under the incentive plan
are awarded but not vested.

The incentive stock awards included in the table below represent the maximum number of shares that may
ultimately vest. As of December 31, 2006, based on the Company’s performance, we estimate that the majority of these stock awards will vest and have recorded compensation expense accordingly. If our estimate of the number of these stock
awards expected to vest changes in a future accounting period, compensation expense could be reduced and will be recognized over the remaining vesting period.

The following table summarizes the non-vested restricted stock and incentive stock awards activity and related information for the year ended December 31, 2006:

Compensation expense for the non-vested restricted stock and incentive stock awards is based on
the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and recognized over the applicable vesting period.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

In 1998, the Company adopted an employee discounted stock purchase plan (DSPP). The DSPP had 500,000 shares available for issuance. Participants could purchase the Company’s common stock at 85% of the lesser of fair
market value on the first or last day of each offering period. Stock outstanding under this plan at December 31, 2006 was 151,794 shares. The plan was terminated effective January 1, 2007.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is
subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous
substances. The Company believes its operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will
not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.

Under terms of the purchase
agreement and related documents for the 1990 Acquisition, American Standard, Inc. (“ASI”) has indemnified the Company for certain items including, among other things, certain environmental claims the Company asserted prior to 2000. If ASI
was unable to honor or meet these indemnifications, the Company would be responsible for such items. In the opinion of management, ASI currently has the ability to meet its indemnification obligations.

Claims have been filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the United States by persons alleging bodily
injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. Since 2000, the number of such claims has increased and the resolution of these claims may take a significant period of time. Most of these claims have been made against our wholly
owned subsidiary, Railroad Friction Products Corporation (RFPC), and are based on a product sold by RFPC prior to the time that the Company acquired any interest in RFPC. On April 17, 2005, a claim against the Company by a former stockholder of
RFPC contending that the Company assumed that entity’s liability for asbestos claims arising from exposure to RFPC’s product was resolved in the Company’s favor.

Most of these claims, including all of the RFPC claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that
retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. We cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors will remain financially viable. Our ultimate legal and financial
liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.

It is Management’s belief
that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present for a variety of factors, including: (1) the limited asbestos case settlement history of the Company’s wholly owned
subsidiary, RFPC; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular. Despite this uncertainty, and although the results of the Company’s operations and
cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, Management believes that the final resolution of the Company’s asbestos-related cases will not be material to the Company’s overall financial
position, results of operations and cash flows. In general, this belief is based upon: (1) Wabtec’s and RFPC’s limited history of settlements and dismissals of asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs
to establish any exposure or causal relationship to RFPC’s product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss.

More specifically, as to RFPC, Management’s belief that any losses due to asbestos-related cases would not be material is also based on the fact
that RFPC owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. To date, RFPC’s insurers have provided RFPC with defense and indemnity in these actions. As to Wabtec and its divisions, Management’s belief that
asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former owners of Wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the
products at issue. To date, Wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of



WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

which confirmed Wabtec’s position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain Wabtec assets. Although Wabtec has
incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have not been material, and the Company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future.

The Company is subject to a RCRA Part B Closure Permit (“the Permit”) issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, Division of Environmental Quality relating to the monitoring and treatment of groundwater contamination on, and adjacent to, the MotivePower Inc. (Boise, Idaho) facility. In compliance with the Permit, the
Company has completed an accelerated plan for the treatment of contaminated groundwater, and continues onsite and offsite monitoring for hazardous constituents. An additional $970,000 was accrued in 2004 based on our refined estimates of ongoing
monitoring costs. The Company reevaluated the reserve and reversed $280,000 to earnings in 2005. In total, the Company has accrued approximately $727,000 at December 31, 2006, the estimated remaining costs for remediation and monitoring. The
Company was in compliance with the Permit at December 31, 2006.

Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation (FWEC), the seller of the
Mountaintop, Pennsylvania property to the predecessor of one of the Company’s subsidiaries in 1989, agreed to indemnify the Company’s predecessor and its successors and assigns against certain identified environmental liabilities for which
FWEC executed a Consent Order Agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and EPA. Management believes that this indemnification arrangement is enforceable for the benefit of the Company and that FWEC has the
financial resources to honor its obligations under this indemnification arrangement.

Prior to the Company’s acquisition of Young
Radiator, Young agreed to clean up alleged contamination on a prior production site in Mattoon, Illinois. The Company has completed the remediation of the site under the state’s voluntary cleanup program and is now in the process of obtaining
closure certification for the site from the State of Illinois. The Company has accrued $3,500 at December 31, 2006 as its estimate of the obtaining the closure certification.

Young ceased manufacturing operations at its Racine, Wisconsin facility in the early 1990s. Investigations prior to the acquisition of Young revealed
some levels of contamination on the Racine property. The Company has completed a comprehensive site evaluation and implemented a groundwater remediation program under Wisconsin’s voluntary remediation program. Site monitoring is being conducted
to demonstrate attainment of Wisconsin’s cleanup requirements. The Company believes the regulating authority is generally in agreement with the selected remediation approach and findings presented to-date. The Company has accrued approximately
$142,000 at December 31, 2006 as its estimate of the remaining remediation costs.

The Company has other contingent obligations
relating to certain sales leaseback transactions, for locomotives that were assumed in connection with the MotivePower merger in 1999, for which reserves of $1.5 million remain as of December 31, 2006.

In April 2005, Amtrak decided to suspend its Acela Express train service due to cracks in the spokes of some of the cars’ brake discs. Amtrak’s
Acela service was resumed on a limited basis in July, 2005, and complete service was resumed in September, 2005. Wabtec did not design or supply the braking system for the Acela cars. The braking system was supplied by Knorr Brake Corporation and
the brake discs were designed by Faiveley Transport. Wabtec did provide and machined approximately one-third of the brake discs for the cars and assisted Amtrak and others, including Bombardier Corporation, Alstom Transportation Inc., Knorr and
Faiveley, in their evaluation and investigation of the brake disc cracks.



WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

On July 11, 2005, Wabtec received a written notice of a potential claim for damages from Knorr
and on March 2, 2006 received a notice from Knorr in which Knorr stated that Amtrak is of the view that it may have warranty claims against Wabtec, Knorr, and Faiveley. Neither Knorr notice specified any amount or range of claims against the
Company, although Knorr has indicated that it expects the Company to participate in any financial settlement arising from the alleged defects and failures of the Acela brake discs. Wabtec, in turn, has forwarded Knorr’s notices to Faiveley and
has notified Faiveley of potential claims by Wabtec against Faiveley.

In a presentation provided to Wabtec and Faiveley on August 22,
2006, Bombardier claimed that it has reached a settlement with Amtrak and Knorr related to the suspension of Amtrak’s Acela service. Bombardier has alleged that it has incurred damages of approximately $38 million, and has been assigned the
rights to pursue additional claims by Amtrak and Knorr of approximately $17 million and $10 million, respectively. Wabtec has contacted Faiveley, asserting that Faiveley is fully responsible for any claims made by Bombardier, including the assigned
claims of Amtrak and Knorr. Wabtec does not believe that it has any material legal liability with regard to this matter.

In March 2006,
management began an internal investigation related to business transactions conducted by a subsidiary, Pioneer Friction Limited (“Pioneer”), in West Bengal, India. Through an internal compliance review, management discovered that
disbursements were made which may be in violation of applicable laws and regulations. Pioneer is a fourth-tier subsidiary of Wabtec; two of the intermediate subsidiaries are Australian companies which are, in turn, owned by a U.S holding company.

While the transactions are inconsequential and not material to the overall operations of Wabtec, they may result in potential penalties.
Management has concluded its investigation, and has informed Wabtec’s Audit Committee, Board of Directors, and the appropriate authorities.

From time to time the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the ordinary course of business. As of the date hereof, the Company is involved in no litigation that the Company believes will have

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Wabtec has two reportable
segments—the Freight Group and the Transit Group. The key factors used to identify these reportable segments are the organization and alignment of the Company’s internal operations, the nature of the products and services, and customer
type. The business segments are:

Freight Group

manufactures products and provides services geared to the production and operation
of freight cars and locomotives, including braking control equipment, on-board electronic components and train coupler equipment. Revenues are derived from OEM sales, aftermarket sales and freight car repairs and services.

Transit Group

consists of products for passenger transit vehicles and locomotives (typically subways, commuter rail and buses) that include
braking, coupling, monitoring systems, climate control and door equipment engineered to meet individual customer specifications, as well as commuter rail locomotives. Revenues are derived from OEM and aftermarket sales as well as from repairs and
services.

The Company evaluates its business segments’ operating results based on income from operations. Corporate activities
include general corporate expenses, elimination of intersegment transactions, interest income and expense and other unallocated charges. Since certain administrative and other operating expenses and other
