BUSINESS

General

Westinghouse
Air Brake Technologies Corporation, doing business as Wabtec Corporation, is a Delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 Air Brake Avenue in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania. Our telephone number is 412-825-1000, and our website is located at

www.wabtec.com

. All references to “we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company” and “Wabtec” refer to Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. Originally founded by George
Westinghouse in 1869, Westinghouse Air Brake Company (“WABCO”) was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from American Standard, Inc. (ASI). The current business includes the combined assets from the November 1999
merger of WABCO and MotivePower Industries, Inc. (“MotivePower”).

Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based equipment and services for the global rail industry. We believe we hold about a 50% market share in North America for our primary
braking-related equipment and a number 1 or number 2 position in North America for most of our other product lines. Our highly engineered products, which are intended to enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for
customers, can be found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles. In 2004, the Company had sales of $822 million and net income of $32.4 million. Sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 54% of
total sales in 2004.

Management and insiders of the Company
own approximately 8% of Wabtec’s outstanding shares, with the balance held by investment companies and individuals. Executive management incentive compensation focuses on earnings, cash flow, working capital and economic profit targets to align
management interests with those of outside shareholders.

Industry Overview

The Company primarily serves the worldwide freight and
passenger transit rail industries. The worldwide market for rail equipment has been estimated at about $70 billion annually, and it is estimated to grow at about 4% annually for the next five years. Our operating results are largely dependent on the
level of activity, financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad industry. Many factors influence the industry, including general economic conditions; rail traffic, as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership;
government investment in public transportation; and investment in new technologies by freight and passenger rail systems. Customers outside North America account for about 22% of Wabtec’s sales.

In North America, railroads carry about 42% of intercity freight, as measured
by ton-miles, which is more than any other mode of transportation. They are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system, serving nearly every industrial, wholesale and retail sector. Through direct ownership and
operating partnerships, U.S. railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in Canada and Mexico, forming what is regarded as the world’s most-efficient and lowest-cost freight rail service. There are more than 500
railroads operating in North America, with the largest railroads, referred to as “Class I,” accounting for more than 90% of the industry’s revenues. Although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities, coal accounts for the
most tons and revenues (about 44% and about 20%, respectively, in 2004). Intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastest-growing
market segment in the past 10 years. Railroads operate in a competitive environment, especially with the trucking industry, and are always seeking ways to improve safety, cost and reliability. New technologies offered by Wabtec and others in the
industry can provide some of these benefits.

Outside of North
America, many of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger transit, rather than freight. In recent years, however, railroads in countries such as Australia, India and China have been


investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems. Throughout the world, government-owned railroads are being sold to
private owners, who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies. These investment programs represent additional opportunities for Wabtec to provide products and services.

In the U.S., passenger transit is a $32 billion industry, dependent largely
on funding from federal, state and local governments, and from fare box revenues. With about 40% of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles, New York City is the largest passenger transit market in the U.S. Passenger transit ridership is near
an all-time high, after increasing throughout the 1990s due to steady growth in the U.S. economy. Based on preliminary figures for 2004, ridership is expected to be about the same as in 2003. In response to lower fare box revenues and government
funding cutbacks, transit authorities have delayed capital expenditures for new equipment and deferred maintenance on existing equipment. New York City, however, has continued to invest in new equipment, as demonstrated by its order for up to 1,700
new subway vehicles, including options, which are expected to be delivered beginning in 2006.

Demand for our freight related products and services in North America is driven by a number of factors, including:

•

Rail traffic.

The Association of American Railroads (AAR) compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry. Two important statistics are
revenue ton-miles and carloadings, which are generally referred to as “rail traffic”. According to preliminary AAR estimates for U.S. railroads, 2004 was a record year, with revenue ton-miles increasing about 4.9%, carloadings increasing
about 2.9% and intermodal units increasing about 10.4%. As rail traffic increases, we believe that our customers will increase their level of spending on equipment and equipment maintenance.

•

Demand for new locomotives.

Currently, the active locomotive fleet in the North American market is about 20,000 units. The average number of new locomotives delivered over
the past 10 years was about 1,000 annually. In 2004, about 1,200 new, heavy-haul locomotives were delivered, up from about 750 in 2003. In 2005, we expect the industry to deliver about 1,100 new locomotives.

•

Demand for new freight cars

. Currently, the active freight car fleet in North America is about 1.3 million units. The average number of new freight cars delivered over the
past 10 years was about 50,000 annually. In 2004, about 46,300 new freight cars were delivered and about 70,000 new freight cars were ordered. We expect that about 55,000 new units will be delivered in 2005.

Demand for North American passenger transit products is driven by a number of
factors, including:

•

Replacement, building and/or expansion programs of transit authorities.

These programs are funded in part by national and local government programs. In 2005, the U.S. federal
government is expected to renew legislation that provides federal funding for transportation projects. The previous legislation expired in 2004, but the government continued to provide funding at 2004 levels in the interim. The amount of funding in
the legislation will have an impact on the capital spending plans of transit authorities. In recent years, U.S. federal funding for passenger transit projects has generally served as a countercyclical balance during the downturn in our freight rail
markets. The average annual number of new transit car deliveries over the past 10 years was about 600 units. In 2004, we estimate that about 800 transit vehicles were delivered, about the same as in 2003. In 2005, we estimate that about 725 units
will be delivered, with about 950 units estimated for 2006. The expected increase in 2006 is due to the delivery of cars to New York City, which has placed an order for 1,700 cars, including options. As a result of this order, Wabtec management
expects the annual transit vehicle delivery rate to be in the range of 900 to 1,200 units through 2009.

•

Ridership levels

. Ridership on U.S. transit vehicles increased steadily from 1995 through 2001. In 2002, ridership decreased for the first time since 1995 due to higher
unemployment levels in the U.S. The lower ridership level, as well as government funding cutbacks, negatively impacted aftermarket spending in 2002 and 2003. In 2004, ridership was about the same as in 2003, and the company’s revenues from
aftermarket products and services increased significantly.


Business Segments and Products

We provide our products and services through two principal business segments, the Freight Group and the Passenger Transit
Group (hereafter referred to as “Transit Group”). The Freight Group manufactures and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives, while the Transit Group does the same for passenger transit vehicles, typically
subways and buses. Both business segments serve original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and provide aftermarket sales and services with the aftermarket accounting for about 54% of net sales. In 2004, the Freight Group accounted for 71% of our total
net sales, and the Transit Group accounted for the remaining 29%. In 2004, the Freight Group generated 58% of its net sales from the aftermarket and 42% of its net sales from the OEMs and Class I railroads. The Transit Group generated 42% of its net
sales from the aftermarket and 58% of its net sales from OEMs. A summary of our leading product lines across both of our business segments is outlined below.

•

We have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing
on the strength of our existing products, technological capabilities and new product innovation. Our new product development effort has focused on electronic technology for brakes and controls. Over the past several years, we introduced a number of
significant new products including electronic brakes and Positive Train Control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols. The Transit Group also focuses on new product development and has
introduced a number of new products during the past several years. Supported by our technical staff of over 500 engineers and specialists, we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines, which enables us to provide comprehensive,
systems-based solutions for our customers. We currently own over 1,000 active patents worldwide and 500 U.S. patents. During the last three years, we have filed for more than 150 U.S. patents in support of our new and evolving product lines.

For additional information on our business segments, see Note
19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.


Competitive Strengths

Our key strengths include:

•

Leading market positions in core products

. Dating back to 1869 and George Westinghouse’s invention of the air brake, we are an established leader in the development and
manufacture of pneumatic braking equipment for freight and passenger transit vehicles. We have leveraged our leading position by focusing on research and engineering to expand beyond pneumatic braking components to supplying integrated parts and
assemblies for the whole locomotive through the end-of-train. We are a recognized leader in the development and production of electronic recording, measuring and communications systems, highly engineered compressors and heat exchange systems for
locomotives and a leading manufacturer of freight car components, including electronic braking equipment, draft gears, brake shoes and electronic end-of-train devices. Additionally, we are a leading provider of complete door assemblies and couplers
for passenger and transit vehicles.

•

Breadth of product offering with a stable mix of OEM and aftermarket business

. We believe that our substantial installed base of products to the OEMs is a significant
competitive advantage for providing products and services to the aftermarket because end-users often look to purchase safety and performance-related replacement parts from the original supplier. In addition, we believe our product portfolio is one
of the broadest in the rail industry, as we offer a wide selection of quality parts, components and assemblies across the entire train. Over the last several years, approximately 55% of our total net sales have come from our aftermarket products and
services business.

•

Leading design and engineering capabilities

. We believe a hallmark of our relationship with our customers has been our leading design and engineering practice, which has, in
our opinion, assisted in the improvement and modernization of global railway equipment. We believe both our customers and the federal transit authorities value our technological capabilities and commitment to innovation, as we seek not only to
enhance the efficiency and profitability of our customers, but also to improve the overall safety of the railways through continuous product improvement.

•

Significant barriers to entry

. We believe that there are a number of company- and industry-specific factors that represent meaningful barriers to entry:

•

Proprietary product offering

. We have an established record of product improvements and new product development. We have assembled a wide range of patented products, which we
believe provides us with a competitive advantage. We currently own over 1,000 active patents worldwide and 500 U.S. patents. During the last three years, we have filed for more than 150 U.S. patents in support of our new and evolving product lines.

•

Substantial installed base.

We believe our installed base presents a meaningful barrier to entry in both the new product market and the aftermarket. As OEMs and Class I
railroad operators attempt to modernize fleets with new products designed to improve and maintain safety and efficiency, new products must be designed to be interoperable with existing equipment. We believe our dedicated research and development
staff and comprehensive product offering enables us to leverage our installed base to maintain our leadership position with OEMs and the Class I railroads. Similarly, we believe our substantial installed base makes us a preferred supplier in the
aftermarket, as end-users typically prefer to source performance and safety-related replacement parts and service from the original product supplier.

•

Regulatory nature of the rail industry.

Oversight of the U.S. rail industry is governed by a number of federal regulatory agencies, including the National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the AAR. These groups mandate rigorous manufacturer certification and new product testing and approval processes that we believe are difficult for new entrants to meet
cost-effectively and efficiently without the scale and extensive experience we possess.


•

Experienced management team

. Our management team has over 100 years of combined experience with the Company. The team implemented numerous initiatives that enabled us to
manage the sharp cyclical downturn in the rail supply market in 2001 and 2002, including the Wabtec Quality and Performance System (QPS), an ongoing program that focuses on “lean manufacturing” principles and continuous improvement across
all aspects of our business. Since 2000, the company has reduced our debt, net of cash, by approximately $500 million, lowering our percentage of net debt to book capitalization from 73% at December 31, 2000 to 15% at December 31, 2004. As a result
of these initiatives, our management team has improved our cost structure, operating leverage and financial flexibility and placed us in an excellent position to benefit from growth opportunities in an improving market environment.

Business strategy

We are focused on executing the following four-point growth strategy:

•

Expand aftermarket sales

. Historically, aftermarket sales are less cyclical than OEM sales because a certain level of aftermarket maintenance and service work must be
performed, even during an industry slowdown. Wabtec provides aftermarket parts and services for its components, but the company is seeking to expand this business with new customers such as short-line and regional railroads, or with customers who
currently perform the work in-house. In this way, we expect to take advantage of the rail industry trend toward outsourcing, as railroads and transit authorities focus on their core function of transporting goods and people, rather than maintaining
and servicing their equipment.

•

Accelerate new product development

. During the recent industry downturn, we maintained research and development spending at historical levels and continued to fund major
development projects, and we will continue to emphasize research and development to create new and improved products. We are focusing on technological advances, especially in the areas of electronics, braking products and other on-board equipment,
as a means of new product growth. We seek to provide customers with incremental technological advances that offer immediate benefits with cost effective investments.

•

Expand globally

. Our net sales outside of North America totaled 22% in 2004, up from 21% in 2003, and we believe that international markets represent a significant
opportunity for future growth. We intend to increase our existing international sales through strategic acquisitions, direct sales of products through our existing subsidiaries and licensees and joint ventures with railway suppliers having a strong
presence in their local markets. We are specifically targeting markets that operate significant fleets of U.S.-style locomotives and freight cars, including Australia, China, India, Russia, South Africa, South America and select areas within Europe.

•

Continuous improvement through lean principles

. We intend to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a low-cost producer in the industry while maintaining
world-class product quality, technology and customer responsiveness. Through QPS and employee-directed initiatives such as Kaizen, a Japanese-developed team concept, we continuously strive to improve quality, delivery and productivity, and to reduce
costs. These efforts enable us to streamline processes, improve product quality and customer satisfaction, reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments. Over time, we expect these lean initiatives to enable us to
increase profit margins, which would improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in new product and service programs.

Backlog

In 2004, 54% of our sales came from aftermarket orders. Aftermarket orders typically carry lead times of less than 30 days, so they are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time. As such, the
Company’s backlog is primarily an indicator of future original equipment sales, not expected aftermarket activity.

The Company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions, including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of
designated stages. Substantial scope-of-work adjustments are common. For


these and other reasons, completion of the Company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled, so backlog should not be relied upon as an indicator of the
Company’s future performance. The railroad industry, in general, has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation.

The backlog of customer orders as of December 31, 2004, and December 31,
2003, and the expected year of completion are as follows.

Engineering and Development

To execute our strategy to develop new products, we
invest in a variety of engineering and development activities. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, we invested about $33.8 million, $32.9 million and $33.6 million, respectively, on product development and improvement
activities. Approximately 40% of these costs comprise activities solely devoted to new product development in any given year. These engineering and development expenditures, in total, represent about 4.1%, 4.6% and 4.8% of net sales for the same
periods, respectively. Sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities, customers and other railroad product suppliers.

Our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies, with an emphasis on applying electronics to
traditional pneumatic equipment. Electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for a long time, but freight railroads have been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability, connectivity and durability. We are
proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hard-wired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads.

We use our Product Development System (PDS) to develop and monitor new product programs. The system requires the product
development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process, from concept to launch, to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets.

Intellectual Property

We have more than 1,000 active patents worldwide. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual
property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property.

Certain trademarks, among them the name WABCO

®

, were acquired or licensed from American Standard Inc. in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the North American operations of the Railway Products
Group of American Standard.

We are a party, as licensor and
licensee, to a variety of license agreements. We do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole.

We entered into a license agreement with Faiveley Transport (formerly SAB WABCO Holdings B.V.) on December 31, 1993,
pursuant to which Faiveley Transport granted us a license to the intellectual property and know-how related to the manufacturing and marketing of certain disc brakes, tread brakes and low noise and


resilient wheel products. SAB WABCO Holdings B.V. was a former affiliate of Wabtec, since both were owned by the same parent company in the early 1990s. The
Faiveley Transport license expired December 31, 2004, but has been renewed for an additional one-year term as provided in the license agreement. The license may be renewed for additional one-year terms.

We have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and
related products in Japan, NABCO Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Company. The licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key Japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in North America. We
believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in North America.

Customers

Our customers include railroads throughout North America, as well as in Australia, Europe, South Africa and India; manufacturers of transportation
equipment, such as locomotives, freight cars, subway vehicles and buses; lessors of such equipment; and passenger transit authorities, primarily those in North America.

In 2004, about 78% of our sales were to customers in North America, but we also shipped products to more than 82 countries
throughout the world. About 54% of our sales were in the aftermarket, with the rest of our sales to OEMs of locomotives, freight cars, subway vehicles and buses.

Our top five customers, General Electric Transportation Systems, Bombardier, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, Electro-Motive
Division of General Motors and Amtrak accounted for 26% of our net sales in 2004. No one customer represents 10% or more of consolidated sales. We believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers.

Competition

We believe that we hold about a 50% market share in North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a No. 1 or
No. 2 market position in North America for most of our other product lines. Nonetheless, we operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very
cost-conscious.

In addition to price, competition is based on
product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery, and customer service and support. Our principal competitors vary to some extent across product lines, but most competitors are smaller, privately held companies.
Within North America, New York Air Brake Company, a subsidiary of the German air brake producer Knorr-Bremse AG, is our principal overall OEM competitor. Our competition for locomotive, freight and passenger transit service and repair is primarily
from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ in-house operations, the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors, General Electric Transportation Systems, and New York Air Brake/Knorr. We believe our key strengths, which include
leading market positions in core products, breadth of product offering with a stable mix of OEM and aftermarket business, leading design and engineering capabilities, significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to
compete effectively in this marketplace.

Employees

At December 31, 2004, we had 4,905 full-time employees, approximately 39% of
whom were unionized. A majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within North America and these agreements generally extend through late 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009.

We consider our relations with our employees and union representatives to be
good, but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us.


Regulation

In the course of our operations, we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities. In the United States, these include principally the
FRA and the AAR.

The FRA administers and enforces federal laws
and regulations relating to railroad safety. These regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce.

The AAR oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, relationships among
railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters. The AAR also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the United States. New products generally must undergo AAR
testing and approval processes.

As a result of these
regulations and regulations in other countries in which we derive our revenues, we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell.

Effects of Seasonality

Our business is not typically seasonal, although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of our major
customers during this period.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based products and services for the global rail industry. Our products are
found on virtually all locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles in the U.S., as well as in certain markets throughout the world. Our products enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, and many
of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles.

Wabtec is a global company with operations in nine countries. In 2004, about 78 percent of the Company’s revenues came from its North American
operations, but Wabtec also sold products or services in 82 countries around the world.

Management Review of 2004 and Future Outlook

Wabtec’s long-term financial goals are to generate free cash flow in excess of net income, maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital, increase margins through strict attention to cost controls, and
increase revenues through a focused growth strategy. In addition, management monitors the Company’s short-term operational performance through measures such as quality and on-time delivery.

In 2004, we achieved the following:

•

Generated cash of $65 million, more than twice net income of $32.4 million;

•

Reduced debt, net of cash, by $65 million;

•

Revenues increased 14.5%, as the company generated increases in both aftermarket and OEM sales, as well as international sales;

•

Product quality, as measured by first-time pass rate, improved by 3%;

•

Productivity increased 6%.

We achieved these results despite higher raw material costs, especially steel and copper, and despite the negative impact of foreign currency exchange
rates, especially on the Company’s Canadian operations.

Freight rail industry statistics, such as carloadings and orders for new freight cars, improved in 2004. For example, carloadings grew 2.9% compared to 2003, as the freight railroads benefited from the strengthening economy in the U.S. As
shown below, orders for new freight cars increased to 70,291 in 2004. As a result, the backlog of freight cars ordered was 58,677, its highest year-end level since 1998. Sales in our freight segment have demonstrated that trend. The following are
quarterly freight car statistics for the past three years:

The following is a summary of freight car, locomotive and
transit car deliveries for the industry:

Based on company estimates

Management is forecasting a slight increase in deliveries
of freight and transit cars.

Carloadings and Intermodal Units

In 2005, we expect
demand to improve due to continued strength in the freight rail and passenger transit aftermarket, as well as growth in the market for new freight cars. Looking beyond 2005, we expect to generate increases in sales and earnings from executing our
four-point growth strategy (see page 5 for more details):

•

Expand aftermarket sales;

•

Accelerate new product development;

•

Expand globally;

•

Continuous improvement through lean principles.

In 2005 and beyond, we will continue to face many challenges, including increased costs for raw materials, especially steel; higher costs for medical and
insurance premiums; and foreign currency fluctuations. In addition,


we face general economic risks, as well as the risk that our customers could curtail spending on new and existing equipment. Risks associated with our
four-point growth strategy include the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the Company, and risks inherent in global expansion. When necessary, we will modify our financial and
operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table
shows our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years indicated.

2004 COMPARED TO

The following table summarizes the results of
operations for the period:

Net sales increased by
14.5% from $717.9 million in 2003 to $822 million in 2004, primarily as a result of volume increases in freight car, locomotive and transit car deliveries. Aftermarket part sales increased because of


carloadings and intermodal units originated. The Company did not realize any significant net sales improvement because of price increases or foreign
exchange. Net income for 2004 was $32.4 million, or $0.71 per diluted share. Net income for 2003 was $22.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share. This increase in net income was primarily due to increased sales and a favorable tax benefit.

The following table shows the Company’s net sales by business
segment:

Net sales.

Net
sales for 2004 increased $104.1 million, or 14.5%, as compared to 2003. Sales increased in both the Freight Group and the Transit Group. The Freight Group’s increased sales reflected higher sales of certain components to international markets,
higher demand for pneumatic air brake components related to increased delivery of freight cars and locomotives and greater demand for friction products due to overall increased rail traffic in 2004. Industry deliveries of new freight cars for 2004
increased to 46,292 units as compared to 31,400 in 2003. The Transit Group’s increased sales were due to increased deliveries under existing contracts and higher aftermarket sales.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased to $205.2 million in 2004 compared to $189.5 million in 2003. Gross profit is
dependent on a number of factors including pricing, sales volume and product mix. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 25% compared to 26.4% in 2003. The decrease in gross profit percentage is primarily due to increased manufacturing costs
because of higher raw material prices, higher medical costs for retiree health plans and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates on the Company’s Canadian operations. Other issues reducing gross profit percentage include inefficiencies
relating to the closing and relocation of an electronics plant from Canada to the U.S., the establishment of a $970,000 reserve to reflect future environmental monitoring at our Boise facility, fixed asset impairment charges of $1.3 million, and the
start up of low-margin rail door contracts in the Transit Group. Also, the provision for warranty expense negatively impacted gross profit having increased $4.4 million in 2004 compared to 2003. The provision for warranty expense is higher due to a
combination of higher sales requiring additional reserves and charges for certain specific products. Although the warranty provision increased in 2004, warranty claims decreased resulting in an overall increase of $4.1 million in our warranty
reserves. The Company is taking action to improve margins in future quarters, including price increases and ongoing initiatives to increase productivity and efficiency.

The following table shows our operating expenses:

Operating
expenses.

Operating expenses increased $10.1 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 including a $3.2 million unfavorable litigation ruling to GETS-GS, which the Company disagrees with and intends to continue to contest. Other costs comprising the
increase include restructuring costs at the Company’s electronics unit, higher medical and insurance claims experience, foreign exchange costs and overall higher costs from inflation and sales activity. These increases were partially offset by
reduced amortization expense. Amortization expense decreased due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized.


Income from operations

. Income from operations totaled $55.4 million (or 6.7% of sales) in 2004
compared with $49.8 million (or 6.9% of sales) in 2003. Higher operating income resulted from increased sales in 2004 offset by higher operating expenses.

Interest expense.

Interest expense increased 3.7% in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the Company’s sale of senior notes in August
2003. These notes, while resulting in higher interest expense for the current year, enabled the Company to convert short-term, variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt at an attractive long-term interest rate.

Other expense.

The Company incurred foreign exchange losses of $1.2
million and $2.8 million, respectively, in 2004 and 2003, due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non U.S. dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings.

Income taxes.

2004 includes a tax benefit of $4.9 million primarily
related to the reversal of certain items that had previously been provided for that were closed from further regulatory examination. The effective income tax rate, not including the aforementioned tax benefit, remains unchanged and was 36.5% for
2004 and 2003. In 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was passed. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact to the Company and its subsidiaries.

Net income

. Net income for 2004 increased $9.7 million, compared with 2003. The increase was due to higher sales and
the tax benefit mentioned above, partially offset by other items including the unfavorable GETS-GS litigation ruling, increased environmental reserve and higher manufacturing costs.

2003 COMPARED TO 2002

The following table summarizes the results of operations for the period:

In 2002, we completed
fair value assessments of goodwill and wrote down the carrying value of goodwill by $90 million ($83.2 million for the Freight Group and $6.8 million for the Transit Group) in accordance with the adoption of SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” The total impact of the writedown, net of taxes, was $61.7 million.

The following table shows the Company’s net sales by business segment:

Net sales.

Net
sales for 2003 increased $21.7 million, or 3.1%, as compared to 2002. The increased sales in the Freight Group more than offset lower sales in the Transit Group. The Freight Group’s increased sales reflected higher sales of components for new
freight cars and locomotives, and commuter locomotives, as well as


higher international sales. Industry deliveries of new freight cars for 2003 increased to about 31,400 units as compared to about 17,700 in 2002. The Transit
Group’s decreased sales were due to the completion of a contract to supply components for New York City subway cars in 2002 and lower aftermarket sales.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased to $189.5 million in 2003 compared to $179.5 million in 2002. Gross profit is dependent on a number of factors
including pricing, sales volume and product mix. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 26.4% compared to 25.8% in 2002. The increase in gross profit percentage is primarily due to higher sales and favorable product mix, which more than offset
the negative impact of the weakening U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar.

The following table shows our operating expenses:

Operating
expenses.

Operating expenses increased $6.9 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to the write-off of non-operating assets of $1.6 million, and higher medical and insurance premiums, partially offset by reduced amortization expense.
Amortization expense decreased due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized.

Income from operations

. Income from operations totaled $49.8 million (or 6.9% of sales) in 2003 compared with $46.7 million (or 6.7% of sales) in 2002. Higher operating income resulted from increased sales and
gross margins, but was partially offset by increased operating expenses in 2003.

Interest expense.

Interest expense decreased 41.9% in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to a substantial decrease in debt.

Other expense.

The Company incurred foreign exchange losses of $2.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in 2003
and 2002, due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non U.S. dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings.

Income taxes.

2003 includes a tax benefit of $2.7 million primarily related to the reversal of certain items that had
previously been provided for that were closed from further regulatory examination. The effective income tax rate was 36.5% for 2003 and 32% for 2002. The change in the effective tax rate was due to a higher effective state tax rate and increased
statutory rates in foreign jurisdictions. Also, increased income has reduced the significance of the favorable impact the Company’s utilization of foreign tax credits has on the effective tax rate.

Net income

. Net income for 2003 increased $68.2 million, compared with
2002, which included a $61.7 million, net of tax, write off of goodwill. Income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change increased $6.5 million, compared with 2002. The increase was due to increased sales, improved margins, and lower
interest expense.

Income Taxes

Management believes in the next three years cash outlays for income taxes
will be less than income tax expense due to the utilization of NOLs and the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets which will continue to be amortized for tax purposes. The Company’s current level of pre-tax income is sufficient to
utilize


the deferred tax assets. In 2004, the Company has produced a $1.1 million federal net operating loss to be carried forward. A portion of the reported federal
credits in the amount of $4.2 million will be realized through a carry back claim. Management believes tax planning opportunities exist in various foreign countries that will allow the Company to utilize foreign net operating loss carryforwards at
an accelerated rate. Any tax assets that are uncertain regarding realization have a valuation allowance in the full amount of the asset. Management believes the remaining assets will be realized in the normal course of business.

The overall effective income tax rate includes a tax benefit of $4.9 million
and $2.7 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively, which is primarily related to the reversal of certain items that had previously been provided for and that have been closed from further regulatory examination

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is provided primarily by operating cash flow and borrowings under
the Company’s unsecured credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks (“credit agreement”). The following is a summary of selected cash flow information and other relevant data:

Management utilizes
EBITDA as a measure of liquidity. The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities:

EBITDA is defined as
earnings before deducting interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Although EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management believes that it is useful
to an investor in evaluating Wabtec because it is widely used as a measure to evaluate a Company’s operating performance and ability to service debt. Financial covenants in our credit facility include ratios based on EBITDA. EBITDA does not
purport to represent cash generated by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, because EBITDA is not
calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Management’s discretionary use of funds depicted by EBITDA may be limited by working capital, debt
service and capital expenditure requirements, and by restrictions related to legal requirements, commitments and uncertainties.


Operating activities.

Operating cash flow in 2004 was $52.9 million as compared to $55.9 million
in 2003. Net Income was approximately $9.7 million higher in 2004 than 2003. Working capital decreased, and generated operating cash, by $6.2 million, as accounts payable and accruals increased $26.1 million, offset by an increase in receivables,
inventory and other current assets of $10.8 million, $5.2 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Deferred and accrued income taxes remained relatively unchanged compared to an $8.8 million decrease in 2003. The remaining use of operating cash is
due to a net increase in the other assets less other liabilities in 2004.

Operating cash flow in 2003 was $55.9 million as compared to $15.7 million in 2002. Working capital remained relatively unchanged in 2003, as receivables and inventory increased $13.2 million, and accounts payable
increased $14.1 million. Also, deferred income taxes decreased by $8.8 million in 2003.

During 2002, cash outlays for merger and restructuring activities was approximately $2.5 million and is reported as a reduction to cash provided by operating activities. Also, in 2002, $30 million was paid in taxes
related to the gain on the sale of locomotive aftermarket assets in 2001. The operating cash flow in 2002 excluding the $30 million tax payment from 2001 was approximately $46 million.

Investing activities.

In 2004 and 2003, cash used in investing activities was $17.8 million and $12.5 million,
respectively, consisting almost entirely of capital expenditures, net of disposals. In 2002 cash used in investing activities was $10.8 million. In 2002, the Company used $1.7 million for certain business acquisitions. See Note 5 of “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report, for further information.

Capital expenditures for continuing operations were $19.3 million, $17.5 million and $14.1 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The majority of
capital expenditures for these periods relates to upgrades to and replacement of existing equipment.

Financing activities.

In 2004, cash used for financing activities was $18.5 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $9.2
million in 2003.

During 2004, long term debt was reduced by
$40.1 million. The Company also realized proceeds of $23 million from the exercise of stock options during 2004. In 2003, the Company issued $150 million of Senior Notes due in August 2013 (“the Notes”). The Notes were issued at par and
interest accrues at 6.875% and is payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year, commencing on January 31, 2004. The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the Company’s then existing bank credit agreement, and for
general corporate purposes.

The Notes are senior unsecured
obligations of the Company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture under which the Notes were issued contains covenants and
restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.

In November 2003, the Company issued common stock in connection with the
registration and sale of stock by certain selling shareholders. The Company issued 726,900 shares of common stock realizing total proceeds of about $10 million. See “Prospectus Summary—Recent Development.”

Cash used for financing activities was $44.1 million in 2002. During 2002,
the Company reduced long-term debt by $45.9 million. We repaid $175 million of senior notes in the third quarter of 2002 to take advantage of lower interest rates on our revolving credit agreement. Historically, the Company have financed the
purchase of significant businesses utilizing cash flow generated from operations and amounts available under its credit facilities.


The following table shows outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The revolving credit
agreement and other term loan interest rates are variable and dependent on market conditions.

Cash balance at
December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $95.3 million and $70.3 million, respectively.

On February 1, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of assets of Rütgers Rail S.p.A. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the purchase price will be allocated to the respective
assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Operating results will be included in the consolidated statement of operations from the acquisition date forward. The new company formed to hold the newly
purchased assets of Rütgers Rail S.p.A. is named CoFren S.r.l. (“CoFren”). CoFren has become the leading manufacturer of brake shoes, disc pads and interior trim components for rail applications in Europe. The purchase price was $36.6
million in cash, and is subject to adjustment based on a calculation of net worth as defined in the Sale and Purchase agreement. The adjustment is to be completed within 90 business days of the acquisition date.

Refinancing Credit agreement.

In January 2004, the Company refinanced
its existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks. This “Refinancing Credit Agreement” provides a $175 million five-year revolving credit facility expiring in January 2009. At December 31, 2004, the
Company had available bank borrowing capacity, net of $21.9 million of letters of credit, of approximately $153.1 million, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.

Refinancing Credit Agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below. The maximum
credit agreement borrowings, average credit agreement borrowings and weighted-average contractual interest rate on credit agreement borrowings were $40 million, $36.7 million and 2.9%, respectively for 2004. To reduce the impact of interest rate
changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the Company entered into interest rate swaps which effectively convert a portion of the debt from variable to fixed-rate borrowings during the term of the swap contracts. On December 31, 2003, the
notional value of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled $40 million and effectively changed our interest rate from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 3.98%. The interest rate swap agreements were terminated, for a net gain of about $200,000 in
2004 in conjunction with the $40 million repayment of the revolving credit agreement.

Under the Refinancing Credit Agreement, we may elect a base interest rate or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rates of Interest (“LIBOR”). The base interest rate is the greater of
LaSalle Bank National Association’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% per annum. The LIBOR rate is based on LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 100 to 200 basis points depending on our consolidated total indebtedness to
cash flow ratios. The current margin is 100 basis points.

The
Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants
and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain
debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio.


The Refinancing Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including payment defaults,
failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect, covenant defaults, defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the Company, bankruptcy, certain judgments against the Company, ERISA defaults and “change of
control” of the Company. The Refinancing Credit Agreement includes the following covenants: a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0, maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 3.25 and a minimum net worth of $180 million plus 50% of consolidated net
income since September 30, 2003. The Company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities. See Note 9 of “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

Management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings, cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service
requirements. If sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the Company’s cash requirements, the Company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be
available, and, in any case, such new financing, if available, would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place.

Extinguishment of other debt.

In June 1995, the Company issued $100 million of 9.375% Senior Notes due in 2005 (the “1995 Notes”). In
January 1999, the Company issued an additional $75 million of 9.375% Senior Notes due in 2005 (the “1999 Notes”). The 1995 Notes and the 1999 Notes were redeemed at par (face) on July 8, 2002 through the use of cash on hand and additional
borrowings under the credit agreement. This redemption resulted in a non-cash loss of $1.9 million relating to a write-off of deferred debt issuance costs.

Effects of Inflation

In general, inflation has not had a material impact on the Company’s results of operations. Some of our labor contracts contain negotiated salary and
benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses, which would cause our labor cost to automatically increase if inflation were to become significant. However, higher costs of metals have reduced gross margin. Other areas of
higher costs include medical benefits for active and retired employees.


Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts
such as debt agreements, lease agreements and have certain contingent commitments such as debt guarantees. The Company has grouped these contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements into operating activities, financing activities, and
investing activities in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical
information. The table below provides a summary of contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2004:

(1)

The Company has entered into $347,000 of material long-term non-cancelable materials and supply purchase
obligations. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for rental of facilities and equipment. Estimated pension funding and post retirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates,
expected return on long-term assets, rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Benefits paid for pension obligations were $6.1 million and $5.7 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Benefits paid for post retirement plans
were $3.5 million and $2.1 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Obligations for financing activities.

Cash requirements for financing activities consist primarily of long-term debt repayments and dividend payments to shareholders. The Company has historically paid quarterly dividends to
shareholders, subject to quarterly approval by our Board of Directors, currently at a rate of $1.8 million annually.

In 2001, the Company sold a subsidiary to that unit’s management team. As part of the sale, the Company guaranteed approximately $3 million of bank
debt of the buyer, which was used for the purchase financing. This debt was refinanced in June 2004, and Wabtec’s guarantee was reduced to $1.3 million. Management has no reason to believe that this debt will not be repaid or refinanced.

The Company arranges for performance bonds to be issued by
third party insurance companies to support certain long term customer contracts. At December 31, 2004, initial value of performance bonds issued on the Company’s behalf is about $150 million.

Obligations for investing activities.

The Company typically spends
approximately $15-25 million a year for capital expenditures, primarily related to facility expansion efficiency and modernization, health and safety, and environmental control. The Company expects annual capital expenditures in the future will be
within this range.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, estimates
and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the


reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Areas of
uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives, environmental matters, warranty reserves, the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, proceeds on assets to be sold, pensions and
other postretirement benefits, and tax matters. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates, and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used
to prepare the Company’s financial statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and the
financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. A discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in Notes 2 and 18,
respectively, in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”
included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the
Company’s operating results and financial condition.

The
Company recognizes revenues on long-term contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting. The units-of-delivery method or other output-based measures, as appropriate, are used to measure the progress of individual contracts
towards completion. Contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as known. Provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts.
Certain pre-production costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be amortized over the life of the contract.

In 2002, we adopted the new standard of accounting for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. The cumulative effect adjustment recognized
on January 1, 2002, upon adoption of the new standard, was a charge of $61.7 million (after tax). Also in 2002, amortization ceased for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Total amortization expense for intangible assets recognized
was $2.4 million in 2004, $3.4 million in 2003 and $4 million in 2002. Additionally, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current
fair value of the business to the recorded value (including goodwill). We use a combination of a guideline public company market approach and a discounted cash flow model (“DCF model”) to determine the current fair value of the business. A
number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecasted operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volume and pricing, costs to produce and working capital changes.
Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its business are estimated. However, actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate
the impairment of goodwill.

The allowance for doubtful
accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence.

The Company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs
from repairing or replacing products with durability, quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods. In general, reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales, based on historical experience. In addition, specific
reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses.

Inventory is reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventories. The Company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog
requirements. To the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand, a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory. Also, specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence.


Other areas of significant judgments and estimates include the liabilities and expenses for pensions and
other postretirement benefits. These amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets and
several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age and mortality). The rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year-end on debt
instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan. The long-term rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five-year
average market value of assets.

As a global company, Wabtec
records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts. However,
the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded. An adjustment to the estimated liability
would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount. Management does not believe that such a charge would be material.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with
variable-rate debt. There was no outstanding variable rate debt at December 31, 2004. After considering the effects of interest rate swaps, further described below, our variable rate debt represented 0% of total long-term debt at December 31, 2003.
Management had entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap contracts that mitigated the impact of variable-rate debt interest rate increases. These interest rate swap contracts were terminated in 2004. In 2003, we had concluded that
our swap contracts qualified for “special cash flow hedge accounting” which permitted recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet (see Note 20 of “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report).

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We
occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations. As of December 31, 2004, we had several such
instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2005.

We entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a
set date at some point in the future. There is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. At the delivery date we can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. All outstanding forward contracts are for the sale of U.S.
Dollars (USD) and the purchase of Canadian Dollars (CAD). As of December 31, 2004, we had forward contracts with a notional value of $59 million CAD (or $43.5 million U.S.), with an average exchange rate of $0.74 USD per $1 CAD, resulting in the
recording of a current asset and an increase in comprehensive income of $3.6 million, net of tax.

We are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2004, approximately 66% of Wabtec’s net sales are in the United States, 10% in Canada, 2% in Mexico, and 22% in other international locations, primarily Europe. (See Note 19 of
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report).

Our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at December 31, 2003.


Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Effective December 31, 2003, Wabtec adopted SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Post-retirement Benefits—an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88 and 106” for its U.S. pension plans. This standard requires additional disclosures about an employer’s pension plans and postretirement benefits such as:
the type of plan assets, investment strategy, measurement date, plan obligations, cash flows, and components of net periodic benefit costs recognized during interim periods. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the required
additional disclosures.

In November 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 151, (Inventory Costs—an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” This standard provides clarification that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and
spoilage should be recognized as current period charges. Additionally, this standard requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of
this standard are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this standard on the Company’s financial statements and results of operations.

SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) “Share-Based Payment”
was issued in December 2004. This standard requires companies to measure and recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value. The effective date is the first interim
reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. Wabtec is currently evaluating pricing models and the transition provisions of this standard and will begin expensing stock options in the third quarter of 2005.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 109-2, “Accounting and
Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” FSP 109-2 provides guidance under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” with respect to recording the potential
impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Act”) on enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability. The Jobs Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. FSP 109-2 states that an
enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the impact of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. The Company has not yet
completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions. Accordingly, provided for in FSP 109-2, the Company has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the Job Act.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORTS TO WABTEC SHAREHOLDERS

Management’s Report on Financial Statements and Practices

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) were
prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts that are based on management’s best judgments and
estimates. The other financial information included in the 10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.

Management also recognizes its responsibility for conducting the Company’s affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate
conduct. This responsibility is characterized and reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business activities within the laws of host countries in which the Company operates and
potentially conflicting outside business interests of its employees. The Company maintains a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Based on its assessment,
management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Management’s Certifications

The certifications of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have been included in Exhibits 31 and 32 in the Company’s 10-K. In addition, in 2004, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer provided to the New York Stock Exchange the annual CEO
certification regarding the Company’s compliance with the New York Stock Exchange’s corporate governance listing standards.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Westinghouse
Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a) of this Registration Statement. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As more fully discussed in Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2002, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Westinghouse Air Brake
Technologies Corporation:

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and
an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Westinghouse Air Brake
Technologies Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies
Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets
of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004 and our report dated March 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

BUSINESS

Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based products and services for the global rail industry. Our products are
found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles, as well as in certain markets throughout the world. Our products enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, and many of our
core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles.

Wabtec is a global company with operations in nine countries. In 2004, about 78 percent of the Company’s revenues came from its North American
operations, but Wabtec also sold products or services in 82 countries around the world.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries.
Such statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Sales between subsidiaries are billed at prices consistent with sales to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific
allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $2 million and $4.5 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory costs include material, labor and overhead.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment additions are stated at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements are
capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The Company provides for book depreciation principally on the straight-line method. Accelerated depreciation methods are utilized for income tax purposes.

Leasing Arrangements

The Company conducts a
portion of its operations from leased facilities and finances certain equipment purchases through lease agreements. In those cases in which the lease term approximates the useful life of the leased asset or the lease meets certain other
prerequisites, the leasing arrangement is classified as a capital lease. The remaining arrangements are treated as operating leases.

Intangible Assets

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002, and, as a result, goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives are no longer amortized. Other intangibles (with definite lives) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment and
more frequently when indicators of impairment are present. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present.

The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value (including goodwill). The Company uses a
combination of a guideline public company market approach and a discounted cash flow model (“DCF model”) to determine the current fair value of the business. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application
of the DCF model to forecasted operating

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volume and pricing, costs to produce and working capital changes. Management considers historical
experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its business are estimated. However, actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.

Warranty Costs

Warranty costs are accrued based
on management’s estimates of repair or upgrade costs per unit and historical experience. Warranty expense was $14.9 million, $10.5 million and $17.6 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Warranty reserves were $17.4 million and $13.3
million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Agreements

In May 1998, a consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97-14, “Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested”
(“EITF 97-14”), was issued. The adoption of EITF 97-14 required the Company to record as treasury stock the historical value of the Company’s stock maintained in its deferred compensation plans.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws. The provision for income taxes includes
federal, state and foreign income taxes.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” to provide alternate methods of transition to SFAS No. 123’s fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. The statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures
about the method of accounting for compensation cost associated with employee stock option plans, as well as the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 and has not changed its
method for measuring the compensation cost of stock options.

The Company continues to use the intrinsic value based method and does not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the stock at the time of grant. As a
result, the adoption of SFAS No. 148 had no impact on our results of operations or financial position.

Had compensation expense for these plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates
for awards, the Company’s net income and earnings per share would be as set forth in the following table. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value is amortized to expense over the options’ vesting period.

For purposes of
presenting pro forma results, the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

Financial
Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on its variable rate borrowings. Interest rate swaps are agreements with a counterparty to
exchange periodic interest payments (such as pay fixed, receive variable) calculated on a notional principal amount. The interest rate differential to be paid or received is recognized as interest expense.

The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 133, and as amended by SFAS 138, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” effective January 1, 2001. In the application, the Company has concluded its interest rate swap contracts qualify for
“special cash flow hedge accounting” which permit recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss) on the balance sheet. The interest rate swaps were terminated in 2004. As a result of
entering into these interest rate swaps, the Company incurred $262,000 in additional interest expense in 2004.

The Company also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Forward contracts are
agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. There is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. At the delivery date the Company can either take
delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. All outstanding forward contracts are for the sale of U.S. Dollars (USD) and the purchase of Canadian Dollars (CAD). As of December 31, 2004, the Company had forward contracts with a notional value
of


WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

$59 million CAD (or $43.5 million U.S.), with an average exchange rate of $0.74 USD per $1 CAD, resulting in the recording of a current asset and an increase
in comprehensive income of $3.6 million, net of tax.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, except for the Company’s Mexican operations whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on
the balance sheet date while income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from transactions, and the translation of financial statements are recorded in
the Company’s consolidated financial statements based upon the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation.” The effects of currency exchange rate changes on
intercompany transactions and balances of a long-term investment nature are accumulated and carried as a component of shareholders’ equity. The effects of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non U.S. dollar
denominated amounts are charged or credited to earnings. Foreign exchange loss was $1.2 million, $2.8 million and $1.2 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as net income and all other non-owner
changes in shareholders’ equity. The Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on derivatives designated and qualified as cash flow hedges,
foreign currency hedges and pension related adjustments

.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletins (SABs) 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements” and 104 “Revision of Topic 13.” Revenue is recognized when
products have been shipped to the respective customers, title has passed and the price for the product has been determined.

The Company recognizes revenues on long-term contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting. The units-of-delivery method or other
output-based measures, as appropriate, are used to measure the progress of individual contracts towards completion. Contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting
period as known. Provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts. Certain pre-production costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be amortized over the life of the contract.
Deferred pre-production costs were $5.3 million and $3.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Significant Customers and Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company’s trade receivables are primarily from rail and transit industry
original equipment manufacturers, Class I railroads, railroad carriers and commercial companies that utilize rail cars in their operations, such as utility and chemical companies. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales in 2004 and 2003. One customer, in the transit group, accounted for 11% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in 2002.

Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs

All fees billed to the customer for shipping and handling are classified as a component of net
revenues. All costs associated with shipping and handling is classified as a component of cost of sales.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, the Company incurred costs of approximately $33.8 million, $32.9 million and $33.6 million, respectively.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, approximately 39% of the Company’s workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements. These
agreements are generally effective through 2005, 2006 and 2007.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income
applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities (such as employee stock options).

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified, where necessary, to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from the estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances
may result in revised estimates.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

Effective December 31, 2003, Wabtec adopted SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Post-retirement Benefits—an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88 and 106” for its
U.S. pension plans. This standard requires additional disclosures about an employer’s pension plans and postretirement benefits such as: the type of plan assets, investment strategy, measurement date, plan obligations, cash flows, and
components of net periodic benefit costs recognized during interim periods. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the required additional disclosures.

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs
– an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” This standard provides clarification that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be recognized as current period charges. Additionally, this standard
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this standard are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this standard on the Company’s financial statements and results of operations.

SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) “Share-Based Payment” was issued in December 2004. This standard requires companies to measure and recognize the
cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value. The effective date is the first interim reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. Wabtec is currently evaluating pricing
models and the transition provisions of this standard and will begin expensing stock options in the third quarter of 2005.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” FSP 109-2 provides guidance under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(the “Jobs Act”) on enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability. The Jobs Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. FSP 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to
evaluate the impact of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. The Company has not yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions. Accordingly, as
provided for in FSP 109-2, the Company has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the Job Act.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On November 1, 2001, the Company completed the sale of certain assets to GE Transportation Systems (GETS) for $238 million in cash. The assets sold
primarily included locomotive aftermarket products and services for which Wabtec was not the original equipment manufacturer. Under the terms of the sales agreement, the Company has agreed to indemnify GETS for, among other things, certain potential
third party, off-site environmental cleanup or remediation costs. At this time, the Company is not aware of any potential liability in connection with this sale of assets. The Company reported a $48.7 million after tax gain on the sale in 2001.

In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company decided to exit
other businesses and put these businesses up for sale. The net assets of those businesses were written down to their estimated realizable value based on a multiple of earnings. The Company reported a $7.2 million after tax loss on the write-down of
these entities.

As of December 31, 2003, one of the businesses
had not sold. The Company actively solicited but did not receive any reasonable offers to purchase the asset and, in response, had reduced the price. The asset is no longer being actively marketed and as a result, the Company reclassed the business
to continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2003. Such reclassification had no material impact on the financial statements.

In accordance with SFAS 144, the operating results of these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for all years presented and are
summarized as of December 31, as follows:

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

The Company made the following acquisitions in 2002 and 2005:

i) In February 2002, the Company purchased the minority interest of a business in India that the Company did not already own for $1.7
million. This acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method. Accordingly, the results of operations of the acquisition are included in the Company’s financial statements prospectively from the acquisition date. The excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets was approximately $664,000 and was allocated to goodwill. Effective January 1, 2002, goodwill was no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS No. 142.

ii) On February 1, 2005, the Company completed the
acquisition of assets of Rütgers Rail S.p.A. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the purchase price will be allocated to the respective assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the
acquisition date. Operating results will be included in the consolidated statement of operations from the acquisition date forward. The new company formed to hold the newly purchased assets of Rütgers Rail S.p.A. is named CoFren S.r.l.
(“CoFren”). CoFren has become the leading manufacturer of brake shoes, disc pads and interior trim components for rail applications in Europe. The purchase price was $36.6 million in cash. The purchase price is subject to adjustment based
on a calculation of net worth as defined in the Sale and Purchase agreement. The adjustment is to be completed within 90 business days of the acquisition date.

The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

Depreciation expense
was $22.8 million, $21 million and $20.2 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2004, the Company wrote down $1.3 million of various assets, a portion of which were subsequently sold in 2005.

8.

INTANGIBLES

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” effective January 1, 2002. Under its provisions, all goodwill and
other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized under a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. Instead, they are subject to periodic assessments for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. In 2002,
the Company completed the Phase I and Phase II assessments and wrote down the carrying value of goodwill by $90 million ($83.2 million for the Freight Group and $6.8 million for the Transit Group), resulting in a non-cash after-tax charge of $61.7
million. The fair value of these reporting units was determined using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information. The Company also performed the required impairment
test in 2004 and 2003, which resulted in no additional impairment charge. Goodwill still remaining on the balance sheet is $113.5 million and $109.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company’s trademarks had a net
carrying amount of $19.6 million and the Company believes these intangibles have an indefinite life. Intangible assets of the Company, other than goodwill and trademarks, consist of the following:

In connection with the
adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company reassessed the useful lives and the classification of its identifiable assets and determined that they continue to be appropriate. The weighted average useful life of patents was 13 years and of covenants not to
compete was five years.

Amortization expense for intangible
assets was $2.4 million, $3.4 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Amortization expense for the five succeeding years is as follows (in thousands):

LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt consisted of the following:

Refinancing Credit Agreement

In January 2004, the Company refinanced its existing
unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks. This “Refinancing Credit Agreement” provides a $175 million five-year revolving credit facility expiring in January 2009. At December 31, 2004, the Company’s
available bank borrowing capacity, net of $21.9 million of letters of credit, was approximately $153.1 million, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.

Refinancing Credit Agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below. The maximum
credit agreement borrowings, average credit agreement borrowings and weighted-average contractual interest rate on credit agreement borrowings were $40 million, $36.7 million and 2.9%, respectively for 2004. To reduce the impact of interest rate
changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the Company entered into interest rate swaps which effectively convert a portion of the debt from variable to fixed-rate borrowings during the term of the swap contracts. On December 31, 2003, the
notional value of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled $40 million and effectively changed the Company’s interest rate on bank debt at December 31, 2003 from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 3.98%. The interest rate swap agreements were
terminated in 2004 in conjunction with the $40 million repayment of the revolving credit agreement.

Under the Refinancing Credit Agreement, the Company may elect a base interest rate or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rates of
Interest (“LIBOR”). The base interest rate is the greater of LaSalle Bank National Association’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% per annum. The LIBOR rate is based on LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 100
to 200 basis points depending on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The current margin is 100 basis points.

The Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from declaring or making
other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The


WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness;
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and
a maximum debt to cash flow ratio.

The Refinancing Credit
Agreement contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect, covenant defaults, defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the Company, bankruptcy,
certain judgments against the Company, ERISA defaults and “change of control” of the Company.

6.875% Senior Notes Due August 2013

In August 2003, the Company issued $150 million of Senior Notes due in 2013 (“the Notes”). The Notes were issued at par. Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate of 6.875% per annum and will be payable
semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year, commencing on January 31, 2004. The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the Company’s existing credit agreement, and for general corporate purposes.

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu
with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture under which the Notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the
following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens,

Scheduled principal repayments of outstanding loan balances required as of December 31, 2004 are as follows:

Extinguishment of Other Borrowings

In June 1995, the Company issued $100 million of 9.375%
Senior Notes due in 2005 (the “1995 Notes”). In January 1999, the Company issued an additional $75 million of 9.375% Senior Notes due in 2005 (the “1999 Notes”). The 1995 Notes and the 1999 Notes were redeemed at par (face) on
July 8, 2002 through the use of cash on hand and additional borrowings under the credit agreement. This redemption resulted in a non-cash loss of $1.9 million relating to a write-off of deferred financing costs.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that cover certain U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom employees and which provide benefits of stated
amounts for each year of service of the employee.

In addition
to providing pension benefits, the Company has provided certain unfunded postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for a portion of North American employees. In January 1995 the postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for
U.S. salaried employees was modified to discontinue benefits for employees who had not attained the age of 50 by March 31, 1995. The Company is not obligated to pay health care and life insurance benefits to individuals who had retired prior to
1990.

The projected benefit
obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $135.7 million and $113.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.


WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $126.1 million and
$106.2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The aggregate projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $135.7 million and $104.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004; and $113.1
million and $86.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2003. The aggregate accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $122 million and
$100.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004; and $70.2 million and $49.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2003.

The components of prepaid (accrued) benefit costs by country are as follows:

Components of Net Periodic Benefit
Costs

An increase in the
minimum pension liability resulted in a charge to shareholders’ equity, net of tax, of $3.8 million in 2004 and $2.8 million in 2003.

Assumptions

Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as follows:

The discount rate is
based on settling the pension obligation with high grade, high yield corporate bonds, and the rate of compensation increase is based on actual experience.

Weighted average assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit costs are as follows:


WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The expected return on plan assets is based on historical performance as well as expected future
rates of return on plan assets considering the current investment portfolio mix and the long-term investment strategy.

The assumed health care cost trend rate grades from an initial rate of 9.06% to an ultimate rate of 5% in six years. A 1% increase in the assumed health
care cost trend rate will increase the amount of expense recognized for the postretirement plans by approximately $441,000 for 2005, and increase the service and interest cost components of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
approximately $6.7 million. A 1% decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate will decrease the service and interest cost components of the expense recognized for the postretirement plans by approximately $351,000 for 2005, and decrease the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $5.5 million.

Pension Plan Assets

The composition of all
plan assets consists primarily of equities, corporate bonds, governmental notes and temporary investments. This Plan’s asset allocations at the respective measurement dates for 2004 by asset category are as follows:

Investment policies
are determined by the respective Plan’s Pension Committee and set forth in its Investment Policy. Pursuant to the Investment Policy for the U.S., the investment strategy is to use passive index funds managed by the Bank of New York. The target
asset allocation and composite benchmarks for U.S. plans include the following:

The Company is
evaluating allocation policies for its plans in Canada and the U.K.

Cash
Flows

The Company’s funding methods are based on
governmental requirements and differ from those methods used to recognize pension expense, which is primarily based on the projected unit credit method applied in the accompanying financial statements. The Company expects to contribute $9.7 million
to the pension plan during 2005 and expects this level of funding to continue in future periods. Rebalancing of the asset allocation occurs on a quarterly basis.

Benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants are as follows:

In May 2004, the FASB
issued FSP 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (FSP FAS 106-2). This Act was signed into law by the President on December 8, 2003 and
introduces a prescription drug benefit plan under Medicare Part D as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. FSP 106-2 provides guidance
on how companies should account for the impact of the Act on their postretirement health care plans. To encourage employers to retain or provide postretirement drug benefits, beginning in 2006 the federal government will provide non-taxable subsidy
payments to employers that sponsor prescription drug benefits to retirees that are actuarially equivalent to the Medicare benefit. FSP 106-2 is effective for interim or annual financial statements beginning after June 15, 2004. The adoption of FSP
106-2 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company also participates in certain 401(k) and multiemployer pension plans. Costs recognized under these plans are summarized as follows:

The 401(k) savings
plan is a participant directed defined contribution plan that holds shares of the Company’s stock. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the plan held on behalf of its participants about 695,000 shares with a market value of $14.8 million, and 776,000

No provision has been
made for U.S., state, or additional foreign taxes related to undistributed earnings of $57 million of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently re-invested.

The 2004 Jobs Creation Act and FSP 109-2 state that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of
enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for applying SFAS No. 109. The Company has not yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions. Accordingly as
provided for in FSP 109-2, the Company has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect repatriation provisions of the 2004 Jobs Creation Act.

The consolidated provision (credit) for income taxes included in the Statement of Income consisted of the following:

loss carryforwards exist in the amount of $159 million and $24 million, respectively, and are set to expire in various periods from 2006 to 2024. A valuation allowance exists and/or has been established for certain of these net operating loss
carryforwards.

Federal tax credits exist of approximately $4.3
million which are comprised of Research and Experimentation credits available through 2024 and Alternative Minimum Tax credits available indefinitely. State tax credits of approximately $614,000 are available and consist of various Machinery &

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The computation of earnings per share from continuing operations is as follows:

Options to purchase
approximately 589,000, 646,000 and 2.1 million shares of Common Stock were outstanding in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price exceeded the
average market price of the common shares.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

Stock Options

Under the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan), the Company may grant options to employees for an initial amount of 1.1 million
shares of Common Stock. This amount is subject to annual modification based on a formula. Under the formula, 1.5% of total common shares outstanding at the end of the preceding fiscal year are added to shares available for grant under the 2000 Plan.
Based on the adjustment, the Company had approximately 1.4 million shares available for 2004 grants and has available approximately 1.1


WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

million shares through the end of fiscal 2005. The shares available for grants on any given date may not exceed 15% of Wabtec’s total common shares
outstanding. Generally, the options become exercisable over a three-year vesting period and expire ten years from the date of grant.

As part of a long-term incentive program, in 1998, the Company granted options to purchase up to 500,020 shares, to certain executives under a plan that
preceded the 2000 Plan. The option price is $20 per share. The options vest 100% after eight years and are subject to accelerated vesting after three years if the Company achieves certain earnings targets as established by the compensation committee
of the board of directors. No further grants may be made under this plan.

non-employee directors to purchase a total of 131,000 shares.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 1998, the Company adopted an employee discounted stock purchase plan (DSPP). The DSPP had 500,000 shares available for issuance. Participants can purchase the Company’s common stock at 85% of the
lesser of fair market value on the first or last day of each offering period. Stock outstanding under this plan at December 31, 2004 was 209,600 shares.

A summary of the Company’s stock option activity and related information for the years indicated follows:

OPERATING LEASES

The Company leases office and manufacturing facilities under operating leases with terms ranging from one to 15 years, excluding renewal options.

The Company has sold remanufactured locomotives to various
financial institutions and leased them back under operating leases with terms from five to 20 years.

Total net rental expense charged to operations in 2004, 2003, and 2002 was $7.8 million, $6.9 million and $6.2 million, respectively. Certain of the
Company’s equipment rental obligations under operating leases pertain to locomotives, which are subleased to customers under both short-term and long-term agreements. The amounts above are shown net of sublease rentals of $2.2 million, $2.8
million and $2.8 million for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Future minimum rental payments under operating leases with remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows:

GUARANTEES

In 2001, the Company sold the operating assets and liabilities of a non-core business unit to that business unit’s management team. As part of the
sale, Wabtec guaranteed approximately $3 million of bank debt of the buyer, which was used for the purchase financing. This debt was refinanced in June 2004, and Wabtec’s guarantee was reduced to $1.3 million. The Company has no reason to
believe that this debt will not be repaid or refinanced.

PREFERRED STOCK

The Company’s authorized capital stock includes 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue the preferred
stock and to fix the designations, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such class or series, including dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, without any further vote or
action by the Company’s shareholders. The rights and preferences of the preferred stock would be superior to those of the common stock. At December 31, 2004 and 2003 there was no preferred stock issued or outstanding.

18.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of
hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes its operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and
regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.

Under terms of the purchase agreement and related documents for the 1990
Acquisition, American Standard, Inc. (“ASI”) has indemnified the Company for certain items including, among other things, certain environmental claims the Company asserted prior to 2000. If ASI was unable to honor or meet these
indemnifications, the Company would be responsible for such items. In the opinion of management, ASI currently has the ability to meet its indemnification obligations.

Actions have been filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the United States
by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. Since 2000, the number of such claims has increased. Most of these claims have been made against our wholly-owned subsidiary, Railroad Friction Products
Corporation (RFPC), and are based on a product sold by RFPC before we acquired American Standard, Inc.’s (ASI) 50% interest in RFPC in 1990. We acquired the remaining interest in RFPC in 1992. These claims include a suit against RFPC and its
insurers seeking coverage under RFPC’s insurance policies, and a claim against the Company contending that the Company assumed ASI’s liability for asbestos claims brought against ASI that ASI alleges claim exposure to RFPC’s product.

Most of these claims, including all of the RFPC claims, are
submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. We cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance
or that the indemnitors will remain financially viable. Our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.

BOISE, IDAHO

The Company is subject to a RCRA Part B Closure Permit (“the Permit”) issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Idaho
Department of Health and Welfare, Division of Environmental Quality relating to the monitoring and treatment of groundwater contamination on, and adjacent to, the MotivePower Industries (Boise, Idaho) facility. In compliance with the Permit, the
Company has completed the first phase of an accelerated plan for the treatment of contaminated groundwater, and continues onsite and offsite monitoring for hazardous constituents. An additional $970,000 was accrued in 2004 based on our refined
estimates of ongoing monitoring costs. In total, the Company has accrued $1.3 million at December 31, 2004, the estimated remaining costs for remediation and monitoring. The Company was in compliance with the Permit at December 31, 2004.

MOUNTAINTOP, PENNSYLVANIA

Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation (“FWEC”) the seller of the
Mountaintop property to the predecessor of one of the Company’s subsidiaries in 1989, agreed to indemnify the Company’s predecessor and its successors and assigns against certain identified environmental liabilities for which FWEC executed
a Consent Order Agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and EPA. Management believes that this indemnification arrangement is enforceable for the benefit of the Company and that FWEC has the financial resources
to honor its obligations under this indemnification arrangement.

MATTOON,
ILLINOIS

Prior to the Company’s acquisition of Young
Radiator, Young agreed to clean up alleged contamination on a prior production site in Mattoon, Illinois. The Company is in the process of remediating the site with the state of Illinois and now estimates the costs to remediate the site to be
approximately $18,000 which has been accrued at December 31, 2004.

RACINE,
WISCONSIN

Young ceased manufacturing operations at its
Racine facility in the early 1990s. Investigations prior to the acquisition of Young revealed some levels of contamination on the Racine property and the Company has begun remediation efforts. The Company has initiated a comprehensive site
evaluation with the state of Wisconsin and believes this governing body is generally in agreement with the findings. The Company has accrued approximately $165,000 at December 31, 2004 as its estimate of the remaining remediation costs.

GETS-GS

On November 3, 2000, the Company settled a suit brought against it in 1999 by GE-Harris Railway Electronics, L.L.C. and
GE-Harris Railway Electronics Services, L.L.C. (collectively “GE-Harris”). On September 20, 2002, a motion in that lawsuit was filed by the successor to GE-Harris, GE Transportation Services Global Signaling, L.L.C. (“GETS-GS”).
The motion by GETS-GS contended that the Company is acting beyond authority granted in the parties’ November 2000 settlement and license agreement and in contempt of the consent order that concluded the suit at that time.

In support of its motion, GETS-GS pointed principally to sales and offers to
sell certain railway brake equipment, including distributed power equipment, to Australian customers. In August 2004, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware ruled partially in favor of GETS-GS ordering the Company to pay
compensatory damages for lost licensing profits related to the above mentioned distributed power equipment

contracts and reimbursement for reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. While the Company disagrees with the ruling and intends to continue to contest
this ruling, this liability of $3.2 million was recognized in 2004 as a component of selling, general and administrative expense. Should an option be exercised by the Company’s Australian customers for additional shipments of products under the
same distributed power contracts, an additional $2.7 million of compensatory damages could be owed to GETS-GS. The additional liability will not be recognized by the Company until and if such option is exercised.

The Company has other contingent obligations relating to certain sales
leaseback transactions, for locomotives that were assumed in connection with the MotivePower merger in 1999, for which reserves of $4.7 million have been established.

From time to time the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the ordinary
course of business. As of the date hereof, the Company is involved in no litigation that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Wabtec has two reportable segments—the Freight Group and the Transit Group. The key factors used to identify these reportable segments are the
organization and alignment of the Company’s internal operations, the nature of the products and services and customer type. The business segments are:

Freight Group

manufactures products and provides services geared to the production and operation of freight cars and locomotives, including braking
control equipment, engines, on-board electronic components and train coupler equipment. Revenues are derived from OEM sales and locomotive overhauls, aftermarket sales and from freight car repairs and services. All of the assets sold to GETS were
part of the Freight Group.

Transit Group

consists of
products for passenger transit vehicles (typically subways, rail and buses) that include braking, coupling and monitoring systems, climate control and door equipment that are engineered to meet individual customer specifications. Revenues are
derived from OEM and aftermarket sales as well as from repairs and services.

The Company evaluates its business segments’ operating results based on income from operations. Corporate activities include general corporate expenses, elimination of intersegment transactions, interest income
and expense and other unallocated charges. Since certain administrative and other operating expenses and other items have not been allocated to business segments, the results in the below tables are not necessarily a measure computed in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to other companies.
