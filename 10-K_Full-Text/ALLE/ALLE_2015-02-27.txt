PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

Allegion plc ("Allegion," "we," "us" or "the Company") is a leading global provider of security products and solutions that keep people safe, secure and productive. We make the world safer as a company of experts, securing the places where people thrive and we create peace of mind by pioneering safety and security. We offer an extensive and versatile portfolio of mechanical and electronic security products across a range of market-leading brands. Our experts across the globe deliver high-quality security products, services and systems and we use our deep expertise to serve as trusted partners to end-users who seek customized solutions to their security needs.

Access control security products and solutions are critical elements in every building. Most door openings are custom-configured to maximize a room’s particular form and function while also meeting local and national building and safety code requirements and end-user security needs. Most buildings have multiple door openings, each serving its own purpose and requiring different specific access-control solutions. Each door must fit exactly within its frame, be prepared precisely for its hinges, synchronize with its specific lockset and corresponding latch and align with a specific key to secure the door. Moreover, security products are increasingly linked electronically, creating additional functionality and complexity.

We believe our ability to deliver a wide range of solutions that can be custom-configured to meet end-users’ security needs is a key driver of our success. We accomplish this with:

•

Our extensive and versatile product portfolio, combined with our deep expertise, which enables us to deliver the right products and solutions to meet diverse security and functional specifications;

•

Our consultative approach and expertise, which enables us to develop the most efficient and appropriate building security and access-control specifications to fulfill the unique needs of our end-users and their partners, including architects, contractors, home-builders and engineers; and

•

Our operational excellence capabilities, including our global manufacturing operations and agile supply chain, which facilitate our ability to deliver specific product and system configurations to end-users worldwide, quickly and efficiently.

Based on information derived from third party sources, we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was more than $30 billion in revenue in 2014, comprised of $25 billion for mechanical hardware and electronic security  products and more than $5 billion for time, attendance, and workforce productivity systems and systems integration. We believe that the security products industry will benefit from several global macroeconomic and long-term demographic trends, including:

•

recovery of construction markets in key North American markets

•

heightened awareness of security requirements,

•

increased global urbanization, and

•

the shift to a digital, interconnected environment.

In the more established economies of North America and Europe, the security products industry’s compound annual growth rate was 1 to 2% per year due to uneven economic conditions experienced over the past three years. We believe our markets are poised for a cyclical recovery driven in part by accelerating growth in the underlying commercial and residential construction markets and improved consumer confidence in the United States offsetting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, we expect growth in the global electronic product categories we serve to outperform the security products industry as end-users adopt newer technologies in their facilities.

We operate in three geographic regions: Americas; Europe, Middle East, India and Africa ("EMEIA"); and Asia Pacific. We sell our products and solutions under the following brands:





We sell a wide range of security products and solutions for end-users in commercial, institutional and residential facilities worldwide, including into the education, healthcare, government, hospitality, commercial office and single and multi-family residential markets. Our strategic brands are Schlage®, Von Duprin®, LCN®, CISA® and Interflex®. We believe Schlage, Von Duprin and LCN hold the No. 1 position in their primary product categories in North America and CISA and Interflex hold the No.1 or No. 2 position in their primary product categories in certain European markets.

For the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we generated revenues of

$2,118.3 million

and operating income of

$326.3 million

.

History and Developments

Allegion plc was incorporated in Ireland on May 9, 2013, to hold Ingersoll Rand’s commercial and residential security businesses. On December 1, 2013, Allegion became a stand-alone public company after Ingersoll Rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of Ingersoll Rand via the transfer of these businesses from Ingersoll Rand to Allegion and the issuance by Allegion of ordinary shares directly to Ingersoll Rand’s shareholders (the "Spin-off").  Our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories. Several of our brands were established more than 75 years ago, and many of our brands originally created their categories:

•

Von Duprin, established in 1908, was awarded the first exit device patent;

•

Schlage, established in 1920, was awarded the first patents granted for the cylindrical lock and the push button lock;

•

LCN, established in 1926, created the first door closure;

•

CISA, established in 1926, devised the first electronically controlled lock; and

•

Steelcraft Doors, established in 1927, developed the first mass-produced hollow metal door in 1942.

We have built upon these founding legacies since our entry into the security products market through the acquisition of Schlage, Von Duprin and LCN in 1974. Today, we continue to develop and introduce innovative and market-leading products. Recent examples include: Schlage NDE series wireless commercial lock with the ENGAGE connectivity platform; Schlage Touchscreen Deadbolt, a residential lock; CISA eSigno, a hotel locking platform; eVayo, a European electronics security platform; Von Duprin Concealed Vertical Cable System that significantly reduces total installation time and ongoing maintenance requirements; aptiQ, a versatile and multi-technology card reader platform; and Schlage’s AD/CO, an electronic locking platform that allows end-users to add additional features without lock replacement.

Industry and Competition

Based on third party sources, we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was more than $31 billion in revenue in 2014, comprised of $26 billion for mechanical hardware and electronic security products and more than $5 billion for time, attendance, and workforce productivity systems and systems integration, with compound annual growth of about 1 to 2% per year over the past three years. This growth rate primarily reflects cyclical challenges in the commercial and residential construction markets throughout North America and Europe as certain developing economies experienced higher growth rates during this period. Additionally, growth in electronic security products and solutions continues to outperform the industry as a whole as end-users adopt newer technologies in their facilities. We expect the security products industry will benefit from favorable long-term



demographic trends such as continued urbanization of the global population, increased concerns about safety and security and technology-driven innovation.

The security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world, with a number of large multi-national companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies. This high fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable end-user needs.  We believe our principal global competitors are Assa Abloy AB, DORMA Holding GmbH, Kaba Holding AG, and Stanley Black & Decker Inc. We also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world, including from Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. in the North American residential market.  As we move into more technologically-advanced product categories, we may also compete against smaller, more specialized competitors.

Our success depends on a variety of factors, including brand and reputation, product breadth, quality and delivery capabilities, price and service capabilities.  As many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network.  Although price often serves as an important customer decision criterion, we also compete based on the breadth and quality of our products and solutions, our ability to custom-configure solutions to meet individual end-user requirements and our global supply chain.

Our 10 largest customers represented approximately 21% of our total revenues in


. No single customer represented 10% or more of our total revenues in


.

Sales and Marketing

In markets where we sell through commercial and institutional distribution channels, we employ sales professionals around the world who work with a combination of end-users, security professionals, architects, contractors, engineers and distribution partners to develop specific custom-configured solutions for our end-users’ needs.  Our field sales professionals are assisted by specification writers who work with architects, engineers and consultants to help design door openings and security systems to meet end-users’ functional, aesthetic and regulatory requirements. Both groups are supported by dedicated customer care and technical sales-support specialists worldwide. We also support our sales efforts with a variety of marketing efforts, including trade-specific advertising, cooperative distributor merchandising, digital marketing, and marketing at a variety of industry trade shows.

In markets in which we sell through retail and home-builder distribution channels, we have teams of sales, merchandising and marketing professionals who help drive brand and product awareness through our channel partners and to consumers. We utilize a variety of advertising and marketing strategies, including traditional consumer media, retail merchandising, digital marketing, retail promotions, and builder and consumer trade shows, to support these teams.

We also work actively with several regulatory bodies around the world to help promote effective and consistent safety and security standards.  For example, we are members of Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association, Security Industry Association, Smart Card Alliance, American Society of Healthcare Engineering, American Institute of Architects, Construction Specification Institute, ASSOFERMA (Italy), BHE (Germany) and UNIQ (France). We also have established the Safety and Security Institute in China, which helps to educate government officials, architects and builders and advocates for consistent building codes and standards that address end-users’ safety and security.

Production and Distribution

We manufacture our products in our geographic markets around the world. We operate 19 production facilities, including 10 in the Americas region, six in EMEIA and three in Asia Pacific. We own 10 of these facilities and lease the others. Our strategy is to produce in the region of use, wherever appropriate, to allow us to be closer to the end-user and increase efficiency and timely product delivery.



In managing our network of production facilities, we focus on eliminating excess capacity, reducing cycle time through productivity, and harmonizing production practices and safety procedures.

We distribute our products through a broad network of channel partners.  In addition, third-party logistics providers perform storage and distribution services for us to support certain parts of our distribution network.

Raw Materials

We support our region-of-use production strategy with corresponding region-of-use supplier partners, where available. Our global and regional commodity teams work with production leadership, product management and materials management teams to ensure adequate materials are available for production at the lowest possible cost.

We purchase a wide range of raw materials, including steel, zinc, brass and other non-ferrous metals, to support our production facilities. Where appropriate, we may enter into long-term supply arrangements or fixed-cost contracts to lower overall costs. We do not believe the loss of any particular supplier would be material to our business.

Intellectual Property

Intellectual property, inclusive of certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, is important to our business.  We create, protect and enforce our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to try to ensure the protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights. We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that such distinctive marks are an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying us and in distinguishing our products from others. We consider our Schlage, Von Duprin, CISA and other associated trademarks to be among our most valuable assets, and we have registered these trademarks in a number of countries. Although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses.

Facilities

We operate through a broad network of sales offices, 19 production facilities and several distribution centers throughout the world.  Our active properties represent about 5.1 million square feet, of which approximately 54% is leased.

The following table shows the location of our worldwide production facilities:

Research and Development

We are committed to investing in highly productive research and development capabilities, particularly in electro-mechanical systems.  Our research and development ("R&D") expenditures were approximately $

43.3 million

, $

39.6 million

and $

38.2 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, respectively.

We concentrate on developing technology innovations that will deliver growth through the introduction of new products and solutions, and also on driving continuous improvements in product cost, quality, safety and sustainability.



We manage our R&D team as a global group with an emphasis on a global collaborative approach to identify and develop new technologies and worldwide product platforms. We are organized on a regional basis to leverage expertise in local standards and configurations. In addition to regional engineering centers in each geographic region, we also operate a global engineering center of excellence in Bangalore, India.

Seasonality

Our business experiences seasonality that varies by product line. Because more construction and do-it-yourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the Northern Hemisphere, our security product sales, typically, are higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters. However, our Interflex and Asia Pacific systems integration businesses typically experience higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to project timing. Revenue by quarter for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:

Employees

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had more than 8,500 employees, approximately 20% of whom have the terms of their employment covered under collective bargaining agreements. Our non-management European employees are represented by national and local works councils.

Environmental Regulation

We are dedicated to an environmental program intended to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities.

We are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") and similar state authorities. We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. For all such sites, there are other PRPs and, in most instances, our involvement is minimal.

In estimating our liability, we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis. Additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future.

We incurred $

2.9 million

, $

2.1 million

, and

$2.9 million

of expenses during the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


, and


, respectively, for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us. As of

December 31, 2014

and


, we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of $

8.8 million

and $

10.8 million

, respectively.  Of these amounts $

2.4 million

and $

2.9 million

, respectively, relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us.  Given the evolving nature of environmental laws, regulations and technology, the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain.

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks below, together with all the other information included in this Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our ordinary shares. If any of the risks below actually occurs, our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Any such adverse effect may cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline, and as a result, you could lose all or part of your investment in us. Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not known to us or risks that we currently believe to be immaterial.

Risks Related to Our Business

Our global operations subject us to economic risks.

We are incorporated in Ireland and operate in countries worldwide. Our global operations depend on products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in Europe, China, Australia, Mexico, Venezuela and Turkey. Accordingly, we are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally, including:

•

changes in laws and regulations or imposition of currency restrictions and other restraints in various jurisdictions;

•

limitation of ownership rights, including expropriation of assets by a local government, and limitation on the ability to repatriate earnings;

•

sovereign debt crises and currency instability in developed and developing countries;

•

imposition of burdensome tariffs and quotas;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing global operations;

•

difficulty in enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through non-U.S. legal systems;

•

national and international conflict, including war, civil disturbances and terrorist acts; and

•

economic downturns and social and political instability.

These risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally, increase our counterparty risk, disrupt our operations, disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations and limit our ability to sell products in certain markets.

Our business relies on the commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets.

We primarily rely on the commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets, which are marked by cyclicality based on overall economic conditions. Weakness or instability in these markets may cause current and potential customers to delay or choose not to make purchases, which could negatively impact the demand for our products and services.

We operate in highly competitive markets.

The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants, including multi-national companies, regional companies and small local companies.  We primarily compete on the basis of quality, innovation, expertise, breadth of product offering and price.  We may be unable to effectively compete on all these bases.  If we are unable to anticipate evolving trends in the market or the timing and scale of our competitors’ activities and initiatives, the demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted.

In addition, we compete in a market that is experiencing the convergence of the mechanical and electronic products.  This may lead to increased competition, including with companies with greater financial and other resources than we have.  To remain competitive, we must develop new products and respond to new technologies in a timely manner.



Our growth is dependent, in part, on the development, commercialization and acceptance of new products and services.

We must develop and commercialize new products and services in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business. We cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, if ever, or, if commercialized, will result in returns greater than our investment. Investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market. We also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market.

Changes in customer preferences and the inability to maintain beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business.

We have significant customers, particularly major retailers, although no one customer represented more than 10% of combined net sales in the past three fiscal years. The loss or material reduction of business, the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for our products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, major customers who are volume purchasers are much larger than us and have strong bargaining power with suppliers. This limits our ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices. Furthermore, unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales.

Our brands are important assets of our businesses and violation of our trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation.

Our brands and trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position. Unauthorized use of our trademarks may not only erode sales of our products, but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation, interfere with relationships with our customers and increase litigation costs. There can be no assurance that our on-going effort to protect our brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations.

Currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.”

Approximately 37% of our 2014 net revenues were derived outside the U.S., and we expect sales to non-U.S. customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues. Although we may enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations, changes in the relative fair values of currencies occur from time to time and may, in some instances, have a material impact on our results of operations. Because we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure, our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations.

We also translate assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies into U.S. dollars for our combined and consolidated financial statements based on applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies will have a material impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency.

Our business strategy includes making acquisitions and investments that complement our existing business. These acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.

We will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of products and services offerings. We cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future, nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful.

Acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and expenses. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including:

•

diversion of management time and attention from daily operations;

•

difficulties integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business;

•

difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business information of acquired businesses;

•

inability to obtain regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms;



•

potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of us;

•

assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and

•

dilution of interests of holders of our ordinary shares through the issuance of equity securities or equity-linked securities.

We may also expand through acquisitions or investments into international markets in which we may have limited experience or are required to rely on business partners. In addition to the risks outlined above, expansion into international markets may require us to compete with local businesses with greater knowledge of the market, including the tastes and preferences of customers, and businesses with dominant market shares.

It may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly, integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations or effectively compete in new markets we enter. Any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition, as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges.

Our operational excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect.

We utilize a number of tools to improve operational efficiency and productivity. Implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and there is no assurance that all of our planned operational excellence projects will be fully implemented, or if implemented will realize the expected improvements.

Our EMEIA restructuring plans may not be successful.

We have implemented a plan to restructure our EMEIA segment to improve efficiencies and regional cost structure.  If we are unable to successfully implement our restructuring plan, we may not be able to improve profitability or effectively compete in the region.  In addition, our restructuring plans could result in significant restructuring charges and impairment charges.

Material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our business.

We are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business. Our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies (including, without limitation, environmental matters) that cannot be predicted with certainty. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments.

Allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us.

We may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by third parties. In particular, we often compete in areas having extensive intellectual property rights owned by others and we have become subject to claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others. In general, if it is determined that one or more of our technologies, products or services infringes the intellectual property rights owned by others, we may be required to cease marketing those services, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost or to take other actions to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights. The litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties, and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position. Adverse intellectual property litigation or claims of infringement against us may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.

We are subject to regulation under a variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies including laws related to anti-corruption, export and import compliance, anti-trust and money laundering, due to our global operations. We cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees, agents and business partners. Any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties, material fines, equitable remedies (including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct), securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence.



We may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.

We rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business. If these systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits, our ability to manage our operations could be impaired.

We currently rely on a single vendor for many of the critical elements of our global information technology infrastructure and its failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results.

We have outsourced many of the critical elements of our global information technology infrastructure to a third-party service provider in order to achieve efficiencies. If the service provider does not perform or does not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service provider. Depending on the function involved, such non-performance, ineffective performance or failures of service may lead to business disruptions, processing inefficiencies or security breaches.

Our information technology infrastructure is important to our business and data security breaches or disruptions of such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results.

Our information technology infrastructure is subject to cyber-attacks and unauthorized security intrusions. Despite instituting security policies and business continuity plans, our systems and networks may be vulnerable to system damage, malicious attacks from hackers, employee errors or misconduct, viruses, power and utility outages, and other catastrophic events that could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations, compromising the security of our proprietary information and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation.

Commodity shortages and price increases could negatively affect our financial results.

We rely on suppliers to secure commodities, including steel, zinc, brass and other non-ferrous metals, required for the manufacture of our products. A disruption of deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our business.

Volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services, and we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers. We do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility, however, we utilize firm purchase commitments to mitigate risk. The pricing of some commodities we use is based on market prices.  To mitigate this exposure, we may use annual and multi-year fixed price contracts to minimize the impact of inflation and to benefit from deflation.

We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets.

At December 31, 2014, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled approximately $506 million and $10.1 million, respectively. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), we periodically assess these assets to determine whether they are impaired. Negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected changes or planned changes in use of assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairment charges.

Successful sales and marketing efforts depend on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees.

Our ability to successfully grow our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives, our sales force and other personnel, including the ability of our sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage. We must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management, sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth. A shortage of these key employees might jeopardize our ability to grow and expand our business.

Our operations are subject to regulatory risks.

Our U.S. and non-U.S. operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including fire and building codes and standards, environmental and health and safety. We have incurred, and will be required to continue to incur, significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. Changes to, or changes in interpretations of, current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures, cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services. Altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply



with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments, increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services.

We may not have been, or we may not at all times be, in full compliance with these laws and regulations. In the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not or have not at all times been in full compliance with these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned.

Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property or operators of manufacturing facilities for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigative, removal and remedial costs under certain U.S. federal and state laws and certain non-U.S. laws are retroactive, strict and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notification from U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies, including the EPA and similar state environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of current and formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup and other possible remedial action. These agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites, including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims from such sites. For more information, see “Business - Environmental Regulation.”

While we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and have accrued for costs related to current remedial efforts, our costs of compliance, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances may exceed our estimates. We may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past, present or future business activities.

The capital and credit markets are important to our business.

Instability in U.S. and global capital and credit markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate volatility, or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent ratings agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements. In particular, if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us, we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy.

Our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets. Limitations on the ability of customers, suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers, limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers.

We may not be able to sustain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate.

We cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in future years, because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the geographic mix of income and the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate. Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate.

Our operations in Venezuela expose us to several risks.

Venezuela is currently experiencing significant political and civil unrest and economic instability, and in February 2013 the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and the official exchange rate changed from 4.3 to 6.3 Venezuelan bolivars per U.S. dollar.  We recognized a $6.2 million realized foreign currency loss related to the devaluation in the first quarter of 2013. In March 2014, the Venezuelan government launched a SICAD II rate to provide a greater supply of U.S. dollars from sources other than the Venezuelan government. All companies located or domiciled in Venezuela may bid for USD for any purpose. The SICAD II exchange rate was approximately 50 bolivars per U.S. dollar on December 31, 2014.

Given accelerated deterioration in economic conditions driven by a significant drop in the price of oil and no expectation of improvement for the foreseeable future, we concluded that the SICAD II exchange rate was the most appropriate rate at which to value bolivar denominated assets and liabilities. As a result, on December 31, 2014, we moved the exchange rate applied to bolivars from the official rate to the SICAD II rate. We recorded a charge of $45.4 million (before tax and non-controlling interest), or $0.28 per diluted share. The charge includes remeasurement of net monetary assets ($12.1 million) and a non-cash impairment



charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances ($33.3 million). After these charges, we had $4.6 million of bolivar-denominated net monetary assets and $8.9 million of inventory in Venezuela as of December 31, 2014.

On February 9, 2015, the Venezuelan government announced changes to its exchange rate system that included the launch of a new, market-based system called the Marginal Currency System, or “Simadi,” that will replace the SICAD II rate.  The Company is currently evaluating this announcement.   Adoption of the Simadi rate would result in additional charges to remeasure the net monetary assets and impair other assets.

This current state of affairs could lead to further devaluation of Venezuela's currency, volatility of exchange rates, and disruption of the economy. If the current unrest and instability continues, our ability to acquire necessary goods from suppliers could be limited, our customers may not be able to fulfill their obligations, our ability to manufacture and sell products could be disrupted and our Venezuelan operations could be adversely affected.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

Our substantial leverage could harm our business by limiting our available cash and our access to additional capital and, to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness, exposing us to interest rate risk.

We have approximately $1.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2014. In addition, we have a senior secured revolving credit facility permitting borrowings of up to $500 million. Further volatility in the credit markets would adversely impact our ability to obtain favorable terms on financing in the future. In addition, a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures, payment of dividends, share repurchase programs and future business opportunities. We may be more vulnerable than a less leveraged company to a downturn in the general economic conditions or in our business, or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth. We may be vulnerable to interest rate increases, as certain of our borrowings, including those under our senior secured credit facilities, are at variable rates.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which actions may not be successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness. For more information see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends, sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes contain customary financial covenants that may restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices we believe are fair, and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.

Despite our levels of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes contain customary restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, our senior secured revolving credit facility permits borrowings of up to $500 million. If we incur additional debt above the levels we currently have, the risks associated with our leverage, including those described above, would increase.



The terms of our debt covenants could limit how we conduct our business and our ability to raise additional funds.

The terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes  restrict us from taking certain actions that we may think are in the best interests of our shareholders. A breach of the covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:

•

limited in how we conduct our business;

•

limited in our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to our shareholders;

•

unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or

•

unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.

These restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our plans.

These covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business, and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including general economic and credit conditions and industry downturns, and the other factors described in these “risk factors.”

Our variable rate indebtedness may expose us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt costs to increase significantly.

A portion of our borrowings at December 31, 2014 is a term loan with a variable rate of interest which exposes us to interest rate risk. We are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with short-term or variable-rate borrowings. At December 31, 2014, we have approximately $1.3 billion of aggregate debt outstanding, and this amount includes $963 million of floating-rate term loans and $300 million of our fixed-rate senior notes. We have the ability to incur up to $500 million of additional floating-rate debt under our senior secured revolving credit facility. A 100 basis point increase in LIBOR would have resulted in incremental 2014 interest expense of approximately $7.0 million, excluding the impact of our forward starting interest rate swaps. In June 2014, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps for

$300.0 million

of our floating-rate term loans. Swaps with notional amounts totaling

$275.0 million

become effective in January 2015 and expire in September 2017 and swaps with notional amounts totaling

$25.0 million

become effective in January 2015 and expire in December 2016. If the LIBOR or other applicable base rates under our senior secured credit facilities increase in the future then the floating-rate debt could have a material effect on our interest expense.

Risks Relating to the Spin-off

We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from our spin-off from Ingersoll Rand.

As an independent, publicly-traded company, we believe that our business will benefit from, among other things, allowing us to better focus our financial and operational resources on our specific business, allowing our Board of Directors and management to design and implement corporate strategies and policies that are based primarily on the characteristics of our business, allowing us to more effectively respond to industry dynamics and allowing the creation of effective incentives for our management and employees that are more closely tied to our business performance. However, we may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all.

We may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent company, and we may experience increased costs.

Prior to 2014, we operated as part of Ingersoll Rand’s corporate organization, and Ingersoll Rand has assisted us by providing certain corporate functions. Ingersoll Rand is obligated contractually to provide to us only those transition services specified in agreements we entered into with Ingersoll Rand. We may be unable to replace in a timely manner or on comparable terms the services or other benefits that Ingersoll Rand previously provided to us that are not specified in any transition services agreement. Upon expiration of any transition services agreement, each of the services that are covered in the agreement will have to be provided internally or by third parties and we may be unable to replace those services in a timely manner or on comparable terms. In addition, if Ingersoll Rand does not continue to perform transition services and the other services that are called for under any transition services agreement, we may not be able to operate our business as effectively.



Our historical combined financial data are not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.

The historical data prior to our spin-off from Ingersoll Rand presented herein may not reflect what our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would have been had we been an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented or what our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be in the future as an independent company. This is primarily because:

•

Ingersoll Rand, or one of its affiliates, performed significant corporate functions for us, including tax and treasury administration and certain governance functions, including internal audit and external reporting. Our historical statements reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Ingersoll Rand for these functions and may not reflect the costs we will incur for similar services as an independent company. Furthermore, we are responsible for the additional costs associated with being an independent, publicly-traded company, including costs related to corporate governance and external reporting.

•

Our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, historically had been satisfied as part of the company-wide cash management practices of Ingersoll Rand. While our businesses have historically generated sufficient cash to finance our working capital and other cash requirements, we no longer have access to Ingersoll Rand’s cash pool. Without the opportunity to obtain financing from Ingersoll Rand, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements.

•

Other significant changes may occur in cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of our operating as a company separate from Ingersoll Rand.

We may have been able to receive better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our agreements related to the spin-off.

The agreements related to the spin-off, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, agreements with respect to real estate and intellectual property matters and any other agreements, were negotiated in the context of the Spin-off from Ingersoll Rand while we were still part of Ingersoll Rand. Accordingly, these agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm’s-length negotiations among unaffiliated third parties. The terms of the agreements in the context of the Spin-off are related to, among other things, allocations of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations among Ingersoll Rand and us. We might have received better terms under the agreements relating to the Spin-off had they been negotiated with disinterested third parties who competed with each other to win our business than we received from Ingersoll Rand.

In connection with the Spin-off, Ingersoll Rand indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified Ingersoll Rand for certain liabilities. If we are required to act on these indemnities to Ingersoll Rand, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted. The Ingersoll Rand indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility, and Ingersoll Rand may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.

Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement with Ingersoll Rand, Ingersoll Rand agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Ingersoll Rand for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Such indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Spin-off. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Ingersoll Rand retained. Further, the indemnity from Ingersoll Rand may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and Ingersoll Rand may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Ingersoll Rand any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.

If the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and/or Ingersoll Rand could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify Ingersoll Rand for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement.

Ingersoll Rand has received an IRS ruling substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of our ordinary shares, together with certain related transactions, qualify under Sections 355 and 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code ("the Code"), with the result that Ingersoll Rand and Ingersoll Rand’s shareholders will not recognize any taxable income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Spin-off, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares (the "IRS



Ruling"). The IRS Ruling also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution qualify for favorable treatment under the Code. In addition to obtaining the IRS Ruling, Ingersoll Rand received opinions from the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP substantially to the effect that certain requirements, including certain requirements that the IRS did not rule on, necessary to obtain tax-free treatment have been satisfied, such that the distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes and certain other matters relating to the distribution, including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution, received tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code.  The receipt and effectiveness of the IRS Ruling and the opinions were conditions to the distribution that were satisfied or waived by Ingersoll Rand. The IRS Ruling and the opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and Ingersoll Rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in shares or asset ownership after the distribution. A legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion. In addition, the opinion will be based on current law, and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect. If the distribution is determined to be taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and our shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, we or Ingersoll Rand could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable.

In addition, under the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us or Ingersoll Rand, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or Ingersoll Rand as a result thereof. If such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us or Ingersoll Rand, then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or Ingersoll Rand as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant.

In addition, the amount of our shares that we can issue may be limited because the issuance of our shares may cause the distribution to be a taxable event for Ingersoll Rand under Section 355(e) of the Code, and under the Tax Matters Agreement, we could be required to indemnify Ingersoll Rand for that tax.

We might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the distribution because of restrictions relating to U.S. federal income tax requirements for tax-free distributions.

Our ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted after the distribution in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the distribution by Ingersoll Rand. Even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code, it may result in a corporate-level taxable gain to Ingersoll Rand and certain of its affiliates under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of our shares or Ingersoll Rand’s shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. Any acquisitions or issuances of our shares or Ingersoll Rand’s shares within two years after the distribution will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or Ingersoll Rand may be able to rebut that presumption.

To preserve the tax-free treatment to Ingersoll Rand of the distribution, under the Tax Matters Agreement, we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being tax-free. Further, for the two-year period following the distribution, without obtaining the consent of Ingersoll Rand, a private letter ruling from the IRS or an unqualified opinion from a nationally recognized law firm or accounting firm, we are prohibited from, among other things:

•

approving or allowing any transaction that results in a change in ownership of more than 50% of our ordinary shares when combined with any other changes in ownership of our shares,

•

redeeming or repurchasing certain amounts of equity securities,

•

selling or otherwise disposing of substantially all of our assets, or

•

engaging in certain internal transactions.

These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. Moreover, the Tax Matters Agreement provides that we are responsible for any taxes imposed on Ingersoll Rand or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the distribution or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the Code unless such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the distribution by Ingersoll Rand.

In February 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our ordinary shares. Due to these restrictions, we may not engage in privately negotiated transactions or acquire more than 20% of our outstanding shares within



two years after the Distribution. We believe that we will be able to execute the authorized share repurchases and preserve the tax-free treatment of the distribution. However, if we are unable to preserve the tax-free treatment, any taxes imposed on us could be significant.

If the distribution is determined to be taxable for Irish tax purposes, significant Irish tax liabilities may arise.

Ingersoll Rand has received an opinion of the Irish Revenue regarding the Irish tax consequences of the distribution to the effect that certain reliefs and exemptions for corporate reorganizations apply. In addition to obtaining the opinion from Irish Revenue, Ingersoll Rand received an opinion from the law firm of Arthur Cox confirming the applicability of the relevant exemptions and reliefs to the distribution and that certain internal transactions will not trigger tax costs. These opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and Ingersoll Rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the opinions, Irish Revenue could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions do not qualify for the relevant exemptions or reliefs if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated. A legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment, is not binding on Irish Revenue or the courts and Irish Revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion. In addition, the legal opinion was based on current law, and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect. If the distribution ultimately is determined not to fall within certain exemptions or reliefs, the distribution could result in our shareholders having an Irish tax liability as a result of the distribution (if a shareholder is an Irish resident or holds shares in Ingersoll Rand in an Irish branch or agency), or we or Ingersoll Rand could incur Irish tax liabilities.

In addition, under the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, in the event the distribution does not qualify for certain reliefs or exemptions, then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or Ingersoll Rand as a result of such determination.  Such tax amounts could be significant.

Risks Related to Our Incorporation in Ireland

Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

The United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As such, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on U.S. federal or state civil liability laws, including the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.

As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.

In addition, Irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval. Also, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash. However, we have opted out of these preemption rights in our Articles of Association as permitted under Irish company law. Irish law provides that this opt-out expires after five years unless renewed by a special resolution of the shareholders. These authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved.

Changes in tax laws, regulations or treaties, changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results, as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes.

The realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in Ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions. From time to time, proposals have been made and/or legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden and/or effective tax rate. For instance, recent U.S. legislative proposals could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments, which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position. Moreover, other U.S. legislative proposals could have



a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our U.S. subsidiaries to our non-U.S. affiliates, which could increase our tax liability. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction.

While we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden and/or effective tax rate and investigate our options, we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted, certain tax treaties are amended and/or our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect. In particular, any changes and/or differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in Ireland, limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions, modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments, or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country, could subject us to increased taxation.

Dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax.

In certain circumstances, we are required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at the rate of 20%) from dividends paid to our shareholders. In the majority of cases, shareholders resident in the United States will not be subject to Irish withholding tax, and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to Irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain Irish dividend withholding tax forms. However, some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax, which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact on the price of our shares.

Dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to Irish income tax.

Dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to Irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from Irish dividend withholding tax, unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Allegion.

Our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Allegion.

Certain provisions in our Articles of Association, among other things, could prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares.

Our Memorandum and Articles of Association contain provisions to deter takeover practices, inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers. These provisions include, amongst others:

•

a provision of our Articles of Association which generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder (being (i) the beneficial owner of the relevant percentage of our voting shares or (ii) an affiliate or associate of us that has at any time within the last five years been the beneficial owner of the relevant percentage of our voting shares), subject to certain exceptions;

•

rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;

•

the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval in certain circumstances, subject to applicable law; and

•

the ability of our Board of Directors to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors in certain circumstances.

We believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is in our best interests and our shareholders' best interests. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.

In addition, several mandatory provisions of Irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us. For example, Irish law does not permit shareholders of an Irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent. We also will be subject to various provisions of Irish law relating to mandatory bids, voluntary bids, requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements, as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances. Also, Irish companies, including us, may alter their Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association only with the approval of at least 75% of the votes of the company’s shareholders cast in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company.



The agreements that we entered into with Ingersoll Rand in connection with the spin-off generally require Ingersoll Rand’s consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements. The consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may consider favorable.

Moreover, an acquisition or further issuance of our ordinary shares after the spin-off could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code, even if the distribution and certain related transactions undertaken in connection therewith otherwise qualify for tax-free treatment. Under Section 355(e) of the Code, we and/or Ingersoll Rand could incur tax upon certain transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution if 50% or more, by vote or value, of our ordinary shares or Ingersoll Rand ordinary shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spin-off. The process for determining whether an acquisition or issuance triggering these provisions has occurred is complex, inherently factual and subject to interpretation. Any acquisitions or issuances of our ordinary shares or Ingersoll Rand ordinary shares within two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or Ingersoll Rand, as applicable, may be able to rebut that presumption. Moreover, under the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with Ingersoll Rand, we are restricted from engaging in certain transactions within two years of the distribution which potentially could trigger application of Section 355(e) of the Code. During such period, these restrictions may limit the ability that we, or a potential acquirer of Allegion, have to pursue certain strategic transactions that might increase the value of our ordinary shares.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the normal course of business, we are involved in a variety of lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings, including commercial and contract disputes, employment matters, product liability claims, environmental liabilities, intellectual property disputes, and tax-related matters. In our opinion, pending legal matters are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND

ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Information regarding the principal market for our ordinary shares and related shareholder matters is as follows:

Our ordinary shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol ALLE. As of

February 24, 2015

, the number of record holders of ordinary shares was

3,647

. The high and low sales price per share and the dividend declared per share for the following periods were as follows:

Information regarding equity compensation plans required to be disclosed pursuant to this Item is incorporated by reference from our Proxy Statement.

Dividend Policy

Our Board of Directors paid dividends of $0.08 per ordinary share on March 31, 2014, June 30, 2014, September 30, 2014 and December 30, 2014. We paid a total of $30.0 million in cash for dividends to ordinary shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2014. Our Board of Directors did not declare any dividends in 2013. Future dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, as well as our ability to pay dividends in compliance with the Irish Companies Act. Under the Irish Companies Act, dividends and distributions may only be made from distributable reserves. Distributable reserves, broadly, means the accumulated realized profits of Allegion plc (ALLE-Ireland). In addition, no distribution or dividend may be made unless the net assets of ALLE-Ireland are equal to, or in excess of, the aggregate of ALLE-Ireland’s called up share capital plus undistributable reserves and the distribution does not reduce ALLE-Ireland’s net assets below such aggregate.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

We did not repurchase any of our ordinary shares during the fourth quarter of


. In February 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our ordinary shares. We paid a total of $50.3 million to repurchase 1.0 million ordinary shares during the year ended December 31, 2014.

To preserve the tax-free treatment to Ingersoll Rand of the Spin-off, under the Tax Matters Agreement, we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the Spin-off and related transactions from being tax-free. We may not engage in privately negotiated transactions or acquire more than 20% of our outstanding shares within two years after the Spin-off. We believe that we will be able to execute the authorized share repurchases and preserve the tax-free treatment of the Spin-off. However, if we are unable to preserve the tax-free treatment, any taxes imposed on us could be significant.

Performance Graph

The annual changes for the period shown November 18, 2013 (when our ordinary shares began trading in the "when-issued" market) to December 31, 2014 in the graph on this page are based on the assumption that $100 had been invested in Allegion plc ordinary shares, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index ("S&P 500") and the Standard & Poor's 400 Capital Goods Index ("S&P



400 Capital Goods") on November 18, 2013, and that all quarterly dividends were reinvested. The total cumulative dollar returns shown on the graph represent the value that such investments would have had on December 31, 2014.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our combined and consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Overview

Organization

We are a leading global provider of security products and solutions operating in three geographic regions: Americas; EMEIA; and Asia Pacific. We sell a wide range of security products and solutions for end-users in commercial, institutional and residential markets worldwide, including into the education, healthcare, government, commercial office and single and multi-family residential markets. Our strategic brands include Schlage, Von Duprin, LCN, CISA, and Interflex.

Trends and Economic Events

Current market conditions, including challenges in international markets, continue to impact our financial results. Uneven global commercial new construction activity is negatively impacting our results, however U.S. residential and consumer markets have begun to improve, and we are seeing improvements in the U.S. new builder and replacement markets.

Based on information derived from third party sources, we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was more than $30 billion in revenue in 2014, comprised of $25 billion for mechanical hardware products and more than $5 billion for time, attendance, and workforce productivity systems and systems integration. We believe that the security products industry will benefit from several global macroeconomic and long-term demographic trends, which include heightened awareness of security requirements, increased global urbanization and the shift to a digital, interconnected environment. In the more established economies of North America and Europe, where the security product industry’s compound annual growth rate was 1 to 2% per year during the uneven economic conditions experienced over the past three years, we believe our markets are poised for a cyclical recovery driven in part by accelerating growth in the underlying commercial and residential construction markets and improved consumer confidence in the United States offsetting currency headwinds overseas. Additionally, we expect growth in the global electronic product categories we serve to continue to outperform the industry as end-users adopt newer technologies in their facilities.

The economic conditions discussed above and a number of other challenges and uncertainties that could affect our business are described under “Risk Factors.”

2014 Significant Events

Venezuela currency devaluation

Venezuela is treated as a highly inflationary economy under GAAP. As a result, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our consolidated joint venture in Venezuela. Any currency remeasurement adjustments for non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings.

The Venezuelan government’s official exchange rate is currently 6.3 Venezuelan bolivars per U.S. dollar. The Venezuelan government re-instituted a secondary exchange rate (SICAD I rate) for select goods and services. The SICAD I rate was 12 bolivars per U.S. Dollar at December 31, 2014. In March 2014, the Venezuelan government launched a SICAD II rate to provide a greater supply of USD from sources other than the Venezuelan government. All companies located or domiciled in Venezuela may bid for USD for any purpose. The SICAD II exchange rate was approximately 50 bolivars per U.S. dollar on December 31, 2014.

Given accelerated deterioration in economic conditions driven by a significant drop in the price of oil and no expectation of improvement for the foreseeable future, we concluded that the SICAD II exchange rate was the most appropriate rate at which to value bolivar denominated assets and liabilities. As a result, on December 31, 2014, we moved the exchange rate applied to bolivars from the official rate to the SICAD II rate. We recorded a charge of $45.4 million (before tax and non-controlling interest), or $0.28 per diluted share. The charge includes remeasurement of net monetary assets ($12.1 million) and a non-cash impairment



charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances ($33.3 million). Had the SICAD II rate been applied throughout all of 2014, we estimate it would have reduced full-year revenues and EPS by approximately $95 million and $0.11 per share, respectively. After these charges, we had $4.6 million of bolivar-denominated net monetary assets and $8.9 million of inventory in Venezuela as of December 31, 2014.

On February 9, 2015, the Venezuelan government announced changes to its exchange rate system that included the launch of a new, market-based system called the Marginal Currency System, or “Simadi,” that will replace the SICAD II rate.  The Company is currently evaluating this announcement. Adoption of the Simadi rate would result in additional charges to remeasure the net monetary assets and impair other assets.

Inventory accounting methodology

In the fourth quarter of 2014 we elected to change our method of accounting for certain inventory from the last-in-first-out (LIFO)method to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method and now all inventory is accounted for using the FIFO method. We applied this change in method of inventory accounting by retrospectively adjusting the prior period financial statements. Further details about the impact of this change are discussed in Note 2 to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Acquisitions

In January 2014, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Schlage Lock de Colombia S.A., the second largest mechanical lock manufacturer in Colombia. In April 2014, we completed the acquisition of Fire & Security Hardware Pty Limited (FSH), an electromechanical locking provider in Australia. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was approximately $23.0 million.

2014 Dividends

We paid quarterly dividends of $0.08 per ordinary share to shareholders on March, 31, 2014, June 30, 2014, September 30, 2014, and December 30, 2014. We paid a total of $30.0 million in cash for dividends to ordinary shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2014.

Spin-off related charges

For the year ended December 31, 2014 we incurred $28.6 million of separation costs associated with the spin-off from Ingersoll Rand, of which $28.2 million was recognized in Selling and administrative expenses in our results of operations and $0.4 million was recognized in Cost of goods sold. Separation costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily include professional and consulting fees, system implementation costs and relocation and other personnel related costs. We do not expect separation costs incurred in 2015 to be material.  The components of separation costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2014 are presented below (in millions):

Restructuring charges

In the second quarter of 2014 management committed to a plan to restructure our EMEIA segment to improve efficiencies and regional cost structure. In conjunction with this plan, we incurred severance and other restructuring charges of $6.1 million and other charges of

$0.4 million

for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Joint venture order flow change

Previously, our consolidated joint venture in Asia acted as a pass-through to the end customer. Beginning in 2013, the consolidated joint venture no longer recognizes the revenue and cost of goods sold on these products because of a revised joint venture operating agreement. Products are shipped direct to the end customer with the joint venture receiving a royalty in an amount that approximates the lost margin. We recognized revenue of approximately $52.0 million related to this business in our Americas segment for the



year ended December 31, 2013. The change did not have a material impact on operating income or on cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Discontinued operations

In the second quarter of 2014 management committed to a plan to sell its United Kingdom (UK) Door businesses to an unrelated third party. The transaction closed in the third quarter of 2014. The businesses sold included the Dor-o-Matic branded automatic door business, the Martin Roberts branded performance steel doorset business and the UK service organization. Historical results of the component have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. In conjunction with the sale, we recorded a $7.6 million charge to write the carrying value of the assets sold down to their selling value.



Results of Operations - For the years ended December 31

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2014

increased by

2.4%

($

48.7 million

) compared to the same period in


due to the following:

The increase in net revenues was primarily driven by improved pricing, higher volumes, the acquisition of the Schlage de Colombia assets in January 2014 and the acquisition of FSH in April 2014. The pricing improvements were primarily driven by our consolidated joint venture in Venezuela and were largely offset by material inflation and other inflation in Venezuela. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the change in order flow through our consolidated joint venture in Asia discussed above.



Net revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2013

increased by

2.3%

($

46.3 million

) compared to the same period in


, due to the following:

The increase in net revenues was primarily driven by improved pricing across all segments as well as increased volumes in the Americas segment due to stronger demand in both the commercial and residential markets as well as new products, particularly from our electronics portfolio. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts, lower volume in EMEIA due to weak markets and the impact of the change in order flow through our consolidated joint venture in Asia discussed above.

Cost of Goods Sold

For the year ended

December 31, 2014

, cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased to

59.7%

from

58.4%

. Costs of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to a $33.3 million non-cash inventory impairment charge related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar (1.6%) discussed above, unfavorable channel/region mix offset by volume (0.3%) and increased investments/other items (0.2%). These increases were partially offset by productivity benefits and pricing improvements in excess of inflation (0.6%) and the impact of foreign currency movements (0.2%).

For the year ended

December 31, 2013

, cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue decreased to

58.4%

from

59.2%

. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 was favorably impacted by a $21.5 million gain on a property sale in China (1.1%) as well as productivity benefits and other items in excess of inflation (0.2%), partially offset by unfavorable channel/region mix (0.5%).

Selling and Administrative Expenses

For the year ended

December 31, 2014

, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to

24.9%

from

23.3%

. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was negatively impacted by increased restructuring charges (0.2%), separation costs incurred in connection with the Spin-off (1.2%) increased investments (1.0%), the impact of the change in the order flow through our consolidated joint venture in Asia discussed above (0.8%) and other inflation in excess of productivity (0.3%). These increases were partially offset by favorable volume leverage (0.9%).

For the year ended

December 31, 2013

, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to

23.3%

from

22.5%

. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 was negatively impacted by a $3.2 million increase in restructuring charges and non-recurring separation costs incurred in connection with the Spin-off (0.1%), inflation in excess of productivity benefits and other items (0.3%) and increased investment spending (0.4%).

Operating Income/Margin

Operating income for the year ended

December 31, 2014

increased

$85.5 million

from the same period in  2013. Operating income in the prior year included a $137.6 million goodwill impairment charge, as well as a $21.5 million gain on the sale of property in China. Neither of these items recurred in the current year. Operating income in the current year includes a $33.3 million non-cash inventory impairment related to the devaluation of the bolivar discussed above. The remaining increase in operating income was primarily due to pricing improvements and productivity in excess of inflation ($36.9 million) and increased volume ($17.1 million). These increases were partially offset by increased restructuring charges and non-recurring separation costs incurred in connection with the Spin-off ($24.8 million) and increased investments and other items ($26.5 million).

Operating margin for the year ended

December 31, 2014

increased to

15.4%

from

11.6%

for the same period in


. The increase was primarily due to the 2013 goodwill impairment charge discussed above (6.7%), pricing improvements and productivity in excess of inflation (1.5%), favorable volume/product mix (0.5%) and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements (0.1%). These increases were partially offset by the 2014 non-cash inventory impairment discussed above (1.6%),  increased non-recurring separation costs and restructuring charges (1.2%), incremental investment spending primarily associated with new product development and other items (1.4%) and the impact of the change in order flow through our consolidated joint venture in Asia and the 2013 gain on sale of a property in China discussed above (0.8%).



Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased $130.5 million from the same period in 2012. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a $137.6 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2013, increased investment spending ($12.4 million), unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements ($5.5 million) and increased restructuring charges and  non-recurring separation costs incurred in connection with the Spin-off  ($9.9 million). These decreases were partially offset by the gain on a property sale in China ($21.5 million), pricing improvements and productivity in excess of inflation ($9.9 million) and increased volume ($3.5 million).

Operating margin for the year ended

December 31, 2013

increased to

11.6%

from

18.4%

for the same period in


. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2013 was negatively impacted by a non-cash goodwill impairment charge (6.8%), incremental investment spending associated with new product development (0.6%), unfavorable product mix (0.5%) and restructuring charges and non-recurring separation costs (0.2%). These decreases were partially offset by the gain on a property sale in China (1.1%) and favorable volume leverage (0.2%).

Interest Expense

Interest expense for the year ended

December 31, 2014

increased $

43.6 million

compared to the same period in


as a result of the full year impact resulting from entering into $1,000 million Senior Secured Credit Facilities and issuing $300 million of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2013 in conjunction with the spin-off from Ingersoll Rand. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we incurred a non-cash charge of approximately $4.5 million for the write-off of unamortized Term Loan B Facility debt issuance costs.

Interest expense for the year ended

December 31, 2013

increased $

8.7 million

compared with the same period of


due to the issuance of debt in the fourth quarter of 2013 in conjunction with the spin-off from Ingersoll Rand.

Other expense, net

The components of Other expense, net, for the year ended

December 31

are as follows:

For the year ended

December 31, 2014

, Other expense, net decreased by $

2.6 million

compared to the same period in


. As discussed above, in the fourth quarter of 2014 we recorded a $12.1 million loss related to write down our Venezuelan bolivar-denominated net monetary assets. This loss is reflected as Exchange loss in the table above. In the prior year, we recorded a $6.2 million loss resulting from the official devaluation of the bolivar from 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar to 6.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar. The remaining decrease in Other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to other foreign currency gains in 2014.

For the year ended

December 31, 2013

, Other expense, net decreased by $3.9 million compared with the same period in


primarily from unfavorable foreign currency impacts.

Provision for Income Taxes

For the year ended

December 31, 2014

, our effective tax rate of

31.4%

compared to

78.3%

for the year ended

December 31, 2013

.  The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 included the impact of a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $137.6 million ($131.2 million after-tax). Additionally, the effective tax rate included $44.8 million of discrete tax adjustments consisting of $31.5 million of expense related to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets that are no longer expected to be utilized and $13.3 million of net tax expense resulting primarily from transactions occurring to effect the Spin-off. Excluding these items, the effective tax rate was 37.8%. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of pre-tax income earned in lower rate jurisdictions as well as favorable discrete tax benefits.

Our 2013 tax rate was above the U.S. statutory rate of

35.0%

primarily due to U.S. state and local taxes and net increases in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits partially offset by earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which, in aggregate, had a lower effective rate.



For periods prior to the Spin-off, income tax expense was recorded as if we filed tax returns on a stand-alone basis. This separate return methodology applied the accounting guidance for income taxes to the stand-alone financial statements as if we were a stand-alone enterprise for the periods prior to the Spin-off using statutory rates. These rates did not contemplate certain tax strategies that could lower the effective tax rate in future periods, if executed.

Discontinued Operations

EMEIA Divestiture

As discussed above, in 2014 we sold our UK Door businesses to an unrelated third party. Historical results of the component have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. In conjunction with the sale, we recorded a $7.6 million charge to write the carrying value of the assets sold down to their selling value.

Net revenues and after-tax earnings of the component for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

, respectively. These losses were mainly related to lease expense and other miscellaneous expenses from previously sold businesses.

Review of Business Segments

We operate in and report financial results for three segments: Americas, EMEIA, and Asia Pacific. These segments represent the level at which our chief operating decision maker reviews company financial performance and makes operating decisions.

Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation, performance reviews, and compensation. For these reasons, we believe that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss. Our chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains, such as corporate charges and other special charges, from Operating income to arrive at a Segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions. We define Segment operating margin as Segment operating income as a percentage of Net revenues.

The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations. Effective January 1, 2013, we transferred a product line from our Asia Pacific segment to our Americas segment. This transfer is reflected in the historical segment results for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013.

Americas

Our Americas segment is a leading provider of security products and solutions in approximately 30 countries throughout North America and parts of South America. The segment sells a broad range of products and solutions including, locks, locksets, key systems, door closers, exit devices, doors and door frames, electronic product and access control systems to end-users in commercial, institutional and residential facilities, including into the education, healthcare, government, commercial office and single and multi-family residential markets. This segment’s strategic brands are Schlage, Von Duprin and LCN.

Segment results for the years ended December 31 were as follows:



2014 vs 2013

Net revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2014

increased by

3.0%

($

45.3 million

) compared to the same period in


due to the following:

The increase in revenues was primarily due to increased residential and commercial volumes as well as new products, the acquisition the assets of of Schlage de Colombia in January 2014 and price increases in Venezuela. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and the impact of the change in order flow through our consolidated joint venture in Asia discussed above.

Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $4.8 million compared to the same period in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the $33.3 million non-cash inventory impairment charge related to the devaluation of the bolivar discussed above and increased investment spending, primarily for new product development ($13.1 million). These decreases were partially offset by pricing improvements and productivity in excess of inflation ($23.2 million), increased volume ($17.0 million) and favorable foreign currency movements and other items ($1.4 million).

Segment operating margin for the year ended

December 31, 2014

declined to

24.8%

from

) compared to the same period in


due to the following:

The increase in revenues was primarily due to increased volume due to stronger demand in both the commercial and residential markets as well as new products, particularly from our electronics portfolio and price increases in Venezuela. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and the impact of the change in order flow through our consolidated joint venture discussed above.

Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $14.1 million compared to the same period in 2012. This increase was primarily due to increased volume ($18.5 million) and pricing improvements and productivity in excess of inflation ($9.8 million). These increases were partially offset by increased investment and other spending ($7.6 million) and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements ($6.6 million).

Segment operating margin for the year ended

December 31, 2013

increased to

25.9%

from

25.7%

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $137.6 million, which has been excluded from these results.

Segment results for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

2014 vs 2013

Net revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2014

decreased by

2.0%

($

8.0 million

) compared to the same period in


due to the following:

The decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreased volumes due to economic weakness in certain markets as well as lower revenue as a result of managements' actions to exit unprofitable businesses. These decreases were partially offset by improved pricing and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements.

Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $5.2 million compared to the same period in 2013. The increase was primarily due to pricing improvements and productivity in excess of inflation ($14.4 million), and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and other items ($0.5 million).

increased by

7.4%

($

11.4 million

) compared to the same period in


, due to the following:

The increase in revenues was mainly due to favorable volume/product mix and revenue from the acquisition of FSH and improved pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts.

Segment operating income for the year ended decreased $23.1 million. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the $21.5 million gain on the sale of a property in China in 2013, a $1.9 million one-time benefit related to the closure of our Asia joint venture manufacturing facility in 2013, $2.0 million of non-recurring favorable items in 2013, a $2.5 million charge to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts in the second quarter of 2014, increased investment spending ($1.4 million), unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements ($0.7 million) and increased separation costs incurred in connection with the Spin-off ($0.7 million).

. The increase was primarily due to the $21.5 million gain in 2013 on sale of a property in China in 2013 (14.2%). This increase was partially offset by unfavorable volume/product mix (2.8%), a non-recurring favorable item in 2012 (1.9%) and increased investment spending (0.7%).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and uses of liquidity

Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities is used to invest in new product development, fund capital expenditures and fund working capital requirements and is expected to be adequate to service any future debt, pay any declared dividends and potentially fund acquisitions and share repurchases. Our ability to fund these capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash provided by operating activities, and to access our borrowing facilities (including unused availability under our Revolver) and capital markets. We believe that our future cash provided by operating activities, together with our access to funds on hand and capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs.

The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended December 31, respectively. For additional details, please see the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating activities

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $32.0 million compared to the same period  in the prior year. Operating cash flows for 2014 reflect higher earnings from continuing operations compared to the same period in the prior year as well as lower working capital.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased $45.3 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating cash flows for 2013 reflect lower earnings from continuing operations and an increase in working capital compared to the same period in the prior year.

Investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $16.1 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $51.5 million of capital expenditures, an increase of $31.3 million from the prior year, as we invested in information technology systems, new product



development and manufacturing plant investments to support our growth initiatives. In addition, we spent $25.2 million of cash for acquisitions primarily for the acquisition of certain assets of Schlage de Colombia in January 2014 and FSH in April 2014.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $1.2 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $20.2 million of capital expenditures, $40.2 million of cash classified as restricted as it is pledged as collateral against a short-term note payable and $41.7 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment primarily related to proceeds from the sale of property in China.

Financing activities

Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $142.4 million compared to the same period in the prior year. In the prior year, $1,300.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Credit facilities as well as additional cash generated throughout the year were distributed to Ingersoll Rand, net of debt issuance costs. In the current year, we made $37.2 million, net repayments on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and $40.8 million of repayments of other borrowings, we paid $30.0 million of dividends to our ordinary shareholders and we repurchased $50.3 million of our ordinary shares.

Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased $25.5 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Net transfers to Ingersoll Rand increased $1,286.7 million as the $1,300.0 million proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities were distributed to Ingersoll Rand, net of debt issuance costs.

Capitalization

Borrowings at December 31 consisted of the following:

The Term Loan A Facility due 2019 amortizes in quarterly installments at the following rates per year: 5% in 2015; 5% in 2016 and 10% in each year thereafter, with the final installment due on October 15, 2019. The Senior Notes are due in full on October 1, 2021.

At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the $500 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the "Revolver"). We had $28.5 million and $24.6 million of letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013, which reduce availability under the Revolver.

Included in the other short-term borrowings at December 31, 2013 is a $40.2 short-term note payable that was repaid in 2014. The $40.2 million of restricted cash presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013 was pledged as collateral for the short-term note payable.

We are required to comply with certain covenants under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. We are required to comply with a maximum leverage ratio of 4.00 (based on a ratio of total consolidated indebtedness, net of unrestricted cash up to $125 million, to consolidated EBITDA). The ratio declines to 3.75 to 1.00 in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, we are required to have a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 based on a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense, net of interest income. This ratio increases to 4.00 to 1.00 in the first quarter of 2015.

As of

December 31, 2014

, we were in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, the indenture to our Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability



to enter into certain transactions. For further details on these covenants, see Note 8 to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

The majority of our earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested in jurisdictions where we have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our global operations. Accordingly, applicable income taxes have not been accrued on the portion of our earnings that is considered to be permanently reinvested.  At

December 31, 2014

, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of

$290.5 million

. Approximately 55% of our cash and cash equivalents was located outside the U.S. Included in our cash and cash equivalents located outside the U.S. is approximately $50 million of cash in China, approximately 49% of which will be distributed to a joint venture partner in Asia when we receive regulatory approval for the distribution. We have provided for income taxes on the 51% of cash that we will retain. We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate any other funds located outside the U.S.; however, repatriation of these funds would expose us to additional taxes.

Pension Plans

Our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due. We seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status, contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities. Global asset allocation decisions are based on a dynamic approach whereby a plan's allocation to fixed income assets as the funded status increases. We monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance.

We monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis. In

December 31, 2014

, the funded status of our qualified pension plan for U.S. employees declined to 75.4% from 90.1% at

December 31, 2013

as a decline in discount rates and the adoption of revised mortality tables increased pension benefit obligations by approximately $60.1 million. The increase in benefit obligations was partially offset by $31.9 million of pension asset returns. The funded status for our non-U.S. pension plans increased to 95.8% at

December 31, 2014

from 84.8% at

December 31, 2013

. The increase in funded status for the non-U.S. was due to asset returns and employer contributions more than offset an increase in pension benefit obligations resulting from a decline in discount rates. Funded status for all of our pension plans at

December 31, 2014

increased to 87.1% from 86.8% at

December 31, 2013

. For further details on pension plan activity, see Note 10 to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods, in millions:

Future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, environmental and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above.

Pensions

At

December 31, 2014

, we had net obligations of

$86.1 million

, which consist of noncurrent pension assets of

$585.2 million

and current and non-current pension benefit liabilities of

$671.3 million

. It is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. We currently project that we will contribute approximately $5.0 million to our plans worldwide in


. Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 10 to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.



Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions

At

December 31, 2014

, we had postretirement benefit obligations of $

13.6 million

. We fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations. Benefit payments, which are net of expected plan participant contributions and Medicare Part D subsidy, are expected to be approximately

$1.0 million

in


. Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 10 to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Income Taxes

At

December 31, 2014

, we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of $

25.4 million

and $

6.2 million

of related accrued interest and penalties, net of tax. The liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. See Note 16 to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits and tax authority disputes.

Contingent Liabilities

We are involved in various litigations, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental, asbestos-related, and product liability matters. We believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. Because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 20 to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Critical Accounting Policies

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from estimates. If updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known.

The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical.

•

Allowance for doubtful accounts – We have provided an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, which represents our best estimate of probable loss inherent in our accounts receivable portfolio. This estimate is based upon our policy, derived from our knowledge of our end markets, customer base and products.

•

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets – We have significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset.

Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test prescribed by GAAP. For those reporting units where it is required, the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed, wherein the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value, impairment exists and must be recognized.

As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques, a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues (market approach), with each method being equally weighted in the calculation. We believe an equal weighting of both approaches is appropriate. The income approach relies on the Company’s estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing, growth and margins, with due consideration given to forecasting risk. The



market approach reflects the market’s expectations for future growth and risk, with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly-traded companies and the subject reporting units.

In step 2, the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test, was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit.

Recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. This assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. For those indefinite-lived assets where it is required, a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology (income approach), which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess.

The determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins, long-term forecasts, discount rates and terminal growth rates. We developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit.

2014 Goodwill Impairment Test

The estimated fair values for each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 10% for the 2014 goodwill impairment test. Additionally, a 1% increase in the discount rate used or a 1% decrease in the terminal growth rate would not result in any reporting unit failing step 1.

Assessing the fair value of goodwill includes, among other things, making key assumptions for estimating future cash flows and appropriate market multiples. These assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity. We make every effort to estimate future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed. However, changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and could result in impairment charges in future periods. Factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to the following:

•

Decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater-than-expected declines in volumes,   pricing pressures or disruptive technology;

•

Declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition or an inability to develop or launch new products;

•

The impacts of the European sovereign debt crisis, including greater-than-expected declines in pricing, reductions in volumes, or fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;

•

The level of success of on-going and future research and development efforts, including those related to recent acquisitions, and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products;

•

Increase in the price or decrease in the availability of key commodities and the impact of higher energy prices; and

•

Increases in our market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital;

2013 Goodwill Impairment Test

In the third quarter of 2013, we determined that we were required to complete the first step of the two-step impairment test. Under the income approach we assumed a discount rate of 11.0%, near term growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 4.6% and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%. Under the market approach, we assumed a weighted average multiple of 8.9 and 8.0 times projected 2013 and 2014 EBITDA, respectively, and a multiple of 0.7 and 0.6 times projected 2013 and 2014 revenue, respectively, based on industry market data. The results of our impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of our EMEIA reporting unit was less than its carrying value; consequently, we performed the second step of the impairment test to quantify the amount of the non-cash, goodwill impairment charge. In the third quarter of 2013 we recorded a non-cash



pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $137.6 million ($131.2 million after-tax). This charge had no impact on our cash flows or our compliance with debt covenants. For our annual goodwill impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of 2013, the fair value of our EMEIA reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 24%.

During 2013, we renegotiated a significant joint venture contract within our Asia Pacific - Other reporting unit and moved the related product line to our Americas segment. As a result of these business changes, we completed the first step of the two-step impairment test. This reporting unit has goodwill of approximately $57 million.

Our Asia Pacific - Other reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 7% as of October 1, 2013. We have provided below  key assumptions and a sensitivity analysis. Under the income approach we assumed a weighted average discount rate of 13.0%, near term growth rates ranging from (1.3%) to 15.9% and a terminal growth rate of 4.0%. Under the market approach, we assumed a weighted average implied multiple of 0.9 and 10.5 times projected 2013 revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), respectively, based on industry market data. Holding other assumptions constant, a 1.0% increase in the discount rate would result in a $7.8 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, a 1.0% decrease in the long-term growth rate would result in a $5.5 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Either of these scenarios individually would result in the reporting unit failing step 1, which would lead to any or all of the reporting unit's $57 million of goodwill to be impaired.

Other Indefinite-lived intangible assets

- In testing our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with a discount rate of 11.0%, a terminal growth rate of 2.5%, and a royalty rate of 5.0%. All indefinite-lived intangible assets had a fair value that exceeded their carrying value by more than 15%.

A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames. The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows.

•

Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles – Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be generated. Impairment in the carrying value of an asset could be recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset are less than its carrying value. The impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined by an estimate of discounted cash flows. We believe that our use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations.

•

Loss contingencies – Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business, including litigation and administrative proceedings, environmental and asbestos matters and product liability, product warranty, worker’s compensation and other claims. We have recorded reserves in the combined and consolidated financial statements related to these matters, which are developed using input derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience data depending on the nature of the reserve, and in certain instances with consultation of legal counsel, internal and external consultants and engineers. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities, we believe our estimated reserves are reasonable and do not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows for any year.

•

Revenue recognition – Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) the price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered. Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. Both the persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement and fixed or determinable price criteria are deemed to be satisfied upon receipt of an executed and legally binding sales agreement or contract that clearly defines the terms and conditions of the transaction including the respective obligations of the parties. If the defined terms and conditions allow variability in all or a component of the price, revenue is not recognized until such time that the price becomes fixed or determinable. At the point of sale, we validate that existence of an enforceable claim that requires payment within a reasonable amount of time and assesses the collectability of that claim. If collectability is not deemed to be reasonably assured, then revenue recognition is deferred until such time that collectability becomes probable or cash is received. Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer has taken title and assumed the risks and rewards of ownership. Service and installation revenue are recognized when earned. In some instances, customer acceptance provisions are included in sales arrangements to give the buyer the ability to ensure the delivered product or service meets the criteria established in the order. In these instances, revenue recognition is deferred until the acceptance terms specified



in the arrangement are fulfilled through customer acceptance or a demonstration that established criteria have been satisfied. If uncertainty exists about customer acceptance, revenue is not recognized until acceptance has occurred.

We offer various sales incentive programs to our customers, dealers, and distributors. Sales incentive programs do not preclude revenue recognition, but do require an accrual for our best estimate of expected activity. Examples of the sales incentives that are accrued for as a contra receivable and sales deduction at the point of sale include, but are not limited to, discounts (i.e. net 30 type), coupons, and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount. Sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable. At

December 31, 2014

and


, we had a customer claim accrual (contra receivable) of

$23.5 million

and

$21.9 million

, respectively. All other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level, remain a customer for a certain period, provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability. At

December 31, 2014

and


, we had a sales incentive accrual of

$23.2 million

and

$21.0 million

, respectively. Each of these accruals represents our best estimate we expect to pay related to previously sold units based on historical claim experience. These estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy. If updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on our combined and consolidated financial statements.

We provide equipment, integrated solutions, and installation designed to customer specifications through construction-type contracts. The term of these types of contracts is typically less than one year, but can be as long as three years. Revenues related to these contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with GAAP. This measure of progress toward completion, utilized to recognize sales and profits, is based on the proportion of actual cost incurred to date as compared to the total estimate of contract costs at completion. The timing of revenue recognition often differs from the invoicing schedule to the customer with revenue recognition in advance of customer invoicing recorded to costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and invoicing in advance of revenue recognition recorded to deferred revenue. At December 31, 2014, all recorded accounts receivables are due within one year. We re-evaluate our contract estimates periodically and reflect changes in estimates in the current period using the cumulative catch-up method. These periodic reviews have not historically resulted in significant adjustments. If estimated contract costs are in excess of contract revenues, then the excess costs are accrued and losses are recognized in current period earnings.

We enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation and service revenue. For multiple element arrangements, each element is evaluated to determine the separate units of accounting. The total arrangement consideration is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price at the inception of the arrangement. The relative selling price is determined using vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price, if it exists; otherwise, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price is used. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a deliverable, a best estimate of the selling price is developed for that deliverable. We primarily utilize VSOE to determine its relative selling price. We recognize revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met, and only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements exist.

•

Income taxes – Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and non-U.S. tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in our judgment to be more likely than not. We regularly review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets considering our historic profitability, projected future taxable income, timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of our tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, we record a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit.

The provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income, and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters. We will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates, the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved.



•

Employee benefit plans – We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retirees, including pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefits. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, employee mortality, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. Actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with GAAP. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated and amortized into earnings over future periods.

We review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate. The discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date. A discount rate reflects a rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. Discount rates for all plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on the yields of corporate bonds rated AA quality. Spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments. The rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy, the types of assets held and the target asset allocation. The expected long-term rate of return is determined as of each measurement date.

We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries, outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors.

Changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost. Estimated sensitivities to the expected 2014 net periodic pension cost of a 0.25% rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows: the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $0.9 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately $0.5 million.  A 1.0% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the cost by approximately

$0.1 million

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to our combined and consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 herein for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition.

Foreign Currency Exposures

We have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets. As a result, we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world. We actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the legal entity level. We attempt to hedge exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount with foreign currency derivatives.  Derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. To minimize the risk of counter party non-performance, derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments.

We evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates. Based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at

December 31, 2014

, a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10% adverse change in exchange rates would result in an additional unrealized loss of approximately $3.9 million. This amount, when realized, would be partially offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions.



Venezuela is treated as a highly inflationary economy under GAAP. As a result, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our consolidated joint venture in Venezuela. Any currency remeasurement adjustments for non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings.

The Venezuelan government’s official exchange rate is currently 6.3 Venezuelan bolivars per U.S. dollar. The Venezuelan government re-instituted a secondary exchange rate (SICAD I rate) for select goods and services. The SICAD I rate was 12 bolivars per U.S. dollar at December 31, 2014. In March 2014, the Venezuelan government launched a SICAD II rate to provide a greater supply of U.S. dollar  from sources other than the Venezuelan government. All companies located or domiciled in Venezuela may bid for U.S. dollar for any purpose. The SICAD II exchange rate was approximately 50 bolivars per U.S. dollar on December 31, 2014.

Given accelerated deterioration in economic conditions driven by a significant drop in the price of oil and no expectation of improvement for the foreseeable future, we concluded that the SICAD II exchange rate was the most appropriate rate at which to value bolivar denominated assets and liabilities. As a result, on December 31, 2014, we moved the exchange rate applied to bolivars from the official rate to the SICAD II rate. We recorded a charge of $45.4 million (before tax and non-controlling interest), or $0.28 per diluted share. The charge includes remeasurement of net monetary assets ($12.1 million) and a non-cash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances ($33.3 million). Had the SICAD II rate been applied throughout all of 2014, we estimate it would have reduced full-year revenues and EPS by approximately $95 million and $0.11 per share, respectively. After these charges, we had $4.6 million of bolivar-denominated net monetary assets and $8.9 million of inventory in Venezuela as of December 31, 2014.

On February 9, 2015, the Venezuelan government announced changes to its exchange rate system that included the launch of a new, market-based system called the Marginal Currency System, or “Simadi,” that will replace the SICAD II rate.  The Company is currently evaluating this announcement.   Adoption of the Simadi rate would result in additional charges to remeasure the net monetary assets and impair other assets.

Commodity Price Exposures

We are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure. We do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at

December 31, 2014

.

Interest Rate Exposure

Outstanding borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities accrue interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risks. A 100 basis point increase in LIBOR would have resulted in incremental 2014 interest expense of approximately $7.0 million, excluding the impact of our forward starting interest rate swaps. In June 2014, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps for

$300.0 million

of our variable rate

$975.0 million

Term Loan Facilities. Swaps with notional amounts totaling

$275.0 million

become effective in January 2015 and expire in September 2017 and swaps with notional amounts totaling

$25.0 million

become effective in January 2015 and expire in December 2016. If the base interest rate in our credit facilities increases in the future then the floating-rate debt could have a material effect on our interest expense.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of

December 31, 2014

, that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and that such information has been accumulated and communicated to the Company's management including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b)

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)

. We concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report herein.

(c)

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Index to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Allegion plc:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for the years then ended, and the combined statements of income, of equity, and of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2012 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Allegion plc and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then  ended, and the combined results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related financial statements.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits (which was an integrated audit in 2014).  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for inventory costing in 2014.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Allegion plc, an Irish public limited company, and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Allegion" or "the Company") is a leading global company that creates peace of mind by pioneering safety and security. The Company offers an extensive and versatile portfolio of mechanical and electronic security products across a range of market-leading brands including CISA®, Interflex®, LCN®, Schlage® and Von Duprin®.

On December 1, 2013, Allegion became a stand-alone public company after Ingersoll-Rand plc ("Ingersoll Rand") completed the separation of its commercial and residential security businesses (the "Business") from the rest of Ingersoll Rand, via the transfer of the Business from Ingersoll Rand to Allegion and the issuance by Allegion of ordinary shares directly to Ingersoll Rand’s shareholders (the "Spin-off"). As part of the Spin-off, Allegion issued one ordinary share for every three ordinary shares of Ingersoll Rand held of record as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time on November 22, 2013. Allegion ordinary shares trade under the symbol ''ALLE'' on the New York Stock Exchange. Allegion issued a total of approximately 96.0 million ordinary shares in the Spin-off.

Basis of presentation:

The Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") within the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC").

Prior to the Spin-off, the Company’s combined and consolidated financial statements were prepared on a stand-alone basis derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Ingersoll Rand and included allocations for direct costs and indirect costs attributable to the operations of the Company. The Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 are on a combined basis and presented as carve-out financial statements as the Company was not a separate consolidated company prior to the Spin-off. Subsequent to the Spin-off, the Company’s financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are presented on a consolidated basis as the Company became a separate consolidated group.

The Company’s Combined and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 include allocations of general corporate expenses for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis by Ingersoll Rand, such as expenses related to finance, human resources, information technology, facilities, and legal, among others. The Company used certain underlying activity drivers as a basis of allocation including revenue, assets, head-count utilization and other factors. Note 19 provides information regarding general overhead allocations. The Company believes such allocations are reasonable, however these Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements do not purport to reflect what the results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), financial position, equity or cash flows would have been had the Company operated as a stand-alone public company for all periods presented.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements follows:

Principles of Consolidation:

The Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company.  A noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest in a majority-owned subsidiary that is not attributable to the parent.  The Company includes Noncontrolling interest as a component of Total equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are presented as an adjustment from Net earnings used to arrive at Net earnings attributable to Allegion in the Combined and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Partially-owned equity affiliates generally represent

% ownership interests in investments and where we demonstrate significant influence in investments, but do not have a controlling financial interest. Partially-owned equity affiliates are accounted for under the equity method.  The Company is also required to consolidate variable interest entities in which it bears a majority of the risk to the entities’ potential losses or stands to gain from a majority of the entities’ expected returns. Transactions between the Company and Ingersoll Rand and its affiliates are herein referred to as "related party" or "affiliated" transactions. The assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of all discontinued operations have been separately reported as discontinued operations.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are based on several factors including the facts and circumstances available at the time the estimates are made, historical experience,

F-9


risk of loss, general economic conditions and trends, and the assessment of the probable future outcome. Some of the more significant estimates include accounting for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, purchase price allocations of acquired businesses, valuation of assets including goodwill and other intangible assets, product warranties, sales allowances, pension plans, postretirement benefits other than pensions, taxes, environmental costs, product liability and other contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the Combined and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period that they are determined.

Currency Translation:

Assets and liabilities where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, have been translated at year-end exchange rates, and income and expense accounts have been translated using average exchange rates throughout the year. Adjustments resulting from the process of translating an entity’s financial statements into the U.S. dollar have been recorded in the Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and all highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less.

Marketable Securities:

The Company has classified its marketable securities as available-for-sale in accordance with GAAP. Available-for-sale marketable securities are accounted for at fair value, with the unrealized gain or loss, less applicable deferred income taxes, recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). If any of the Company’s marketable securities experience other than temporary declines in value as defined by GAAP, a loss is recorded in the Combined and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Inventories

:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company changed its method of inventory costing for certain inventory in its Americas operating segment to the first-in first-out (FIFO) method from the last-in first-out (LIFO) method. The Company's other operating segments also determine costs using the FIFO method. The Company believes that the FIFO method is preferable as it results in uniformity across the Company’s global operations, aligns with how the Company internally manages inventory, provides better matching of revenues and expenses and improves comparability with the Company’s peers. The impact of this change in accounting principle on the financial statements for each period presented is further explained in Note 4.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

:  The Company has provided an allowance for doubtful accounts reserve, which represents the best estimate of probable loss inherent in the Company’s account receivables portfolio. Changes in the financial condition of customers or other unanticipated events, which may affect their ability to make payments, could result in charges for additional allowances exceeding the Company's estimates. The Company's estimates are influenced by the following considerations: a continuing credit evaluation of our customers’ financial condition; trade accounts receivable aging; and historical loss experience. The Company reserved $

8.9 million

and $

5.5 million

for doubtful accounts as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Assets placed in service are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the shorter of their economic useful life or their lease term. The range of useful lives used to depreciate property, plant and equipment is as follows:

Repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are charged against earnings as incurred. Major replacements and significant improvements that increase asset values and extend useful lives are capitalized.

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

The Company records as goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Once the final valuation has been performed for each acquisition, adjustments may be recorded.

F-10


In accordance with GAAP, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or whenever there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset.

Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test prescribed by U.S. GAAP. For those reporting units where it is required, the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed, wherein the reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value, impairment exists and must be recognized.

The calculation of estimated fair value is based on two valuation techniques, a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues (market approach), with each method being equally weighted in the calculation. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test, was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit.

Recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (i.e. Trademarks) is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  This assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset.  For those indefinite-lived assets where it is required, a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology (income approach), which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess.

Intangible assets such as patents, customer-related intangible assets and other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. The weighted-average useful lives approximate the following:

Recoverability of intangible assets with finite useful lives is assessed in the same manner as property, plant and equipment as described above.

Income Taxes:

For purposes of the Company’s Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements for periods prior to the Spin-off, income tax expense has been recorded as if the Company filed tax returns on a stand-alone basis separate from Ingersoll Rand. This separate return methodology applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the stand-alone financial statements as if the Company was a stand-alone enterprise for the periods prior to the Spin-off. Therefore, cash tax payments and items of current and deferred taxes may not be reflective of the Company’s actual tax balances prior to or subsequent to the Spin-off.  Cash paid for income taxes for the year ended

December 31, 2014

was

$66.7 million

.

The income tax accounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2014 include income taxes payable and deferred taxes allocated to the Company at the time of the Spin-off. The calculation of the Company’s income taxes involves considerable judgment and the use of both estimates and allocations.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and non-U.S. tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in its judgment to be more likely than not. The Company regularly reviews the recoverability of its deferred tax assets considering its historic profitability, projected future taxable income, timing of the reversals of existing temporary

F-11


differences and the feasibility of its tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, the Company records a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit.

Product Warranties:

Standard product warranty accruals are recorded at the time of sale and are estimated based upon product warranty terms and historical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its liabilities and will make adjustments as necessary based on known or anticipated warranty claims, or as new information becomes available.

Revenue Recognition:

Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) the price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered. Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. Both the persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement and fixed or determinable price criteria are deemed to be satisfied upon receipt of an executed and legally binding sales agreement or contract that clearly defines the terms and conditions of the transaction including the respective obligations of the parties. If the defined terms and conditions allow variability in all or a component of the price, revenue is not recognized until such time that the price becomes fixed or determinable. At the point of sale, the Company validates the existence of an enforceable claim that requires payment within a reasonable amount of time and assesses the collectability of that claim. If collectability is not deemed to be reasonably assured, then revenue recognition is deferred until such time that collectability becomes probable or cash is received. Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer has taken title and assumed the risks and rewards of ownership. Service and installation revenue are recognized when earned. In some instances, customer acceptance provisions are included in sales arrangements to give the buyer the ability to ensure the delivered product or service meets the criteria established in the order. In these instances, revenue recognition is deferred until the acceptance terms specified in the arrangement are fulfilled through customer acceptance or a demonstration that established criteria have been satisfied. If uncertainty exists about customer acceptance, revenue is not recognized until acceptance has occurred.

The Company offers various sales incentive programs to our customers, dealers, and distributors. Sales incentive programs do not preclude revenue recognition, but do require an accrual for the Company’s best estimate of expected activity. Examples of the sales incentives that are accrued for as a contra receivable and sales deduction at the point of sale include, but are not limited to, discounts (i.e. net 30 type), coupons, and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount. Sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable. At

December 31, 2014

and


, the Company had a customer claim accrual (contra receivable) of

$23.5 million

and

$21.9 million

, respectively. All other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain level of purchases, remain a customer for a certain period, provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability. At

December 31, 2014

and


, the Company had a sales incentive accrual of

$23.2 million

and

$21.0 million

, respectively. Each of these accruals represents the Company’s best estimate it expects to pay related to previously sold units based on historical claim experience. These estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy. If updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in the Company’s results for the period in which they become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between the Company’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company provides equipment, integrated solutions, and installation designed to customer specifications through construction-type contracts. The term of these types of contracts is typically less than one year, but can be as long as three years. Revenues related to these contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with GAAP. This measure of progress toward completion, utilized to recognize sales and profits, is based on the proportion of actual cost incurred to date as compared to the total estimate of contract costs at completion. The timing of revenue recognition often differs from the invoicing schedule to the customer with revenue recognition in advance of customer invoicing recorded to costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and invoicing in advance of revenue recognition recorded to deferred revenue. At

December 31, 2014

, all recorded accounts receivables are due within one year. The Company re-evaluates its contract estimates periodically and reflects changes in estimates in the current period using the cumulative catch-up method. These periodic reviews have not historically resulted in significant adjustments. If estimated contract costs are in excess of contract revenues, then the excess costs are accrued and losses are recognized in current earnings.

The Company enters into sales arrangements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation and service revenue. For multiple element arrangements, each element is evaluated to determine the separate units of accounting. The total arrangement consideration is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price at the inception of the arrangement. The relative selling price is determined using vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of selling price, if it exists; otherwise, third-party evidence ("TPE") of selling price is used. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a deliverable, a best estimate of the selling price is developed for that deliverable. The Company primarily utilizes VSOE to determine its relative selling price. The Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has stand-alone value

F-12


to the customer, the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met, and only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements exist.

Environmental Costs:

The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment. Environmental expenditures relating to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which do not contribute to current or future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities for remediation costs are recorded when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Company’s commitment to a plan of action. The assessment of this liability, which is calculated based on existing technology, does not reflect any offset for possible recoveries from insurance companies, and is not discounted.  Refer to Note 20 for further details of environmental matters.

Research and Development Costs:

The Company conducts research and development activities for the purpose of developing and improving new products and services. These expenditures are expensed when incurred. For the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, these expenditures amounted to approximately $

43.3 million

, $

39.6 million

and $

38.2 million

, respectively and consist of salaries, wages, benefits, building costs and other overhead expenses.

Software Costs:

The Company capitalizes certain qualified internal-use software costs during the application development stage and subsequently amortizes those costs over the software's useful life, which ranges from


to


years.

Employee Benefit Plans

: The Company provides a range of benefits, including pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefits to eligible current and former employees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, employee mortality, turnover rates, and healthcare cost trend rates. Actuaries perform the required calculations to determine expense in accordance with GAAP. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated into Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into Net earnings over future periods. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate.  Refer to Note 10 for further details on employee benefit plans.

Loss Contingencies:

Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business, including litigation and administrative proceedings, environmental matters, product liability, product warranty, worker’s compensation and other claims. The Company has recorded reserves in the financial statements related to these matters, which are developed using inputs derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience data depending on the nature of the reserve and, in certain instances, with consultation of legal counsel, internal and external consultants and engineers. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities, the Company believes its estimated reserves are reasonable and does not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company for any year.  Refer to Note 20 for further details on loss contingencies.

Derivative Instruments:

The Company periodically enters into cash flow and other derivative transactions to specifically hedge exposure to various risks related to currency and interest rates. The Company recognizes all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value as either assets or liabilities. For cash flow designated hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative contract are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, and are recognized in Net earnings at the time earnings are affected by the hedged transaction.  For other derivative transactions, the changes in the fair value of the derivative contract are immediately recognized in Net earnings.  Refer to Note 9 for further details on derivative instruments.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements:

In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2013-04, "Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date." ASU 2013-04 provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements where the total obligation is fixed at the reporting date, and for which no specific guidance currently exists. This new guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2014. The requirements of ASU 2013-04 do not have a significant impact on the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, "Parent’s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity." ASU

F-13


2013-05 clarifies the application of GAAP to the release of cumulative translation adjustments related to changes of ownership in or within foreign entities, including step acquisitions.  This new guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2014.The requirements of ASU 2013-04 do not have a significant impact on the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11 Income Taxes (Topic 740), "Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists." With certain exceptions, ASU 2013-11 requires entities to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward. This new guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2014. The requirements of ASU 2013-11 do not have a significant impact on the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:

In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08 "Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity," which amends the definition of a discontinued operation in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 205-20 (Presentation of Financial Statements — Discontinued Operations) and requires entities to disclose additional information about disposal transactions that do not meet the discontinued operations criteria. ASU 2014-08 redefines a discontinued operation as a component or group of components of an entity that (1) has been disposed of by sale or other than by sale or is classified as held for sale and (2) represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. According to the ASU, a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and results includes the disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity investment, or other major parts of an entity. The ASU is effective prospectively for disposals or components classified as held for sale in periods on or after December 15, 2014. The requirements of ASU 2014-08 are not expected to have a significant impact on the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2014-09 is the result of a joint project between the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB")  to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") that would remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements, provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets, provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements and simplify the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. The Company is assessing what impact, if any, ASU 2014-09 will have on the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12 "Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period." ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award. This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted. The requirements of ASU 2014-12 are not expected to have a significant impact on the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 "Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." ASU 2014-15 guidance on management’s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 will be effective in the fourth quarter of 2016, with early adoption permitted. The requirements of ASU 2014-15 are not expected to have a significant impact on the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 3 – MARKETABLE SECURITIES

At December 31, long-term marketable securities included within Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

NOTE 4 – INVENTORIES

At December 31, the major classes of inventory were as follows:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  In the fourth quarter of 2014 the Company recorded a

$33.3 million

non-cash inventory impairment charge related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar within Costs of goods sold in the 2014 Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

As described in Note 2, in the fourth quarter of 2014 the Company elected to change its method of accounting for certain inventory in its Americas operating segment from LIFO to FIFO. The Company applied this change in method of inventory costing by retrospectively adjusting the prior period financial statements.  As a result of the retrospective adjustment of the change in accounting principle, certain amounts in our combined and consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the years ended

NOTE 6 – GOODWILL

The Company records as goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Once the final valuation has been performed for each acquisition, adjustments may be recorded. The changes in the carrying amount of Goodwill are as follows:

* During 2013, the Company reclassified goodwill related to a product line transfer from the Asia Pacific segment to the Americas segment.

** Accumulated impairment consists of charges of

$137.6 million

(EMEIA),

$341.0 million

(EMEIA) and $

6.9 million

(Asia Pacific) recorded in 2013, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a result of the Company's impairment testing.  During the third quarter of 2013 the Company performed an interim impairment test on goodwill of its EMEIA reporting unit. The results of the third quarter 2013 interim impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of the EMEIA reporting unit was less than its carrying value; consequently, the Company completed the second step of the interim impairment test, which resulted in a $137.6 million non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge.

F-16


The estimated fair values for each of the Company's reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 10% for the 2014 goodwill impairment test.

NOTE 7 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The following table sets forth the gross amount and related accumulated amortization of the Company’s intangible assets at December 31:

The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives in accordance with GAAP. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization, but instead, are tested for impairment at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present).

Intangible asset amortization expense for

NOTE 8 – DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES

At December 31, long-term debt and other borrowings consisted of the following:

Senior Secured Credit Facilities

In November 2013, the Company entered into a credit agreement providing for (i)

$1.0 billion

of Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities, consisting of a $500 million "tranche A" Term Loan Facility due in 2018 (the "Term Loan A Facility") and a

$500 million

"tranche B" Term Loan Facility due in 2020 (the "Term Loan B Facility,") and (ii) a

$500.0 million

Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the "Revolver") maturing in 2018. The Company refers to these credit facilities as its "Senior Secured Credit

F-17


Facilities." The net proceeds of the Term Loan A Facility and Term Loan B Facility were distributed to Ingersoll Rand in connection with the Spin-off.

On October 15, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to amend and restate its existing credit agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, among other things, (1) increased the size of the Term A Loan Facility to

$975.0 million

and borrowed an additional $493.8 million under the facility, (2) repaid the outstanding Term Loan B Facility with the proceeds from the Term Loan A Facility, (3) reduced credit spreads on Term Loan A Facility 25 basis points and eliminated the LIBOR floor associated with Term Loan B Facility and (4) extended the applicable maturities from September 27, 2018 to October 15, 2019. The availability under the Revolver remained unchanged, and continues to permit borrowing of up to

$500.0 million

. In addition to repaying the outstanding Term Loan B Facility of $500.0 million, the Company repaid $31.0 million of principal on its Term Loan A Facility during the year ended December 31, 2014. Borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan A Facility were $962.8 million on December 31, 2014. Allegion plc also became the primary borrower under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

In the fourth quarter, the Company  incurred a non-cash charge of approximately

$4.5 million

associated with the write-off of the unamortized Term Loan B Facility debt issuance costs.

Term Facilities

. The Term Loan A Facility amortizes in quarterly installments at the following rates per year: 5% in 2015; 5% in 2016 and 10% in each year thereafter, with the final installment due on October 15, 2019.

Revolver.

The five-year Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility permits borrowings of up to

$500.0 million

. The Revolver is comprised of two tranches: a $400 million tranche available in U.S. Dollars and a multi-currency tranche capped at $100 million.  The Revolver also includes $100.0 million available for the issuance of letters of credit, however outstanding letters of credit reduce availability under the Revolver. The Revolver matures and the commitments thereunder will terminate on October 15, 2019. The Company pays certain fees with respect to the Revolver, including a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Revolver of 0.25% per year.  At December 31, 2014, the Company did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and had

$28.5 million

of letters of credit outstanding.

Guarantees and Collateral.

The indebtedness, obligations and liabilities under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior secured basis by certain of Allegion plc's restricted subsidiaries, and will be secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions and exclusions, by a first-priority lien on substantially all tangible and intangible assets of the borrowers and each domestic guarantor (including (i) a perfected pledge of all of the capital stock of the borrower and each direct, wholly-owned material restricted subsidiary held by the borrowers or any guarantor (subject to certain limitations with respect to foreign subsidiaries) and (ii) perfected security interests in, and mortgages on, accounts, inventory, equipment, general intangibles, commercial tort claims, investment property, intellectual property, material fee-owned real property, letter-of-credit rights, intercompany notes and proceeds of the foregoing, except for certain excluded assets.

Mandatory Prepayments.

In accordance with the Senior Secured Credit Facility, net cash proceeds of non-recourse asset sales and proceeds received from certain additional indebtedness will require prepayment of the Term Loan with proceeds received. In addition, starting with the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company may be required to apply between 0%-50% of its annual excess cash flow (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility) to the prepayment of the Senior Secured Credit Facility. However, this percentage reduces to certain levels and eventually to zero upon achievement certain leverage ratios.

Voluntary Prepayments.

The Company may voluntarily prepay the outstanding Term Facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. Optional prepayments of the Term Facility will be applied to the remaining installments at the direction of the borrower.

Commitments under the Revolver may be reduced in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.

Covenants.

NOTE 9 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In the normal course of business, the Company uses various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, to manage the risks associated with currency rate exposures. These financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.

On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction, a cash flow hedge of a recognized asset or liability, or as an undesignated derivative. The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identification of the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk

F-19


management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking derivative instruments that are designated as hedges to specific assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions.

The fair market value of derivative instruments is determined through market-based valuations and may not be representative of the actual gains or losses that will be recorded when these instruments mature due to future fluctuations in the markets in which they are traded.

The Company assesses at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. To the extent the derivative is deemed to be a highly effective hedge, the fair market value changes of the instrument are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).

Any ineffective portion of a derivative instrument’s change in fair value is recorded in Net earnings in the period of change. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective, or it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the hedging relationship will be undesignated and any future gains and losses on the derivative instrument will be recorded in Net earnings.

Currency Hedging Instruments

The net notional amount of the Company’s currency derivatives were $

68.5 million

and $

209.6 million

at

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively. At

December 31, 2014

and


, gains of $

1.6 million

and  $

0.5 million

, net of tax, respectively, were included in AOCI related to the fair value of the Company’s currency derivatives designated as accounting hedges. The amount expected to be reclassified into Net earnings over the next twelve months is a gain of $

1.6 million

. The actual amounts that will be reclassified to Net earnings may vary from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions. Gains and losses associated with the Company’s currency derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in Net earnings as changes in fair value occur. At

December 31, 2014

, the maximum term of the Company’s currency derivatives was less than one year.

Interest Rate Swaps

In June 2014, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix interest rate paid during the contract period for

$300.0 million

of the Company's variable rate

$975.0 million

Term Loan Facilities. Swaps with notional amounts totaling

$275.0 million

become effective in January 2015 and expire in September 2017 and swaps with notional amounts totaling

$25.0 million

become effective in January 2015 and expire in December 2016. These interest rate swaps met the criteria to be accounted for as cash flow hedges of variable rate interest payments. Consequently, the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps were recognized in AOCI. At December 31, 2014, $0.9 million of losses were recorded in AOCI related to these interest rate swaps and none are expected to be reclassified into Interest expense over the next twelve months.

The fair values of derivative instruments included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31

were as follows:

Asset and liability derivatives included in the table above are recorded within Other current assets and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, respectively.

F-20


The amounts associated with derivatives designated as hedges affecting Net earnings and AOCI for the years ended

December 31

were as follows:

Concentration of Credit Risk

The counterparties to the Company’s forward contracts and swaps consist of a number of investment grade major international financial institutions. The Company could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties. However, the credit ratings and the concentration of risk in these financial institutions are monitored on a continuous basis and present no significant credit risk to the Company.

NOTE 10 – PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

The Company sponsors several U.S. defined benefit and defined contribution plans covering substantially all of our U.S. employees. Additionally, the Company has non-U.S. defined benefit and defined contribution plans covering eligible non-U.S. employees. Postretirement benefits, other than pensions, provide healthcare benefits, and in some instances, life insurance benefits for certain eligible employees.

Pension Plans

The noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering non-collectively bargained U.S. employees provide benefits on an average pay formula while most plans for collectively bargained U.S. employees provide benefits on a flat dollar benefit formula.  The non-U.S. pension plans generally provide benefits based on earnings and years of service. The Company also maintains additional other supplemental plans for officers and other key employees.

On December 1, 2013, in connection with the Spin-off, various defined benefit plans were established for both U.S. and non-U.S. based employees.  All plans were re-measured as of December 1, 2013 in connection with the Spin-off.  The Schlage Lock Company LLC Pension Plan ("Schlage plan") was established to provide retirement benefits to Allegion employees and former Allegion employees who were participants in certain Ingersoll Rand pension plans (the “Parent Pension Plans”).  The Schlage plan assumed all liabilities under the Parent Pension Plans related to Allegion participants- active and former.  Assets were transferred to the Schlage plan in accordance with Section 414(l) of the Internal Revenue Code ("the Code").

The Schlage Lock Company LLC NQ Pension plans ("Schlage NQ plans") were established in connection with the Spin-off to provide retirement benefits to Allegion employees and former Allegion employees who were participants in the certain Ingersoll Rand non-qualified pension plans (collectively, the “Parent NQ Pension Plans”).  The Schlage NQ plans assumed all liabilities under the Parent NQ Pension Plans related to Schlage NQ plans participants. These are unfunded plans.

The Schlage Lock Company LLC Other Postemployment Benefits Plan ("Schlage OPEB plan") was established in connection with the Spin-off.  The Schlage OPEB plan provides other postemployment benefits to Allegion employees and former Allegion employees who were participants in certain Ingersoll Rand  Other Postemployment Benefits Plans  (collectively, the “Parent OPEB Plans”). The Schlage OPEB plan assumed all liabilities under the Parent OPEB Plans related to Schlage plan participants. This is an unfunded plan.

The Allegion UK Pension Plan ("Allegion UK Plan") was also established in connection with the Spin-off to provide retirement benefits to Allegion employees, former Allegion employees and those members for whom Ingersoll Rand Security Technologies Ltd. was legally responsible who were participants in the Ingersoll Rand UK Pension Plan. The Allegion UK plan assumed all liabilities  under the Ingersoll Rand UK Pension Plan. Assets were transferred to the Allegion UK plan in accordance with a Transfer Agreement.  All liabilities and corresponding plan assets related to remaining non-U.S. plans were transferred at the time of the Spin-off.

F-21


The following table details information regarding the Company’s pension plans at December 31:

(a)

During 2014, the Society of Actuaries released a new mortality table, referred to as RP-2014, which is believed to better reflect mortality improvements. The Company used the RP-2014 mortality table to measure its U.S. pension obligation as of December 31, 2014. The impact of the new mortality tables as well as the decline in discount rates from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 is included in actuarial losses.

(b)

Represents the benefit obligation and plan assets transferred to the Allegion UK plan as a result of the combination of plans related to Allegion employees, former Allegion employees and those members for whom Ingersoll Rand Security Technologies Ltd. was legally responsible.

(c)

Consists of the difference between the preliminary assets allocated to Allegion for the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2012 (which were allocated based on relative accumulated benefit obligations) and the actual assets allocated in the Spin-off in accordance with the agreed upon methodology between Allegion and Ingersoll Rand (based on the provisions of Section 414(l) of the Code).

F-22


It is the Company’s objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. However, certain plans are not funded due to either legal, accounting, or tax requirements in certain jurisdictions. As of

December 31, 2014

, approximately

5%

of our projected benefit obligation relates to plans that are not funded of which the majority are Non-U.S. plans.

The pretax amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:

Weighted-average assumptions used:

. The amounts expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost during the year ended December 31,


for prior service cost and plan net actuarial losses are $

0.7 million

and $

6.0 million

, respectively.

Weighted-average assumptions used:

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy, the types of assets held and target asset allocations. The expected long-term rate of return is determined as of the measurement date. Each plan is reviewed and its historical returns and target asset allocations to determine the appropriate expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to be used.

The overall objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due. The goal is to achieve this while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status, contribution, and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities. Each plan’s funded status and asset allocation is monitored regularly in addition to investment manager performance.

The Company determines the fair value of its US plan assets using the following methodologies:

•

Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments

–The investments are valued at the closing price or amount held on deposit by the custodian bank or at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations considering the credit-worthiness of the issuer. As these investments are not traded on active markets, these investments are classified as Level 2.

•

Equity Mutual Funds

–Valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. These funds are required to publish their daily net asset value (NAV) and to transact at that price.  Such securities are classified as Level 2.

•

U.S. government and agency obligations

–Quoted market prices are not available for these securities.  Fair values are estimated using pricing models and/or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows.  Such securities are classified as Level 2.

Cash equivalents are valued using a market approach with inputs including quoted market prices for either identical or similar instruments. Fixed income securities are valued through a market approach with inputs including, but not limited to, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker quotes and issuer spreads. Commingled funds are valued at their daily net asset value (NAV) per share or the equivalent. NAV per share or the equivalent is used for fair value purposes as a practical expedient. NAVs are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund. Private real estate fund values are reported by the fund manager and are based on valuation or appraisal of the underlying investments.

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

The Company sponsors a postretirement plan that provides for healthcare benefits, and in some instances, life insurance benefits that cover certain eligible employees. The Company funds postretirement benefit obligations principally on a pay-as-you-go basis. Generally, postretirement health benefits are contributory with contributions adjusted annually. Life insurance plans for retirees are primarily noncontributory.

On December 1, 2013 the Schlage Lock Company LLC Postretirement other than Pensions Plan ("Schlage Postretirement Plan") was established in connection with the Spin-off.  The Schlage Postretirement Plan provides postretirement benefits other than pensions to Allegion employees and former Allegion employees who were participants in certain Ingersoll Rand Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension Plans.  The Schlage Postretirement Plan assumed all liabilities related to Schlage Postretirement Plan participants and no assets were transferred to the Schlage Postretirement plan.

NOTE 11 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  Fair value measurements are based on a framework that utilizes the inputs market participants use to determine the fair value of an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize those inputs. The fair value hierarchy is comprised of three levels that are described below:

•

Level 1 – Inputs based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 – Inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

•

Level 3 – Unobservable inputs based on little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities.

The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value at

December 31, 2014

are as follows:

F-29


Assets and liabilities measured at fair value at

December 31, 2013

are as follows:

The Company determines the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities using the following methodologies:

•

Marketable securities

– These securities include investments in publicly traded stock of non-U.S. companies held by non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Company. The fair value is obtained for the securities based on observable market prices quoted on public stock exchanges.

•

Derivative instruments

– These instruments include forward foreign currency contracts and instruments related to non-functional currency balance sheet exposures. The fair value of the derivative instruments are determined based on a pricing model that uses spot rates and forward prices from actively quoted currency markets that are readily accessible and observable.

F-30


•

Interest rate swaps

– These instruments include forward-starting interest rate swap contracts for $300.0 million of the Company's variable rate debt. The fair value of the derivative instruments are determined based on quoted prices for the Company's swaps, which are not considered an active market.

•

Total debt -

The f

air value of long-term debt is based upon observable market prices quoted on public exchanges for similar assets.

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings are a reasonable estimate of their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

The methodology used by the Company to determine the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities at

December 31, 2014

are the same as those used at

December 31, 2013

.  There have been no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 categories.

NOTE 12 – EQUITY

NOTE 13 – SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company records share-based compensation awards using a fair value method and recognizes compensation expense for an amount equal to the fair value of the share-based payment issued in its financial statements. The Company’s share-based compensation plans include programs for stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance stock units ("PSUs"), and deferred compensation.

Under the Company's incentive stock plan, the total number of ordinary shares authorized by the shareholders is

8.0 million

, of which

4.5 million

remains available as of

December 31, 2014

for future incentive awards.

Compensation Expense

Share-based compensation expense related to continuing operations is included in Selling and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes the expenses recognized for the years ended December 31:

Stock Options / RSUs

Eligible participants may receive (i) stock options, (ii) RSUs or (iii) a combination of both stock options and RSUs. The fair value of each of the Company’s stock option and RSU awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the required service period, which is generally the 3-year vesting period. However, for stock options and RSUs granted to retirement eligible employees, the Company recognizes expense for the fair value at the grant date.

The average fair value of the stock options granted for the year ended

December 31, 2014

and


was estimated to be $

19.54

per share and $

15.98

per share, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted average assumptions used were the following:

For grants issued prior to December 1, 2013, expected volatility is based on the historical volatility from traded options on Ingersoll Rand's stock.  The risk-free rate of return is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award. Historical data is used to estimate forfeitures within Ingersoll Rand’s valuation model.  The expected life of Ingersoll Rand’s stock option awards is derived from historical experience and represents the period of time that awards are expected to be outstanding.

For grants issued on or after December 1, 2013, expected volatility is based on the weighted average of the implied volatility of a group of the Company’s peers. The risk-free rate of return is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award. Historical peer data is used to estimate forfeitures within the Company’s valuation model.  The expected life of the Company’s stock option awards granted post separation is derived from the simplified approach based on the weighted average time to vest and the remaining contractual term, and represents the period of time that awards are expected to be outstanding.

Performance Shares

The Company has a Performance Share Program ("PSP") for key employees. The program provides awards in the form of Performance Share Units based on performance against pre-established objectives. The annual target award level is expressed as a number of the Company's ordinary shares. All PSUs are settled in the form of ordinary shares unless deferred.

In December 2013, the Company’s Compensation Committee granted PSUs that are earned based upon the Company’s total shareholder return ("TSR") performance compared to the TSR of the 41 companies currently comprising the S&P 400 Capital Goods Index over the three-year performance period based on the change in the 30 day average price for the index from December 2013 to the 30 day average price for the index in December 2016. The fair value of the market condition is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation approach in a risk-neutral framework to model future stock price movements based upon the risk-free rate of return, the volatility of each entity, and the pair-wise correlations between each entity.  The model utilizes a peer group of 41 members.

In March 2014, the Company’s Compensation Committee granted PSUs that are earned based upon a 50% performance condition, measured at each reporting period by EPS performance in relation to pre-established targets set by the Compensation Committee, and upon a 50% market condition, measured by the Company’s relative TSR against the S&P 400 Capital Goods Index over one-year, two-year, and three-year performance periods based on the change in the 30 day average price for the index from January 2014 to the 30 day average  price for the index in December 2014, December 2015, and December 2016.  The fair values of the market conditions are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation approach in a risk-neutral framework to model future stock price movements based upon the risk-free rate of return, the volatility of each entity, and the pair-wise correlations between each entity.  The model utilizes a peer group of 41 members.

At

December 31, 2014

, there was $

4.7 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost from the PSP based on current performance, which is related to unvested shares. This compensation will be recognized over the required service period, which is generally the three-year vesting period.

Deferred Compensation

The Company allows key employees to defer a portion of their eligible compensation into a number of investment choices, including its ordinary share equivalents. Any amounts invested in ordinary share equivalents will be settled in ordinary shares of the Company at the time of distribution.

NOTE 14 – RESTRUCTURING

During


,


, and


, the Company incurred costs of

$7.1 million

,

$5.8 million

, and $

7.5 million

respectively, associated with ongoing restructuring actions. These actions included workforce reductions as well as the closure and consolidation of manufacturing facilities in an effort to increase efficiencies across multiple lines of business.

In the second quarter of 2014, management committed to a plan to restructure the EMEIA segment to improve efficiencies and regional cost structure ("the 2014 EMEIA Restructuring Plan"). Restructuring charges recorded during the year ended

December 31

, 2014 as part of this plan were as follows:

Restructuring charges recorded during the years ended December 31 as part of other restructuring plans were as follows:

F-35


These charges primarily related to workforce reductions in an effort to increase efficiencies across multiple lines of business.

As of

December 31, 2014

and


, the Company had

$1.9 million

and

$2.8 million

accrued for costs associated with its ongoing restructuring actions, of which a majority is expected to be paid within one year.

NOTE 15 – OTHER EXPENSE, NET

At December 31, the components of Other expense, net were as follows:

In March 2014, the Venezuelan government launched a SICAD II rate to provide a greater supply of U.S. dollars from sources other than the Venezuelan government. Given accelerated deterioration in economic conditions driven by a significant drop in the price of oil and no expectation of improvement for the foreseeable future, the Company concluded that the SICAD II exchange rate was the most appropriate rate at which to value bolivar denominated assets and liabilities. As a result, on December 31, 2014, the Company moved the exchange rate applied to bolivars from the official rate to the SICAD II rate. The Company recorded a charge of

$12.1 million

in order to remeasurement net monetary assets to the SICAD II rate.

Included within Exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 is a

$6.2 million

realized foreign currency loss related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar from the pre-existing exchange rate of

4.3

bolivars per U.S. dollar to

6.3

bolivars per U.S. dollar.

NOTE 16 – INCOME TAXES

The Company and its subsidiaries, prior to the Spin-off, were included in Ingersoll Rand's income tax returns in certain taxing jurisdictions. In preparing the combined and consolidated financial statements, the Company has determined the tax provision for those jurisdictions on a separate return basis.

Earnings (loss) before income taxes for the years ended December 31 were taxed within the following jurisdictions:

F-36


The components of the Provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

The Provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income taxes determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory income tax rate to pretax income, as a result of the following differences:

(1)

Net of changes in valuation allowances

F-37


At December 31, a summary of the deferred tax accounts were as follows:

Deferred tax account balances from 2013 were recast to conform to current year presentation. The material changes in deferred tax account balances result from the tax write-up of certain inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets immediately prior to the Spin-off.

At

December 31, 2014

,

$0.8 million

of deferred tax was recorded for certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. No deferred taxes have been provided for any portion of the remaining undistributed earnings of the Company's subsidiaries since these earnings have been and under certain plans will continue to be, permanently reinvested in these subsidiaries. For many reasons, including the number of legal entities and jurisdictions involved, the complexity of the Company's legal entity structure, the complexity of tax laws in the relevant jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, the rules pertaining to the utilization of foreign tax credits in the United States and the impact of projections of income for future years to any calculations, the Company believes it is not practicable to estimate, within any reasonable range, the amount of additional taxes which may be payable upon the distribution of earnings.

At

December 31, 2014

, the Company had the following operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available to offset taxable income in prior and future years:

The U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards were incurred in various jurisdictions. The non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards were incurred in various jurisdictions, predominantly in China, Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom.

The Company evaluates its deferred income tax assets to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. U.S. GAAP requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a "more likely than not" standard. This assessment

F-38


considers the nature, frequency, and amount of recent losses, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.

Activity associated with the Company’s valuation allowance is as follows:

During 2014, the valuation allowance increased by

$3.9 million

This increase is the result of changes in jurisdictional profitability and changes in judgment and facts regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets.

The Company has total unrecognized tax benefits of $

25.4 million

and $

40.6 million

as of

December 31, 2014

, and

December 31, 2013

. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate are $

$25.4 million

as of

December 31, 2014

. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company records interest and penalties associated with the uncertain tax positions within its Provision for income taxes. The Company had reserves associated with interest and penalties, net of tax, of $

6.2 million

and $

11.5 million

at

December 31, 2014

and 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recognized a $

15.2 million

reduction in the reserve related to interest and penalties, net of tax, through Parent Company Investment. For the years ended

December 31, 2014

and 2013, the Company recognized $

(2.2) million

and $

4.3 million

in interest and penalties net of tax in continuing operations related to these uncertain tax positions.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the Company's tax positions is subject to change based on future events including, but not limited to, the settlements of ongoing audits and/or the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the outcomes and timing of such events are highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, could potentially be reduced by up to approximately $

8.7 million

during the next


months.

The provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by the Company and can raise issues regarding its filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a tax authority with respect to that return. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout

F-39


the world, including such major jurisdictions as Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico and the United States. In general, the examination of the material tax returns of subsidiaries of the Company is complete for the years prior to 2004, with certain matters being resolved through appeals and litigation.

In connection with the Spin-off, the Company and Ingersoll Rand entered into a Tax Matters Agreement for the allocation of taxes. As of December 31, 2014, the Company agreed to indemnify Ingersoll Rand

$2.4 million

for various tax matters, exclusive of interest and penalties of

$1.8 million

, which is reflected as an Other noncurrent liability (

$4.1 million

and

$2.6 million

at December 31, 2013). In addition, the Company has recorded a

$43.4 million

indemnity payable to Ingersoll Rand related to a filing for competent authority relief, which is reflected as an Other noncurrent liability (

$47.2 million

at December 31, 2013). As part of this competent authority filing, the Company has also recorded

$43.4 million

as an Other noncurrent asset. The

$43.4 million

is exclusive of interest in the amount of

$6.4 million

(

$47.2 million

and

$6.6 million

at December 31, 2013). The Company also has an indemnity receivable from Ingersoll Rand in the amount of

$5.6 million

reflected as an Other noncurrent asset (

$9.4 million

at December 31, 2013). The indemnity receivable is primarily related to additional competent authority relief filings.

NOTE 17 – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

EMEIA Divestiture

In the second quarter of 2014 the Company committed to a plan to sell its United Kingdom (UK) Door businesses to an unrelated third party. The transaction closed in the third quarter of 2014. The businesses sold include the Dor-o-Matic™ branded automatic door business, the Martin Roberts™ branded performance steel doorset business and the UK service organization. Historical results of the component, which were previously reported as part of the EMEIA segment, have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. In conjunction with the plan, we recorded a

$7.6 million

charge to write the carrying value of the assets to be sold down to their estimated fair value.

Net revenues and after-tax earnings of the component for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

Other divestitures

Other discontinued operations recognized a loss of

$0.4 million

,

$0.8 million

and

$2.7 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, respectively. These losses were mainly related to lease expense and other miscellaneous expenses from previously sold businesses.

NOTE 18 – EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Allegion plc by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted EPS is calculated after adjusting the denominator of the basic EPS calculation for the effect of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares, which in the Company’s case, includes shares issuable under share-based compensation plans.

Basic and Diluted EPS for all periods prior to the Spin-off reflect the number of distributed shares on December 1, 2013, or 96.0 million shares. For 2013 year to date calculations, these shares are treated as issued and outstanding from January 1, 2013 for purposes of calculating historical basic EPS. At the time of the Spin-off, stock options and restricted stock awards were converted to awards of Allegion, and therefore there were no dilutive securities outstanding for historical periods. For 2013, the Company determined its weighted average dilutive share outstanding assuming that the date of our separation from Ingersoll Rand was the beginning of the period. The following table summarizes the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

F-40


At December 31, 2014,

0.3 million

stock options were excluded from the computation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding because the effect of including these shares would have been anti-dilutive.

NOTE  19 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Ingersoll Rand provided the Company’s subsidiaries with certain centrally managed services and corporate function support in the areas of finance, information technology, employee benefits, legal, human resources, integrated supply chain and marketing through November 30, 2013. In addition, as discussed in Note 10, certain employees of the Company’s subsidiaries were eligible to participate in certain Ingersoll Rand employee benefit plans that were sponsored and administered by Ingersoll Rand or its affiliates.

The Company’s subsidiaries use of these services and its participation in these employee benefit plans generated both direct and indirect costs. These direct and indirect costs and benefits relating to the services and benefit plans were charged to the Company’s subsidiaries and were included in Cost of goods sold and Selling and administrative expenses.

Costs associated with centrally managed services were billed to the Company’s subsidiaries on the basis of direct usage. Historically, Ingersoll Rand corporate allocations were generally allocated to the Company’s subsidiaries on the basis of revenue, assets, payroll expense, and selling and administrative expenses. Incremental corporate costs were allocated to the Company’s subsidiaries on a similar basis. Costs were allocated to the Company’s subsidiaries using allocation methods that management believed were reasonable.

The Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements reflect these direct and indirect costs through a corporate overhead allocation. For the years ended December 31, these allocated Ingersoll Rand costs amount to:

The Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Ingersoll Rand, under which Ingersoll Rand provides certain services for a limited time after the Spin-off to help ensure an orderly transition. Under the Transition Services Agreement, the Company receives certain services, including services for information technology, human resources and labor and finance and accounting support as well as other corporate support services, from Ingersoll Rand and/or third party providers at specified prices. The Company paid

$2.9 million

in 2014 and

$0.5 million

in the fourth quarter of 2013 to Ingersoll Rand for services provided under transition services agreements.

NOTE 20 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is involved in various litigations, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental and product warranty matters. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, except as expressly set forth in this note, management believes that any liability which may result from these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company.

Environmental Matters

The Company is dedicated to an environmental program to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, the Company is currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former production facilities.

F-41


The Company is sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and has received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state authorities. It has also been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. For all such sites, there are other PRPs and, in most instances, the Company’s involvement is minimal.

In estimating its liability, the Company has assumed it will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis. Additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future.

The Company incurred $

2.9 million

, $

2.1 million

, and $

2.9 million

of expenses during the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us.  Environmental remediation costs are recorded in Costs of goods sold within the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. As of

December 31, 2014

and


, the Company has recorded reserves for environmental matters of $

8.8 million

and $

10.8 million

. Of these amounts $

2.4 million

and $

2.9 million

relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by the Company.   Environmental reserves are classified as Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, or Other noncurrent liabilities based on their expected term. The Company's total current environmental reserve at

December 31, 2014

and


was $

2.2 million

and $

4.2 million

and the remainder is classified as noncurrent. Given the evolving nature of environmental laws, regulations and technology, the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain.

Warranty Liability

Standard product warranty accruals are recorded at the time of sale and are estimated based upon product warranty terms and historical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its liabilities and will make adjustments as necessary based on known or anticipated warranty claims, or as new information becomes available.

The changes in the standard product warranty liability for the year ended

December 31,

were as follows:

Standard product warranty liabilities are classified as Accrued expenses and other current liabilities.

NOTE 21 – BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies except that the operating segments’ results are prepared on a management basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Company disaggregates financial information for internal review and decision making. The Company largely evaluates performance based on Segment operating income and Segment operating margins.

Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that the Company’s chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation, performance reviews, and compensation. For these reasons, the Company believes that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss. The Company’s chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains, such as corporate charges and other  special charges, from Operating income to arrive at a Segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base its operating decisions. The Company defines Segment operating margin as Segment operating income as a percentage of Net revenues.

F-42


Each reportable segment is based primarily on the geography in which it operates. A description of the Company’s reportable segments is as follows:

The Americas segment provides security products and solutions in approximately 30 countries throughout North America and parts of South America. The segment sells a broad range of products and solutions including, locks, locksets, key systems, door closers, exit devices, doors and door frames, electronic product and access control systems to end-users in commercial, institutional and residential facilities, including into the education, healthcare, government, commercial office and single- and multi-family residential markets.  This segment’s strategic brands are Schlage, Von Duprin and LCN.

The EMEIA segment provides security products and solutions throughout Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa in approximately 85 countries. The segment offers customers the same portfolio of products as the Americas segment, as well as time and attendance and workforce productivity solutions. This segment’s strategic brands are Bricard, CISA and Interflex.  This segment also resells Schlage, Von Duprin and LCN products, primarily in the Middle East.

The Asia Pacific segment provides security products and solutions throughout Asia Pacific in approximately 14 countries. The segment offers customers the same portfolio of products as the Americas segment, as well as video analytics solutions. This segment’s strategic brands are Schlage, CISA, Von Duprin and LCN.

Effective January 1, 2013, a product line was transferred from the Asia Pacific segment to the Americas segment. This transfer is reflected in the historical segment results for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Effective September 1, 2014 the Company completed the sale of its United Kingdom (UK) Door businesses to an unrelated third party. The businesses sold included the Dor-o-Matic™ branded automatic door business, the Martin Roberts™ branded performance steel doorset business and the UK service organization. Historical results of the component have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 17 - Discontinued Operations for more information.

The Company is currently evaluating this announcement.   Adoption of the Simadi rate would result in additional charges to remeasure the net monetary assets and impair other assets.

On February 11, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of

$0.10

cents per ordinary share. The dividend is payable March 31, 2015 to shareholders of record on March 17, 2015.
