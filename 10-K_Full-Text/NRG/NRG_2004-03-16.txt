PART I

Item 1 —

Business

General

NRG Energy, Inc., or “NRG Energy”,
“we”, “our”, or “us” is a
wholesale power generation company, primarily engaged in the
ownership and operation of power generation facilities and the
sale of energy, capacity and related products in the United
States and internationally. We have a diverse portfolio of
electric generation facilities in terms of geography, fuel type,
and dispatch levels. We seek to maximize operating income
through the efficient procurement and management of fuel
supplies and maintenance services, and the sale of energy,
capacity and ancillary services into attractive spot,
intermediate and long-term markets.

We were formed in 1992 as the non-regulated
subsidiary of Northern States Power, or “NSP”, which
was itself merged into New Century Energies, Inc. to form
Xcel Energy, Inc., or “Xcel Energy” in 2000.
While owned by NSP and later by Xcel Energy, we consistently
pursued an aggressive high growth strategy focused on power
plant acquisitions, high leverage and aggressive development,
including site development and turbine orders. In 2002, a number
of factors, most notably the aggressive prices paid by us for
our acquisitions of turbines, development projects and plants,
combined with the overall downturn in the power generation
industry, triggered a credit rating downgrade (below investment
grade) which, in turn, precipitated a severe liquidity
situation. On May 14, 2003, we and 25 of our direct and
indirect wholly owned subsidiaries commenced voluntary petitions
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
New York. On November 24, 2003, the bankruptcy court
entered an order confirming our plan of reorganization and the
plan became effective on December 5, 2003.

As part of the plan of reorganization, Xcel
Energy relinquished its ownership interest and we became an
independent public company upon our emergence from bankruptcy on
December 5, 2003. We no longer have any material
affiliation or relationship with Xcel Energy. As part of that
reorganization, we eliminated approximately $5.2 billion of
corporate level bank and bond debt and approximately
$1.3 billion of additional claims and disputes by
distributing a combination of equity and up to
$1.04 billion in cash among our unsecured creditors. In
addition to the debt reduction associated with the
restructuring, we used a substantial portion of the proceeds of
a recent note offering and borrowings under a new credit
facility, the “Refinancing Transactions,” to retire
approximately $1.7 billion of project-level debt. The
Refinancing Transactions eliminated certain structurally senior
project level debt and associated “cash traps” at
subsidiaries operating in the Northeast and South Central
regions of the United States. In January 2004, we used proceeds
of an additional note offering to repay $503.5 million of
the outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility.

As of December 31, 2003, we owned interests
in 72 power projects in seven countries having an aggregate
generation capacity of approximately 18,200 megawatts, or
“MW.” Approximately 7,900 MW of our capacity
consists of merchant power plants in the Northeast region of the
United States. Certain of these assets are located in
transmission constrained areas, including approximately
1,400 MW of “in-city” New York City
generation capacity and approximately 750 MW of southwest
Connecticut generation capacity. We also own approximately
2,500 MW of capacity in the South Central region of the
United States, with approximately 1,700 MW of that capacity
supported by long-term power purchase agreements. Our assets in
the West Coast region of the United States consist of
approximately 1,300 MW of capacity with the majority of
such capacity owned via our 50% interest in West Coast Power,
LLC, or “West Coast Power.” Our assets in the West
Coast region are supported by a power purchase agreement with
the California Department of Water Resources that runs through
December 2004. Our principal domestic generation assets consist
of a diversified mix of natural gas-, coal- and oil-fired
facilities, representing approximately 48%, 26% and 26% of our
total domestic generation capacity, respectively. We also own
interests in plants having a generation capacity of
approximately 3,000 MW in various international markets,
including Australia, Europe and Latin America. Our energy
marketing subsidiary, NRG Power Marketing, Inc., or
“PMI,” began operations in 1998 and is focused on
maximizing the value of our North American assets by providing
centralized contract origination and management services, and
through the efficient procurement and management of fuel and the
sale of energy and related products in the spot, intermediate
and long-term markets.



We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation on
May 29, 1992. Our headquarters and principal executive
offices are located at 901 Marquette Avenue, Suite 2300,
Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55402. Our telephone number is
(612) 373-5300. Our Internet website is
http://www.nrgenergy.com. Our recent annual reports, quarterly
reports, current reports and other periodic filings are
available free of charge through our Internet website. The
charters of our audit, compensation and nominating committee are
also available on our website at
http://www.nrgenergy.com/investors/corpgov.htm. These charters
are available in print to any shareholder who requests them.

The Bankruptcy Case

On May 14, 2003, we and 25 of our direct and
indirect wholly owned subsidiaries commenced voluntary petitions
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
New York, or “the bankruptcy court.” During the
bankruptcy proceedings, we continued to conduct our business and
manage our properties as debtors in possession pursuant to
sections 1107(a) and 1108 of the bankruptcy code. Our
subsidiaries that own our international operations, and certain
other subsidiaries, were not part of these chapter 11 cases
or any of the subsequent bankruptcy filings. On
November 24, 2003, the bankruptcy court entered an order
confirming the NRG plan of reorganization, and the plan became
effective on December 5, 2003.

Events Leading to the Commencement of the
    Chapter 11 Filing

Since the 1990’s, we pursued a strategy of
growth through acquisitions and later the development of new
construction projects. This strategy required significant
capital, much of which was satisfied with third party debt. Due
to a number of reasons, particularly our aggressive pricing of
acquisitions, and the overall downturn in the power generation
industry, our financial condition deteriorated significantly
starting in 2001. During 2002, our senior unsecured debt and our
project-level secured debt were downgraded multiple times by
rating agencies. In September 2002, we failed to make payments
due under certain unsecured bond obligations, which resulted in
further downgrades.

As a result of the downgrades, the debt load
incurred during the course of acquiring our assets, declining
power prices, increasing fuel prices, the overall downturn in
the power generation industry and the overall downturn in the
economy, we experienced severe financial difficulties. These
difficulties caused us to, among other things, miss scheduled
principal and interest payments due to our corporate lenders and
bondholders, be required to prepay for fuel and other related
delivery and transportation services and be required to provide
performance collateral in certain instances. We also recorded
asset impairment charges of approximately $3.1 billion
during 2002, while we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xcel
Energy, related to various operating projects as well as for
projects that were under construction which we had stopped
funding and turbines we had purchased for which we no longer had
a use.

In addition, our missed payments resulted in
cross-defaults of numerous other non-recourse and limited
recourse debt instruments and caused the acceleration of
multiple debt instruments, rendering such debt immediately due
and payable. In addition, as a result of the downgrades, we
received demands under outstanding letters of credit to post
collateral aggregating approximately $1.2 billion.

In August 2002, we retained financial and legal
restructuring advisors to assist our management in the
preparation of a comprehensive financial and operational
restructuring. In March 2003, Xcel Energy announced that its
board of directors had approved a tentative settlement agreement
with us, the holders of most of our long-term notes and the
steering committee representing our bank lenders.

We filed two plans of reorganization in
connection with our restructuring efforts. The first, filed on
May 14, 2003, and referred to as the NRG plan of
reorganization, relates to us and the other NRG plan debtors.
The second plan, relating to our Northeast and South Central
subsidiaries, which we refer to as the Northeast/ South Central
plan of reorganization, was filed on September 17, 2003. On
November 25, 2003, the bankruptcy court entered an order
confirming the Northeast/South Central plan of reorganization
and the plan became effective on December 23, 2003.



On June 6, 2003, LSP-Nelson Energy LLC and
NRG Nelson Turbines LLC filed for protection under
chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code and on August 19,
2003, NRG McClain LLC filed for protection under chapter 11
of the bankruptcy code. This annual report does not address the
plans of reorganization of these subsidiaries because they are
not material to our operations and we expect to sell or
otherwise dispose of our interest in each subsidiary subsequent
to our reorganization.

The following description of the material terms
of the NRG plan of reorganization and the Northeast/ South
Central plan of reorganization is subject to, and qualified in
its entirety by, reference to the detailed provisions of the NRG
plan of reorganization and NRG disclosure statement, and the
Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization and Northeast/
South Central disclosure statement, all of which are available
for review upon request.

NRG Plan of Reorganization

The NRG plan of reorganization is the result of
several months of intense negotiations, among us, Xcel Energy
and the two principal committees representing our creditor
groups, which we refer to as the Global Steering Committee and
the Noteholder Committee. A principal component of the NRG plan
of reorganization is a settlement with Xcel Energy in which Xcel
Energy agreed to make a contribution consisting of cash (and,
under certain circumstances, its stock) in the aggregate amount
of up to $640 million to be paid in three separate
installments following the effective date of the NRG plan of
reorganization. The Xcel Energy settlement agreement resolves
any and all claims existing between Xcel Energy and us and/or
our creditors and, in exchange for the Xcel Energy contribution,
Xcel Energy is receiving a complete release of claims from us
and our creditors, except for a limited number of creditors who
have preserved their claims as set forth in the confirmation
order entered on November 24, 2003.

Under the terms of the Xcel Energy settlement
agreement, the Xcel Energy contribution will be or has been paid
as follows:

•

An initial installment of $238 million in
    cash was paid on February 20, 2004.

•

A second installment of $50 million in cash
    was paid on February 20, 2004.

•

A third installment of $352 million in cash,
    which Xcel Energy is required to pay on April 30, 2004.

On November 24, 2003, the bankruptcy court
issued an order confirming the NRG plan of reorganization, and
the plan became effective on December 5, 2003. To
consummate the NRG plan of reorganization, we have or will,
among other things:

•

Satisfy general unsecured claims by:

•

issuing new NRG Energy common stock to holders of
    certain classes of allowed general unsecured claims; and

•

making cash payments in the amount of up to
    $1.04 billion to holders of certain classes of allowed
    general unsecured claims of which $500 million was paid
    with proceeds of the Refinancing Transactions.

•

Satisfy certain secured claims by either:

•

distributing the collateral to the security
    holder,

•

selling the collateral and distributing the
    proceeds to the security holder or

•

other mutually agreeable treatment.

•

Issue to Xcel Energy a $10 million
    non-amortizing promissory note which will:

•

accrue interest at a rate of 3% per
    annum, and

•

mature 2.5 years after the effective date of
    the NRG plan of reorganization.



Northeast/ South Central Plan of
    Reorganization

The Northeast/ South Central plan of
reorganization was proposed on September 17, 2003 after we
secured the necessary financing commitments. On
November 25, 2003, the bankruptcy court issued an order
confirming the Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization
and the plan became effective on December 23, 2003. In
connection with the order confirming the Northeast/ South
Central plan of reorganization, the court entered a separate
order which provides that the allowed amount of the
bondholders’ claims shall equal in the aggregate the sum of
(i) $1.3 billion plus (ii) any accrued and unpaid
interest at the applicable contract rates through the date of
payment to the indenture trustee plus (iii) the reasonable
fees, costs or expenses of the collateral agent and indenture
trustee (other than reasonable professional fees incurred from
October 1, 2003) plus (iv) $19.6 million,
ratably, for each holder of bonds based upon the current
outstanding principal amount of the bonds and irrespective of
(a) the date of maturity of the bonds, (b) the
interest rate applicable to such bonds and (c) the issuer
of the bonds. The settlement further provides that the
Northeast/ South Central debtors shall reimburse the informal
committee of secured bondholders, the indenture trustee, the
collateral agent, and two additional bondholder groups, for any
reasonable professional fees, costs or expenses incurred from
October 1, 2003 through January 31, 2004 up to a
maximum amount of $2.5 million (including in such amount
any post-October 1, 2003 fees already reimbursed), with the
exception that the parties to the settlement reserved their
respective rights with respect to any additional reasonable
fees, costs or expenses incurred subsequent to November 25,
2003 related to matters not reasonably contemplated by the
implementation of the settlement of the Northeast/ South Central
plan of reorganization.

The creditors of Northeast and South Central
subsidiaries are unimpaired by the Northeast/ South Central plan
of reorganization. This means that holders of allowed general
unsecured claims were paid in cash, in full on the effective
date of the Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization.
Holders of allowed secured claims will receive or have received
either (i) cash equal to the unpaid portion of their
allowed unsecured claim, (ii) treatment that leaves
unaltered the legal, equitable and contractual rights to which
such unsecured claim entitles the holder of such claim,
(iii) treatment that otherwise renders such unsecured claim
unimpaired pursuant to section 1124 of the bankruptcy code
or (iv) such other, less favorable treatment that is
confirmed in writing as being acceptable to such holder and to
the applicable debtor.

Fresh Start Reporting

As a result of our emergence from bankruptcy, we
have adopted Fresh Start reporting, or “Fresh Start.”
Under Fresh Start, our confirmed enterprise value has been
allocated to our assets and liabilities based on their
respective fair values in conformity with the purchase method of
accounting for business combinations. See
Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operation — Reorganization and Emergence from
Bankruptcy for additional information.

Strategy

We own and operate a diverse portfolio of
electric generation facilities, which we believe have strategic
locational advantages. Through our reorganization, we intend to
reposition ourselves in our industry to focus on owning,
operating and maximizing the value of our generation assets. We
are implementing this strategy through the following key actions:



•

continuing our focus on operating power plants in
    a safe, secure and environmentally compliant manner, and

•

to the extent that our locationally-advantaged
    power plants can no longer be operated profitably, seeking to
    redevelop those sites for alternative use.

Competition

The future course of the restructuring of the
wholesale power generation industry is difficult to predict, but
it is likely to include consolidation within the industry, the
sale, bankruptcy or liquidation of certain competitors, the
re-regulation of certain markets and the long-term reduction in
new investment into the industry. Under any scenario, however,
we anticipate that we will continue to face competition from
numerous companies in the industry. We anticipate that the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or “FERC”, will
continue its efforts to facilitate the competitive energy market
place throughout the country on several fronts but particularly
by encouraging utilities to voluntarily participate in Regional
Transmission Organizations, or “RTOs.”

Many companies in the regulated utility industry,
with which the wholesale power industry is closely linked, are
also restructuring or reviewing their strategies. Several of
those companies are discontinuing their unregulated activities,
seeking to divest of their unregulated subsidiaries or
attempting to have their regulated subsidiaries acquire assets
out of their or other companies’ unregulated subsidiaries.
This may lead to increased competition between the regulated
utilities and the unregulated power producers within certain
markets.

Competitive Strengths

We believe that we benefit from the following
competitive strengths:

Plant Diversity.

Our
generation fleet includes base-load, intermediate and peaking
facilities, giving us the opportunity to maximize our profit
opportunities along the entire energy dispatch curve. Our
generation facilities are likewise diversified by fuel-type,
including coal, oil and natural gas. The diversity of
technology, fuel type and operational characteristics allows us
to participate in most aspects of the electricity demand cycle.
By offering what we believe to be an efficient mix of
generation, we are able to offer competitive prices to our
customers and optimize the revenue potential across the entire
fleet. For example, in the current high gas price environment,
our coal assets, such as Huntley, Dunkirk, Big Cajun II and
Indian River, have a distinct competitive advantage due to the
relatively low marginal cost of coal. Peaking assets can provide
increased revenue by taking advantage of higher prices in
periods of increased demand in the energy markets. Further,
peaking and intermediate assets can provide emergency back-up
when our base-load plants experience outages.

Regional Strength.

We have a number of power plants in the Northeast, South Central
and West Coast regions of the United States, providing a degree
of economies of scale throughout the organization, and reducing
our dependence on any single market. Owning multiple plants in a
particular market provides us greater dispatch flexibility and
increases power marketing opportunities.

Locational
Advantages.

We own and operate a
number of facilities that are strategically located near large
urban areas or in certain transmission-constrained areas with
locational advantages over our competition. For example, the
Astoria and Arthur Kill plants are situated inside the
New York City market. Due to transmission constraints and
local installed capacity requirements of the New York
Independent System Operator, or “NYISO”, competitors
outside the city limits are restricted from importing power into
New York City, and therefore do not have the advantage of
“in city” generation. Certain facilities in California
near the Los Angeles and San Diego load centers use ocean
water cooling that gives them competitive advantages, especially
during water shortages. Additionally, construction of new power
plants in areas such as New York City and California is
limited because of the difficulty in:

•

finding sites for new plants;



•

overcoming the general public’s
    “not-in-my-backyard” mentality;

•

obtaining the necessary permits; and

•

arranging fuel supplies.

The value of some of our plants is also enhanced
by the potential for re-powering or site expansion.

Risk Mitigation.

As
a wholesale generator, we are subject to the risks associated
with volatility in fuel and power prices. We mitigate these
risks by managing a portfolio of contractual assets for both
power supply and fuel requirements. In the near term our
portfolio will be weighted toward spot market sales and
short-term contracts because long-term contracts are not
generally available at attractive prices. We expect that these
generally weak market conditions will continue for the
foreseeable future in some markets. As the markets improve, we
will seek opportunities to enter into longer-term agreements in
order to capture more stable returns and predictable cash flow.
We manage counterparty credit risk by doing our own credit
assessment of the companies with which we trade and when
necessary by requiring appropriate credit support in the form of
cash collateral or letters of credit.

Improved Financial
Position.

As part of the NRG plan of
reorganization, we eliminated approximately $5.2 billion of
corporate level bank and bond debt and approximately
$1.3 billion of additional claims and disputes by
distributing a combination of equity and up to
$1.04 billion in cash among our unsecured creditors.

Performance Metrics

The following table contains a summary of our
North American power generation revenues from majority owned
subsidiaries for the year 2003, includes both Predecessor
Company and Reorganized NRG revenues (in thousands of dollars):

*

Consists of our wholly-owned subsidiary, NEO
    California LLC.

**

For additional information — see
    Item 15 — Note 20 of the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for our consolidated revenues by segment
    disclosures.

***

Includes miscellaneous revenues from the sale of
    natural gas, recovery of incurred costs under reliability
    agreements and revenues received under leasing arrangements.

In understanding our business, we believe that
certain performance metrics are particularly important. These
are industry statistics defined by the North American Electric
Reliability Council and as more fully described below:

Annual Equivalent Availability Factor, or
“EAF”:

is the Total
Available Hours a unit is available in a year minus the
summation of all Partial Outage events in a year converted to
Equivalent Hours (EH) where EH is partial Megawatts lost
divided by unit Net Available Capacity times hours of each event
and the net of these hours is divided by hours in a year to
achieve EAF in percent.

Average heat rate:

We calculate the average heat rate for our fossil-fired power
plants (excluding peakers) by dividing (a) fuel consumed in
Btu’s by (b) KWh generated. The resultant heat rate is
a measure of fuel efficiency.

Net Capacity Factor:

Net actual generation divided by net maximum capacity for the
period hours.



In-Market Availability, or
“IMA”:

IMA is the ratio of
the calculated revenue earned compared to an estimation of the
potential revenues that would have been earned if the facility
had been available 100 percent of the time it was
considered to be “in-market”, as determined by NRG
Power Marketing, for the period under consideration.

The table below presents the North America power
generation performance metrics discussed above.

The table below presents the Australian power
generation performance metrics discussed above.

Power Generation

Northeast Region

Facilities.

As of
December 31, 2003, we owned approximately 7,900 MW of
net generating in the Northeast Region of the United States,
primarily in New York, Connecticut and Delaware. These
generation facilities are diversified in terms of dispatch level
(base-load, intermediate and peaking), fuel type (coal, natural
gas and oil) and customers.

The Northeast Region power generation assets as
of December 31, 2003 are summarized in the table below.

Market Framework.

Our largest asset base is located in the Northeast region. This
region is comprised of investments in generation facilities
primarily located in the physical control areas of the NYISO,
the ISO New England, Inc., or “ISO-NE”, and the
Pennsylvania, Jersey, Maryland Interconnection, or
“PJM.”



Although each of the three northeast ISOs are
functionally, administratively and operationally independent
from one another, they all tend to follow, to a certain extent,
the FERC endorsed model for Standard Market Design, or
“SMD.” The physical power deliveries in these markets
are financially settled by Locational Marginal Prices, or
“LMPs”, which reflect the value of energy at a
specific location at the specific time it is delivered. This
value is determined by an ISO administered auction process,
which evaluates and selects the least cost of supplier offers or
‘bids’ to fill the specific locational requirement.
The ISO sponsored LMP energy marketplaces consist of two
separate and characteristically distinct settlement time frames.
The first is a security constrained, financially firm, “Day
Ahead” unit commitment, or “DAM.” The second is a
financially settled, security constrained “Real Time”
dispatch and balancing market, or “RT.” In addition to
energy delivery, the ISOs manage secondary markets for installed
capacity, ancillary services and financial transmission rights.

Market Developments.

On March 1, 2003, ISO-NE implemented its version of
SMD. This change modified the New England market structure by
incorporating LMP, which means pricing by location rather than
on a New England wide basis. Even though we view this change as
an improvement to the existing market design, we still view the
market within New England as incapable of allowing us to recover
our costs and earn a reasonable return on our investment.

On February 26, 2003, we filed a proposed
cost of service agreement with FERC for the following
Connecticut facilities: Devon station units 11-14, Middletown
station, Montville station and Norwalk station (FERC Docket No
ER03-563-000). In response, on March 25, 2003, FERC issued
an order, “the March 25, 2003 Order”, approving a
tracking mechanism for the payment of or recovery of certain
maintenance expenses, subject to refund, and authorized an
effective date of February 27, 2003. In the March 25,
2003 Order, FERC also permitted ISO-NE, via an escrow account,
to start collecting the maintenance expenses from certain NEPOOL
participants in order to ensure the availability of our units.
In its March 25, 2003 Order, FERC did not rule on the
remainder of the issues to allow further time to consider
protests it received related to the filing. On February 6,
2004, we filed updated maintenance schedules for the period
April 1, 2004 through March 31, 2005.

On April 25, 2003, FERC issued an order
rejecting the remaining part of the proposed cost of service
agreements including the monthly cost-based payment, citing
certain policy determinations regarding cost of service
agreements. Rather, FERC instructed ISO-NE to establish
temporary bidding rules that would permit selected units (units
with capacity factors of ten percent or less during 2002),
operating within designated congestion areas, such as
Connecticut, to raise their bids to allow them the opportunity
to recover their fixed and variable costs through the market. In
May and June 2003, the ISO-NE revised its market rules to
facilitate “peaking unit safe harbor”, or
“PUSH”, bidding. On July 24, 2003, FERC clarified
that the capacity factor of ten percent or less applies to units
rather than stations. Therefore, on a unit basis, all of our
facilities qualify to bid under the temporary rules, except
Middletown units 2 and 3. The PUSH bidding rule will remain in
place until ISO-NE implements locational installed capacity
payments, which FERC mandated ISO-NE implement no later than
June 1, 2004. On March 1, 2004, ISO-NE filed a
locational capacity proposal with FERC. Under the proposal,
generators that are needed for reliability and have a capacity
factor of 15% or less in 2003 are eligible for a monthly
capacity payment of $5.38 per KW-month. Most of our
generators located in Connecticut satisfy this requirement.

Consistent with our expectations, PUSH bidding
has not yielded sufficient revenues to cover all our costs for
most of our affected facilities. We intend to take additional
actions with FERC and other Connecticut parties to attempt to
address the expected revenue deficiency. On January 16,
2004, we filed proposed reliability-must-run agreements, or
“RMR agreements”, with FERC for the following
facilities: Devon station units 11-14, Middletown station and
Montville station. The RMR agreement filings requested FERC to
establish cost of service rates. The FERC has not yet acted on
this matter.

In addition to the facilities noted above, the
following of our quick-start facilities in Connecticut have
submitted PUSH bids that have been approved by FERC: Cos Cob,
Franklin Drive, Branford, and Torrington. The existing RMR
agreement between ISO-NE and us covering Devon station units 7
and 8 terminated on September 30, 2003. On
October 2, 2003, we filed with FERC to extend the existing
RMR agreement for the



two Devon units. On December 1, 2003, FERC
granted us a one day suspension of the rates, subject to refund,
set the case for hearing and appointed a settlement judge. On
February 25, 2004, a FERC sponsored technical conference
occurred to review the costs associated with the two Devon
units. In the technical conference, our costs relevant to the
RMR agreements were discussed. Also, we expect to file an
amended cost of service filing with the FERC relative to Devon
units 7 & 8 in order to make the cost assumptions for
Devon 7 & 8 similar to that of the RMR agreements. ISO
NE has indicated in a letter dated February 27, 2004 that
one of the Devon units will no longer be needed for reliability
services. Therefore, one of the Devon units 7 & 8
agreements will be terminated effective April 28, 2004.

In April of 2003, the NYISO implemented a demand
curve in its capacity market and scarcity pricing improvements
in its energy market. The New York demand curve eliminated
the previous market structure’s tendency to price capacity
at either its cap (deficiency rate) or near zero. In a complaint
filed with FERC on December 15, 2003, Consolidated Edison
Company of New York, Inc. and other load-serving
entities alleged that NYISO had used the wrong rate setting
methodology to establish prices and rebates in the New York
City markets for a portion of the summer capacity auction in
2003, and that this action resulted in overcharges to customers
and overpayments to suppliers, including us, totaling
approximately $21 million, with our share being
approximately $5 million. If the complaint were granted, we
may be required to refund payments. On December 19, 2003,
the Electricity Consumers Resource Council appealed the FERC
decision approving the demand curve in the United States Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. If the appeal
is granted, it could require the elimination of the demand curve
for the capacity market. On February 11, 2004, a FERC
sponsored settlement conference took place without successful
resolution of the issue. The NYISO scarcity pricing improvements
have re-introduced some volatility in the New York energy
markets when supplies are short.

The NYISO intends to introduce additional changes
to its energy market in early 2004, with the implementation of
Standard Market Design 2. Although the exact nature of these
changes is not known at this time, we anticipate the changes to
be small, targeted improvements to the NYISO’s present
market.

In PJM, we are closely following market power
mitigation modifications that may significantly impact the
revenues achievable in that market by modifying PJM’s price
capping mechanisms. On April 2, 2003, Reliant
Resources, Inc., or “Reliant”, filed a complaint
against PJM with FERC and suggested specific modifications to
PJM’s price mitigation rules. On June 9, 2003, FERC
rejected the Reliant modifications but required PJM to file a
report to address the concerns of Reliant by September 30,
2003. The PJM market monitoring unit filed its compliance filing
with FERC as required, but opted to continue its present
mitigation practices. The present mitigation plan permits PJM to
“cost-cap” the energy bids of certain generating
facilities that were constructed prior to 1996. The cost capping
method is based on a facility’s variable costs plus ten
percent. In addition, the PJM market monitoring unit filed to
eliminate the exemption that units built after 1996 had from
PJM’s mitigation measures. This change, if approved by
FERC, will impact certain of our facilities within PJM. It will
also continue a practice that has depressed prices in PJM. The
PJM market monitoring unit’s actions were not endorsed by
the requisite number of market participants. It is unclear at
this time, what actions FERC will take and how this will impact
us.

South Central Region

Facilities.

As of
December 31, 2003, we owned approximately 2,500 MW of
net generating capacity in the South Central United States. The
South Central region generating assets consist primarily of our
power generation facilities in New Roads, Louisiana, or
“the Cajun Facilities”, and also include the
Sterlington and Bayou Cove generating facilities.

Our portfolio of plants in Louisiana comprises
the second largest generator in the Southeastern Electric
Reliability Council/ Entergy, or “SERC-Entergy”
region. The core of these assets are the Cajun Facilities which
are primarily coal-fired assets supported by long-term power
purchase agreements with regional cooperatives.



The South Central region power generation assets
as of December 31, 2003 are summarized in the table below.

*

Units 1 and 2 owned 100%, Unit 3 owned 58%.

Market Framework.

Our South Central region assets are located within the control
areas of the local, regulated, and sometimes vertically
integrated, utilities, primarily Entergy Corporation, or
“Entergy.” The utility performs the scheduling,
reserve and reliability functions that are administered by the
ISOs in certain other regions of the United States and Canada.
We operate a National Electric Reliability Council, or
“NERC”, certified control area within the Entergy
control area, which is comprised of our generating assets and
our co-op customer loads. Although the reliability functions
performed are essentially the same, the primary differences
between these markets lie principally in the physical delivery
and price discovery mechanisms. In the South Central region, all
power sales and purchases are consummated bilaterally between
individual counter-parties, and physically delivered either
within or across the physical control areas of the transmission
owners from the source generator to the sink load. Transacting
counter-parties are required to reserve and purchase
transmission services from the intervening transmission owners
at their FERC approved tariff rates. Included with these
transmission services are the reserve and ancillary costs.
Energy prices in the South Central region are determined and
agreed to in bilateral negotiations between representatives of
the transacting counter-parties, using market information
gleaned by the individual marketing agents arranging the
transactions.

Market Developments.

In the South Central region, including Entergy’s service
territory, the present energy market is not a centralized market
and does not have an independent system operator as is found in
the Northeast markets. Rather, the energy market is made up of
bilateral contractual relations. We presently have long-term all
requirements contracts with 11 Louisiana Distribution
Cooperatives, and long-term contracts with the Municipal Energy
Agency of Mississippi, South Mississippi Electric Power
Association and Southwestern Electric Power Company. The
Distribution Cooperatives serve approximately 300,000 to 350,000
retail customers.

In the Southeast portion of the United States,
Entergy and Southern Company recently discontinued their RTO
initiative, SeTrans. It is unclear at this time how this recent
development will impact us, or whether another RTO proposal will
replace the SeTrans initiative.

West Coast Region

Facilities.

As of
December 31, 2003, we owned approximately 1,300 MW of
net generating capacity in the West Coast region, primarily in
California and Nevada. Our west coast generation assets consist
primarily of a 50% interest in West Coast Power LLC.

In May 1999, we formed West Coast Power, along
with Dynegy, Inc., or “Dynegy”, to serve as the
holding company for a portfolio of operating companies that own
generation assets in Southern California in the California
Independent System Operator, or “Cal ISO” market. This
portfolio currently consists of the El Segundo Generating
Station, the Long Beach Generating Station, the Encina
Generating Station and 13 combustion turbines in the
San Diego area. Dynegy provides power marketing and fuel
procurement services to West Coast Power, and we provide
operations and management services. An application for a permit
to repower the existing El Segundo site, replacing the retired
unit 1 & 2 with 600 MW of new generation has been
filed. The permit is in the California Energy Commission review
process, and it is anticipated that the



Presiding Member’s Proposed Decision issued
in January 2004 recommending approval of the redevelopment
project will be adopted by the Commission during the first
quarter of 2004. However, we would not proceed with the
construction of the new project absent a long-term power
purchase agreement or tolling arrangement supporting the
financial investment necessary for this repowering.

The West Coast region power generation assets as
of December 31, 2003 are summarized in the table below.

Market Framework.

Our West Coast region assets are primarily located within the
control area of the Cal ISO. The Cal ISO operates a financially
settled “Real Time” balancing market. “Day
Ahead” energy markets in the west are currently similar to
those in the South Central region with all power sales and
purchases consummated bilaterally between individual
counter-parties and scheduled for physical delivery with the Cal
ISO.

Market Developments.

In California, the Cal ISO continues with its plan to move
toward markets similar to PJM, NYISO and ISO-NE with its MDO2
initiative (market design 2002). The Cal ISO intends that MDO2
will establish a standardized day ahead market and real time
market that allows for multiple settlements. Presently the Cal
ISO market does not include a capacity market. In general, the
Cal ISO is continuing along a path of small incremental changes,
rather than significant market restructuring. Although numerous
stakeholder meetings have been held, the final market design
remains unknown at this time. The effect of the MDO2 changes on
us cannot be determined at this time.

In addition to the Cal ISO’s market changes,
numerous legislative initiatives in California create
uncertainty and risk for us. Most significantly, SB39XX mandates
that the California Public Utilities Commission, or
“CPUC” exercise jurisdiction over the maintenance
procedures of wholesale power generators. This effort has slowed
in recent months, due to an Executive Order issued by Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger that directs all government agencies to
evaluate regulations that could harm business and business
development in the state. The Executive Order effectively put a
nine month hold on all regulations identified, and it is unclear
at this time where that process will lead. The CPUC recently
issued draft orders directing the utilities to meet a 17%
reserve requirement by no later than the beginning of 2008.

The Cal ISO has protested the timeframe and those
discussions may result in changes for procurement by the
utilities that may present opportunities to enter into new
bilateral agreements. In addition, the CPUC has adopted an
order, which allows the load serving investor owned utilities to
purchase energy and capacity through contracts with generators
for up to a one year term. A longer term procurement proceeding
is pending. It is the intention of the West Coast Power LLC
entities to arrange for short term and longer term capacity
agreements beginning in January 2005 after the current
California Department of Water Resources, or “CDWR”,
agreement expires.

Other North America Region

Facilities.

As of
December 31, 2003, we owned approximately 3,500 MW of
net generating capacity in our other regions of the United
States.



Our Other North America power generation assets
as of December 31, 2003 are summarized in the table below.

*

May sell or dispose of in the next 12 months.

Market Developments.

In the Midwest, it is anticipated that Exelon Corporation will
be partially integrated into PJM by the second quarter of 2004,
and will transition to PJM’s LMP market model soon
thereafter. Exelon is the parent corporation of PECO Energy
Company and Commonwealth Edison, or “ComEd.” On
November 25, 2003, FERC issued an order requiring American
Electric Power, or “AEP”, to join PJM. In the order
the FERC stated that AEP must comply with its prior commitment
to join an RTO, namely PJM. Previously, the actions taken by the
Virginia legislature had restricted AEP’s ability to join
PJM. At this time the effect of the November 25, 2003 order
is unclear. Consequently, Exelon, and our Chicago area assets,
could be somewhat isolated from the rest of PJM. The impact of
the Exelon integration on us is also unclear at this time. Also
on December 31, 2003, PJM requested that FERC approve
certain changes to the PJM Operating Agreement in order to
permit ComEd to join PJM. On December 31, 2003 and
February 5, 2004, PJM filed proposed mitigation plans for
the ComEd territory. Among the requested changes was the
proposed adoption for the PJM energy market mitigation plan of
“cost capping” and a new mitigation plan for the
capacity market. Under this mitigation plan, bids into the
capacity market would be limited to incremental costs. These two
mitigation proposals, if approved, could negatively impact our
facilities located in ComEd’s territory.

International

Facilities.

Over the
past decade we, through our foreign subsidiaries, invested in
international power generation projects in Asia Pacific, Europe
and Latin America. During 2002, we sold international generation
projects with an aggregate total generating capacity of
approximately 600 MW. As of December 31, 2003, we,
through certain foreign subsidiaries, had investments in power
generation projects located in Australia, the UK, Germany, South
America and Taiwan with approximately 3,000 MW of net
generating capacity.



Our international power generation assets as of
December 31, 2003 are summarized in the table below.

Alternative Energy and Services

In addition to our traditional power generation
facilities discussed above, we own alternative energy generation
facilities through NEO Corporation, or “NEO” and
through our NRG Resource Recovery business division, which
processes municipal solid waste as fuel to generate power. In
addition, we own district heating and cooling and steam
transmission operations through NRG Thermal LLC.

NEO Corporation.

NEO
is a wholly owned subsidiary that was formed to develop power
generation facilities ranging in size from 1 to 33 MW in
the United States. As of December 31, 2003, NEO has
ownership interests in 9 landfill gas collection systems and had
17 MW of net ownership interests in related electric
generation facilities utilizing landfill gas as fuel. NEO also
had 42 MW of net ownership interests in 17 hydroelectric
facilities and 107 MW of net ownership interests in five
distributed generation facilities including 93 MW of
gas-fired peaking engines in California (referred to as the Red
Bluff and Chowchilla facilities and included in our summary of
the West Coast region). Certain of the assets owned by NEO are
currently being marketed. See “Significant Dispositions of
Non-Strategic Assets” under this Item 1 for more
information.

NEO’s power generation assets as of
December 31, 2003 are summarized in the table below.



*

May sell or dispose of in the next
    12 months, excluding our Chowchilla or Red Bluff facilities
    (assets held for use).

Resource Recovery
Facilities.

Our Resource Recovery
business is focused on owning and operating alternative
fuel/“green power” generation and fuels processing
projects. The alternative fuels currently processed and
combusted are municipal solid waste, urban wood waste (pallets,
clean construction debris, etc.), and non-recyclable waste paper
and compost. Our Resource Recovery business has municipal solid
waste processing capacity of approximately 3,400 tons per day
and generation capacity of 25 MW, of which our net
ownership interest is 18 MW. Our Resource Recovery business
owns and operates municipal solid waste processing and/or
generation facilities in Maine and Minnesota. Our Resource
Recovery business also owns and operates NRG Processing
Solutions which includes thirteen composting and biomass fuel
processing sites in Minnesota, of which three sites are
permitted to operate as municipal solid waste transfer stations.

Our significant Resource Recovery assets as of
December 31, 2003 are summarized in the table below.

*

The Newport facilities are related strictly to
    municipal solid waste processing.

**

For the Elk River facility, our 85% interest is
    related strictly to municipal solid waste processing.

***

May sell or dispose of in the next 12 months.

Thermal and Chilled Water
Businesses.

We have interests in
district heating and cooling systems and steam transmission
operations through our subsidiary NRG Thermal LLC. NRG
Thermal’s steam and chilled water businesses have a steam
and chilled water capacity of approximately 1,290 megawatt
thermal equivalents, or “MWt”.

As of December 31, 2003, NRG Thermal owned
five district heating and cooling systems in Minneapolis,
Minnesota; San Francisco, California; Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and San Diego,
California. These systems provide steam heating to approximately
600 customers and chilled water to 90 customers. In
addition, NRG Thermal owns and operates three projects that
serve industrial/government customers with high-pressure steam
and hot water, and an 88 MW combustion turbine peaking
generation facility and an 18 MW coal-fired cogeneration
facility in Dover, Delaware (included in the summary of the
Other North America region).



Our thermal and chilled water assets as of
December 31, 2003 are summarized in the table below.

*

Thermal production and transmission capacity is
    based on 1,000 Btus per pound of steam production or
    transmission capacity. The unit mmBtu is equal to one million
    Btus.

Energy Marketing

Our energy marketing subsidiary, PMI began
operations in 1998. PMI provides a full range of energy
management services for our domestic generation facilities.
These services are provided under bilateral contracts or agency
agreements pursuant to which PMI manages the sales and purchases
of energy, capacity and ancillary services from the facilities,
procures the fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) and associated
transportation and manages the emission allowance credits for
these facilities. In addition, PMI provides all necessary ISO
bidding, dispatch and transmission scheduling for the
facilities. PMI utilizes its contractual arrangements with third
parties in order to procure fuel and to sell energy, capacity
and ancillary services to minimize administrative costs and
burdens and reduce the amount of collateral requirements imposed
by third party suppliers and purchasers, thereby easing credit
and liquidity concerns.

NRG Worldwide Operations

NRG Worldwide Operations, or “NRG
Operations”, provides operating and maintenance services to
our generation fleet. These services include providing
experienced personnel for the operation and administration of
each facility and oversight out of the corporate office to
balance resources, share expertise and best practices and ensure
the optimum utilization of resources available to the fleet. In
addition, NRG Operations provides



overall fleet management, strategic planning and
the development and dissemination of consistent fleet wide
policies and practices.

NRG Operations typically provides services to
project entities by entering into a Service Agreement with the
project company. Service Agreements provide a contractual basis
and definition of the rights and responsibilities of the
operating companies and the asset owners for each project that
is operated by NRG Operations. NRG Operations’ operating
companies provide a uniform suite of services that address
management, technical, contractual, commercial and other
business issues as well as safety, security and environmental
compliance services and strategies.

Financial Information About Segments and
Geographic Areas

For financial information on our operations on a
geographical and on a segment basis, see
Item 15 — Note 20 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Dispositions of Non-Strategic Assets

Since 2002, we sold or made arrangements to sell
a number of consolidated businesses and equity investments in an
effort to reduce our debt and improve liquidity. Dispositions
completed during 2003 and announced pending dispositions as of
February 29, 2004 are summarized in the following chart:

(1)

Discontinued operations.

In addition to the announced pending dispositions
described in the table above, definitive agreements have been
executed in connection with the sale of our interests in certain
other projects. In addition, we are continuing to market other
non-strategic assets.

Significant Customers

Predecessor Company

For the period from January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003, sales to one customer, NYISO, accounted
for 30.5% of our total revenues from majority owned operations.
Also during 2002, NYISO accounted for 23.7% of our total
revenues from majority owned operations. During 2001, we derived
approximately 51.1% of our total revenues from majority-owned
operations from two customers: NYISO



33.6% and Connecticut Light and Power Co. 17.5%.
We account for the revenues attributable to the significant
customers noted above as part of our North American power
generation segment.

Reorganized NRG

For the period from December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003, we derived approximately 35.5% of our
total revenues from majority-owned operations from two
customers: NYISO 24.1% and ISO New England 11.4%. We account for
the revenues attributable to the NYISO and ISO New England as
part of our North American power generation segment. NYISO is an
ISO, which is a FERC-regulated entity that manages the
transmission assets that are collectively under the control of
the ISO to provide non-discriminatory access to the transmission
grid. The NYISO exercises operational control over most of
New York State’s transmission facilities. We
anticipate that NYISO will continue to be a significant customer
given the scale of our asset base in the NYISO control area.

The following table shows the percent of total
revenue each segment contributes to our total revenue:

Seasonality and Price Volatility

Annual and quarterly operating results can be
significantly affected by weather and price volatility.
Significant other events, such as demand for natural gas for
heating and reduced hydroelectric capacity due to drier seasons
can increase seasonal fuel and power price volatility. We derive
a majority of our annual revenues in the months of May through
September, when demand for electricity is the highest in our
North American markets. Further, volatility is generally higher
in the summer months due to the effect of temperature
variations. Our second most important season is winter where
volatility and price spikes in underlying fuel prices has tended
to drive seasonal electricity prices. Issues related to the
seasonality and price volatility are fairly uniform across our
business segments.

Sources and Availability of Raw
Materials

Our raw material requirements primarily include
various forms of fossil fuel energy sources, including oil,
natural gas and coal. We obtain our oil, natural gas and coal
from multiple sources and availability is generally not an
issue, although localized shortages and supplier financial
stability issues can and do occur. The prices of oil, natural
gas and coal are subject to macro-and micro-economic forces that
can change dramatically in both the short term and the long
term. For example, the prices of natural gas and oil were
particularly high during the winter of 2002-2003 due to weather
volatility and geo-political uncertainty in the Middle East.
Oil, natural gas and coal represented approximately 37.1% and
38.6% of our cost of operations for the period January 1,
2003 through December 5, 2003 and the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003,
respectively. Issues related to the sources and availability of
raw materials are fairly uniform across our business segments.



Employees

As of December 31, 2003, we had 2,892
employees, approximately 478 of whom are employed directly by us
and approximately 2,414 of whom are employed by our wholly owned
subsidiaries and affiliates. Approximately 1,020 employees are
covered by bargaining agreements. During 2003, we have
experienced no significant labor stoppages or labor disputes at
our facilities.

Federal Energy Regulation

Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.

The FERC is an independent
agency that regulates the transmission and wholesale sale of
electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the
Federal Power Act, or “FPA.” The FPA also gives FERC
jurisdiction over: a public utility’s issuance of
securities or assumption of liabilities; the dispositions of
jurisdictional assets; and the licensing and inspecting of
private, municipal and state-owned hydroelectric projects. In
addition, FERC determines whether a generation facility
qualifies for Exempt Wholesale Generator, or “EWG”
status under Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, or
“PUHCA.” FERC also determines whether a generation
facility meets the ownership and technical criteria of a
Qualifying Facility, or “QF” under Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, or “PURPA.”

Federal Power Act.

The Federal Power Act, or “FPA”, gives FERC exclusive
rate-making jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and
transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. FERC
regulates the owners of facilities used for the wholesale sale
of electricity or transmission in interstate commerce as
“public utilities.” The FPA also gives FERC
jurisdiction to review certain transactions and numerous other
activities of public utilities. Our QFs are exempt from the
FERC’s FPA rate regulation.

Public utilities are required to obtain
FERC’s acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale
sales of electricity. Because our non-QF generating companies
are selling electricity in the wholesale market, such generating
companies are deemed to be public utilities for purposes of the
FPA. FERC has granted our generating and power marketing
companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based
rates. Usually, the FERC’s orders that grant our generating
and power marketing companies market-based rate authority
reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if FERC
subsequently determines that we possess excessive market power.
If our generating and power marketing companies were to lose
their market-based rate authority, such companies may be
required to obtain FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-service
rate schedule and may become subject to the accounting,
record-keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on
utilities with cost-based rate schedules.

In addition, the FPA gives FERC jurisdiction over
a public utility’s issuance of securities or assumption of
liabilities. However, FERC usually grants blanket approval for
future securities issuances or assumptions of liabilities to
entities with market-based rate authority. In the event that one
of our public utility generating companies were to lose its
market-based rate authority, our future securities issuances or
assumptions of liabilities could require prior approval of the
FERC. In addition, FERC has issued an order in connection with
our reorganization that implies that FERC believes that we, even
though we are not a public utility under the FPA, may require
FERC’s approval before we can issue securities or assume
liabilities subsequent to our reorganization.

The FPA also requires the FERC’s prior
approval for the transfer of control over assets subject to
FERC’s jurisdiction. FERC has jurisdiction over certain
facilities used to interconnect our EWG generating projects with
the transmission grid, and over the filed rate schedules and
tariffs of our EWG generating projects and power marketer
operating companies. Thus, transferring these assets would
require FERC approval.

In New England, New York, the Mid-Atlantic
region, the Midwest and California, FERC has approved ISOs. Most
of these ISOs administer a wholesale centralized bid-based spot
market in their regions pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC.
These tariffs/market rules dictate how the spot markets operate
and how entities with market-based rates shall be compensated
within those markets. The ISOs in these regions also control
access to and the operation of the transmission grid within
their footprint. Outside of ISO-controlled regions, we are
allowed to sell at market-based rates as determined by willing
buyers and sellers. Access to, pricing for,



and operation of the transmission grid in such
regions is controlled by the local transmission owning utility
according to its Open Access Transmission Tariff approved by
FERC.

Public Utility Holding Company
Act.

PUHCA defines as a “holding
company” any entity that owns, controls or has the power to
vote 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a
“public utility company.” Unless exempt, a holding
company is required to register with the SEC, and it and its
Subsidiaries (i.e., a company with 10% of its voting securities
held by the registered holding company) become subject to
extensive regulation. Registered holding companies under PUHCA
are required to limit their utility operations to a single,
integrated utility system and divest any other operations that
are not functionally related to the operation of the utility
system. In addition, a company that is a Subsidiary of a
registered holding company is subject to financial and
organizational regulation, including approval by the SEC of
certain financings and transactions. Domestic generating
facilities that qualify as QFs and/or that have obtained EWG
status from FERC are not considered “public utility
companies” for purposes of PUHCA. Each of our domestic
generating subsidiaries has been designated by FERC as an EWG or
is otherwise exempt from PUHCA because it is a QF under PURPA.

Because our generating subsidiaries have EWG or
QF status, we do not qualify as a “holding company”
under PUHCA. However, prior to the effective date of the NRG
plan of reorganization, we met the definition of a
“Subsidiary” of a registered holding company, Xcel
Energy, making us subject to regulation under PUHCA. After the
effective date, we ceased to be a Subsidiary of Xcel Energy and,
under current law, are no longer subject to regulation as a
“registered holding company” or a
“Subsidiary” of a registered holding company under
PUHCA as long as (i) we do not become a Subsidiary of
another registered holding company and (ii) the projects in
which we have an interest (1) qualify as QFs under PURPA,
(2) obtain and maintain EWG status under Section 32 of
PUHCA, (3) obtain and maintain Foreign Utility Company, or
“FUCO”, status under Section 33 of PUHCA, or
(4) are subject to another exemption or waiver. If our
projects were to cease to be exempt and we were to become
subject to SEC regulation under PUHCA, it would be difficult for
us to comply with PUHCA absent a substantial corporate
restructuring.

On December 18, 2003, FERC approved
FirstEnergy Corp’s., or “FirstEnergy”,
application to acquire approximately 6.5% of our outstanding
shares. We were, therefore, an “Affiliate” of a
registered holding company. While an “Affiliate” is
subject to substantially less regulation than a
“Subsidiary,” being an Affiliate of FirstEnergy Corp.
could have limited the transactions that we could enter into
with FirstEnergy without notifying the SEC. On February 2,
2004, FirstEnergy announced that it completed the divesture of
the NRG Energy stock in the secondary market. Based on such
disclosure, we believe that we are no longer an affiliate of
FirstEnergy.

Regulatory
Developments.

FERC is attempting to
deregulate the wholesale market by requiring transmission owners
to provide open, non-discriminatory access to electricity
markets and the transmission grid. In April 1996, FERC issued
Orders 888 and 889, requiring all public utilities to file
“open access” transmission tariffs that give wholesale
generators, as well as other wholesale sellers and buyers of
electricity, access to transmission facilities on a
non-discriminatory basis. This led to the formation of the ISOs
described above. On December 20, 1999, FERC issued Order
2000, encouraging the creation of RTOs. Finally, on
July 31, 2002, FERC issued its Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking regarding SMD. All three orders were intended to
eliminate market discrimination by incumbent vertically
integrated utilities and to provide for open access to the
transmission grid. The status of FERC’s RTO and SMD
initiatives is uncertain. On April 28, 2003, FERC issued a
white paper describing proposed changes to the proposed SMD
rulemaking that would, among other things, allow for more
regional differences. In addition, the Energy Bill pending
before Congress could restrict FERC’s ability to implement
these initiatives.

The full effect of these changes on us is
uncertain at this time, because in many parts of the United
States, it has not been determined how entities will attempt to
comply with FERC’s initiatives. At this time, five ISOs
have been approved and are operational: ISO-NE in New England;
the NYISO in New York; PJM in the Mid-Atlantic region; the
Midwest Independent System Operation, or “MISO” in the
Central Midwest region; and the Cal ISO in California. Two of
these ISOs, PJM and MISO, have been found to also qualify as
RTOs. In February 2004, FERC approved the RTO proposal by
Southwest Power Pool, subject to certain



conditions. ISO-NE, together with New England
transmission owners, has filed a proposal for an RTO in New
England. A number of other entities in various regions of the
United States have also requested that FERC approve their
organizations as RTOs.

We are affected by rule/tariff changes that occur
in the existing ISOs and RTOs. The ISOs that oversee most of the
wholesale power markets have in the past imposed, and may in the
future continue to impose, price limitations and other
mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.
For example, ISO-NE, NYISO, PJM and Cal ISO have imposed
price limitations. These types of price limitations and other
regulatory mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of
our generation facilities that sell energy into the wholesale
power markets. In addition, the regulatory and legislative
changes that have recently been enacted in a number of states in
an effort to promote competition are novel and untested in many
respects. These new approaches to the sale of electric power
have very short operating histories, and it is not yet clear how
they will operate in times of market stress or pressure, given
the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long-term price
history in many of these markets and the imposition of price
limitations by independent system operators.

The Energy Bill proposed in Congress 2003 would
have repealed PUHCA one year after passage and amended PURPA,
and provided FERC with additional jurisdiction over the books
and accounts of certain holding companies. If the
repeal/amendment of PURPA or PUHCA should occur, either
separately or as part of legislation designed to encourage the
broader introduction of wholesale and retail competition the
ability of regulated utility companies to compete more directly
with wholesale power generators could be increased. To the
extent competitive pressures increase the economics of domestic
wholesale power generation projects may come under increasing
pressure. Deregulation may not only continue to fuel the current
trend toward consolidation among domestic utilities, but may
also encourage the desegregation of vertically-integrated
utilities into separate generation, transmission and
distribution businesses. At this time, the Energy Bill has
stalled in Congress and it is unclear whether it will be passed
into law. If the Energy Bill is passed, it is unclear what
impact, if any, the new rules would have on us.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to a broad range of foreign,
provincial, federal, state and local environmental and safety
laws and regulations applicable to the development, ownership,
construction and operation of our domestic and international
projects. These laws and regulations impose requirements
relating to discharges of substances to the air, water and land,
the handling, storage and disposal of, and exposure to,
hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of properties
affected by pollutants. These laws and regulations generally
require that we obtain governmental permits and approvals before
construction or operation of a power plant commences, and after
completion, that our facilities operate in compliance with those
permits and applicable legal requirements. We could also be held
responsible under these laws for the cleanup of pollutants
released at our facilities or at off-site locations where we may
have sent wastes, even if the release or off-site disposal was
conducted in compliance with the law.

Regulatory compliance for the construction of new
facilities is a costly and time-consuming process. Intricate and
rapidly changing environmental regulations may require major
capital expenditures for permitting and create a risk of
expensive delays or material impairment of project value if
projects cannot function as planned due to changing regulatory
requirements or local opposition. In addition, environmental
laws have become increasingly stringent over time, particularly
with regard to the regulation of air emissions from our plants.
Such laws generally require regular capital expenditures for
power plant upgrades and modifications and for the installation
of certain pollution control equipment. Therefore, we seek to
integrate the consideration of potential environmental impacts
into every business decision we make, and by doing so, strive to
improve our competitive advantage by meeting or exceeding
environmental and safety requirements pertaining to the
management and operation of our assets.

It is not possible at this time to determine when
or to what extent additional facilities or modifications to
existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of
possible changes to environmental and safety laws and
regulations, regulatory interpretations or enforcement policies.
In general, the effect of future laws or



regulations is expected to require the addition
of pollution control equipment or the imposition of certain
restrictions on our operations. We expect that future liability
under or compliance with environmental and safety requirements
could have a material effect on our operations or competitive
position.

Domestic Environmental Regulatory
    Matters

The construction and operation of power projects
are subject to stringent environmental and safety protection and
land use laws and regulations in the United States. These laws
and regulations generally require lengthy and complex processes
to obtain licenses, permits and approvals from federal, state
and local agencies. If such laws and regulations become more
stringent and our facilities are not exempted from coverage, we
could be required to make extensive modifications to further
reduce potential environmental impacts. Also, we could be held
responsible under environmental and safety laws for the cleanup
of pollutant releases at our facilities or at off-site locations
where we have sent waste.

We establish accruals where reasonable estimates
of probable environmental and safety liabilities are possible.
We adjust the accruals when new remediation or other
environmental liability responsibilities are discovered and
probable costs become estimable, or when current liability
estimates are adjusted to reflect new information or a change in
the law.

U.S. Federal Environmental
    Initiatives

Several federal regulatory and legislative
initiatives are being undertaken in the U.S. to further
limit and control pollutant emissions from fossil-fuel-fired
combustion units. Although neither the exact impact of these
initiatives nor the final form that these initiatives will take
are known at this time, all of our power plants will likely be
affected in some manner by the expected changes in federal
environmental laws and regulations. In Congress, legislation has
been proposed that would impose annual caps on U.S. power
plant emissions of nitrogen oxides, or
“NO

x

,” sulfur dioxide, or
“SO


,” mercury and, in some instances,
carbon dioxide, or “CO


.”

The U.S Environmental Protection Agency, or
“EPA,” announced in December 2003 its proposed rules
regulating mercury emissions from coal-fired electric utility
units and emissions of nickel from oil-fired utility units. In
its mercury rule proposal, EPA offered three options for
controlling mercury emissions. The first option would regulate
mercury emissions by setting maximum achievable control
technology, or “MACT,” standards on major sources of
hazardous air pollutants, or “HAPS.” Existing units
would need to comply with new mercury emission limitations
within three years following EPA’s publication of the final
rule. The other two options are based on capping nationwide
emissions of mercury from coal-fired units, allocating mercury
allowances to such individual sources, and allowing such sources
to trade allowances in order to demonstrate compliance with the
rule. Under the EPA proposal, implementation of the
cap-and-trade program would be done in two phases; the first
phase would cap nationwide mercury emissions beginning in 2010
and the second phase would mandate a further reduction in the
cap in 2018. In the preamble to its proposal, EPA indicated that
it views the more flexible cap-and-trade approach as the best
option for reducing mercury emissions from coal-fired utility
units. We expect that each of our coal-fired electric power
plants would be subject to mercury regulation under any of
EPA’s proposed regulatory options. EPA’s final
decision on mercury regulation is expected to be announced on or
before December 15, 2004. Since the final rule has not yet
been promulgated and we do not know at this time which of the
three proposed options EPA will eventually select, it is not
possible to determine the extent to which the final mercury
rules will affect our domestic operations.

EPA has also proposed two options for regulations
to control nickel emissions from oil-fired electric utility
units. The first option is similar to the MACT approach for
mercury, i.e., a limit on nickel emissions would apply to
oil-fired utility units that constitute major sources of HAPS.
The second option would require all oil-fired units to meet the
same numerical standard as that proposed under the MACT
approach, but would exempt units that fire distillate fuel oil.
Under both proposals, EPA is considering establishing a limit on
the nickel content of fuel that would be equivalent to the
nickel emission limit. In proposing the limits for nickel from
oil-fired units, EPA proposed the use of electrostatic
precipitators, or “ESPs,” as the control device of
choice. Our oil-fired units that lack ESPs include, Vienna,
Encina, Middletown Unit No. 4 and Montville



Unit No. 6. We have not completed our
evaluation of the impact the proposed nickel emission limit
would have on these sources. EPA’s final decision regarding
nickel emissions from oil-fired units will be provided on or
before December 15, 2004.

EPA has finalized federal rules governing ozone
season NO

x

emissions across the eastern United
States. These ozone season rules are being implemented in two
phases. The first phase of restrictions occurred in the Ozone
Transport Commission region during the 2003 ozone season; all of
our generating units in the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions
are included in this part of the program. The second phase of
NO

x

reductions will extend to states within the Ozone
Transport Assessment Group region and restrict 2004 and
subsequent ozone season NO

x

emissions in most states
east of the Mississippi River. These rules, which will continue
until further notice, require one NO

x

allowance to be
held for each ton of NO

x

emitted from any fossil
fuel-fired stationary boiler, combustion turbine, or combined
cycle system that (i) at any time on or after
January 1, 1995, served a generator with a nameplate
capacity greater than 25 MW and sold any amount of
electricity or (ii) has a maximum design heat input greater
than 250 mmBtu/hr. Our facilities that are subject to this rule
in the South Central and Northeast regions have been allocated
NO

x

emissions allowances, but we expect that those
allowances may not be sufficient for the anticipated operation
for all of these facilities. Our facilities in Illinois in the
Other North America region are also subject to this program. We
expect that our Illinois sources will receive initial allowances
out of a new source set aside. The future operating capacity of
these Illinois plants will determine whether the initial
allowances are sufficient. If our allocation is insufficient, we
will be required to purchase NO

x

allowances from
sources holding excess allowances. The need to purchase these
additional NO

x

allowances could have a material
adverse effect on our operations in these regions.

On December 17, 2003, EPA announced it was
proposing a rule to address the impact of interstate transport
of air pollutants on non-attainment of the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards for fine particles and 8-hour ozone. EPA
dubbed this rule the “Interstate Air Quality Rule.”
The proposed Interstate Air Quality Rule would reduce emissions
of SO


and NO

x

in 29 eastern states and
the District of Columbia in two phases. SO


emissions
would be reduced by 3.6 million tons in 2010 (approximately
40 percent below current levels) and by another
2 million tons per year when the rules are fully
implemented in 2015 (approximately 70 percent below current
levels). Emissions of NO

x

would be cut by
1.5 million tons in 2010 and 1.8 million tons annually
in 2015 (about 65 percent below today’s levels). Each
affected state would be required to revise its state
implementation plan to include control measures to meet specific
statewide emission reduction requirements. To achieve the
required reductions in the most cost effective way, the proposal
suggests that states regulate power plants under a cap-and-trade
program similar to EPA’s Acid Rain Program. Under such a
program, total emissions in the affected states would be
permanently capped and could not increase. In general, the
flexibility provided by such cap-and-trade programs would
benefit our operations. However, the cost of obtaining
allowances under such programs could still represent a material
adverse effect on our operations.

On February 16, 2004, EPA released for
purposes of minimizing adverse environmental impacts on aquatic
species regulations governing cooling water intake structures at
existing power plants. The new rules will require implementation
of the best technology available for minimizing such impacts and
require facilities designed to withdraw water in amounts greater
than 50 million gallons per day via such structures to
include (when such facilities submit applications to renew their
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits) a
comprehensive demonstration study characterizing impingement
mortality and entrainment losses. Further, the facility must
confirm that the technologies, operational measures, and/or
restoration measures proposed to minimize impacts will meet one
of five compliance alternatives. We expect that each of the
following NRG facilities that utilize once through cooling
systems will be required to conduct such studies and select a
compliance alternative: Somerset, Devon, Middletown, Montville,
Norwalk Harbor, Indian River, Dunkirk, Huntley, Oswego,
Arthur Kill, Big Cajun 2, El Segundo, Encina, and Long Beach. We
have already undertaken such demonstration studies at four of
these facilities (Somerset, Middletown, Montville, and Norwalk
Harbor); we have already decided and budgeted to install best
technology available at one of the facilities (Arthur Kill); and
we are likely at four facilities to be exempted from critical
demonstration study requirements on the basis of either low
capacity utilization rates (Montville, Devon and Oswego) or
location on a freshwater river with high mean annual flow rate
(Big Cajun 2). In general, the new rules provide



flexibility in terms of their available
compliance options and allow an implementing agency to find that
the cost of compliance would be significantly greater than the
benefits of complying with a facility’s applicable
performance standards. We believe this flexibility will allow
the remaining facilities to greatly minimize compliance costs.
In general, the cost of a comprehensive demonstration study is
expected to total less than $400 thousand; however, in the case
of the California facilities El Segundo, Encina and Long Beach,
we expect the cost of each such study to be significantly
higher, but not exceed $2 million each. We are undertaking
to narrow this cost through discussions with contractors having
experience in 316(b) demonstrations in California.

Regional U.S. Regulatory
    Initiatives

West Coast Region.

The El Segundo and Long Beach Generating Stations are both
regulated by the South Coast Air Quality Management
District’s, or “SCAQMD’s,” Regional Clean
Air Incentives Market, or “RECLAIM,” program. This
program, which regulates NO

x

emissions in the Los
Angeles area, was amended on May 11, 2001, and mandated
major changes with respect to air emissions control at power
generation facilities in southern California. New RECLAIM
Rule 2009 required that all existing power generation
facilities meet Best Available Retrofit Control Technology, or
“BARCT,” NO

x

emissions from all utility
boilers by January 1, 2003, and for NO

x

emissions from all peaking units by January 1, 2004. Under
the new rule, existing power generation facilities were required
to submit compliance plans by September 1, 2001, listing
how each unit at the stations would meet BARCT by the deadlines.
El Segundo’s compliance plan did not propose additional
NO

x

controls to meet BARCT since Units 3 & 4
are already equipped with acceptable selective catalytic
reduction, or “SCR,” technology (first installed on
Unit 4 in 1995 and on Unit 3 in 2001). Further, Units
1 & 2 were decommissioned at the end of 2002 so the new
requirements did not apply to those two units. SCAQMD approved
the El Segundo Rule 2009 Compliance Plan on
October 17, 2002, indicating that the SCRs on Units
3 & 4 meet BARCT and requiring that Units 1 &
2 be retired on or before December 31, 2002. SCAQMD
approved the Long Beach Generating Station Rule 2009
Compliance Plan on April 25, 2002, which proposed
modifications to the Long Beach NO

x

control system by
December 31, 2002, and specified a new NO

x

emission concentration limit of 16.6 parts per million. The Long
Beach plant completed all control system modifications and
demonstrated compliance with 16.6 parts per million a limit
before the December 31, 2002 deadline. We believe all Long
Beach and El Segundo units have met the Rule 2009 BARCT
requirements.

Northeast Region.

Final rules implementing changes in air regulations in
Massachusetts and Connecticut were promulgated in 2000. The
Connecticut rules required that existing facilities reduce their
emissions of SO


in two steps. The first
SO


milestone took place on January 1, 2002 and
the second SO


milestone occurred on January 1,
2003. Our plants in Connecticut have operated in compliance with
the first phase rules and are now operating in compliance with
the second phase rules. Connecticut’s rules governing
emissions of NO

x

were also modified in 2000 to
restrict the average, non-ozone season NO

x

emission
rate to 0.15 pound per million Btu heat input. We plan to comply
with the new NO

x

rules, in part, through selective
firing of natural gas, use of selective non-catalytic reduction
technology presently installed at our Norwalk Harbor and
Middletown Power Stations, improved combustion controls, use of
emission reduction credits and purchase of allowances. In 2002,
the Connecticut legislature passed a law further tightening air
emission standards by eliminating in-state emissions credit
trading subsequent to January 1, 2005 as a means of meeting
Department of Environmental Protection regulatory standards for
SO


emissions from older power plants. The
termination of SO


emissions trading in Connecticut
by 2005 could have a material adverse effect on our operations
in that state.

The new Massachusetts rules set forth schedules
under which six existing coal-fired power plants in
Massachusetts were required to meet stringent emission limits
for NO

x

, SO


, mercury and CO


.
The state has reserved the issue of credit creation and trading
for the control of carbon monoxide and regulations on the
control of particulate matter emissions for future
consideration. On February 25, 2003, we received from the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, or
“MADEP,” a permit to install natural gas reburn
technology to meet the NO

x

and SO


limits
specified in the new rules at our Somerset Generating Station.



Total capital expenditures of approximately
$5.6 million have been expended to implement reburn
technology at the Somerset Station.

In September 2003, MADEP proposed mercury
regulations that would affect the Somerset Station. The first
phase would go into effect on October 1, 2006 and require
the Somerset Station to meet a mercury rate of 0.0075 Pounds/
GWh or an 85% reduction inlet-to-outlet. The second phase, which
goes into effect on October 1, 2012, would require a rate
of 0.0025 Pounds/ GWh, or a 95% reduction inlet-to-outlet.
Public hearings on these rules occurred in mid-November. On
December 8, 2003, we submitted comments in support of
certain provisions of the proposed rule that would allow for
affected facilities to submit for MADEP’s approval
alternative reduction plans for complying with the rate
limitation or percent removal requirement. Such plans would
allow for affected facilities to substitute approved off-site
reductions for reductions in stack emissions. We believe we can
comply with any future mercury reductions required by the rules
through achieving early reductions of mercury via early
implementation of the natural gas reburn technology and with our
January 1, 2010 commitment to shutdown Somerset
Station’s existing boiler. We are still considering our
options with respect to how we will address MADEP’s
CO


emission standards. Such options include using
early reductions of CO


achieved through early
implementation of the natural gas reburn technology, purchase of
creditable greenhouse gas reductions obtained from third
parties, or by filing a legal challenge with respect to
MADEP’s legal authority to regulate CO


emissions. If we were required to purchase verifiable
CO


emission reduction credits, such purchase could
have a material adverse impact on Somerset Station.

New York issued rules on April 17, 2003
that became effective on May 17, 2003 that reduce allowable
SO


and NO

x

emissions from large,
fossil-fuel-fired combustion units in New York State (6
NYCRR Part 237: Acid Deposition Reduction NO

x

Budget Trading Program and Part 238: Acid Deposition
Reduction SO


Budget Trading Program). These rules
affect all of our New York generators except the Astoria
Gas Turbines. We filed a petition on August 15, 2003
challenging the final rules. Although, oral arguments have been
heard by the judge presiding over this matter, no finding has
been issued as of the date hereof. Our strategy for complying
with the new rules will be to generate early reductions of
SO


and NO

x

associated with fuel switching
and use such reductions to extend the timeframe for implementing
technological controls. Such technological controls could
include the addition of flue gas desulphurization, low
NO

x

combustion technologies and/or SCR equipment. We
anticipate that we could incur capital expenditures up to
$200 million in the 2010 through 2012 timeframe to
implement upgrades and modifications to our plants in
New York (other than Astoria) to meet these new state
regulatory requirements if we cannot address such requirements
through use of compliant fuels and/or plant wide applicability
limits. Capital expenditures on this order would be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company.

While no material impending rule changes
affecting our existing facilities have been formally proposed,
Delaware has considered in 2003 whether or not to develop
Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards for mercury. In
support of this effort, the state is beginning to test large
combustion sources for mercury emissions. In addition, the state
is considering establishing an emissions reduction rulemaking
that could affect our assets in Delaware. We are meeting with
the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental
Control, or “DNREC,” to determine whether or nor our
reductions and their timing will meet DNREC’s expectations
and thereby avoid a rulemaking.

South Central
Region.

The Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality has promulgated State Implementation Plan
revisions to bring the Baton Rouge ozone non-attainment area
into compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards. We
participated in the development of the revisions, which require
the reduction of NO

x

emissions at the gas-fired Big
Cajun I Power Station and coal-fired Big Cajun II
Power Station to 0.1 pounds NO

x

per million Btu heat
input and 0.21 pounds NO

x

per million Btu heat input,
respectively. This revision of the Louisiana air rules would
appear to constitute a change-in-law covered by the agreement
between Louisiana Generating LLC and the electric cooperatives
allowing the costs of added combustion controls to be passed
through to the cooperatives. The capital cost of combustion
controls required at the Big Cajun II Generating Station to
meet the State’s NO

x

regulations is estimated to
total approximately $10.0 million each for Units
1 & 2. Unit 3 has already made such changes.



On January 27, 2004, Louisiana Generating
LLC received from EPA Region 6 a request for information that
would assist in their determination whether projects undertaken
at Big Cajun 2 may have triggered any of the Clean Air
Act’s requirements under New Source Review and/or New
Source Performance Standards. Louisiana Generating LLC has
started to assemble the information requested and began
submitting documents on February 27, 2004. Given the volume
of information requested, Louisiana Generating LLC is not
scheduled to complete the information request until the end of
March 2004.

Domestic Site Remediation
    Matters

Under certain state and local environmental laws
and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of any
facility, including an electric generating facility, may be
required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened
releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products
at the facility. We may also be held liable to a governmental
entity or to third parties for property damage; personal injury
and investigation and remediation costs incurred by the party in
connection with hazardous material releases or threatened
releases. These laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by
the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, impose
liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused
the presence of the hazardous substances, and courts have
interpreted liability under such laws to be strict (without
fault), and joint and several. The cost of investigation,
remediation or removal of any hazardous or toxic substances or
petroleum products could be substantial. Although we have been
involved in on-site contamination matters, to date, we have not
been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to
any off-site waste disposal matter.

West Coast Region.

The Asset Purchase Agreements for the Long Beach, El Segundo,
Encina and San Diego gas turbine generating facilities
provide that Southern California Edison and San Diego
Gas & Electric retain liability and indemnify us for
existing soil and groundwater contamination that exceeds
remedial thresholds in place at the time of closing. Along with
our business partner for these facilities, we conducted
Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessments at
each of these sites for the purpose of identifying such existing
contamination and provided the results to the sellers.
San Diego Gas & Electric has undertaken corrective
actions at the Encina and San Diego gas turbine generating
sites related to issues identified in these assessments,
although final government agency approval to certify
completeness of the corrective action has not yet been obtained.
Spills and releases of various substances have occurred at these
sites since establishing the historical baseline, all of which
have been or will be remediated in accordance with existing laws
as described further below.

A lubricating oil leak in November 2002 from
underground piping at the El Segundo Generating Station
contaminated soils adjacent to and underneath the Unit 1
powerhouse. We excavated and disposed of contaminated soils that
could be removed in accordance with existing laws. We filed a
request with the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control
Board to allow contaminated soils to remain underneath the Unit
1 powerhouse building foundation until the building is
demolished. In March 2003, the Los Angeles Regional Water
Quality Control Board approved the request.

A diesel fuel spill to on-site surface
containment occurred at the Cabrillo Power II LLC Kearny
Combustion Turbine facility (San Diego) in February 2003.
Emergency response and subsequent remediation activities were
promptly completed. An application for confirmation sampling for
the site was submitted to the San Diego County Department
of Environmental Health in September 2003. We expect that the
Department will authorize the sampling plan and confirmation
sampling will be completed in 2004.

Three San Diego Combustion Turbine
facilities, formerly operating pursuant to land leases with the
United State Navy, are currently being decommissioned with
equipment being removed from the sites and remediation
activities occurring where necessary. All remedial activities
are being completed pursuant to the requirements of the United
States Navy and the San Diego County Department of
Environmental Health. We expect decommissioning and remediation
activities to be complete in 2004.

Northeast Region.

Coal ash is produced as a by-product of coal combustion at the
Dunkirk, Huntley, Indian River and Somerset Generating
Stations. We currently attempt to direct our coal ash to
beneficial uses such as road base, cement replacement, cinder
blocks and flowable fill materials. Even so, significant



amounts of ash are landfilled at on and off-site
locations. At Indian River, Dunkirk and Huntley, ash is disposed
at landfills owned and operated by us. No material liabilities
outside the costs associated with closure, post-closure care and
monitoring are expected at the Dunkirk and Huntley facilities,
currently estimated at approximately $5.8 million. We
maintain financial assurance to cover costs associated with
closure, post-closure care and monitoring activities by
providing cash collateral, corporate guarantees or meeting
certain financial ratio tests.

We must also maintain financial assurance for
closing interim status RCRA facilities at the Devon, Middletown,
Montville and Norwalk Harbor Generating Stations. Previously, we
satisfied financial assurance requirements by meeting specified
financial tests. In April 2003, due to a deterioration of our
financial condition, we satisfied financial assurance
requirements by depositing $1.5 million in a trust fund
instrument requiring complete collateralization of closure and
post-closure-related costs.

We inherited historical clean-up liabilities when
we acquired the Somerset, Devon, Middletown, Montville, Norwalk
Harbor, Arthur Kill and Astoria Generating Stations. We have
recently satisfied clean-up obligations associated with the
Ledge Road property (inherited as part of the Somerset
acquisition). Site contamination liabilities arising under the
Connecticut Transfer Act at the Devon, Middletown, Montville and
Norwalk Harbor Stations are currently being refined as part of
on-going site investigations. We do not expect to incur material
costs associated with completing the investigations at these
Stations or future work to close and monitor landfill areas
pursuant to the Connecticut requirements. During installation of
a sound wall at Somerset Station in 2003, oil contaminated soil
was encountered. We have delineated the general extent of
contamination, determined it to be minimal, and will place an
activity use limitation on that section of the property.
Remedial liabilities at the Arthur Kill Generating Station have
been established in discussions between the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation, or “NYSDEC,”
and us and are expected to cost between approximately
$1.0 million and $2.0 million. Remedial investigations
are ongoing at the Astoria Generating Station. At this time, we
expect our long-term cleanup liability at this site to be
approximately $2.5 million to $4.3 million. In the
course of installing groundwater monitoring wells on the Astoria
site in late 2003 to track our remediation of a historical
(pre-NRG Energy) fuel oil spill, the drilling contractor
encountered deposits of coal tar in two borings. We reported the
coal tar discovery to the NYSDEC. NYSDEC has required us to
delineate the extent of this contamination around these borings.
We may also be required to remediate the coal tar contamination
and/or record a deed restriction on the property if significant
contamination is to remain in place. Our estimate of the cost to
further delineate the extent of possible coal tar contamination
at the Astoria station is approximately $0.2 million. At
this time, we do not believe it is necessary to adjust the
estimate of our long-term cleanup liability for the Astoria site.

We are responsible for the costs associated with
closure, post-closure care and monitoring of the ash landfill
owned and operated by us on the site of the Indian River
Generating Station. No material liabilities outside such costs
are expected. Financial assurance to provide for closure and
post-closure-related costs is currently maintained by a trust
fund collateralized in the amount of approximately
$6.6 million.

South Central
Region.

We maintain a trust fund to
address liabilities associated with closure, post-closure care
and monitoring of the ash ponds owned and operated on site at
the Big Cajun II Generating Station (one of the instruments
allowed by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality for
providing financial assurance for expenses associated with
closure and post-closure care of the ponds). The value of the
trust fund is approximately $4.8 million and we are making
annual payments to the fund in the amount of approximately
$0.1 million.

International Environmental
    Matters

Most of the foreign countries in which we own or
may acquire or develop independent power projects have
environmental and safety laws or regulations relating to the
ownership or operation of electric power generation facilities.
These laws and regulations are still changing and evolving, and
have a significant impact on international wholesale power
producers. In particular, our international power generation
facilities will likely be affected by evolving emissions
limitations and operational requirements imposed by the Kyoto



Protocol, which is an international treaty
related to greenhouse gas emissions, and country-based
restrictions pertaining to global climate change concerns.

We retain appropriate advisors in foreign
countries and seek to design our international asset management
strategy to comply with and take advantage of opportunities
presented by each country’s environmental and safety laws
and regulations. There can be no assurance that changes in such
laws or regulations will not adversely effect our international
operations.

Australia.

Our
Australian power facilities are licensed under the environment
protection legislation of the state in which they are located,
and are subject to compliance with these state authorizations.
The most significant environmental issue for our Australian
businesses is the response to global climate change. Climate
change issues are considered a long-term issue (e.g., 2010 and
beyond), and the Australian government’s response to date
has included a number of initiatives, all of which have had no
impact or minimal impact on our current operations. The
Australian government has stated that Australia will achieve its
Kyoto Protocol target of 108% of 1990 greenhouse gas emission
levels for the 2008 to 2012 reporting period but that Australia
will not ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Each Australian state
government is considering implementing a number of climate
change initiatives that will vary considerably state to state.
We currently expect that climate change initiatives will not
have a material adverse effect on our businesses in Australia.

MIBRAG/ Schkopau,
Germany.

We expect CO


emissions trading will begin in Germany in 2005, but we cannot
quantify the possible effect of this trading on our operations
in Germany at this time because implementation details are still
being negotiated among businesses, lobbyists and regulatory
authorities. Fundamental issues such as
“grandfathering” existing plants or availability of
credits for plants previously closed or upgraded are still
unsettled. We are working with specialized consultants, the
Environmental Ministry of Sachsen Anhalt and MIBRAG to
understand developments and minimize any adverse effects.
Proposed changes in section 13 of the German Emission
Control Directive, is expected to tighten emissions limits for
plants firing conventional fuels. As with CO


emissions trading, these changes are currently being debated
with issues such as exemptions based on size or purpose of
plants and “grandfathering.” Section 17 of this
Directive was recently finalized and tightened emission limits
for facilities co-firing waste products. Although the new
regulations will require the Mumsdorf and Deuben Power Stations
to install additional controls to reduce NO

x

emissions in 2006, the economic benefits received from co-firing
sewage sludge at the facilities provide a business rationale for
the investment.

The European Union’s Groundwater Directive
and Mine Wastewater Management Directive are in the rule-making
stage with the final outcome still under debate. Given the
uncertainty regarding the possible outcome of the on-going
debate on these directives, we cannot quantify at this time the
possible effect such requirements would have on our future coal
mining operations in Germany.

A new law specifically dealing with the
relocation of residents of Heuersdorf in the path of the mining
plan has been introduced in the legislature of Saxony and is
expected to be enacted between April and June 2004. There are
numerous potential court challenges still to come in the
process. We cannot predict the outcome of this process at this
time. MIBRAG continues its political and legal work in an effort
to obtain a favorable resolution.

The supply contracts under which MIBRAG mines
lignite from the Profen mine expire on December 31, 2029;
the contracts under which MIBRAG mines lignite from the
Schleenhain mine expire in 2041. At the end of each mine’s
productive lifetime, MIBRAG will be required to reclaim areas of
each mine most recently opened. MIBRAG accrues for these
eventual expenses and estimates the cost of final reclamation to
approach

€

190 million
in the instance of the Schleenhain mine
and

€

132 million
for Profen.

Our Enfield
Generating Station uses state-of-the-art combined cycle
technology and fires natural gas as its primary fuel. Currently
the facility complies with all conditions in its environmental
permits and its operation is not under challenge by any
governmental or non-governmental parties.



Risks Related to NRG
Energy, Inc.

Our actual financial results may vary
    significantly from the projections filed with the bankruptcy
    court.

In connection with the NRG plan of
reorganization, we were required to prepare projected financial
information to demonstrate to the bankruptcy court the
feasibility of the NRG plan of reorganization and our ability to
continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. These
projections were based on financial information available to us
as of May 1, 2003 and have not been, and will not be,
updated on an ongoing basis. The projections were initially
filed with the bankruptcy court on May 14, 2003. These
projections are not included in this annual report nor are they
incorporated by reference and should not be relied upon. At the
time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous
assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance and
with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic
conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may
not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to
uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business,
economic and competitive risks. Our actual results will vary
from those contemplated by the projections and the variations
may be material. As a result, we caution you not to rely upon
the projections.

Because our consolidated financial
    statements will reflect Fresh Start reporting adjustments made
    upon our emergence from bankruptcy, financial information
    reflecting our future results of operations and financial
    condition will not be comparable to prior periods.

As a result of adopting Fresh Start reporting,
the book value of our long-lived assets and the related
depreciation and amortization schedules, among other things,
will change from that reflected in our historical consolidated
financial statements. Our future results will not be comparable
to the historical consolidated statement of operations data
included in this annual report. Since we have emerged from
bankruptcy, you will not be able to compare certain information
reflecting our results of operations and financial condition to
those for periods prior to our emergence from bankruptcy without
making adjustments for Fresh Start reporting.

Our operations are subject to hazards
    customary to the power generation industry. We may not have
    adequate insurance to cover all of these hazards.

Our operations are subject to many hazards
associated with the power generation industry, which may expose
us to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate
insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardous
activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading
fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and
delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems.
In addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood,
lightning, hurricane and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion,
collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in our
operations. These hazards can cause significant personal injury
or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property,
plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the
environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any
one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant
in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages,
environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or
penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we
consider adequate, but we cannot assure you that our insurance
will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and
against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A
successful claim for which we are not fully insured could hurt
our financial results and materially harm our financial
condition. Further, due to rapidly rising insurance costs, we
cannot assure you that insurance coverage will continue to be
available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those
presently available to us.

Our revenues are unpredictable because many
    of our power generation facilities operate, wholly or partially,
    without long-term power purchase agreements. Further, because
    wholesale power prices are subject to significant volatility,
    the revenues that we generate are subject to significant
    fluctuations.

Prior to the late 1990’s, substantially all
revenues from independent power generation facilities were
derived under long-term power purchase agreements, pursuant to
which all energy and capacity was generally sold to a single
party at fixed prices. Due to changes in the wholesale power
markets, the percentage of facilities, including ours, with
these types of long-term power purchase agreements has
decreased, and it is



likely that over the next several years where
there is an oversupply of generation capacity, most of our
facilities will operate as “merchant” facilities
without long-term agreements. Without the benefit of long-term
power purchase agreements, we cannot assure you that we will be
able to sell any or all of the power generated by our facilities
at commercially attractive rates or that our facilities will be
able to operate profitably. This could lead to future impairment
of our property, plant and equipment or us closing certain of
our facilities resulting in additional economic losses and
liabilities.

Further, we sell all or a portion of the energy,
capacity and other products from many of our facilities to
wholesale power markets. The prices of energy products in those
markets are influenced by many factors outside of our control,
including fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and
demand, weather, economic conditions and the rules, regulations
and actions of the system operators and regulatory regimes in
those markets. In addition, unlike most other commodities, power
can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally must be
produced concurrently with its use. As a result, the wholesale
power markets are subject to significant price fluctuations over
relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable.

Increasing competition in wholesale power
    markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and cash flows, and we may require additional
    liquidity to remain competitive.

Our wholesale energy operations compete with
other providers of electric energy in the procurement of fuel
and the sale of energy and related products. In order to
successfully compete, we must have the ability to aggregate fuel
supplies at competitive prices from different sources and
locations and must be able to efficiently utilize transportation
services from third-party pipelines, railways and other fuel
transporters and transmission services from electric utilities.
We also compete against other energy merchants on the basis of
our relative skills, financial position and access to credit
sources. Energy customers, wholesale energy suppliers and
transporters often seek financial guarantees and other
assurances that their energy contracts will be satisfied. In
addition, our merchant asset business is constrained by our
liquidity, our access to credit and the reduction in market
liquidity. Other companies with which we compete may not have
similar constraints.

A substantial portion of our historical
    earnings in 2003 have been derived from our California
    generation assets, and we cannot assure you as to the
    collectibility of all amounts owed to our California affiliates
    or that we will be able to enter into comparable agreements
    beyond 2004.

In March 2001, certain affiliates of West Coast
Power entered into a contract with the California Department of
Water Resources, or “CDWR,” pursuant to which the
affiliates agreed to sell up to 2,300 MW from
January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2004, any of
which may be resold by the CDWR to utilities such as Southern
California Edison Company, or “SCE,” PG&E and
San Diego Gas and Electric Company, or
“SDG&E.” The ability of the CDWR to make future
payments is subject to the CDWR having a continued source of
funding, whether from legislative or other emergency
appropriations, from a bond issuance or from amounts collected
from SCE, PG&E and SDG&E for deliveries to their
customers. As a result of the present situation in California,
we are exposed to a risk of delayed payments and/or non-payment
regardless of whether the sales are made directly to PG&E,
SCE or SDG&E or to the California ISO or the CDWR. We are
also exposed to the risk of being unable to enter into a
contract with similar terms and conditions as the CDWR contract.

Construction, expansion, refurbishment and
    operation of power generation facilities involve significant
    risks that cannot always be covered by insurance or contractual
    protections and could have a material adverse effect on our
    revenues and results of operations.

We are exposed to risks relating to the breakdown
or failure of equipment or processes, shortages of equipment and
supply, material and labor and operating performance below
expected levels of output or efficiency. A significant portion
of our facilities was constructed many years ago. Older
equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good
engineering practices, may require significant capital
expenditures to keep it operating at optimum efficiency. This
equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and
improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure caused by
breakdown, forced outage or any unanticipated capital
expenditure, could result in reduced profitability. In addition,
if we make any “major



modifications” to our power generation
facilities, as defined under the new source review provisions of
the Federal Clean Air Act, we would be required to install
“best available control technology” or to achieve the
“lowest achievable emissions rate.” Any such
modifications would likely result in substantial additional
capital expenditures. In general, environmental laws,
particularly with respect to air emissions, are becoming more
stringent, which may require us to install expensive plant
upgrades and/or restrict our operations to meet more stringent
standards.

We cannot always predict the level of capital
expenditures that will be required due to changing environmental
and safety laws and regulations, deteriorating facility
conditions and unexpected events (such as natural disasters or
terrorist attacks). The unexpected requirement of large capital
expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our
financial performance and condition. Further, the construction,
expansion, modification and refurbishment of power generation,
thermal energy production and transmission and resource recovery
facilities involve many risks, including:

The ongoing operation of our facilities involves
all of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating
to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes,
performance below expected levels of output or efficiency and
the inability to transport our product to our customers in an
efficient manner due to a lack in transmission capacity. While
we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and
obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the
proceeds of such insurance, warranties or performance guarantees
may not be adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses
or liquidated damages payments should we experience equipment
breakdown or non-performance of contractors. Any of these risks
could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which
in turn could result in lost revenues, increased expenses,
higher maintenance costs and penalties.

We are exposed to the risk of fuel and fuel
    transportation cost increases and volatility and interruption in
    fuel supply because our facilities generally do not have
    long-term natural gas, coal and liquid fuel supply
    agreements.

Most of our domestic natural gas-, coal- and
oil-fired power generation facilities purchase their fuel
requirements under short-term contracts or on the spot market.
Although we attempt to purchase fuel based on our known fuel
requirements, we still face the risks of supply interruptions
and fuel price volatility as fuel deliveries may not exactly
match energy sales due in part to our need to prepurchase
inventories for reliability and dispatch requirements. The price
we can obtain for the sale of energy may not rise at the same
rate, or may not rise at all, to match a rise in fuel costs.
This may have a material adverse effect on our financial
performance. Moreover, changes in market prices for natural gas,
coal and oil may result from the following:



The volatility of fuel prices could adversely
affect our financial results and operations.

The quality of fuel that we rely on at
    certain of our plants may at times not be
    available.

Our plant operating characteristics and equipment
often dictate the specific fuel quality to be combusted. The
availability of specific fuel qualities may vary due to supplier
financial or operational disruptions, and may have a material
adverse impact on the financial results of specific plants.

Future decreases in gas prices in certain
    markets may adversely impact our financial
    performance.

Certain of our facilities, particularly our coal
generation assets, are currently benefiting from higher
electricity prices in their respective markets as a result of
high gas prices compared to historical levels. A decrease in gas
prices may lead to a corresponding decrease in electricity
prices in these markets, which could adversely impact our
financial performance.

We often rely on single suppliers and at
    times we rely on single customers at our facilities, exposing us
    to significant financial risks if either should fail to perform
    their obligations.

We often rely on a single supplier for the
provision of fuel, water and other services required for
operation of a facility, and at times, we rely on a single
customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant
portion of a facility’s output, in some cases under
long-term agreements that provide the support for any project
debt used to finance the facility. During the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we derived
30.5% of our revenues from one customer: the NYISO. For the
period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 we
derived 35.5% of our revenues from two customers: NYISO 24.1%
and ISO New England 11.4%. During 2002, we derived approximately
23.7% of our revenues from majority-owned operations from one
customer: the NYISO. During 2001, we derived approximately 51.1%
of our revenues from majority-owned operations from two
customers: the NYISO 33.6% and CL&P 17.5%. The failure of
any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations
to the facility could have a material adverse effect on such
facility’s financial results. Consequently, the financial
performance of any such facility is dependent on the credit
quality and continued performance by suppliers and customers of
their obligations under these long-term agreements.

We may not have sufficient liquidity to
    effectively hedge market risks.

We are exposed to market risks through our power
marketing business, which involves the sale of energy, capacity
and related products and procurement of fuel, transmission
rights and emission allowances. These market risks include,
among other risks, volatility arising from the timing
differences associated with buying fuel, converting fuel into
energy and delivering the energy to a buyer. We seek to manage
this volatility by entering into forward and other contracts
which hedge the amount of exposure for our net transactions. As
such, the effectiveness of our hedging strategy may be dependent
on the amount of collateral available to enter



into these hedging contracts and liquidity
requirements may be greater than we anticipate or are able to
meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital to post as
collateral in support of performance guarantees or as cash
margin, we may not be able to effectively manage this price
volatility. Factors, which could lead to an increase in our
required collateral, include adverse changes in our industry,
credit rating downgrades or the secured nature of our new credit
facility. Under certain unfavorable commodity price scenarios,
it is possible that we could experience inadequate liquidity as
a result of the posting of additional collateral.

Further, if our facilities experience unplanned
outages, we may be required to procure replacement power in the
open market to minimize our exposure to liquidated damages.
Without adequate liquidity to post margin and collateral
requirements, we may be exposed to significant losses and may
miss significant opportunities, and we may have increased
exposure to the volatility of spot markets.

Our risk management activities may increase
    the volatility in our quarterly financial results.

We engage in commodity-related marketing and
price-risk management activities in order to hedge our exposure
to market risk with respect to electricity sales from our
generation assets, emission allowances and fuel utilized by
those assets. We generally attempt to balance our fixed-price
physical and financial purchases and sales commitments in terms
of contract volumes and the timing of performance and delivery
obligations through the use of financial and physical derivative
contracts. These derivatives are accounted for in accordance
with SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,”

as amended by
SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and
SFAS No. 149. SFAS No. 133 requires us to
record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
Whether a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting or not
depends upon it meeting specific criteria used to determine if
hedge accounting is appropriate. If a derivative does not
qualify or if the company does not elect to designate a
derivative as a hedge the changes in fair value of the
derivative will be recognized immediately in earnings. Changes
in the fair value of non-hedge derivatives are immediately
recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
accounted for as accounting hedges are either recognized in
earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the
related hedged assets, liabilities and firm commitments or for
forecasted transactions, deferred and recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income, or “OCI,”
until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in
earnings. As a result, most derivative contracts are
mark-to-market and change in their fair value, brought upon by
fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices, flow through
the statement of operations. As a result, we are unable to
predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have
on our quarterly operating results or financial position.

Our results are subject to quarterly and
    seasonal fluctuations.

Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated
in the past and may continue to do so in the future as a result
of a number of factors, including:

•

seasonal variations in demand and corresponding
    energy and fuel prices; and

•

variations in levels of production.

Additionally, because we receive the majority of
capacity payments under some of our power sales agreements
during the months of May through October, our revenues and
results of operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations.

Large energy blackouts have the potential
    to reduce our revenue collection, increase our costs and result
    in increased federal and state regulatory
    requirements.

On August 14, 2003, the northeastern United
States and parts of Canada suffered a massive blackout allegedly
stemming from transmission problems originating in Ohio. The
Department of Energy, in conjunction with its Canadian
counterpart, is actively investigating the cause of the outage.
Upon completion, there are likely to be changes to NERC
reliability criteria and standards that may impact the operation
of power plants owned by us. Other entities such as the
New York Public Service Commission are also conducting
investigations. Upon completion of these investigations, there
may be regulatory changes and we cannot



predict the impact of such changes. Moreover, the
business of selling power is fundamentally dependent on the
integrity of the electricity transmission system. Large energy
blackouts, such as the blackout described above, can occur as a
result of failures in the electricity transmission system. Such
blackouts have the potential to reduce our revenue collection,
increase our costs and engender enhanced federal and state
regulatory requirements.

Because we own less than a majority of some
    of our project investments, we cannot exercise complete control
    over their operations.

We have limited control over the operation of
some project investments and joint ventures because our
investments are in projects where we beneficially own less than
a majority of the ownership interests. We seek to exert a degree
of influence with respect to the management and operation of
projects in which we own less than a majority of the ownership
interests by negotiating to obtain positions on management
committees or to receive certain limited governance rights such
as rights to veto significant actions. However, we may not
always succeed in such negotiations. We may be dependent on our
co-venturers to operate such projects. Our co-venturers may not
have the level of experience, technical expertise, human
resources management and other attributes necessary to operate
these projects. The approval of co-venturers also may be
required for us to receive distributions of funds from projects
or to transfer our interest in projects.

Our access to the capital markets may be
    limited.

We may require additional capital from outside
sources from time to time. Our ability to arrange financing,
either at the corporate level or on a non-recourse project-level
basis, and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous
factors, including:

We may not be successful in obtaining additional
capital for these or other reasons. The failure to obtain
additional capital from time to time may have a material adverse
effect on our business and operations.

Our business is subject to substantial
    governmental regulation and permitting requirements and may be
    adversely affected by liability under, or any future inability
    to comply with, existing or future regulations or
    requirements.

Our business is subject to extensive foreign,
federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws
and regulations. We generally are required to obtain and comply
with a wide variety of licenses, permits and other approvals in
order to construct, operate or modify our facilities. We may
incur significant additional costs because of our need to comply
with these requirements. If we fail to comply with these
requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability
and the imposition of liens or fines. We could also be required
to shut down any facilities that do not comply with these
requirements. In addition, we are at risk for liability for
past, current or future contamination at our former and existing
facilities or with respect to off-site waste disposal sites that
we have used in our operations. Existing regulations may be
revised or reinterpreted and new laws



and regulations may be adopted or become
applicable to us or our facilities in a manner that may have a
detrimental effect on our business. With the continuing trend
toward stricter standards, greater regulation and more extensive
permitting requirements, we expect that our environmental
expenditures will be substantial in the future. For more
information, see “Business — Environmental
Matters.”

Our operations are potentially subject to the
provisions of various energy laws and regulations, including the
PUHCA, the FPA and state and local utility laws and regulations.

Under the FPA, FERC regulates our wholesale sales
of electric power (other than sales by our Qualifying
Facilities, which are exempt from FERC rate regulation). The
ability to sell energy at market-based rates is predicated on
the absence of market power in either generation or
transmission. The market power analysis includes not only
generation and transmission owned by a particular applicant but
also assets owned by affiliated companies. FERC has found that
we do not possess market power in either generation or
transmission outside of the Xcel Energy franchise territories.
Once we terminated our Xcel Energy relationship, we were
permitted to request FERC to find that we do not possess market
power with respect to Xcel Energy franchise territories and
request FERC to remove associated restrictions on our ability to
make market-based rate sales in such regions. On
December 17, 2003, we requested that FERC approve revision
to our market based rate tariffs, which in part removed the Xcel
Energy sales restrictions. We are waiting for FERC acceptance of
the tariff revisions. Holders of market-based rate authority
must comply with obligations imposed by FERC and with certain
FERC filing requirements such as the requirement to file
quarterly reports detailing wholesale sales. Although a number
of our direct and indirect subsidiaries have obtained
market-based rate authority from FERC, these authorizations
could be revoked if we fail in the future to satisfy the
applicable criteria, if FERC modifies the criteria, or if FERC
eliminates or further restricts the ability of wholesale sellers
to make sales at market-based rates. On November 17, 2003,
FERC issued an order conditioning all market-based rate sales on
behavioral rules intended to prevent market manipulation and
other market abuses. All market-based sales will be conditioned
on compliance with these behavioral rules and violations of such
conditions could result in a seller being subject to refunds,
revocation of market-based rate authority and other unspecified
remedies for violating the conditions. At this time it is not
clear what impact this proposal may have on us.

In addition, under PUHCA, registered holding
companies and their subsidiaries (i.e., companies with 10% or
more of their voting securities held by registered holding
companies) are subject to extensive regulation by the SEC. We
were previously a subsidiary of a registered holding company,
Xcel Energy. Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we ceased to be
a subsidiary of Xcel Energy and are no longer subject to
regulation under PUHCA as a registered holding company or as a
subsidiary of such a holding company as long as we do not become
a subsidiary of another registered holding company and the
projects in which we have an interest (1) qualify as a QF
under PURPA, (2) obtain and maintain EWG status under
Section 32 of PUHCA, (3) obtain and maintain foreign
utility company, (FUCO) status under Section 33 of
PUHCA, or (4) are subject to another exemption or waiver.
If our projects were to cease to be exempt and we were to become
subject to SEC and FERC regulation under PUHCA, it would be
difficult for us to comply with PUHCA absent a substantial
corporate restructuring.

While we are no longer a subsidiary of a
registered holding company after our emergence from bankruptcy,
we became an affiliate (as defined by PUHCA, a company with
between 5-10% of its voting securities held by a registered
holding company) of FirstEnergy, a registered holding company,
when FERC approved FirstEnergy’s application to acquire
6.5% of our outstanding common stock upon emergence from
bankruptcy as part of a settlement. Although becoming an
affiliate of FirstEnergy would have subjected us to certain
limitations on our transactions with FirstEnergy and other
restrictions, these restrictions are less substantial than those
applicable to us when we were a subsidiary of Xcel Energy. On
February 2, 2004, FirstEnergy announced that it completed
the divestiture of the NRG Energy stock in the secondary market.
Based on such disclosure, we believe that we are no longer an
affiliate of FirstEnergy.

The Energy Bill currently pending before Congress
would repeal PUHCA one year after passage and create new rules
for holding companies. At this time, the Energy Bill has stalled
in Congress and it is unclear whether it will be passed into
law. In addition, if the Energy Bill is passed, it is unclear
what impact, if any, the



new rules would have on us. See
Item 1 — Business — Federal Energy
Regulation  — Regulatory Developments for a further
discussion of the Energy Bill.

Our business faces regulatory risks related
    to the market rules and regulations imposed by transmission
    providers, ISOs and RTOs particularly with respect to our
    Connecticut generating assets.

We face regulatory risk imposed by the various
transmission providers, ISOs and RTOs and their
corresponding market rules. Transmission providers, ISOs
and RTOs have FERC-approved tariffs that govern access to their
transmission system. These tariffs may contain provisions that
limit access to the transmission grid or allocate scarce
transmission capacity in a particular manner.

We presently operate in the following ISO
markets: California (through the West Coast Power joint venture
and individually), New England, New York and PJM. The chief
regulatory risk is the lack of market product that adequately
compensates generating units for providing reliability services.
The lack of such a properly designed product is one of the
reasons we have numerous petitions with the FERC requesting cost
based compensation for some of our Connecticut facilities.

Our success will depend on our ability to
    retain key employees and successfully implement new
    strategies.

Our future success and the successful
implementation of new strategies will be highly dependent upon
our new President and Chief Executive Officer, and our new Chief
Financial Officer, as well as other members of senior
management. The loss of the services of any such individuals or
other key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon
the implementation of new strategies. Further, there can be no
assurance that the implementation of new strategies will be
successful or that they will not cause substantial disruption to
our ongoing business.

We will be subject to claims made after the
    date that we filed for bankruptcy and other claims that are not
    discharged in the bankruptcy proceeding, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations and
    profitability.

The nature of our business subjects us to
litigation in the ordinary course of business. In addition, we
are from time to time involved in other legal proceedings.
Although all claims made against us prior to the date of the
bankruptcy filing, except as described in the immediately
following paragraph, were satisfied and discharged in accordance
with the terms of the NRG plan of reorganization or in
connection with settlement agreements that were approved by the
bankruptcy court prior to our emergence from bankruptcy, any
remaining or future claims may have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and profitability. In addition, claims
made against subsidiaries that did not file chapter 11, and
claims arising after the date of our bankruptcy filing were not
discharged in the bankruptcy proceeding. See
Item 3  — Legal Proceedings of this annual report
on Form 10-K for a description of the significant legal
proceedings and investigations in which we are presently
involved.

Claims made against us prior to the date of the
bankruptcy filing might not be discharged if the claimant had no
notice of the bankruptcy filing. In addition, in other
bankruptcy cases, states have challenged whether their claims
could be discharged in a federal bankruptcy proceeding if they
never made an appearance in the case. The U.S. Supreme
Court has not finally settled this issue.

In addition, our West Coast Power subsidiaries
are named in a class action suit alleging, among other things,
the manipulation of gas price indexes by reporting false and
fraudulent trades. We have not been named in this litigation.
Dynegy has agreed with us that it will indemnify and hold
harmless all of the named defendants in such lawsuit, as well as
us. In the event Dynegy is unable or unwilling to satisfy its
indemnification obligations, our West Coast Power subsidiaries
or we could sustain substantial monetary penalties, which could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.



Under the NRG plan of reorganization, we have
established disputed claims reserves, which we will utilize to
make distributions to holders of disputed claims in our
bankruptcy as and when their claims are resolved. If these
reserves prove inadequate, we will be required to finance
required distributions from other resources, and doing so could
have an adverse impact on our financial condition and could
require the issuance of new common stock, which would dilute
existing shareholders. In particular, the State of California
has a disputed claim against us in an amount capped at
$1.35 billion. We have made no reserves for this claim
because we believe it is without merit; however, if the State of
California prevails, then payment of the distributions to which
the State of California is entitled under the NRG plan of
reorganization could have an adverse impact on our financial
condition.

We cannot be certain that the bankruptcy
    proceeding will not adversely affect our operations going
    forward.

Although we emerged from bankruptcy in December
2003, we cannot assure you that the bankruptcy proceeding will
not adversely affect our operations going forward. Having filed
for bankruptcy protection may adversely affect our ability to
negotiate favorable terms from suppliers, landlords and others
and to attract and retain customers. The failure to obtain such
favorable terms and retain customers could adversely affect our
financial performance.

Certain of our prepetition creditors have
    received NRG Energy common stock pursuant to the NRG plan of
    reorganization and have the right to select our board members
    and influence certain aspects of our business
    operations.

Under the NRG plan of reorganization, holders of
certain claims have received distributions of shares of our
common stock. MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities Partners L.P.
and one of its affiliates, collectively
“MatlinPatterson”, based on its most recent filings
with the SEC, own 21.5% of our outstanding common stock.
MatlinPatterson could acquire additional claims or shares, or it
could divest claims or shares in the future. Our prepetition
noteholders and lenders collectively received in excess of 80%
of our outstanding common stock.

If any holders of a significant number of the
shares of our common stock were to act as a group, such holders
could be in a position to control the outcome of actions
requiring stockholder approval, such as an amendment to our
certificate of incorporation, the authorization of additional
shares of capital stock, and any merger, consolidation, or sale
of all or substantially all of our assets, and could prevent or
cause a change of in our control. Moreover, certain of our
prepetition creditors, including MatlinPatterson and lenders
under our prepetition credit facility, have designated ten
members of our 11-member board of directors.

Acts of terrorism could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flows.

Our generation facilities and the facilities of
third parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist
activities, as well as events occurring in response to or in
connection with them, that could cause environmental
repercussions and/or result in full or partial disruption of
their ability to generate, transmit, transport or distribute
electricity or natural gas. Strategic targets, such as
energy-related facilities, may be at greater risk of future
terrorist activities than other domestic targets. Any such
environmental repercussions or disruption could result in a
significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction
or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our international investments face
    uncertainties.

We have investments in power projects in
Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, South America and
Taiwan. International investments are subject to risks and
uncertainties relating to the political, social and



economic structures of the countries in which we
invest. Risks specifically related to our investments in
international projects may include:

Certain of our subsidiaries remain in
    chapter 11, and we may deem it necessary to put additional
    subsidiaries through chapter 11.

The following subsidiaries are not covered by
either of the two plans of reorganization that were confirmed in
November 2003, and remain in chapter 11: NRG McClain LLC,
NRG Nelson Turbines LLC and LSP-Nelson Energy LLC. In addition,
we anticipate that it may be necessary or advisable to put one
or more of our other subsidiaries through chapter 11 as
part of our overall restructuring effort. The existence of these
ongoing chapter 11 proceedings may adversely affect the way
we are perceived by investors, financial markets, customers,
suppliers and regulatory authorities, which could adversely
affect our operations and financial performance.

Our chapter 11 reorganization has
    exposed certain of our project subsidiaries to the exercise of
    rights and remedies by project lenders or
    shareholders.

At a number of our project subsidiaries, our
pre-bankruptcy financial distress, the chapter 11
reorganization or the loss of Xcel Energy as a controlling
shareholder could constitute a default under certain project
loan agreements or shareholders agreements. Absent a waiver of
these defaults from the applicable lenders, we may not be able
to prevent the acceleration of the project debt and the exercise
of remedies against the project subsidiaries. Likewise, absent a
waiver from the affected shareholders, those shareholders may be
able to enforce buy-out rights or other remedies against our
project subsidiaries. As of the date of this annual report, we
have not been able to obtain waivers or make other arrangements
with certain of these project lenders and shareholders, and
there is no assurance that we will be able to in the future. If
we are unable to obtain waivers or make other arrangements, our
project subsidiaries may be adversely affected, which may cause
adverse effects to us as a whole.

Legal Proceedings

California Wholesale Electricity Litigation
and Related Investigations

People of the State of California ex. rel.
Bill Lockyer, Attorney General, v. Dynegy, Inc.
et al.,

United States District
Court, Northern District of California, Case No. C-02-O1854
VRW; United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Case
No. 02-16619.

This action was filed in state court on
March 11, 2002 against us, Dynegy, Dynegy Power
Marketing, Inc., Xcel Energy, West Coast Power and four of
West Coast Power’s operating subsidiaries. Through our
subsidiary, NRG West Coast LLC, we are a 50 percent
beneficial owner with Dynegy of West Coast Power, which owns,
operates, and markets the power of four California plants.
Dynegy and its affiliates and subsidiaries are responsible for
gas procurement and marketing and trading activities on behalf
of West Coast Power. It alleges that the defendants violated
California Business & Professions Code
§ 17200 by selling ancillary services to the Cal ISO,
and subsequently selling the same capacity into the spot market.
The California Attorney General seeks injunctive relief as well
as restitution, disgorgement and civil penalties.

On April 17, 2002, the defendants removed
the case to the United States District Court in
San Francisco. Thereafter, the case was transferred to
Judge Vaughn Walker, who is also presiding over various other
“ancillary services” cases brought by the California
Attorney General against other participants in the California
market, as well as other lawsuits brought by the Attorney
General against these other market participants. We have tolling
agreements in place with the Attorney General with respect to
such other proposed claims against us.

The Attorney General filed motions to remand,
which the defendants opposed in July of 2002. In an Order filed
in early September 2002, Judge Walker denied the remand motions.
The Attorney General has appealed that decision to the United
States Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit, and the appeal is
pending. The Attorney General also sought a stay of proceedings
in the district court pending the appeal, and this request was
also denied. In a lengthy opinion filed March 25, 2003,
Judge Walker dismissed the Attorney General’s action
against Dynegy and us with prejudice, finding it was barred by
the filed-rate doctrine and preempted by federal law. The
Attorney General filed a Notice of Appeal, and the appeal was
argued in August 2003 and also is pending.

Public Utility District of Snohomish
County v. Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc et al.,

Case No. 02-CV-1993 RHW, United
States District Court, Southern District of California (part of
MDL 1405).

This action was filed against us, Dynegy, Xcel
Energy and several other market participants in the United
States District Court in Los Angeles on July 15, 2002. The
complaint alleges violations of the California
Business & Professions Code § 16720 (the
Cartwright Act) and Business & Professions Code
§ 17200. The basic claims are price fixing and
restriction of supply, and other market “gaming”
activities.

The action was transferred from Los Angeles to
the United States District Court in San Diego and was made
a part of the Multi-District Litigation proceeding described
below. All defendants filed motions to dismiss and to strike in
the fall of 2002. In an Order dated January 6, 2003, Judge
Robert Whaley, a federal judge from Spokane sitting in the
United States District Court in San Diego, pursuant to the
Order of the Multi-District Litigation Panel, granted the
motions to dismiss on the grounds of federal preemption and
filed-rate doctrine. The plaintiffs have filed a notice of
appeal, and the appeal is pending.



In re: Wholesale Electricity Antitrust
Litigation,

MDL 1405, United States
District Court, Southern District of California, pending before
Judge Robert H. Whaley. The cases included in this proceeding
are as follows:

All of West Coast Power’s operating
subsidiaries are defendants in at least one of these six
coordinated cases, which were all filed in late 2000 and 2001 in
various state courts throughout California. We are also a
defendant in all of them. The cases allege unfair competition,
market manipulation and price fixing. All the cases were removed
to the appropriate United States District Courts, and were
thereafter made the subject of a petition to the Multi-District
Litigation Panel (Case No. MDL 1405). The cases were
ultimately assigned to Judge Whaley. Judge Whaley entered an
order in 2001 remanding the cases to state court, and thereafter
the cases were coordinated pursuant to state court coordination
proceedings before a single judge in San Diego Superior
Court. Thereafter, Reliant Energy and Duke Energy filed
cross-complaints naming various Canadian, Mexican and United
States government entities. Some of these defendants once again
removed the cases to federal court, where they were again
assigned to Judge Whaley. The defendants filed motions to
dismiss and to strike under the filed-rate and federal
preemption theories, and the plaintiffs challenged the district
court’s jurisdiction and sought to have the cases remanded
to state court. In December 2002, Judge Whaley issued an opinion
finding that federal jurisdiction was absent in the district
court, and remanding the cases to state court. Duke Energy and
Reliant Energy then filed a notice of appeal with the Ninth
Circuit, and also sought a stay of the remand pending appeal.
The stay request was denied by Judge Whaley. On
February 20, 2003, however, the Ninth Circuit stayed the
remand order and accepted jurisdiction to hear the appeal of
Reliant Energy and Duke Energy on the remand order. We
anticipate that filed-rate/federal preemption pleading
challenges will be renewed once the remand appeal is decided.

“Northern California”

cases against various market
participants, not including us (part of MDL 1405). These include
the

Millar, Pastorino, RDJ Farms, Century Theatres, EI Super
Burrito, Leo’s, J&M Karsant,

and

Bronco Don

cases. We were not named in any of these cases, but in virtually
all of them, either West Coast Power or one or more of its
operating subsidiaries is named as a defendant. These cases all
allege violation of Business & Professions Code
§ 17200, and are similar to the various allegations
made by the Attorney General. Dynegy is named as a defendant in
all these actions, and Dynegy’s outside counsel is
representing both Dynegy and the West Coast Power entities in
each of these cases. These cases all were removed to federal
court, made part of the Multi-District Litigation, and denied
remand to state court. In late August 2003, Judge Whaley granted
the defendants’ motions to dismiss in these various cases,
which are now the subject of the plaintiff’s appeal to the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.



Bustamante v. McGraw-Hill
Companies, Inc., et al.,

No. BC 235598, California
Superior Court, Los Angeles County.

This putative class action lawsuit was filed on
November 20, 2002. The complaint generally alleges that the
defendants attempted to manipulate gas indexes by reporting
false and fraudulent trades. Named defendants in the suit
include numerous industry participants unrelated to us, as well
as the operating subsidiaries established by West Coast Power
for each of its four plants: El Segundo Power, LLC; Long Beach
Generation, LLC; Cabrillo Power I LLC; and Cabrillo
Power II LLC. The complaint seeks restitution and
disgorgement of “ill-gotten gains,” civil fines,
compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and
declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiff filed an
amended complaint in 2003.

Jerry Egger, et al. v.
Dynegy, Inc., et al.,

Case
No. 809822, Superior Court of California, San Diego
County (filed May 1, 2003). This class action complaint
alleges violations of California’s Antitrust Law and
Business and Professional Code, as well as unlawful and unfair
business practices. The named defendants include “West
Coast Power, Cabrillo II, El Segundo Power, Long Beach
Generation.” We are not named. This case now has been
removed to the United States District Court, and the defendants
have moved to have this case included as Multi-District
Litigation along with the above referenced cases before Judge
Walker. Plaintiffs have filed a motion to remand to state court,
which was heard on February 19, 2004. At the hearing, the
court decided to stay the case pending a decision from the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals in the Pastorino appeal, referenced
above.

Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc., on behalf of
Itself and all others similarly situated v.
Dynegy, Inc. Holding Co., West Coast Power, LLC,
et al.,

Case No. CIV.S-03-2346
DFL GGH. This putative class action was filed on
November 10, 2003, in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of California. The complaint alleges
violations of the federal Sherman and Clayton Acts and
California’s Cartwright Act and Business and Professions
Code. In addition to naming West Coast Power and Dynegy, Inc.
Holding Co., the complaint names numerous industry participants,
as well as “unnamed co-conspirators.” The complaint
alleges that defendants conspired to manipulate the spot price
and basis differential of natural gas with respect to the
California market allegedly enabling defendants to reap
exorbitant and illicit profits by gouging natural gas
purchasers. Specifically, the complaint alleges that defendants
and their co-conspirators employed a variety of false reporting
techniques to manipulate the published natural gas price
indices. The complaint seeks unspecified amounts of damages,
including a trebling of plaintiff’s and the putative
class’s actual damages. We are unable at this time to
predict the outcome of this dispute or the ultimate liability,
if any, of West Coast Power.

California Investigations

FERC — California Market
    Manipulation

The FERC has an ongoing “Investigation of
Potential Manipulation of Electric and Natural Gas Prices,”
which involves hundreds of parties (including our affiliate,
West Coast Power) and substantial discovery. In June 2001, FERC
initiated proceedings related to California’s demand for
$8.9 billion in refunds from power sellers who allegedly
inflated wholesale prices during the energy crisis. Hearings
have been conducted before an administrative law judge who
issued an opinion in late 2002. The administrative law judge
stated that after assessing a refund of $1.8 billion for
“unjust and unreasonable” power prices between
October 2, 2000 and June 20, 2001, power suppliers
were owed $1.2 billion because the State was holding funds
owed to suppliers.

In August 2002, the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted a request by the
Electricity Oversight Board, the California Public Utilities
Commission and others, to seek out and introduce to FERC
additional evidence of market manipulation by wholesale sellers.
This decision resulted in FERC ordering an additional
100 days of discovery in the refund proceeding, and also
allowing the relevant time period for potential refund liability
to extend back an additional nine months, to January 1,
2000.

On December 12, 2002, FERC Administrative
Law Judge Birchman issued a Certification of Proposed Findings
on California Refund Liability in Docket No. EL00-95-045
et al., which determined the method for calculating the
mitigated energy market clearing price during each hour of the
refund period. On March 26,



2003, FERC issued an Order on Proposed Findings
on Refund Liability in Docket No. EL00-95-045, or the
“Refund Order,” adopting, in part, and modifying, in
part, the Proposed Findings issued by Judge Birchman on
December 12, 2002. In the Refund Order, FERC adopted the
refund methodology in the Staff Final Report on Price
Manipulation in Western Markets issued contemporaneously with
the Refund Order in Docket No. PA02-2-000. This refund
calculation methodology makes certain changes to Judge
Birchman’s methodology, because of FERC Staff’s
findings of manipulation in gas index prices. This could
materially increase the estimated refund liability. The Refund
Order directed generators wanting to recover any fuel costs
above the mitigated market clearing price during the refund
period to submit cost information justifying such recovery
within 40 days of the issuance of the Refund Order, which
West Coast Power did. Dynegy and the West Coast Power entities
are currently engaged in settlement negotiations with FERC
Staff, the California Attorney General, the California Public
Utility Commission, the California Electricity Oversight Board,
PG&E, and Southern California Edison.

Other FERC Proceedings

There are a number of additional, related
proceedings in which West Coast Power entities are parties,
which are either pending before FERC or on appeal from FERC to
various United States Courts of Appeal. These cases involve,
among other things, allegations of physical withholding, a
FERC-established price mitigation plan determining maximum rates
for wholesale power transactions in certain spot markets, and
the enforceability of, and obligations under, various contracts
with, among others, the California ISO and the State of
California and certain of its agencies and departments.

CFTC — Dynegy/ West Coast Power
    Natural Gas Futures Index Manipulation

On December 18, 2002, a Dynegy subsidiary,
Dynegy Marketing & Trade, or “DMT,” and West
Coast Power, collectively “the Respondents,” entered
into a consent Offer of Settlement and Order, “the Consent
Order”, with the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission,
or “CFTC.” The action is captioned In re Dynegy
Marketing & Trade and West Coast Power LLC, CFTC Docket
No. 03-03. The CFTC asserted various violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as well as CFTC regulations.

The CFTC alleged in the Consent Order that DMT
natural gas traders reported false natural gas trading
information, including price and volume information, to certain
industry publications that establish and publish indexes for
natural gas prices. The CFTC alleged that DMT submitted the
false information in an attempt to manipulate the indexes for
DMT’s benefit. The CFTC further alleged that DMT traders
directed other Dynegy personnel to report each of the same false
trades in the name of West Coast Power, as counterparty, in an
effort to lend credence to the trades’ validity. The
Respondents to the Consent Order did not admit or deny the
allegations or findings made by the CFTC, but agreed to an Offer
of Settlement, and agreed to pay a civil monetary fine of
$5 million. The Respondents also agreed to undertakings
regarding further cooperation with the CFTC and public
statements concerning the Consent Order. Dynegy agreed to pay
and be entirely responsible for the $5 million fine imposed
by the CFTC.

U.S. Attorney —
    Houston

The U.S. Attorney indicted two fired Dynegy
traders in connection with the index reporting scheme, and is
reportedly investigating other Dynegy activity and employees.

U.S. Attorney —
    San Francisco

According to press reports, the
U.S. Attorney in San Francisco has assembled an
“energy crisis” task force. While Dynegy received a
grand jury subpoena in November 2002, the scope and targets of
this investigation are unknown to us. We did not receive a
subpoena.



California State Senate Select
    Committee

This Committee, chaired by Senator Dunn,
subpoenaed records from us during the Summer of 2001. We
produced about 5,000 pages of documents; Dynegy produced a much
larger volume of documents. The Committee has apparently
concluded its activities without issuing any reports or findings.

CPUC

The CPUC continues to request data and documents
in several settings. First, it is one of the parties in the FERC
proceeding mentioned above. Second, inspectors have visited West
Coast Power plants, usually unannounced and usually immediately
following an unplanned outage. They have demanded documentation
concerning the reason for the outage. Third, the CPUC has
demanded documents to allow it to prepare “reports,”
one of which was issued in the fall of 2002, and another of
which was issued January 30, 2003. The FERC’s
above-referenced March 26 Refund Order undercut the
accuracy and reliability of these CPUC reports. Dynegy has made
extensive productions to the CPUC of plant-related materials as
well as trading data.

California Attorney General

In addition to the litigation it has undertaken
described above, the California Attorney General has undertaken
an investigation entitled “In the Matter of the
Investigation of Possibly Unlawful, Unfair, or Anti-Competitive
Behavior Affecting Electricity Prices in California.” In
this connection, the Attorney General has issued subpoenas to
Dynegy, served interrogatories on Dynegy and us, and informally
requested documents and interviews from Dynegy and Dynegy
employees as well as us and our employees. We responded to the
interrogatories in the summer of 2002, with the final set of
responses being served on September 3, 2002. We have also
produced a large volume of documentation relating to the West
Coast Power plants. In addition, our employees in California
have sat for informal interviews with representatives of the
Attorney General’s office. Dynegy employees have also been
interviewed.

NRG Bankruptcy Cap on California
    Claims

On November 21, 2003, in conjunction with
confirmation of the NRG plan of reorganization, we reached an
agreement with the Attorney General and the State of California,
generally, whereby for purposes of distributions, if any, to be
made to the State of California under the NRG plan of
reorganization, the liquidated amount of any and all allowed
claims shall not exceed $1.35 billion in the aggregate. The
agreement neither affects our right to object to these claims on
any and all grounds nor admits any liability whatsoever. We
further agreed to waive any objection to the liquidation of
these claims in a non-bankruptcy forum having proper
jurisdiction.

Although any evaluation of the likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome or an estimate of the amount or range of
potential loss in the above-referenced private actions and
various investigations cannot be made at this time, we note that
the Gordon complaint alleges that the defendants, collectively,
overcharged California ratepayers during 2000 by
$4.0 billion. We cannot predict the outcome of these cases
and investigations at this time.

Electricity Consumers Resource
    Council v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Docket
    No. 03-1449

On December 19, 2003, the Electricity
Consumers Resource Council, or “ECRC,” appealed to the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit a recent decision by FERC approving the implementation
of a demand curve for the New York installed capacity, or
“ICAP,” market. ECRC claims that the implementation of
the ICAP demand curve violates section 205 of the Federal
Power Act because it constitutes unreasonable ratemaking. We are
a party to this appeal and will contest ECRC’s assertions,
but at this time cannot assess the eventual outcome.



Connecticut Light & Power
    Company v. NRG Power
    Marketing, Inc.,

Docket
    No. 3:01-CV-2373 (AWT), pending in the United States
    District Court, District of Connecticut

This matter involves a claim by CL&P for
recovery of amounts it claims are owing for congestion charges
under the terms of a SOS contract between the parties, dated
October 29, 1999. CL&P has served and filed its motion
for summary judgment to which PMI filed a response on
March 21, 2003. CL&P has withheld approximately
$30 million from amounts owed to PMI, claiming that it has
the right to offset those amounts under the contract. PMI has
counterclaimed seeking to recover those amounts, arguing among
other things that CL&P has no rights under the contract to
offset them. By reason of the previous bankruptcy stay, the
court has not ruled on the pending motion. On November 6,
2003, the parties filed a joint stipulation for relief from the
automatic stay in order to allow the proceeding to go forward.
PMI cannot estimate at this time the likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome in this matter, or the overall exposure for
congestion charges for the full term of the contract.

Connecticut Light & Power
    Company,

Docket No. EL03-135,
    pending at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

This matter involves a dispute between CL&P
and PMI concerning which of party is responsible, under the
terms of the October 29, 1999 SOS contract, for costs
related to congestion and losses associated with the
implementation of standard market design, or “SMD-Related
Costs.” CL&P has withheld, in addition to the
$30 million discussed above, approximately $79 million
from amounts owed to PMI, claiming that it is entitled under the
contract to offset those additional amounts for SMD-Related
Costs. The parties have now reached a settlement which was filed
with FERC on March 3, 2004, whereby CL&P will pay PMI
$38.4 million plus interest, and subject to adjustments and
true-ups upon final approval by FERC.

The State of New York and Erin M.
    Crotty, as Commissioner of the New York State Department of
    Environmental Conservation v. Niagara Mohawk Power
    Corporation et al.,

United States
    District Court for the Western District of New York, Civil
    Action No. 02-CV-002S

In January 2002, the New York Department of
Environmental Conservation, or “DEC,” sued Niagara
Mohawk Power Corporation, or “NiMo,” and us in federal
court in New York. The complaint asserted that projects
undertaken at our Huntley and Dunkirk plants by NiMo, the former
owner of the facilities, required preconstruction permits
pursuant to the Clean Air Act and that the failure to obtain
these permits violated federal and state laws. In July, 2002, we
filed a motion to dismiss. On March 27, 2003, the court
dismissed the complaint against us with prejudice as to the
federal claims and without prejudice as to the state claims. It
is possible the state will appeal this dismissal to the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals. In the meantime, on December 31,
2003, the trial court granted the state’s motion to amend
the complaint to again sue us and various affiliates in this
same action in the federal court in New York, asserting
against us violations of operating permits and deficient
operating permits at the Huntley and Dunkirk plants. If the case
ultimately is litigated to an unfavorable outcome that could not
be addressed otherwise, we have estimated that the total
investment that would be required to install pollution control
devices could be as high as $300 million over a ten to
twelve-year period. We also could be found responsible for
payment of certain penalties and fines.

Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation v.
    NRG Energy, Inc., Huntley Power, LLC, and Dunkirk Power,
    LLC,

Supreme Court, State of
    New York, County of Onondaga, Case
    No. 2001-4372

We have asserted that NiMo is obligated to
indemnify it for any related compliance costs associated with
resolution of the above enforcement action. NiMo has filed suit
in state court in New York seeking a declaratory judgment
with respect to its obligations to indemnify us under the asset
sales agreement. We have pending a summary judgment motion on
its entitlement to be reimbursed by NiMo for the attorneys’
fees we have incurred in the enforcement action.



Huntley Power LLC, Dunkirk Power LLC and
    Oswego Power LLC

The DEC has alleged violations by the Huntley
Generating Station, the Dunkirk Generating Station and the
Oswego Generating Station with respect to opacity exceedances.
The above entities have been engaged in consent order
negotiations with the DEC relative to such opacity issues
affecting all three facilities since the plants were acquired.
In late February, 2004 we signed a proposed final version of the
consent order, which, if executed and thereby issued by the DEC,
would quantify the number of opacity exceedances at the three
facilities through the second quarter of 2003 and assess a
cumulative penalty of $1 million. In addition, among other
provisions, the consent order would establish stipulated
penalties for future violations of opacity requirements and of
the consent order and would impose a Schedule of Compliance. In
the event that the consent order is not issued by DEC in the
form to which we agreed to by the six entities and any
subsequent negotiations prove unsuccessful, it is not known what
relief the DEC will seek through an enforcement action and what
the result of such action will be.

Huntley Power LLC

On April 30, 2003, the Huntley Station
submitted a self-disclosure letter to the DEC reporting
violations of applicable sulfur in fuel limits, which had
occurred during 6 days in March, 2003 at the chimney stack
serving Huntley Units 63-66. The Huntley Station self-disclosed
that the average sulfur emissions rates for those days had been
1.8 lbs/mm BTU, rather than the maximum allowance of 1.7 lbs/mm
BTU. NRG Huntley Operations discontinued use of Unit 65 (the
only unit utilizing the subject stack at the time) and has kept
the remaining three units off line until adherence with the
applicable standard is assured. On May 19, 2003, the DEC
issued Huntley Power LLC a Notice of Violation. Huntley Power
LLC has met with the DEC to discuss the circumstances
surrounding the event and the appropriate means of resolving the
matter. Huntley Power LLC does not know what relief the DEC will
seek through an enforcement action. Under applicable provisions
of the Environmental Conservation Law, the DEC asserts that it
may impose a civil penalty up to $10,000, plus an additional
penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each day that a violation
continues and may enjoin continuing violations.

    and NRG Oswego Operations, Inc.,

Supreme Court, Erie County, Index
    No. 1-2000-8681 — Station Service
    Dispute

On October 2, 2000, plaintiff NiMo commenced
this action against us to recover damages plus late fees, less
payments received through the date of judgment, as well as any
additional amounts due and owing, for electric service provided
to the Dunkirk Plant after September 18, 2000. Plaintiff
NiMo claims that we have failed to pay retail tariff amounts for
utility services commencing on or about June 11, 1999 and
continuing to September 18, 2000 and thereafter. Plaintiff
has alleged breach of contract, suit on account, violation of
statutory duty and unjust enrichment claims. On or about
October 23, 2000, we served an answer denying liability and
asserting affirmative defenses.

After proceeding through discovery, and prior to
trial, the parties and the court entered into a Stipulation and
Order filed August 9, 2002 consolidating this action with
two other actions against Our Huntley and Oswego subsidiaries,
both of which cases assert the same claims and legal theories
for failure to pay retail tariffs for utility services at those
plants.

On October 8, 2002, a Stipulation and Order
was filed in the Erie County Clerk’s Office staying this
action pending submission to FERC of some or all of the disputes
in the action. We cannot make an evaluation of the likelihood of
an unfavorable outcome. The cumulative potential loss could
exceed $35 million.

Niagara
Mohawk Power Corporation v. Huntley Power LLC, NRG Huntley
Operations, Inc., NRG Dunkirk Operations, Inc.,
Dunkirk Power LLC, Oswego Harbor Power LLC, and NRG
Oswego



Operations, Inc.,

Case Filed November 26, 2002 in
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Docket No. EL
03-27-000

This is the companion action filed by NiMo at
FERC, similarly asserting that NiMo is entitled to receive
retail tariff amounts for electric service provided to the
Huntley, Dunkirk and Oswego plants. On October 31, 2003,
the FERC Trial Staff, a party to the proceedings, filed a reply
brief in which it supported and agreed with each position taken
by our facilities. In short, the staff argued that our
facilities: (1) self-supply station power under the NYISO
tariff (which took effect on April 1, 2003) in any month
during which they produce more energy than they consume and, as
such, should not be assessed a retail rate; (2) are
connected only to transmission facilities and, as such, at most
should only pay NiMo a FERC-approved transmission rate; and
(3) should be allowed to net consumption and output even if
power is injected into the grid at a different point from which
it is drawn off. We are presently awaiting a ruling by FERC. At
this stage of the proceedings, we cannot estimate the likelihood
of success on this action. As noted above, the cumulative
potential loss could exceed $35 million.

In the Matter of Louisiana Generating,
    LLC,

Adversary Proceeding
    No. 2002-1095 1-EQ on the docket of the Louisiana Division
    of Administrative Law

During 2000, DEQ issued a Part 70 Air Permit
modification to Louisiana Generating to construct and operate
two 240 MW natural gas-fired turbines. The Part 70 Air
Permit set emissions limits for the criteria air pollutants,
including NO

x

, based on the application of Best
Available Control Technology, or “BACT.” The BACT
limitation for NO

x

was based on the guarantees of the
manufacturer, Siemens-Westinghouse. Louisiana Generating sought
an interim emissions limit to allow Siemens-Westinghouse time to
install additional control equipment. To establish the interim
limit, DEQ issued a Compliance Order and Notice of Potential
Penalty, No. AE-CN-02-0022, on September 8, 2002,
which is, in part, subject to the referenced administrative
hearing. DEQ alleged that Louisiana Generating did not meet its
NO

x

emissions limit on certain days, did not conduct
all opacity monitoring and did not complete all record keeping
and certification requirements. Louisiana Generating intends to
vigorously defend certain claims and any future penalty
assessment, while also seeking an amendment of its limit for
NO

x

. An initial status conference was held with the
Administrative Law Judge and quarterly reports are being
submitted to that judge to describe progress, including
settlement and amendment of the limit. In late February 2004, we
timely submitted to the DEQ an amended BACT analysis and amended
Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permit
application to amend the NO

x

limit. In addition,
Louisiana Generating may assert breach of warranty claims
against the manufacturer. With respect to the administrative
action described above, at this time we are unable to predict
the eventual outcome of this matter or the potential loss
contingencies, if any, to which we may be subject.

NRG Sterlington Power, LLC

During 2002, NRG Sterlington conducted a review
of the Sterlington Power Facility’s Part 70 Air Permit
obtained by the facility’s former owner and operator, Koch
Power, Inc. Koch had outlined a plan to install eight
25 MW capacity turbines to reach a 200 MW capacity
limit in the permit. Due to the inability of several units to
reach their nameplate capacity, Koch determined that it would
need additional units to reach the electric output target. In
August 2000, NRG Sterlington acquired the remaining interests in
the facility not originally held on a passive basis and sought
the transfer of the Part 70 Air Permit along with a modification
to incorporate two 17.5 MW turbines installed by Koch and
to increase the total number of turbines to ten. The permit
modification was issued February 13, 2002. During further
review, NRG Sterlington determined that a ninth unit had been
installed prior to issuance of the permit modification. In
keeping with its environmental policy, it disclosed this matter
to DEQ in April, 2002. NRG Sterlington provided to DEQ
additional information during July 2002. A Consolidated
Compliance Order & Notice of Potential Penalty,
No. AE-CN-01-0393, was issued by DEQ on September 10,
2003, wherein DEQ formally alleged that NRG Sterlington did not
complete all certification requirements, and installed a ninth
unit prior to issuance of its permit modification. We met with
DEQ on November 19, 2003 to discuss mitigating
circumstances and a settlement has been agreed to between the
parties. Under the settlement agreement, without admitting any



liability, NRG Sterlington has agreed to pay DEQ
the sum of $4,500. The agreement is subject to a public comment
period and review by the Louisiana attorney general.

United States Environmental Protection
    Agency Request for Information under Section 114 of the
    Clean Air Act

On January 27, 2004, Louisiana Generating,
LLC and Big Cajun II received a request for information
under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act from the EPA seeking
information primarily relating to physical changes made at Big
Cajun II in 1994 and 1995 by the predecessor owner of that
facility. Louisiana Generating, LLC and Big Cajun II intend
to respond to the EPA request in an appropriate and cooperative
manner. At the present time, we cannot predict the probable
outcome in this matter.

General Electric Company and Siemens
    Westinghouse Turbine Purchase Disputes

We and/or our affiliates have entered into
several turbine purchase agreements with affiliates of General
Electric Company, or “GE,” and Siemens Westinghouse
Power Corporation, or “Siemens.” GE and Siemens have
notified us that we are in default under certain of those
contracts, terminated such contracts, and demanded that we pay
the termination fees set forth in such contracts. GE’s
claim amounts to approximately $113 million and
Siemens’ approximately $45 million in cumulative
termination charges. We cannot estimate the likelihood of
unfavorable outcomes in these disputes.

Itiquira Energetica, S.A.

Our indirectly controlled Brazilian project
company, Itiquira Energetica S.A., the owner of a
156 MW hydro project in Brazil, is currently in arbitration
with the former EPC contractor for the project, Inepar
Industria e Construcoes, or “Inepar.” The dispute was
commenced by Itiquira in September of 2002 and pertains to
certain matters arising under the former EPC contract. Itiquira
principally asserts that Inepar breached the contract and caused
damages to Itiquira by (i) failing to meet milestones for
substantial completion; (ii) failing to provide adequate
resources to meet such milestones; (iii) failing to pay
subcontractors amounts due; and (iv) being insolvent.
Itiquira’s arbitration claim is for approximately
U.S. $40 million. Inepar has asserted in the
arbitration that Itiquira breached the contract and caused
damages to Inepar by failing to recognize events of force
majeure as grounds for excused delay and extensions of scope of
services and material under the contract. Inepar’s damage
claim is for approximately U.S. $10 million. The
parties submitted their respective statements of claims,
counterclaims and responses, and a preliminary arbitration
hearing was held on March 21, 2003. In lieu of taking
expert testimony at hearing, the court of arbitration ordered an
expert investigation process to cover technical and accounting
issues. We anticipate that the final report from the expert
investigation process will be delivered to the court of
arbitration in the last week of March, 2004. After reviewing the
final report, the court of arbitration may, if it deems it
necessary, require expert testimony on technical and accounting
issues, which we anticipate would commence on approximately
May 15, 2004. We expect the arbitration panel to issue its
decision no later than July 31, 2004. We cannot estimate
the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in this dispute.

CFTC Trading Inquiry

On June 17, 2002, the CFTC served Xcel
Energy, on behalf of its affiliates, which then included us and
PMI, with a subpoena requesting certain information regarding
“round trip” or “wash” trading and general
trading practices in its investigation of several energy trading
companies. The CFTC now appears focused on possible efforts by
traders to submit false reports to index publications in an
attempt to manipulate the index. In January, 2004, the CFTC and
Xcel Energy’s subsidiary, e prime, inc., reached a
settlement in connection with this investigation, which included
the payment of a $16 million fine and the entry of a cease
and desist order. Other industry participants that have settled
with the CFTC have paid fines of between $1.5 million and
$30 million and have agreed to the terms of cease and
desist orders. The CFTC has requested additional related
information from us and has subpoenaed to appear for testimony a
number of our present and former employees. We have sought to
cooperate with the CFTC and have submitted materials responsive
to the



CFTC’s requests, while vigorously denying
that we engaged in any improper conduct. We cannot at this time
predict the outcome or financial impact of this investigation.

Additional Litigation

In addition to the foregoing, we are parties to
other litigation or legal proceedings, which may or may not be
material. There can be no assurance that the outcome of such
matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations.

Disputed Claims Reserve

As part of the NRG plan of reorganization, we
have funded a disputed claims reserve for the satisfaction of
certain general unsecured claims that were disputed claims as of
the effective date of the plan. Under the terms of the plan, to
the extent such claims are resolved now that we have emerged
from bankruptcy, the claimants will be paid from the reserve on
the same basis as if they had been paid out in the bankruptcy.
That means that their allowed claims will be reduced to the same
recovery percentage as other creditors would have received and
will be paid in pro rata distributions of cash and common stock.
We believe we have funded the disputed claims reserve at a
sufficient level to settle the remaining unresolved proofs of
claim we received during the bankruptcy proceedings. However, to
the extent the aggregate amount of these payouts of disputed
claims ultimately exceeds the amount of the funded claim
reserve, we are obligated to provide additional cash and common
stock to the claimants. We will continue to monitor our
obligation as the disputed claims are settled. However, if
excess funds remain in the disputed claims reserve after payment
of all obligations, such amounts will be reallocated to the
Creditor Pool. We have provided our common stock and cash
contribution to an escrow agent to complete the distribution and
settlement process. Since we have surrendered control over the
common stock and cash provided to the disputed claims reserve,
we recognized the issuance of the common stock as of
December 5, 2003 and removed the cash amounts from our
balance sheet. Similarly, we have moved the obligations relevant
to the claims from our balance sheet when the common stock was
issued and cash contributed.

Item 5 —

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity,
    Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
    Securities

Market Information and Holders

In connection with the consummation of the NRG
plan of reorganization, on December 5, 2003 all shares of
our old common stock were canceled and 100,000,000 shares
of new common stock of NRG Energy were distributed pursuant to
such plan to the holders of certain classes of claims. A certain
number of shares of common stock was issued for distribution to
holders of disputed claims as such claims are resolved or
settled. In the event our disputed claims reserve is inadequate,
it is possible we would have to issue additional shares of our
common stock to satisfy such pre-petition claims or contribute
additional cash proceeds. See Item 3 — Legal
Proceedings — Disputed Claims Reserve. Our authorized
capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of NRG Energy
common stock and 10,000,000 shares of Serial Preferred
Stock. Further, a total of 4,000,000 shares of our common
stock, representing approximately 4% of our outstanding common
stock, are available for issuance under our long-term incentive
plan.



Our new common stock currently trades in the
over-the-counter market and has been assigned the symbol
NRGE.OB. The high and low sales prices for our new common stock
since issuance on December 5, 2003 through March 9, 2004,
are:

Over-the-counter market quotations reflect
inter-dealer prices, without retail markup, mark-down or
commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.

From June 2, 2002 through December 5,
2003, Xcel Energy Wholesale Group, Inc. held all shares of
our old common stock. During the period from May 31, 2000
through June 3, 2002, our then outstanding common stock was
traded principally on the New York Stock Exchange.

Dividends

We have not declared or paid dividends on our new
common stock, and the payment of dividends is currently
prohibited by our credit agreements.

Securities Authorized for Issuance Under
Equity Compensation Plans

*

The NRG Energy, Inc. long-term incentive
    plan became effective upon our emergence from bankruptcy. The
    Long-Term Incentive Plan was not approved by security holders as
    it was adopted in connection with the NRG plan of
    reorganization. The long-term incentive plan provides for grants
    of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
    performance awards, deferred stock units and dividend equivalent
    rights. Our directors, officers and employees, as well as other
    individuals performing services for, or to whom an offer of
    employment has been extended by us, are eligible to receive
    grants under the long-term incentive plan. A total of
    4,000,000 shares of our common stock, representing
    approximately 4% of our outstanding common stock, are available
    for issuance under the long-term incentive plan. The purpose of
    the long-term incentive plan is to promote our long-term growth
    and profitability by providing these individuals with incentives
    to maximize stockholder value and otherwise contribute to our
    success and to enable us to attract, retain and reward the best
    available persons for positions of responsibility. The
    compensation committee of our board of directors will administer
    the long-term incentive plan.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use
of Proceeds from Registered Securities

All of our outstanding common stock was issued
pursuant to the NRG plan of reorganization on December 5,
2003 in accordance with Section 1145 of the bankruptcy
code. We received no proceeds from such issuance.



Item 6 —

Selected Financial Data

The following table presents our selected
financial data. The data included in the following table has
been restated to reflect the assets, liabilities and results of
operations of certain projects that have met the criteria for
treatment as discontinued operations. For additional information
refer to Item 15 — Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. This historical data should
be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
Statements and the related notes thereto in Item 15 and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7. Due to
the adoption of Fresh Start reporting as of December 5,
2003, the Successor Company’s post Fresh Start balance
sheet and statement of operations have not been prepared on a
consistent basis with the Predecessor Company’s financial
statements and are not comparable in certain respects to the
financial statements prior to the application of Fresh Start
reporting. A black line has been drawn to separate and
distinguish between Reorganized NRG and the Predecessor Company.

N/A — Not Applicable.



The following table provides the detail of our
revenues from majority-owned operations:

Energy and energy related revenue consists of
revenues received upon the physical delivery of electrical
energy to a third party at both spot (merchant sales) and
contracted rates. In addition, we also generate revenues from
the sale of ancillary services and by entering into certain
financial transactions. Ancillary revenues are derived from the
sale of energy related products associated with the generation
of electrical energy such as spinning reserves, reactive power
and other similar products. Revenues derived from financial
transactions are generally received upon the settlement of
transactions relating to the sale of energy or fuel which do not
require the physical delivery of the underlying commodity.

Capacity revenue consists of revenues received
from a third party at either spot (merchant sales) or negotiated
contract rates for making installed generation capacity
available upon demand in order to satisfy system integrity and
reliability requirements. In addition, capacity revenues
includes revenues received under tolling arrangements which
entitle third parties to dispatch our facilities and assume
title to the electrical generation produced from that facility.

Alternative revenues consists of revenues
received from the sale of steam, hot and chilled water generally
produced at a central district energy plant and sold to
commercial, governmental and residential buildings for space
heating, domestic hot water heating and air conditioning.
Alternative revenue includes the sale of high-pressure steam
produced and delivered to industrial customers that is used as
part of an industrial process. In addition, alternative revenues
includes revenues received from the processing of municipal
solid waste into refuse derived fuel that is sold to a third
party to be used as fuel in the generation of electricity.

O&M fees consist of revenues received from
providing certain unconsolidated affiliates with management and
operational services generally under long-term operating
agreements.

Other revenues consist of miscellaneous other
revenues derived from the sale of natural gas, recovery of
incurred costs under reliability agreements and revenues
received under leasing arrangements.

Item 7 —

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

We are a wholesale power generation company,
primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of power
generation facilities and the sale of energy, capacity and
related products in the United States and internationally. We
have a diverse portfolio of electric generation facilities in
terms of geography, fuel type and dispatch levels, which help us
mitigate risk. We intend to maximize operating income through
the efficient procurement and management of fuel supplies and
maintenance services, and the sale of energy, capacity and
ancillary services into attractive spot, intermediate and
long-term markets.

We do not anticipate any significant new
acquisitions or construction in the near future, and instead
will focus on operational performance, asset management and debt
reduction. We have already made significant reductions in
capital expenditures, business development activities and
personnel. Power sales, fuel procure-



ment and risk management will remain key
strategic elements of our operations. Our objective will be to
optimize the operating income of our facilities within an
appropriate risk and liquidity profile.

Industry Trends.

In
this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” we discuss
our historical results of operations and expected financial
condition. During 2002 and 2003, the following factors, among
others, have negatively affected our results of operations:

We expect that these generally weak market
conditions will continue for the foreseeable future in some
markets. Historically, we have believed that, as supply
surpluses begin to tighten and as market rules and regulatory
conditions stabilize, prices will improve for energy, capacity
and ancillary services. This view is consistent with our belief
that in the long run market prices will support an adequate rate
of return on the construction of new power generation assets
needed to meet increasing demand. This view is currently being
challenged in certain markets as regulatory actions and market
rules unfold that limit the ability of merchant power companies
to earn favorable returns on existing and new investments. To
the extent unfavorable regulatory and market conditions exist in
the long term, we could have significant impairments of our
property, plant and equipment, which, in turn, could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further,
this could lead to us closing certain of our facilities
resulting in additional economic losses and liabilities.

Asset Sales.

As part
of our strategy, we plan to continue the selective divestment of
certain assets. Since July 2002, we have sold or made
arrangements to sell a number of assets and equity investments.
In addition, we are currently marketing our interest in certain
other non strategic assets.

Discontinued
Operations.

We have classified certain
business operations, and gains/losses recognized on sale, as
discontinued operations for projects that were sold or have met
the required criteria for such classification pending final
disposition. Accounting regulations require that continuing
operations are reported separately in the income statement from
discontinued operations, and that any gain or loss on the
disposition of any such business be reported along with the
operating results of such business. Assets classified as
“discontinued operations” on our balance sheet as of
December 31, 2003 include McClain. For the periods
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, discontinued
results of operations include our Killingholme, McClain, NEO
Landfill Gas, Inc., NEO Fort Smith LLC, NEO Woodville
LLC, NEO Phoenix LLC, Timber Energy Resources, Inc., Cahua
and Energia Pacasmayo projects. All prior periods presented have
been restated accordingly. For the period December 6, 2003
through December 31, 2003, discontinued results of
operations included McClain.

New Management.

On
October 21, 2003, we announced the appointment of David
Crane as our new President and Chief Executive Officer,
effective December 1, 2003. Before joining us,
Mr. Crane served as the Chief Executive Officer of
London-based International Power PLC and has over 12 years
of energy industry



experience. On March 11, 2004 we announced
the appointment of Robert Flexon as Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer, effective March 29, 2004. Before
joining us Mr. Flexon served as Vice President, Work
Processes, Corporate Resources and Development at
Hercules, Inc. In addition, we have filled several other
senior and middle management positions over the last
12 months. Our board of directors currently is comprised of
Mr. Crane and ten other independent individuals, three of
whom have been designated by MatlinPatterson.

Independent Public Accountants; Audit
Committee.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
has been our independent auditor since 1995. Our new board of
directors has appointed an audit committee consisting entirely
of independent directors. Pursuant to the charter, the committee
appoints, retains, oversees, evaluates, compensates and
terminates on its sole authority our independent auditors and
approves all audit engagements, including the scope, fees and
terms of each engagement. The audit committee’s oversight
process is intended to ensure that we will continue to have
high-quality, cost-efficient independent auditing services.

Results of Operations

Due to the adoption of Fresh Start as of
December 5, 2003, Reorganized NRG’s balance sheet,
statement of operations and statement of cash flows have not
been prepared on a consistent basis with, and are therefore
generally not comparable to those of the Predecessor Company
prior to the application of Fresh Start. In accordance with
SOP 90-7, Reorganized NRG’s balance sheet, statement
of operations and statement of cash flows have been presented
separately from those of the Predecessor Company.

Reorganized NRG’s revenues from
majority-owned operations, operating costs and expenses,
general, administrative and development expenses, write-downs
and losses on sales of equity method investments, restructuring
and impairment charges and legal settlement costs were not
significantly affected by the adoption of Fresh Start.
Therefore, the Predecessor Company’s 2003 amounts have been
combined with Reorganized NRG’s 2003 amounts for comparison
and analysis purposes herein.

Reorganized NRG’s net loss, equity in
earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, depreciation and
amortization, other income (expense), income taxes and
discontinued operations were affected by the adoption of



Fresh Start. Therefore, the Predecessor
Company’s 2003 and the Reorganized NRG’s 2003 amounts
are discussed separately for comparison and analysis purposes
herein.

For the Year Ended December 31, 2003
    Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002

Net Income

Predecessor Company

During the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003, we recorded net income of
$2.8 billion. Net income for the period is directly
attributable to our emerging from bankruptcy and adopting the
Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90-7. Upon the confirmation
of our Plan of Reorganization and our emergence from bankruptcy
we were able to remove significant amounts of long-term debt and
other prepetition obligations from our balance sheet.
Accordingly, as part of net income from continuing operations,
we recorded a net gain of $3.9 billion as the impact of our
adopting Fresh Start in our statement of operations,
$6.0 billion of this amount is directly related to the
forgiveness of debt and settlement of substantial amounts of our
pre-petition obligations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. In
addition to the removal of substantial amounts of pre-petition
debt and other obligations from our balance sheet, we have also
revalued our assets and liabilities to fair value, accordingly
we have substantially written down the value of our fixed
assets. We have recorded a net $1.7 billion charge related
to the revaluation of our assets and liabilities within the
Fresh Start Reporting adjustment line of our consolidated
statement of operations. In addition to our recording
adjustments related to our emergence from bankruptcy, we also
recorded substantial charges related to other items such as the
settlement of certain outstanding litigation in the amount of
$462.6 million, write downs and losses on the sale of
equity investments of $147.1 million, advisor cost and
legal fees directly attributable to our being in bankruptcy of
$197.8 million and $237.6 million of other asset
impairment and restructuring costs incurred prior to our filing
for bankruptcy. Net income for the period January 1, 2003
through December 5, 2003 was also favorably impacted by our
not recording interest expense on substantial amounts of
corporate level debt while we were in bankruptcy and by the
continued favorable results experienced by our equity
investments.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, we
recognized a net loss of $3.5 billion. The loss from
continuing operations incurred during 2002 primarily consisted
of $2.7 billion of other charges consisting primarily of
asset impairments.

Reorganized NRG

During the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003, we recognized net income of
$11.0 million or $0.11 per share of common stock. Net
income was directly attributable to a number of factors some of
which are discussed below. From an overall operational
perspective our facilities were profitable during this period.
Our results were adversely impacted by our having to continue to
satisfy the standard offer service contract that we entered into
with Connecticut Light & Power, or “CL&P” in
2000. As a result of our inability to terminate this contract
during our bankruptcy proceeding we continued to be exposed to
losses under this contract. These losses were incurred, as we
were unable to satisfy the requirements of this contract



at a price/cost below the contracted sales price.
Upon our adoption of Fresh Start, we recorded at fair value, all
assets and liabilities on our opening balance sheet and
accordingly we recorded as an obligation the fair value of the
CL&P contract. During the period December 6, 2003
through December 31, 2003, we recognized as revenues, the
entire fair value of this contract effectively offsetting the
actual losses incurred under this contract. The CL&P
contract terminated on December 31, 2003.

Revenues from Majority Owned
    Operations

Our operating revenues from majority owned
operations were $2.1 billion in 2003, compared to
$2.1 billion in the prior year, an increase of
$1.3 million or less than 1%.

Revenues from majority owned operations of
$2.1 billion for the year 2003, includes $1.1 billion
of energy revenues, $649.1 million of capacity revenues,
$192.8 million of alternative energy, $15.3 of O&M fees
and $153.5 million of other revenues which include
financial and physical gas sales, sales from our Schkopau
facility and NEPOOL expense reimbursements. The increase of
$1.3 million is due to increased capacity revenues
resulting from additional projects becoming operational in the
later part of 2002, higher sales in New York, and by our
recognizing, as additional revenues, the fair value of the
out-of-market CL&P contract upon our emergence from
bankruptcy. Offsetting these increases, we continued to
recognize losses on the CC&P contract throughout 2003
resulting from higher market prices and lower generation.

Cost of Majority-Owned Operations

Our cost of majority owned operations related to
continuing operations was $1.6 billion in 2003, compared to
$1.4 billion for 2002, an increase of $113.0 million
or 7.8%. For 2003 and 2002, cost of majority owned operations
represented 73.3% and 68.0% of revenues from majority owned
operations, respectively. Cost of majority owned operations,
consists primarily of cost of energy (primarily fuel costs),
labor, operating and maintenance costs and non income based
taxes related to our majority owned operations.

For the year 2003, cost of energy was
$956.4 million compared to $965.7 million for 2002,
representing a decrease of $9.3 million. As a percent of
revenue from majority owned operations, cost of energy was 45.1%
and 45.6%, for 2003 and 2002, respectively. This decrease was a
result of an overall decrease in the cost of fuel during 2003
and a favorable change in the fair value of our energy related
derivatives resulting from contract terminations. Offsetting
this decrease are liquidated damages of $72.9 million
triggered from our financial condition.

Depreciation and Amortization

Predecessor Company

Our depreciation and amortization expense related
to continuing operations was $245.9 million for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and $240.7
for the year ended December 31, 2002. Depreciation and
amortization consists of the allocation of our historical
depreciable fixed asset costs over the remaining lives of such
property as well as the amortization of certain contract based
intangible assets.

Reorganized NRG

Our depreciation and amortization expense related
to continuing operations was $13.0 million for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003.
Depreciation and amortization consists of the allocation of our
newly valued basis in our fixed assets over newly determined
remaining fixed asset lives. As part of adopting the Fresh Start
concepts of SOP 90-7 our tangible fixed assets were
recorded at fair value as determined by a third party valuation
expert who we also consulted with in determining the appropriate
remaining lives for our tangible depreciable property.
Depreciation expense for this period was based on preliminary
depreciable lives and asset balances.



General, Administrative and
    Development

Our general, administrative and development costs
for 2003 were $192.0 million compared to
$226.2 million for 2002, a decrease of $34.1 million
or 15.1%. For 2003 and 2002, general, administrative and
development costs represent 9.1% and 10.7% of revenues from
majority owned operations, respectively. This decrease is due to
decreased costs related to work force reduction efforts, cost
reductions due to the closure of certain international offices
and reduced legal costs. Outside services also decreased, due to
less non-restructuring legal activities.

Other Charges (Credits)

During the year 2003, we recorded other credits
of $3.0 billion, which consisted primarily of
$228.9 million related to asset impairments,
$462.6 million related to legal settlements and
$197.8 million related to reorganization charges and
$8.7 million related to restructuring charges. We also
incurred a $3.9 billion credit related to Fresh Start
adjustments. During 2002, we recorded other charges of
$2.7 billion, which consisted primarily of
$2.6 billion related to asset impairments and
$111.3 million related to restructuring charges.

We review the recoverability of our long-lived
assets on a periodic basis and if we determined that an asset
was impaired, we compared asset-carrying values to total future
estimated undiscounted cash flows. Separate analyses are
completed for assets or groups of assets at the lowest level for
which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the
cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The estimates of
future cash flows included only future cash flows, net of
associated cash outflows, directly associated with and expected
to arise as a result of our assumed use and eventual disposition
of the asset. Cash flow estimates associated with assets in
service are based on the asset’s existing service
potential. The cash flow estimates may include probability
weightings to consider possible alternative courses of action
and outcomes, given the uncertainty of available information and
prospective market conditions.

If an asset was determined to be impaired based
on the cash flow testing performed, an impairment loss was
recorded to write down the asset to its fair value. Estimates of
fair value were based on prices for similar assets and present
value techniques. Fair values determined by similar asset prices
reflect our current estimate of recoverability from expected
marketing of project assets. For fair values determined by
projected cash flows, the fair value represents a discounted
cash flow amount over the remaining life of each project that
reflects project-specific assumptions for long-term power pool
prices, escalated future project operating costs, and expected
plant operation given assumed market conditions.



Impairment charges (credits) included the
following for the year ended December 31, 2002 and for the
period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003 and the
period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003.



Reorganization Items

For the period from January 1, 2003 to
December 5, 2003, we incurred $197.8 million in
reorganization costs and for the period from December 6,
2003 to December 31, 2003 we incurred $2.5 million in
reorganization costs. All reorganization costs have been
incurred since we filed for bankruptcy in May 2003. The
following table provides the detail of the types of costs
incurred (in thousands):

Restructuring Charges

We incurred total restructuring charges of
approximately $111.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002. These costs consisted of employee
separation costs and advisor fees. We incurred an additional
$8.7 million of employee separation costs and advisor fees
during 2003 until we filed for bankruptcy in May 2003.
Subsequent to that date we recorded all advisor fees as
reorganization costs.

Legal Settlement Costs

During 2003, we recorded $396.0 million in
connection with the resolution of the FirstEnergy Arbitration
Claim. As a result of this resolution, FirstEnergy retained
ownership of the Lake Plant Assets and received an allowed
general unsecured claim of $396 million under the NRG plan
of reorganization submitted to the bankruptcy court.

In November 2003, we settled various litigation
with Fortistar Capital in which Fortistar Capital released us
from all litigation claims in exchange for a $60.0 million
pre-petition claim and an $8.0 million post-petition claim.
We had previously recorded $10.8 million in connection with
various legal disputes with Fortistar Capital; accordingly, we
recorded an additional $57.2 million during November 2003.

In August of 1995, we entered into a Marketing,
Development and Joint Proposing Agreement or “the Marketing
Agreement”, with Cambrian Energy Development LLC, or
“Cambrian.” Various claims had arisen in connection
with this Marketing Agreement. In November 2003, we entered into
a Settlement Agreement with Cambrian where we agreed to transfer
our 100% interest in three gasco projects (NEO Ft. Smith,
NEO Phoenix and NEO Woodville) and our 50% interest in two genco
projects (MM Phoenix and MM Woodville) to Cambrian. In addition,
we agreed to pay approximately $1.8 million in settlement
of royalties incurred in connection with the Marketing
Agreement. We had previously recorded a liability for royalties
owed to Cambrian, therefore, we recorded an additional
$1.4 million during November 2003.

In November 2003, we settled our dispute with
Dick Corporation in connection with Meriden Gas Turbines, which
resulted in our recording an additional liability of
$8.0 million in November, 2003.



Fresh Start Adjustments

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a
credit of $3.9 billion in connection with fresh start
adjustments as discussed in Item 15 —
Note 3. Following is a summary of the significant effects
of the reorganization and Fresh Start:

Other Income (Expense)

Predecessor Company

During the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003, we recorded other expense of
$327.4 million. Other expense consisted primarily of
$360.4 million of interest expense and $147.1 million
of write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments,
partially offset by equity in earnings of unconsolidated
affiliates of $170.9 million and $11.4 million of
other income.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, other
expenses was $590.3 million, which consisted primarily of
$487.2 million of interest expense and $200.5 million
of write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments.

Interest expense for the period January 1,
2003 through December 5, 2003 of $360.4 million
consisted of interest expense on both our project and corporate
level interest bearing debt. In addition, interest expense
includes the amortization of debt issuance costs and any
interest rate swap termination costs. Subsequent to our entering
into bankruptcy we ceased the recording of interest expense on
our corporate level debt as these prepetition claims were deemed
to be impaired and subject to compromise. We did not however
cease to record interest expense on the project level debt
outstanding at our Northeast Generating and South Central
Generating facilities even though these entities were also in
bankruptcy as these claims were deemed to be most likely not
impaired and not subject to compromise. We also recorded
substantial amounts of fees and costs related to our acquiring a
debtor in possession financing arrangement while we were in
bankruptcy. In addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy we
wrote off any remaining deferred finance costs related to our
corporate and project level debt including our Northeast and
South Central project level debt as it was probable that they
would be refinanced upon our emergence from bankruptcy.

Write-Downs and Losses on Sales of Equity
    Method Investments

As we periodically review our equity method
investments for impairments we have taken substantial
write-downs and losses on sales of equity method investments
during the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003 and for the year 2002. In 2003 we recorded impairments and
losses on the sales of investments of $147.1 million
compared to $200.5 million in 2002. The $147.1 million
recorded in 2003 consists of the write down of our investment in
the Loy Yang project of $146.4 million and our investment
in the NEO Corporation — Minnesota Methane project of
$12.3 million during 2003. These losses were partially



offset by gains on the sale of our investment in
the ECKG and Mustang projects. During 2002 we recorded
write-downs and losses on sales of equity method investments of
$200.5 million. The $200.5 million recorded in 2002
consists of a write down of our investment in the Loy Yang
project of $111.4 million, a loss of $48.4 million on
the transfer of our interest in the Sabine River Works project
to our partner, a $14.2 million write down related to our
investment in our EDL project, a write down of our investment in
our Kondapalli project of $12.7 million and a write down of
our investment in NEO Corporation — Minnesota Methane
and MM Biogas of $12.3 million and $3.3 million,
respectively among others. See Item 15 —
Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

During the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003, minority interest in (earnings)/losses of
consolidated subsidiaries was $(2.2) million, compared to
$20.3 million, an increase of $22.5 million, as
compared to 2002. The increase is primarily due to favorable
results at PERC.

Reorganized NRG

Other income (expense) for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, was an
expense of $6.7 million and consisted primarily of
$21.6 million of interest expense, partially offset by
$13.5 million of equity earnings from unconsolidated
subsidiaries.

Interest expense for the period December 6,
2003 through December 31, 2003 of $21.6 million
consists primarily of interest expense at the corporate level,
primarily related to the newly issued high yield notes, term
loan facility and revolving line of credit used to refinance
certain project level financings. In addition, interest expense
includes the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred
as a result of our refinancing efforts and the amortization of
discounts and premiums recorded upon the marking of our debt to
fair value upon our adoption of the Fresh Start provision of
SOP 90-7.

Equity Earnings from Unconsolidated
    Affiliates

Predecessor Company

During the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003, we recorded $170.9 million of equity
earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Our 50%
investment in West Coast Power comprised $98.7 million of
this amount with our investments in the Mibrag, Loy Yang,
Gladstone and Rocky Road projects comprising $21.8 million,
$17.9 million, $12.4 million and $6.9 million,
respectively, with the remaining amounts attributable to various
domestic and international equity investments. Our investment in
West Coast Power continues to generate favorable earnings as
well as our investments in Mibrag, Loy Yang, Gladstone and Rocky
Road. For the year ended December 31, 2002, equity earnings
from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was
$69.0 million.

Reorganized NRG

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates
of $13.5 million consists primarily of equity earnings from
our 50% ownership in West Coast Power of $9.3 million.

Discontinued Operations

Predecessor Company

As of December 5, 2003, we classified as
discontinued operations the operations and gains/losses
recognized on the sales of projects that were sold or were
deemed to have met the required criteria for such classification
pending final disposition. For the period January 1, 2003
through December 5, 2003, discontinued operations consist
of the historical operations and net gains/losses related to our
Killingholme, McClain, NLGI, NEO Corporation projects, TERI,
Cahua and Energia Pacasmayo projects. Discontinued operations
for the year ended December 31, 2002 consisted of our
Crockett Cogeneration, Entrade, Killingholme, Csepel, Bulo Bulo,
McClain, NLGI and TERI, Cahua and Energia Pacasmayo projects.



For the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003, the results of operations related to such
discontinued operations was a net gain of $15.7 million.
The reason for the gain recognized during the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, was the
completion of the sale of our interest in Killingholme resulting
in a net gain of $191.2 million, offset by the loss on the
sale of our Peru projects, impairment charges recorded at
McClain and NLGI.

During 2002 we recognized a loss on discontinued
operations of $500.8 million due to asset impairments
recorded at Killingholme, NLGI and TERI projects.

Reorganized NRG

Discontinued operations for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 is
comprised of a gain of $0.5 million attributable to the on
going operations of our McClain project.

Income Tax

Predecessor Company

Income tax (benefit)/expense for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 was a tax
expense of $16.6 million as compared to a tax benefit of
($164.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
The income tax expense for the period ended December 5,
2003 was primarily due to separate company income tax
liabilities and an increase in the valuation allowance against
deferred tax assets. An additional valuation allowance of
$33 million was recorded against deferred tax assets of NRG
West Coast as a result of its conversion from a corporation to a
single member limited liability company (a disregarded entity
for federal income tax purposes).

The effective income tax rate for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 is relatively
low since the U.S. net operating loss carryforwards are
offset by the cancellation of debt income resulting from the
Bankruptcy. The income tax benefit for the year ended
December 31, 2002 was primarily due to the increase in
deferred tax assets relating to impairments recognized for
financial reporting purposes. A valuation allowance was
increased limiting the recognition of deferred tax assets to the
extent of previously-recorded deferred tax liabilities.

Income taxes have been recorded on the basis that
our U.S. subsidiaries and we will file separate federal
income tax returns for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003. Since our U.S. subsidiaries and we
will not be included in the Xcel Energy consolidated tax group,
each of our U.S. subsidiaries that is classified as a
corporation for U.S. income tax purposes must file a
separate federal income tax return. It is uncertain if, on a
stand-alone basis, we would be able to fully realize deferred
tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary
differences, therefore a full valuation allowance has been
established.

Reorganized NRG

Income tax (benefit)/expense for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 was a tax
benefit of ($0.7) million which consists of a U.S. tax
benefit of ($1.5) million and foreign tax expense of
$0.8 million. The foreign tax expense for the period is due
to earnings in the foreign jurisdictions.

Our U.S. subsidiaries and we will file a
consolidated federal income tax return for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. With the
exception of alternative minimum tax, or “AMT”, we
anticipate that our cash tax rate for the next 5 years will
be relatively low as we realize the cash tax benefits from using
our net operating loss carryforwards. For AMT purposes,
utilization of net operating losses is limited on an annual
basis.

Due to the uncertainty of realization of deferred
tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary
differences, the change in U.S. current and deferred income
taxes has been fully offset by a change in the valuation
allowance and our U.S. net deferred tax assets at
December 31, 2003 were offset by a full valuation allowance
in accordance with SFAS 109. Regarding the valuation
allowance as of December 5, 2003, SOP 90-7 requires
any future benefits from reducing the valuation allowance from
preconfirmation net



operating loss carryforwards be reported as a
direct addition to paid-in-capital versus a benefit on our
income statement. Consequently, our effective tax rate in post
Bankruptcy emergence years will not benefit from utilization of
our net operating loss carryforwards which were fully valued as
of the date of our emergence from Bankruptcy.

As of December 31, 2003, our management
intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings from our foreign
operations. Accordingly, U.S. income taxes and foreign
withholding taxes were not provided on the earnings of our
foreign subsidiaries.

For the Year Ended December 31, 2002
    Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001

Net Loss

During the year ended December 31, 2002, we
recognized a net loss of $3.5 billion. This loss
represented a decrease in earnings of $3.7 billion compared
to net income of $265.2 million for the same period in
2001. Our loss from continuing operations was $3.0 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to net income
of $222.0 million from continuing operations for the same
period in 2001. The loss from continuing operations incurred
during 2002 primarily consists of $2.7 billion of other
charges consisting primarily of asset impairments.

During 2002, our continuing operations
experienced less favorable results than those experienced during
the same period in 2001. Overall, our domestic power generation
operations performed poorly compared to the same period in 2001.
Our domestic operations experienced reductions in domestic
energy and capacity sales and an overall decrease in power pool
prices and related spark spreads (the monetary difference
between the price of power and fuel cost). During the fourth
quarter of 2002, an additional reserve for uncollectible
receivables in California was established by West Coast Power,
the California joint venture of which we own 50%, which reduced
our equity in the earnings of that joint venture by
approximately $58.5 million on a pre-tax basis. In
addition, West Coast Power’s results were already less than
those recorded in 2001 due to less favorable contracts and
reductions in sales of energy and capacity. In addition,
increased administrative costs, depreciation and interest
expense from completed construction costs also contributed to
the less than favorable results in 2002. Partially offsetting
these earnings reductions was the recognition, in the fourth
quarter of 2002, of approximately $51.0 million of
additional revenues related to the contractual termination of a
power purchase agreement with our Indian River project.

During the third quarter of 2002, we experienced
credit rating downgrades, defaults under certain credit
agreements, increased collateral requirements and reduced
liquidity. These events led to impairments of a number of our
assets, resulting in pre-tax charges related to continuing
operations of approximately $2.6 billion during 2002. In
addition, approximately $200.5 million of net losses on
sales and write-downs of equity method investments were recorded
in 2002.

Operating results of majority-owned projects that
were sold or have met the criteria to be considered as
held-for-sale have been classified as discontinued operations.
The period ended December 31, 2002, consisted of the
historical operations and net gains/losses related to our
Crockett Cogeneration, Entrade, Killingholme, Csepel, Bulo Bulo,
McClain, NLGI, NEO Fort Smith LLC, NEO Woodville LLC, NEO
Phoenix LLC, TERI, Cahua and Energia Pacasmayo.

During 2002, we expensed approximately
$111.3 million for costs related to our financial
restructuring. These costs include expenses for financial and
legal advisors, contract termination costs, employee separation
and other restructuring activities.

Revenues from Majority-Owned
    Operations

Our operating revenues from majority-owned
operations were $2.1 billion in 2002 compared to
$2.2 billion in the prior year, a decrease of
$88.8 million or approximately 4.0%. Revenues from
majority-owned operations for the year ended December 31,
2002, consisted primarily of power generation revenues from
domestic operations of approximately $1.6 billion in 2002
compared with $1.7 billion in 2001, a decrease



of $132.8 million. This decrease in domestic
generation revenue is due to reductions in energy and capacity
sales and an overall decrease in power pool prices.

The Northeast region experienced decreased
revenues, as they were significantly affected by a combination
of lower capacity revenues and a decline in megawatt hour
generation compared with 2001. This decline in generation is
attributable to an unseasonably warm winter and cooler spring
and a slowing economy, which reduced demand for electricity,
together with new regulation, which reduced price volatility,
particularly in New York City. The South Central region
generated increased revenues primarily due to a full year of
operations compared to plants acquired and completed in

.

Our International revenues from majority-owned
operations increased by $36.3 million or 10.9% from 2001 to
2002. The Asia Pacific region reported a reduction in revenues
of $9.8 million while increases were reported from Europe
of $34.9 million and Latin America of $11.2 million.
The reduction in Asia Pacific revenue is primarily due to a
decline in energy prices and the loss of a significant contract
at Flinders. The increase in Europe and Latin America revenue is
primarily due to a full year of operations for acquisitions made
in 2001.

Operating Costs and Expenses

For the year ended December 31, 2002, cost
of majority-owned operations related to continuing operations
was $1.4 billion compared to $1.4 billion for 2001, an
increase of $11.2 million or approximately 0.8%. For the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, cost of
majority-owned operations represented approximately 68.0% and
64.7% of revenues from majority-owned operations, respectively.
Cost of majority-owned operations consists primarily of cost of
energy (primarily fuel costs), labor, operating and maintenance
costs and non-income based taxes related to our majority-owned
operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, cost
of energy was $965.7 million compared to
$995.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
This represents a decrease of $29.3 million or 2.9%. As a
percent of revenue from majority-owned operations cost of energy
was 45.1% and 45.1% for the years ended December 31, 2002
and 2001, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
operating and maintenance costs were $399.0 compared to
$347.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
This represents an increase of $51.6 million or 14.9%. As a
percent of revenue from majority-owned operations, operating and
maintenance costs represented 18.8% and 15.7%, for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
increase in operating and maintenance expense is primarily due
to a full year of expense in 2002 related to assets acquired
during 2001.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
depreciation and amortization related to continuing operations
was $240.7 million, compared to $163.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of
$76.8 million or approximately 46.9%. This increase is
primarily due to the addition of property, plant and equipment
related to our acquisitions of electric generating facilities
completed during 2002.

General, Administrative and
    Development

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
general, administrative and development costs were
$226.2 million, compared to $192.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of
$34.1 million or approximately 17.7%. For the year
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, general, administrative
and development costs represent 10.7% and 8.7% of revenues from
majority-owned operations, respectively. This increase is
primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense. Additionally
there was an increase in other general administrative expenses
due to 2001 acquisitions and newly constructed facilities coming
on line. These increases were partially offset by decreases in
business development expenses and other reductions to costs
previously incurred to support international and expanded
operations.



Other Charges

During the third quarter of 2002, we experienced
credit rating downgrades, defaults under certain credit
agreements, increased collateral requirements and reduced
liquidity. We applied the provisions of SFAS No. 144
to our construction and operational projects. We completed an
analysis of the recoverability of the asset carrying values of
our projects factoring in the probability of different courses
of action available to us given our financial position and
liquidity constraints. As a result, we determined during the
third quarter that many of our construction projects and certain
operational projects were impaired and should be written down to
fair market value. To estimate fair value, our management
considered discounted cash flow analyses, bids and offers
related to those projects and prices of similar assets. During
2002, we recorded asset impairment and other special charges
related to continuing operations of $2.7 billion. See
Item 15 — Note 8 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Other Income (Expense)

For the year ended December 31, 2002, total
other expense was $590.3 million, compared to
$161.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001,
an increase of $428.4 million or approximately 264.7%. The
increase in total other expense from 2001 consisted primarily of
an increase in interest expense and $200.5 million of write
downs and losses on sales of equity method investments combined
with lower equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, we had
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of
$69.0 million, compared to $210.0 million for 2001, a
decrease of $141.0 million or approximately 67.1%. The
$141.0 million decrease in equity earnings from
unconsolidated affiliates is due primarily to unfavorable
results at West Coast Power in 2002 as compared to the same
period in 2001. During 2002, West Coast Power had long-term
contracts that were less favorable than those held in 2001. In
addition during 2002, West Coast Power established reserves for
certain receivables not considered recoverable from California
PX. Our share of this reserve was approximately
$58.5 million on a pre-tax basis.

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
interest expense (which includes both corporate and project
level interest expense) was $487.2 million, compared to
$389.9 million in 2001, an increase of $97.3 million
or approximately 25.0%. This increase is due primarily to
increased corporate and project level debt. We issued
substantial amounts of long-term debt at both the corporate
level (recourse debt) and project level (non-recourse debt) to
either directly finance the acquisition of electric generating
facilities or refinance short-term bridge loans incurred to
finance such acquisitions.

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
minority interest in (earnings)/ losses of consolidated
subsidiaries was $20.3 million, compared to
$(0.8) million, a decrease of $21.1 million, as
compared to 2001. This decrease is primarily due to increased
earnings from COBEE for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Other income was a gain of $8.0 million, as
compared to $18.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001, a decrease of $10.8 million, or
approximately 57.4%. Other income consists primarily of interest
income on cash balances and realized and unrealized foreign
currency exchange gains and losses. Interest income was lower
during 2002 due to lower interest from affiliates, primarily
related to West Coast Power. In addition, there were significant
foreign currency exchange losses during 2002.

Write-Downs and Losses on Sales of Equity
    Method Investments

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
write-downs and losses on equity method investments were
$200.5 million. The $200.5 million charge consists
primarily of write-downs related to our investment in Loy Yang
in the total amount of $111.4 million. In addition, we
recorded a loss of $48.4 million upon the transfer of our
investment in SRW Cogeneration and recorded write-downs of
$14.2 million and $3.6 million of our investments in
EDL and Collinsville, respectively.



Income Tax

Income tax (benefit)/expense for the year ended
December 31, 2002 was a tax benefit of
($164.4) million as compared to a tax expense of
$39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2002
was primarily due to the increase in deferred tax assets
relating to impairments recognized for financial reporting
purposes. A valuation allowance was increased limiting the
recognition of deferred tax assets to the extent of previously
recorded deferred tax liabilities. The income tax expense for
the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily due to U.S.
and foreign operating earnings reduced by tax credits of
$37.2 million.

For 2002, income taxes were recorded on the basis
that Xcel Energy would not include us in its consolidated
federal income tax return following Xcel Energy’s
acquisition of our public shares on June 3, 2002. Since
Xcel Energy did not include us in its consolidated federal
income tax return, we and each of our U.S. subsidiaries
that is classified as a corporation for U.S. income tax
purposes must file separate federal income tax returns. It is
uncertain if, on a stand-alone basis, we will be able to fully
realize deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and
other temporary differences, consequently, a valuation allowance
of $1.3 billion was recorded as of December 31, 2002.

For 2001, our U.S. subsidiaries and we were
included in the Xcel Energy consolidated federal income tax
return through March 12, 2001, the date of our secondary
public offering. For the remainder of the year, we filed a
consolidated federal return with our U.S. subsidiaries.
Income tax expense was recorded on current and deferred tax
liabilities, partially offset by benefits from tax credits.

Discontinued Operations

As of December 31, 2002, we classified the
operations and gains/losses recognized on the sales of certain
entities as discontinued operations. Discontinued operations
consist of the historical operations and net gains/losses
related to our Crockett Cogeneration, Entrade, Killingholme,
Csepel, Bulo Bulo, McClain, NLGI, NEO Fort Smith LLC, NEO
Woodville LLC, NEO Phoenix LLC, TERI, Cahua and Energia
Pacasmayo that were sold in 2002 or were deemed to have met the
required criteria for such classification pending final
disposition. For 2002, the results of operations related to such
discontinued operations was a net loss of $500.8 million as
compared to a gain of $43.2 million for the same period in
2001. The primary reason for the loss recognized in 2002 is due
to asset impairments recorded at Killingholme, TERI and NLGI.

Reorganization and Emergence from
    Bankruptcy

On May 14, 2003, we and 25 of our
U.S. affiliates, filed voluntary petitions for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code, “the Bankruptcy Code” in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
New York, or the “bankruptcy court.”

On May 15, 2003, NRG Energy, PMI, NRG
Finance Company I LLC, NRGenerating Holdings (No. 23)
B.V. and NRG Capital LLC, collectively “the Plan
Debtors”, filed the NRG plan of reorganization and the
related Disclosure Statement for Reorganizing Debtors’
Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the
United States Bankruptcy Code, as subsequently amended,
“the Disclosure Statement.” The Bankruptcy Court held
a hearing on the Disclosure Statement on June 30, 2003, and
instructed the Plan Debtors to include certain additional
disclosures. The Plan Debtors amended the Disclosure Statement
and obtained Bankruptcy Court approval for the Third Amended
Disclosure Statement for Debtors’ Second Amended Joint Plan
of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code.

On November 24, 2003, the bankruptcy court
issued an order confirming the NRG plan of reorganization, and
the plan became effective on December 5, 2003. On
September 17, 2003, the Northeast/ South Central plan of
reorganization was proposed after we secured the necessary
financing commitments. On November 25, 2003, the bankruptcy
court issued an order confirming the Northeast/ South Central
plan of reorganization and the plan became effective on
December 23, 2003.



Financial Reporting by Entities in
    Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code and Fresh
    Start

Between May 14, 2003 and December 5,
2003, we operated as a debtor-in-possession under the
supervision of the bankruptcy court. Our financial statements
for reporting periods within that timeframe were prepared in
accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Position 90-7,

“Financial Reporting by Entities in
Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code”

, or “SOP
90-7.”

For financial reporting purposes, the close of
business on December 5, 2003, represents the date of
emergence from bankruptcy. As used herein, the following terms
refer to the Company and its operations:

The implementation of the NRG plan of
reorganization resulted in, among other things, a new capital
structure, the satisfaction or disposition of various types of
claims against the Predecessor Company, the assumption or
rejection of certain contracts, and the establishment of a new
board of directors.

In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy,
we adopted Fresh Start in accordance with the requirements of
SOP 90-7. The application of SOP 90-7 resulted in the
creation of a new reporting entity. Under Fresh Start, the
enterprise value of our company was allocated among our assets
and liabilities on a basis substantially consistent with
purchase accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141

“Business Combinations”

, or
“SFAS No. 141.” Accordingly, we pushed down
the effects of this allocation to all of our subsidiaries.

Under the requirements of Fresh Start, we have
adjusted our assets and liabilities, other than deferred income
taxes, to their estimated fair values as of December 5,
2003. As a result of marking our assets and liabilities to their
estimated fair values, we determined that there was no excess
reorganization value that was reallocated back to our tangible
and intangible assets. Deferred taxes were determined in
accordance with SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for
Income Taxes.”

The net effect of all Fresh Start
adjustments resulted in a gain of $3.9 billion, which is
reflected in the Predecessor Company’s results of
operations for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003. The application of the Fresh Start
provisions of SOP 90-7 created a new reporting entity
having no retained earnings or accumulated deficit.

As part of the bankruptcy process we engaged an
independent financial advisor to assist in the determination of
our reorganized enterprise value. The fair value calculation was
based on management’s forecast of expected cash flows from
our core assets. Management’s forecast incorporated forward
commodity market prices obtained from a third party consulting
firm. A discounted cash flow calculation was used to develop the
enterprise value of Reorganized NRG, determined in part by
calculating the weighted average cost of capital of the
Reorganized NRG. The Discounted Cash Flow, or “DCF”,
valuation methodology equates the value of an asset or business
to the present value of expected future economic benefits to be
generated by that asset or business. The DCF methodology is a
“forward looking” approach that discounts expected
future economic benefits by a theoretical or observed discount
rate. The independent financial advisors prepared a 30 year
cash flow forecast using a discount rate of approximately 11%.
The resulting reorganization enterprise value as included in the
Disclosure Statement ranged from $5.5 billion to
$5.7 billion. The independent financial advisor then
subtracted our project level debt and made several other
adjustments to reflect the values of assets held for sale,
excess cash and collateral requirements to estimate a range of
Reorganized NRG equity value of between $2.2 billion and
$2.6 billion.

In constructing our Fresh Start balance sheet
upon our emergence from bankruptcy we used a reorganization
equity value of approximately $2.4 billion, as we believe
this value to be the best indication of the value of the
ownership distributed to the new equity owners. Our NRG Plan of
reorganization provided for the issuance of 100,000,000 shares
of NRG common stock to the various creditors resulting in a
calculated price per share of $24.04. Our reorganization value
of approximately $9.1 billion was determined by adding our
reorganized equity value of $2.4 billion, $3.7 billion
of interest bearing debt and our other liabilities of



$3.0 billion. The reorganization value
represents the fair value of an entity before liabilities and
approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets
of the entity immediately after restructuring. This value is
consistent with the voting creditors and bankruptcy court’s
approval of the NRG plan of reorganization.

We recorded approximately $3.9 billion of
net reorganization income in the Predecessor Company’s
statement of operations for 2003, which includes the gain on the
restructuring of equity and the discharge of obligations subject
to compromise for less than recorded amounts, as well as
adjustments to the historical carrying values of our assets and
liabilities to fair market value.

Due to the adoption of Fresh Start as of
December 5, 2003, the Reorganized NRG post-Fresh Start
balance sheet, statement of operations and statement of cash
flows have not been prepared on a consistent basis with the
Predecessor Company’s financial statements and are
therefore not comparable in certain respects to the financial
statements prior to the application of Fresh Start. A black line
has been drawn on the accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements to separate and distinguish between Reorganized NRG
and the Predecessor Company. The effects of the reorganization
and Fresh Start on our balance sheet as of December 5,
2003, were as follows (in thousands):







APB No. 18,

“The Equity Method of
Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,”

requires
us to effectively push down the effects of Fresh Start reporting
to our unconsolidated equity method investments and to recognize
an adjustment to our share of the earnings or losses of an
investee as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary. As a
result of pushing down the impact of Fresh Start to our West
Coast Power affiliate, we determined that a contract based
intangible asset with a one year remaining life, consisting of
the value of West Coast Power’s California Department of
Water Resources energy sales contract, must be established and
recognized as a basis adjustment to our share of the future
earnings generated by West Coast



Power. This adjustment will reduce our equity
earnings in the amount of approximately $10.4 million per
month until the contract expires in December 2004.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Reorganized Capital Structure

In connection with the consummation of the NRG
plan of reorganization, on December 5, 2003 all shares of
our old common stock were canceled and 100,000,000 shares
of new common stock of NRG Energy were distributed pursuant to
such plan to the holders of certain classes of claims. A certain
number of shares of common stock was issued for distribution to
holders of disputed claims as such claims are resolved or
settled. In the event our disputed claims reserve is inadequate,
it is possible we would have to issue additional shares of our
common stock to satisfy such pre-petition claims or contribute
additional cash proceeds. See Item 3 — Legal
Proceedings — Disputed Claims Reserve. Our authorized
capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of NRG Energy
common stock and 10,000,000 shares of Serial Preferred
Stock. Further, a total of 4,000,000 shares of our common
stock, representing approximately 4% of our outstanding common
stock, are available for issuance under our long-term incentive
plan.

In addition to our issuance of new common stock,
on December 23, 2003, we completed a note offering
consisting of $1.25 billion of 8% Second Priority Senior
Secured Notes due 2013, or the “Second Priority
Notes”, and we entered into a new credit facility
consisting of a $950.0 million term loan facility, a
$250.0 million funded letter of credit facility and a
$250.0 million revolving credit facility. In January of
2004, we completed a supplementary note offering whereby we
issued an additional $475.0 million of the Second Priority
Notes at a premium and used the proceeds to repay a portion of
the $950.0 million term loan. As of March 1, 2004, we
had $1.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of Second
Priority Notes outstanding, $446.5 million principal amount
outstanding under the term loan and $147.5 million remains
available under the funded letter of credit facility. As of
March 1, 2004, we had not drawn down on our revolving
credit facility. Finally, in connection with the consummation of
the NRG plan of reorganization, we issued to Xcel Energy a
$10.0 million non-amortizing promissory note, which will
accrue interest at a rate of 3% per annum and mature
2.5 years after the effective date of the NRG plan of
reorganization.

As part of the NRG plan of reorganization, we
eliminated approximately $5.2 billion of corporate level
bank and bond debt and approximately $1.3 billion of
additional claims and disputes through our distribution of new
common stock and $1.04 billion in cash among our unsecured
creditors. In addition to the debt reduction associated with the
restructuring, we used the proceeds of the recent note offering
and borrowings under the New Credit Facility to retire
approximately $1.7 billion of project-level debt.

For additional information on our short term and
long term borrowing arrangements, see Item 15 —
Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Historical Cash Flows

Predecessor Company

Historically, we have obtained cash from
operations, issuance of debt and equity securities, borrowings
under credit facilities, capital contributions from Xcel Energy,
reimbursement by Xcel Energy of tax benefits pursuant to a tax
sharing agreement and proceeds from non-recourse project
financings. We used these funds to finance operations, service
debt obligations, fund the acquisition, development and
construction of generation facilities, finance capital
expenditures and meet other cash and liquidity needs.



Reorganized NRG

We have obtained cash from operations, Xcel
Energy’s contribution net of distributions to creditors,
proceeds from the sale of certain assets and borrowings under
our Second Priority Notes and New Credit Facility.

Net Cash Provided (Used) By Operating
    Activities

Predecessor Company

Net cash provided by operating activities
increased during 2002 compared with 2001, primarily due to our
efforts to conserve cash by deferring the payment of interest
and managing our cash flows more closely. As a result, we
increased accounts payable and accrued interest balances and
reduced inventory levels.

For the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 net cash provided by operating
activities was $238.5 million. Operating activities
consisted of a net loss before Fresh Start adjustments of
$1.1 billion, offset by non-cash charges of
$567.5 million and cash provided by working capital of
$800.1 million. The non-cash charges consisted primarily of
the write-down of our investment in Loy Yang, asset impairments
and legal settlement charges. The favorable change in working
capital was primarily due to reduced cash expenditures
throughout the bankruptcy period resulting in increased accounts
payable.

Reorganized NRG

For the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 cash used by operating activities was
$588.9 million. This was primarily a result of payments
made to creditors upon our emergence from bankruptcy.

Net Cash Provided (Used) By Investing
    Activities

Predecessor Company

Net cash used in investing activities decreased
in 2002, compared with 2001, primarily as a result of the
termination of our acquisition program due to our financial
difficulties and the receipt of cash upon the sale of assets
during 2002.

For the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 cash used in investing activities
$185.7 million. This was primarily a result of capital
expenditures and an increase in restricted cash, offset by cash
proceeds received upon the sale of investments.

Reorganized NRG

For the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 cash provided by investing activities was
$363.4 million. In connection with the refinancing
transaction, approximately $375.3 million of restricted
cash was released upon payment of the Northeast Generating and
South Central Generating note. This increase was offset by funds
used for capital expenditures and investments in projects.



Net Cash Provided (Used) By Financing
    Activities

Predecessor Company

Net cash provided by financing activities
decreased during 2002 compared to 2001 due to constraints on our
ability to access the capital markets and the cancellation and
termination of construction projects reducing the need for
capital.

For the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 cash used by financing activities was
$29.9 million, which consisted primarily of principal
payments offset by the issuance of additional debt.

Reorganized NRG

For the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 cash provided by financing activities was
$393.3 million. We entered into refinancing transactions on
December 23, 2003, where we issued $1.25 billion of
Second Priority Notes and entered into the New Credit Facility,
which consisted of a $950.0 million senior secured term
loan facility and a $250.0 million funded letter of credit
facility. Upon completion of the refinancing transactions, we
repaid the Northeast Generating and South Central Generating
notes and the Mid-Atlantic Generating obligations.

Sources of Funds

The principal sources of liquidity for our future
operations, capital expenditures, facility closures and project
restructurings are expected to be: (i) existing cash on
hand and cash flows from operations, (ii) Xcel
Energy’s contribution net of distributions to creditors,
(iii) proceeds from the sale of certain assets and
businesses and (iv) borrowings under our New Credit
Facility, including up to $250.0 million of available
borrowings under our new revolving credit facility and up to
$250.0 million of a pre-funded letter of credit facility.
Additionally, there are approximately $89.5 million of
undrawn letters of credit under the pre-petition ANZ LC
Facility. The ANZ LC Facility is supported by a cash funded
claim reserve to support any letters of credit drawn prior to
their expiration. Capacity under the ANZ LC facility will be
reduced as the underlying LCs expire or are terminated. All of
the LCs will expire or be terminated by the end of 2004, at
which time the ANZ LC facility will no longer exist.

As a result of our emergence from bankruptcy, all
of our then existing securities, including our old common stock
and various issuances of senior notes, were cancelled and
approximately $5.2 billion of our existing debt and
approximately $1.3 billion of additional claims and
disputes were eliminated for a combination of equity and up to
$1.04 billion in cash.

On December 23, 2003, we entered into a bank
facility for up to $1.45 billion, or the “New Credit
Facility”, which included a $950.0 million, six and a
half-year senior secured term loan, a $250.0 million funded
letter of credit facility, and a four-year $250.0 million
revolving line of credit, or the “revolving credit
facility.” Portions of the revolving credit facility are
available as a swing-line facility and as a revolving letter of
credit sub-facility. As of December 31, 2003, the corporate
revolver was undrawn. Also on December 23, 2003, we issued
$1.25 billion in 8% second priority, senior secured notes,
or the “Second Priority Notes”, due and payable on
December 15, 2013.

Upon completion of the refinancing transactions,
we, among other things: (i) repaid the Northeast Generating
LLC Notes, or “Northeast Notes”, the South Central
Generating LLC Notes, or “South Central Notes”, and
the Mid-Atlantic Generating LLC Obligations; (ii) paid a
settlement amount associated with the repayment of the Northeast
Notes and the South Central Notes; (iii) paid
$500.0 million in lieu of 10% NRG Energy senior notes to
former unsecured creditors pursuant to the NRG plan of
reorganization, the “POR Notes”, (see the discussion
of Senior Securities under Item 15 — Note 17
to the Consolidated Financial Statements) ; (iv) pre-funded
a letter of credit sub-facility under the New Credit Facility in
the amount of $250.0 million; and (v) paid fees and
expenses related to the offering of notes and the New Credit
Facility in the amount of $74.8 million.



On January 28, 2004, we issued an additional
$475.0 million of the Second Priority Notes, obtaining net
proceeds of $501.8 million. With proceeds from this
issuance and other funds, we subsequently 1) repaid
$503.5 million of the term loan under the New Credit
Facility, reducing the principal outstanding from
$950.0 million to $446.5 million, 2) made a
prepayment premium payment of $15.1 million, and
3) repaid accrued but unpaid interest on the prepayment
amount, totaling $0.4 million. On February 25, 2004,
we received from our term loan lenders a waiver under the New
Credit Facility waiving our obligation to enter into a hedge
arrangement on a notional value of $500.0 million, as
required by the credit agreement.

Cash Flows.

Our
operating cash flows are expected to be impacted by, among other
things: (i) spark spreads generally; (ii) commodity
prices (including demand for natural gas, coal, oil and
electricity); (iii) the cost of ordinary course operations
and maintenance expenses; (iv) planned and unplanned
outages; (v) contraction of terms by trade creditors;
(vi) cash requirements for closure and restructuring of
certain facilities; (vii) restrictions in the declaration or
payments of dividends or similar distributions from our
subsidiaries; and (viii) the timing and nature of asset
sales.

A principal component of the NRG plan of
reorganization is a settlement with Xcel Energy in which Xcel
Energy agreed to make a contribution to us consisting of cash
(and, under certain circumstances, its common stock) in an
aggregate amount of up to $640.0 million to be paid in
three separate installments. Xcel Energy contributed
$288.0 million on February 20, 2004. We anticipate
receiving an additional installment of up to $352.0 million
in cash on April 30, 2004. We will distribute
$515.0 million of cash we receive from Xcel Energy to our
creditors. In the event we achieve certain liquidity measures in
September 2004, an additional $25.0 million may be
distributed to creditors, and we may use $100.0 million for
any purpose, subject to any restrictions contained in the
indenture or the New Credit Facility.

Asset Sales.

We
received $229.3 million and $196.2 million in net cash
proceeds from the sale of certain assets and businesses in the
fiscal years ended 2002 and 2003, respectively. The New Credit
Facility and the indenture governing the notes place
restrictions on the use of any proceeds we may receive from
certain asset sales in the future.

Letter of Credit Sub-facility and Revolving
Credit Facility.

The New Credit
Facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility in the amount
of $250.0 million. As of December 31, 2003, we had
issued $1.7 million in letters of credit under this
facility. The New Credit Facility also includes a revolving
credit facility in the amount of $250.0 million to be used
for general corporate purposes. On December 31, 2003 we had
not yet drawn on our revolving credit facility. For additional
information regarding our debt see Item 15 —
Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Uses of Funds

Our requirements for liquidity and capital
resources, other than for operating our facilities, can
generally be categorized by the following: (i) PMI
activities; (ii) capital expenditures; and
(iii) project finance requirements for cash collateral.

PMI.

PMI activities
comprise the single largest requirement for liquidity and
capital resources. PMI liquidity requirements are primarily
driven by: (i) margin and collateral posting requirements
with counterparties; (ii) establishment of trading
relationships; (iii) disbursement and receipt timing (i.e.,
buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); and
(iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions.
For 2004, we believe that approximately $265 million to
$360 million may be required for PMI to meet potential
margin requirements and to cover prepayments and fuel inventory
builds.

Estimates for liquidity requirements are highly
dependent on our hedging activity and then current market
conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and
market volatility. In addition, our estimates are dependent on
credit terms with third parties. We do not assume that we will
be provided with unsecured credit from third parties in
budgeting our working capital requirements.

Capital
Expenditures.

Capital expenditures
were $1.4 billion for the year ended 2002,
$113.5 million for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 and $10.6 million for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Capital
expenditures in 2003 relate primarily to operations and
maintenance of



our existing generating facilities whereas
capital expenditures in 2002 related primarily to new plant
construction. We anticipate that our 2004 capital expenditures
will be approximately $113.8 million and will relate
primarily to the operation and maintenance of our existing
generating facilities.

Project Finance
Requirements.

We are a holding company
and conduct our operations through subsidiaries. Historically,
we have utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion
of the capital expenditures and investments required to
construct our power plants and related assets. Consistent with
our strategy, we may seek, where available on commercially
reasonable terms, non-recourse debt financing in connection with
the assets or businesses that our affiliates or we may develop,
construct or acquire. Non-recourse borrowings are substantially
non-recourse to other subsidiaries, affiliates and us, and are
generally secured by the capital stock, physical assets,
contracts and cash flow of the related project subsidiary or
affiliate. Some of these project financings require us to post
collateral in the form of cash or an acceptable letter of credit.

Principal on short-term debt, long-term debt and
capital leases as of December 31, 2003 are due and payable
in the following periods (in thousands):



Principal payments for debt that have been deemed
current for financial reporting purposes as of December 31,
2003 are reflected as short-term in the table above. Events may
have occurred since December 31, 2003 that would allow such
debt to be paid on a normal amortizing schedule. Prepayments, or
additional borrowing under certain facilities, since
December 31, 2003 are not reflected. See
Item 15 — Note 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion on events that may
affect debt payment schedules.

If we decide not to provide any additional
funding or credit support to our subsidiaries, the inability of
any of our subsidiaries that are under construction or that have
near-term debt payment obligations to obtain non-recourse
project financing may result in such subsidiary’s
insolvency and the loss of our investment in such subsidiary.
Additionally, the loss of a significant customer at any of our
subsidiaries may result in the need to restructure the
non-recourse project financing at that subsidiary, and the
inability to successfully complete a restructuring of the
non-recourse project financing may result in a loss of our
investment in such subsidiary. Certain of our projects are
subject to restrictions regarding the movement of cash. For
additional information see Item 15 — Note 17
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity Estimates

For 2004, we anticipate utilizing all of our
$250.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. In addition,
we believe that approximately $265.0 million to
$360.0 million of cash may be required for PMI to meet its
potential margin requirements and to cover prepayments and fuel
inventory builds. As part of our refinancing transactions, we
have established a $250.0 million revolving credit
facility. The revolving credit facility was established to
satisfy short-term working capital requirements, which may arise
from time to time. It is not our current intention to draw funds
under the revolving credit facility.

Other Liquidity Matters

We maintain cash deposits in order to assure the
continuation of vendor trade terms. As of December 31,
2003, the total amount of cash deposits maintained for these
purposes was approximately $48.3 million.

We expect our capital requirements to be met with
existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, borrowings
under our Second Priority Notes and New Credit Facility, and
asset sales. We believe that our current level of cash
availability and asset sales, along with our future anticipated
cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet the
existing operational and collateral needs of our business for
the next 12 months. Subject to restrictions in our Second
Priority Notes and our New Credit Facility, if cash generated
from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity
requirements, we may seek to sell assets, obtain additional
credit facilities or other financings and/or issue additional
equity or convertible instruments. We cannot assure you,
however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow
from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and
operating improvements will be realized on schedule or that
future borrowings will be available to us under our credit
facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our
indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need
to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before
maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance
any of our indebtedness, on commercially reasonable terms or at
all. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant
amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many
factors beyond our control.



Off Balance-Sheet Items

As of December 31, 2003, we do not have any
significant relationships with structured finance or special
purpose entities that provide liquidity, financing or
incremental market risk or credit risk.

We have numerous investments with an ownership
interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy related
entities that are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting as disclosed in Item 15 — Note 13
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our pro-rata share of
non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was
approximately $967.7 million as of December 31, 2003.
In the normal course of business we may be asked to loan funds
to these entities on both a long and short-term basis. Such
transactions are generally accounted for as accounts payables
and receivables to/from affiliates and notes
payables/receivables to/from affiliates and if appropriate, bear
market-based interest rates. See Item 15 —
Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding amounts accounted for as notes
receivable — affiliates.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial
Commitments

We have a variety of contractual obligations and
other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash
requirements in addition to our capital expenditure programs.
The following is a summarized table of contractual obligations.
See additional discussion in Item 15 —
Notes 17, 24 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

*

These amounts represent creditor payments under
    NRG’s plan of reorganization. Additionally, payments of up
    to $275 million will be required pursuant to security
    interests held in certain assets by creditors when the related
    assets are sold.

Interdependent Relationships

We do not have any significant interdependent
relationships. Since we formerly were an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Xcel Energy, there were certain related party
transactions that took place in the normal



course of business. For additional information
regarding our related party transactions, see
Item 15 — Note 22 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Derivative Instruments

We may enter into long term power sales
contracts, long term gas purchase contracts and other energy
related commodities financial instruments to mitigate
variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market
prices, hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities and
protect fuel inventories.

The tables below disclose the trading activities
that include non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair
value. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and

We may use a variety of financial instruments to

our cost of borrowing and energy and energy related commodities
prices.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements and
related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted
accounting principles, or “GAAP”, requires the
application of appropriate technical accounting rules and
guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily
involves judgments regarding future events, including the
likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and
regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves,
could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures
based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use.
In addition, the financial and operating environment also may
have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the
business, but on the results reported through the application of
accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements
and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting
policies have not changed.

On an ongoing basis, we, evaluate our estimates,
utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and
other methods we consider reasonable. In any case, actual
results may differ significantly from our estimates. Any effects
on our business, financial position or results of operations
resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the
period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become
known.

Our significant accounting policies are
summarized in Item 15 — Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table
identifies certain of the significant accounting policies listed
in Item 15 — Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The table also identifies the judgments
required, uncertainties involved in the application of each and
estimates that may have a material impact on our results of
operations and statement of financial position.These policies,
along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our
management in their application, have a significant impact on
our consolidated financial statements. We identify our most
critical accounting policies as those that are the most
pervasive and important to the portrayal of our financial
position and results of operations, and that require the most
difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management
regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.





Of all of the accounting policies identified in
the above table, we believe that the following policies and the
application thereof to be those having the most direct impact on
our financial position and results of operations.

Fresh Start Reporting

In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy,
we adopted Fresh Start in accordance with the requirements of
SOP 90-7. The application of SOP 90-7 resulted in the
creation of a new reporting entity. Under Fresh Start, the
reorganization value of our company was allocated among our
assets and liabilities on a basis substantially consistent with
purchase accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141

“Business Combinations.”

The bankruptcy court in its confirmation order
approved our Plan of reorganization on November 24, 2003.
Under the requirements of SOP 90-7, the Fresh Start date is
determined to be the confirmation date unless significant
uncertainties exist regarding the effectiveness of the
bankruptcy order. Our Plan of reorganization required completion
of the Xcel Energy settlement agreement prior to emergence from
bankruptcy. We believe this settlement agreement was a
significant contingency and thus delayed the Fresh Start date
until the Xcel Energy settlement agreement was finalized on
December 5, 2003.

Under the requirements of Fresh Start, we have
adjusted our assets and liabilities, other than deferred income
taxes, to their estimated fair values as of December 5,
2003. As a result of marking our assets and liabilities to their
estimated fair values, we determined that there was no excess
reorganization value to recognize as an intangible asset.
Deferred taxes were determined in accordance with
SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income
Taxes.”

The net effect of all Fresh Start adjustments
resulted in a gain of $3.9 billion, which is reflected in
the Predecessor Company’s results for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. The
application of the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90-7
created a new reporting entity having no retained earnings or
accumulated deficit.

As part of the bankruptcy process we engaged an
independent financial advisor to assist in the determination of
the fair value of our reorganized enterprise value. The fair
value calculation was based on management’s forecast of our
core assets. Management’s forecast relied on forward market
prices obtained from a third party consulting firm. A discounted
cash flow calculation was used to develop the enterprise value
of Reorganized NRG, determined in part by calculating the
weighted average cost of capital of the Reorganized NRG. The
Discounted Cash Flow, or “DCF”, valuation methodology
equates the value of an asset or business to the present value
of expected future economic benefits to be generated by that
asset or business. The DCF methodology is a “forward
looking” approach that discounts all expected future
economic benefits by a theoretical or observed discount rate
determined by calculating the weighted average cost of capital,
or “WACC”, of Reorganized NRG. The enterprise
calculation was based on management’s forecast of our core
assets. Management’s forecast relied on forward market
prices obtained from a third party consulting firm. For purposes
of our Disclosure statement, the independent financial advisor
estimated our reorganization enterprise value of our ongoing
projects to range from $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion,
less project level debt, and net of cash. Certain other
adjustments were made to reflect the values of assets held for
sale, excess cash and net of the Xcel Settlement and collateral
requirements. These adjustments resulted in a reorganized NRG
value, net of project debt, of between $3.1 billion and
$3.5 billion. Additional adjustments were made to reflect
cash payments expected as part of the implementation of the Plan
of Reorganization, resulting in a final range of equity values
of between $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion.

In constructing our Fresh Start balance sheet
upon our emergence from bankruptcy we used a reorganization
equity value of approximately $2.4 billion, as we believe
this value to be the best indication of the value of the
ownership distributed to the new equity owners. Our
reorganization value of approximately $9.1 billion was
determined by adding our reorganized equity value of
$2.4 billion, $3.7 billion of interest bearing debt
and our other liabilities of $3.0 billion. The
reorganization value represents the fair value of an entity
before liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer
would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after
restructuring. This value is consistent with the voting
creditors and Court’s approval of the Plan of
Reorganization.



A separate plan of reorganization was filed for
our Northeast Generating and South Central Generating entities
that was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on November 25,
2003, and became effective on December 23, 2003, when the
final conditions of the plan were completed. In connection with
Fresh Start on December 5, 2003, we have accounted for
these entities as if they had emerged from bankruptcy at the
same time that we emerged as we believe that we continued to
maintain control over the Northeast Generating and South Central
Generating facilities through-out the bankruptcy process.

Due to the adoption of Fresh Start upon our
emergence from bankruptcy, the Reorganized NRG’s post-fresh
start balance sheet, statement of operations and statement of
cash flows have not been prepared on a consistent basis with the
Predecessor Company’s financial statements and are
therefore not comparable in certain respects to the financial
statements prior to the application of Fresh Start.

Capitalization Practices and Purchase
    Accounting

Predecessor Company

For those assets that were being constructed by
us, the carrying value reflects the application of our property,
plant and equipment policies which incorporate estimates,
assumptions and judgments by management relative to the
capitalized costs and useful lives of our generating facilities.
Interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance projects expected
to require more than three months to complete is capitalized.
Capitalization of interest is discontinued when the asset under
construction is ready for our intended use or when construction
is terminated. An insignificant amount of interest was
capitalized during 2003. Development costs and capitalized
project costs include third party professional services, permits
and other costs that are incurred incidental to a particular
project. Such costs are expensed as incurred until an
acquisition agreement or letter of intent is signed, and our
board of directors has approved the project. Additional costs
incurred after this point are capitalized.

Reorganized NRG

In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy,
we adopted Fresh Start in accordance with the requirements of
SOP 90-7. The application of SOP 90-7 resulted in the
creation of a new reporting entity. Under Fresh Start, the
reorganization value of our company was allocated to our assets
and liabilities on a basis substantially consistent with
purchase accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141.
We engaged a valuation specialist to help us determine the fair
value of our fixed assets. The valuations were based on forecast
power prices and operating costs determined by us. The valuation
specialist also determined the estimated remaining useful lives
of our fixed assets. The capitalization policy will be
consistent with the predecessor company policy.

Impairment of Long Lived
    Assets

We evaluate property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of
impairment exist. Recoverability of assets to be held and used
is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets
to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset, through considering project specific assumptions for
long-term power pool prices, escalated future project operating
costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the
probability weighting of different courses of action available
to us. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation
techniques such as the present value of expected future cash
flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. For the
period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, net
income from continuing operations was reduced by
$228.9 million due to asset impairments. Asset impairment
evaluations are by nature highly subjective.

Revenue Recognition and Uncollectible
    Receivables

We are primarily an electric generation company,
operating a portfolio of majority-owned electric generating
plants and certain plants in which our ownership is 50% or less
which are accounted for under the



equity method of accounting. We also produce
thermal energy for sale to customers. Both physical and
financial transactions are entered into to optimize the
financial performance of our generating facilities. Electric
energy revenue is recognized upon transmission to the customer.
In certain markets, which are operated/ controlled by an
independent system operator and in which we have entered into a
netting agreement with the ISO, which results in our receiving a
netted invoice, we have recorded purchased energy as an offset
against revenues received upon the sale of such energy. Capacity
and ancillary revenue is recognized when contractually earned.
Revenues from operations and maintenance services are recognized
when the services are performed. We continually assess the
collectibility of our receivables, and in the event we believe a
receivable to be uncollectible, an allowance for doubtful
accounts is recorded or, in the event of a contractual dispute,
the receivable and corresponding revenue may be considered
unlikely of recovery and not recorded in the financial
statements until management is satisfied that it will be
collected.

Derivative Financial
    Instruments

In January 2001, we adopted
FAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,”

or
“SFAS No. 133”, as amended by SFAS No.
137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149.
SFAS No. 133 requires us to record all derivatives on
the balance sheet at fair value. In some cases hedge accounting
may apply. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting
treatment is appropriate are a) the designation of the
hedge to an underlying exposure, b) whether or not the
overall risk is being reduced and c) if there is
correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and
the underlying obligation. Formal documentation of the hedging
relationship, the nature of the underlying risk, the risk
management objective, and the means by which effectiveness will
be assessed is created at the inception of the hedge. Changes in
the fair value of non-hedge derivatives are immediately
recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an
offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged
assets, liabilities and firm commitments or for forecasted
transactions, deferred and recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income or “OCI”, until
the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings. We
primarily account for derivatives under SFAS No. 133
such as long-term power sales contracts, long-term gas purchase
contracts and other energy related commodities and financial
instruments used to mitigate variability in earnings due to
fluctuations in spot market prices, hedge fuel requirements at
generation facilities and to protect investments in fuel
inventories. SFAS No. 133 also applies to interest rate
swaps and foreign currency exchange rate contracts. The
application of SFAS No. 133 results in increased
volatility in earnings due to the recognition of unrealized
gains and losses. In determining the fair value of these
derivative/financial instruments we use estimates, various
assumptions, judgment of management and when considered
appropriate third party experts in determining the fair value of
these derivatives.

Discontinued Operations

We classify our results of operations that either
have been disposed of or are classified as held for sale as
discontinued operations if both of the following conditions are
met: (a) the operations and cash flows have been (or will
be) eliminated from our ongoing operations as a result of the
disposal transaction and (b) we will not have any
significant continuing involvement in the operations of the
component after the disposal transaction.

Pensions

The determination of our obligation and expenses
for pension benefits is dependent on the selection of certain
assumptions. These assumptions determined by management include
the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets
and the rate of future compensation increases. Our actuarial
consultants use assumptions for such items as retirement age.
The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results,
which may result in a significant impact to the amount of
pension obligation or expense recorded by us.



Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS Statement
No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,”

or “SFAS No. 123.”
In accordance with SFAS Statement No. 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure,”

or
“SFAS No. 148”, we adopted
SFAS No. 123 under the prospective transition method
which requires the application of the recognition provisions to
all employee awards granted, modified, or settled after the
beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions
are first applied.

Recent Accounting
    Developments

As part of the provisions of SOP 90-7, we
are required to adopt, for the current reporting period, all
accounting guidance that is effective within a twelve-month
period. As a result, we have adopted all provisions of FASB
Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities.”

Item 7A —

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk

Historically we have used a variety of financial
instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates on our international project cash flows,
interest rates on our cost of borrowing and energy and energy
related commodities prices.

Currency Exchange Risk

We expect to continue to be subject to currency
risks associated with foreign denominated distributions from our
international investments. In the normal course of business, we
may receive distributions denominated in the Euro, Australian
Dollar, British Pound, New Taiwanese Dollar and the Brazilian
Real. We have historically engaged in a strategy of hedging
foreign denominated cash flows through a program of matching
currency inflows and outflows, and to the extent required,
fixing the U.S. Dollar equivalent of net foreign
denominated distributions with currency forward and swap
agreements with highly credit worthy financial institutions. We
would expect to enter into similar transactions in the future if
management believes it to be appropriate.

As of December 31, 2003, neither we, nor any
of our consolidating subsidiaries, had any outstanding foreign
currency exchange contracts.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates
when entering into variable rate debt obligations to fund
certain power projects. Exposure to interest rate fluctuations
may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known
as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options.
These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and
result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into
account the combination of the variable rate debt and the
interest rate derivative instrument. Our risk management policy
allows us to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate
debt obligations.

As of December 31, 2003, we had various
interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling
approximately $620.5 million. If the swaps had been
discontinued on December 31, 2003, we would have owed the
counter parties approximately $50.1 million. Based on the
investment grade rating of the counter-parties, we believe that
our exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by the
counter-parties to our hedging contracts is insignificant.

We have both long and short-term debt instruments
that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in
market interest rates. As of December 31, 2003, a
100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on our
variable rate debt would impact net income by approximately
$14.5 million.

At December 31, 2003, the fair value of our
fixed-rate debt was $1.8 billion, compared with the
carrying amount of $1.8 billion. We estimate that a 1%
decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair
value of our fixed-rate debt to $1.9 billion, or an
increase of $119.2 million.



Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to commodity price variability in
electricity. Commodity price risk also impacts emission
allowances, natural gas, oil and coal, which are required to
generate power. To manage earnings volatility associated with
these commodity price risks, we enter into financial
instruments, which may take the form of fixed price, floating
price or indexed sales or purchases, and options, such as puts,
calls, basis transactions and swaps.

We utilize an un-diversified
“Value-at-Risk”, or “VAR”, model to estimate
a maximum potential loss in the fair value of our commodity
portfolio including generation assets, load obligations and
bilateral physical and financial transactions. The key
assumptions for our VAR model include (1) a lognormal
distribution of price returns (2) three day holding period
and (3) a 95% confidence interval. The volatility estimate
is based on the implied volatility for at the money call
options. This model encompasses the following generating
regions: ENTERGY, NEPOOL, NYPP, PJM, WSCC and MAIN.

The estimated maximum potential three-day loss in
fair value of our commodity portfolio, calculated using the VAR
model is as follows:

We have risk management policies in place to
measure and limit market and credit risk associated with our
power marketing activities. These policies do not permit
speculative or directional trading. An independent department
within our finance organization is responsible for the
enforcement of such policies. We are currently in the process of
reviewing and revising these policies to reflect changes in best
practices and industry.

Credit Risk

We are exposed to credit risk in our risk
management activities. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss
resulting from the nonperformance by a counter party of its
contractual obligations. We actively manage our counter-party
credit risk. We have an established credit policy in place to
minimize overall credit risk. Important elements of this policy
include ongoing financial reviews of all counter-parties,
established credit limits, as well as monitoring, managing and
mitigating credit exposure.

Item 9A —

Controls and Procedures

During the fourth quarter of 2003, under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, we
conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) or
Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the fiscal year
covered by this Form 10-K. Based on their evaluation, our
officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective.

Our officers are primarily responsible for the
accuracy of the financial information that is represented in
this report. To meet their responsibility for financial
reporting, they have established internal controls and
procedures, which they believe, are adequate to provide
reasonable assurance that our assets are protected from loss.
There have been no significant changes (including corrective
actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses) in our internal controls or in other factors that
could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date
of the evaluation referenced above. We recently hired a new
Chief Financial Officer, Robert Flexon, effective March 2004.

During the fourth quarter of 2002, our officers
determined that there were certain deficiencies or
“reportable conditions” in the internal controls
relating to our financial reporting caused by our pending
financial restructuring and business realignment. During the
second half of 2002, there were material changes and vacancies
in our senior management positions and a diversion of our
financial and management resources to restructuring efforts.
These circumstances detracted from our ability through our
internal controls to timely monitor and accurately assess the
impact of certain transactions, as would be expected in an
effective financial reporting control environment. In addition,
during 2003, we operated without an internal audit department, a
senior risk manager or a CFO. However, during 2003, we dedicated
significant resources to make corrections to those control
deficiencies, including hiring several other key senior and
middle management personnel, hiring an outside consultant to
review, document and suggest improvements to controls, and the
implementation of new controls and procedures.

Note 1 — Organization

General

We are a wholesale power generation company,
primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of power
generation facilities and the sale of energy, capacity and
related products in the United States and internationally. We
have a diverse portfolio of electric generation facilities in
terms of geography, fuel type, and dispatch levels. We seek to
maximize operating income through the efficient procurement and
management of fuel supplies and maintenance services, and the
sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services into attractive
spot, intermediate and long-term markets.

We were formed in 1992 as the non-regulated
subsidiary of Northern States Power, or “NSP”, which
was itself merged into New Century Energies, Inc. to form
Xcel Energy, Inc., or “Xcel Energy” in 2000.
While owned by NSP and later by Xcel Energy, we consistently
pursued an aggressive high growth strategy focused on power
plant acquisitions, high leverage and aggressive development,
including site development and turbine orders. In 2002, a number
of factors most notably the aggressive prices paid by us for our
acquisitions of turbines, development projects and plants,
combined with the overall downturn in the power generation
industry, triggered a credit rating downgrade (below investment
grade), which in turn, precipitated a severe liquidity
situation. On May 14, 2003, we and 25 of our direct and
indirect wholly owned subsidiaries commenced voluntary petitions
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
New York. On November 24, 2003, the bankruptcy court
entered an order confirming our plan of reorganization and the
plan became effective on December 5, 2003.

As part of the plan of reorganization, Xcel
Energy relinquished its ownership interest and we became an
independent public company upon our emergence from bankruptcy on
December 5, 2003. We no longer have any material
affiliation or relationship with Xcel Energy. As part of that
reorganization, we eliminated approximately $5.2 billion of
corporate level bank and bond debt and approximately
$1.3 billion of additional claims and disputes by
distributing a combination of equity and up to
$1.04 billion in cash among our unsecured creditors. In
addition to the debt reduction associated with the
restructuring, we used a substantial portion of the proceeds of
a recent note offering and borrowings under a new credit
facility, the “Refinancing Transactions,” to retire
approximately $1.7 billion of project-level debt on
December 23, 2003. In January 2004, we used proceeds of an
additional note offering to repay $503.5 million of the
outstanding borrowings under our New Credit facility.

As of December 31, 2003, we owned interests
in 72 power projects in seven countries having an aggregate
generation capacity of approximately 18,200 MW.
Approximately 7,900 MW of our capacity consists of merchant
power plants in the Northeast region of the United States.
Certain of these assets are located in transmission constrained
areas, including approximately 1,400 MW of
“in-city” New York City generation capacity and
approximately 700 MW of southwest Connecticut generation
capacity. We also own approximately 2,500 MW of capacity in
the South Central region of the United States, with
approximately 1,700 MW of that capacity supported by
long-term power purchase agreements. Our assets in the West
Coast region of the United States consist of approximately
1,300 MW of capacity with the majority of such capacity
owned via our 50% interest in West Coast Power, LLC, or
“West Coast Power.” Our assets in the West Coast
region are supported by a power purchase agreement with the
California Department of Water Resources that runs through
December 2004. Our principal domestic generation assets
consisted of a diversified mix of natural gas-, coal- and
oil-fired facilities, representing approximately 48%, 26% and
26% of our total domestic generation capacity, respectively. We
also own interests in plants having a generation capacity of
approximately 3,000 MW in various international markets,
including Australia, Europe and Latin America. Our energy
marketing subsidiary, NRG Power Marketing, Inc., or
“PMI” began operations in 1998 and is focused on
maximizing the value of our North American assets by providing
centralized contract origination and management services, and
through the efficient procurement and management of fuel and the
sale of energy and related products in the spot, intermediate
and long-term markets.

The Bankruptcy Case

On May 14, 2003, we and 25 of our direct and
indirect wholly owned subsidiaries commenced voluntary petitions
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
New York, or “the bankruptcy court.” During the
bankruptcy proceedings, we continued to conduct our business and
manage our properties as debtors in possession pursuant to
sections 1107(a) and 1108 of the bankruptcy code. Our
subsidiaries that own our international operations, and certain
other subsidiaries, were not part of these chapter 11 cases
or any of the subsequent bankruptcy filings. On
November 24, 2003, the bankruptcy court entered an order
confirming the NRG plan of reorganization, and the plan became
effective on December 5, 2003.

Events Leading to the Commencement of the
    Chapter 11 Filing

Since the 1990’s, we pursued a strategy of
growth through acquisitions and later the development of new
construction projects. This strategy required significant
capital, much of which was satisfied primarily with third party
debt. Due to a number of reasons, particularly our aggressive
pricing of acquisitions and the overall down-turn in the power
generation industry, our financial condition deteriorated
significantly starting in 2001. During 2002, our senior
unsecured debt and our project-level secured debt were
downgraded multiple times by rating agencies. In September 2002,
we failed to make payments due under certain unsecured bond
obligations, which resulted in further downgrades.

As a result of the downgrades, the debt load
incurred during the course of acquiring assets, declining power
prices, increasing fuel prices, the overall down-turn in the
power generation industry and the overall down-turn in the
economy, we experienced severe financial difficulties. These
difficulties caused us to, among other things, miss scheduled
principal and interest payments due to our corporate lenders and
bondholders, be required to prepay for fuel and other related
delivery and transportation services and be required to provide
performance collateral in certain instances. We also recorded
asset impairment charges of approximately $3.1 billion
during 2002, while we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xcel
Energy, related to various operating projects as well as for
projects that were under construction which we had stopped
funding and turbines we had purchased for which we no longer had
a use.

In addition, our missed payments resulted in
cross-defaults of numerous other non-recourse and limited
recourse debt instruments and caused the acceleration of
multiple debt instruments, rendering such debt immediately due
and payable. In addition, as a result of the downgrades, we
received demands under outstanding letters of credit to post
collateral aggregating approximately $1.2 billion.

In August 2002, we retained financial and legal
restructuring advisors to assist our management in the
preparation of a comprehensive financial and operational
restructuring. In March 2003, Xcel Energy announced that its
board of directors had approved a tentative settlement agreement
with us, the holders of most of our long-term notes and the
steering committee representing our bank lenders.

We filed two plans of reorganization in
connection with our restructuring efforts. The first, filed on
May 14, 2003, and referred to as the NRG plan of
reorganization, relates to us and the other NRG plan debtors.
The second plan, relating to our Northeast and South Central
subsidiaries, which we refer to as the Northeast/ South Central
plan of reorganization, was filed on September 17, 2003. On
November 25, 2003,



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming
the Northeast/South Central plan of reorganization and the plan
became effective on December 23, 2003.

On June 6, 2003, LSP-Nelson Energy LLC and
NRG Nelson Turbines LLC filed for protection under
chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code and on August 19,
2003, NRG McClain LLC filed for protection under chapter 11
of the bankruptcy code. This annual report does not address the
plans of reorganization of these subsidiaries because they are
not material to our operations and we expect to sell or
otherwise dispose of our interest in each subsidiary subsequent
to our reorganization.

The following description of the material terms
of the NRG plan of reorganization and the Northeast/ South
Central plan of reorganization is subject to, and qualified in
its entirety by, reference to the detailed provisions of the NRG
plan of reorganization and NRG disclosure statement, and the
Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization and Northeast/
South Central disclosure statement, all of which are available
for review upon request.

NRG Plan of Reorganization

The NRG plan of reorganization is the result of
several months of intense negotiations among us, Xcel Energy and
the two principal committees representing our creditor groups,
which we refer to as the Global Steering Committee and the
Noteholder Committee. A principal component of the NRG plan of
reorganization is a settlement with Xcel Energy in which Xcel
Energy agreed to make a contribution consisting of cash (and,
under certain circumstances, its stock) in the aggregate amount
of up to $640 million to be paid in three separate
installments following the effective date of the NRG plan of
reorganization. The Xcel Energy settlement agreement resolves
any and all claims existing between Xcel Energy and us and/or
our creditors and, in exchange for the Xcel Energy contribution,
Xcel Energy is receiving a complete release of claims from us
and our creditors, except for a limited number of creditors who
have preserved their claims as set forth in the confirmation
order entered on November 24, 2003.

Under the terms of the Xcel Energy settlement
agreement, the Xcel Energy contribution will be or has been paid
as follows:

•

An initial installment of $238 million in
    cash was paid on February 20, 2004.

•

A second installment of $50 million in cash
    was paid on February 20, 2004.

•

A third installment of $352 million in cash,
    which Xcel Energy is required to pay on April 30, 2004.

On November 24, 2003, the bankruptcy court
issued an order confirming the NRG plan of reorganization, and
the plan became effective on December 5, 2003. To
consummate the NRG plan of reorganization, we have or will,
among other things:

•

Satisfy general unsecured claims by:

•

issuing new NRG Energy common stock to holders of
    certain classes of allowed general unsecured claims; and

•

making cash payments in the amount of up to
    $1.04 billion to holders of certain classes of allowed
    general unsecured claims of which $500 million was paid in
    December 2003, with proceeds of the Refinancing Transactions;

•

Satisfy certain secured claims by either:

•

distributing the collateral to the security
    holder,

•

selling the collateral and distributing the
    proceeds to the security holder or

•

other mutually agreeable treatment; and



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Issue to Xcel Energy a $10 million
    non-amortizing promissory note which will:

•

accrue interest at a rate of 3% per
    annum, and

•

mature 2.5 years after the effective date of
    the NRG plan of reorganization.

Northeast/ South Central Plan of
    Reorganization

The Northeast/ South Central plan of
reorganization was proposed on September 17, 2003 after we
secured the necessary financing commitments. On
November 25, 2003, the bankruptcy court issued an order
confirming the Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization
and the plan became effective on December 23, 2003. In
connection with the order confirming the Northeast/ South
Central plan of reorganization, the court entered a separate
order which provides that the allowed amount of the
bondholders’ claims shall equal in the aggregate the sum of
(i) $1.3 billion plus (ii) any accrued and unpaid
interest at the applicable contract rates through the date of
payment to the indenture trustee plus (iii) the reasonable
fees, costs or expenses of the collateral agent and indenture
trustee (other than reasonable professional fees incurred from
October 1, 2003) plus (iv) $19.6 million,
ratably, for each holder of bonds based upon the current
outstanding principal amount of the bonds and irrespective of
(a) the date of maturity of the bonds, (b) the
interest rate applicable to such bonds and (c) the issuer
of the bonds. The settlement further provides that the
Northeast/ South Central debtors shall reimburse the informal
committee of secured bondholders, the indenture trustee, the
collateral agent, and two additional bondholder groups, for any
reasonable professional fees, costs or expenses incurred from
October 1, 2003 through January 31, 2004 up to a
maximum amount of $2.5 million (including in such amount
any post-October 1, 2003 fees already reimbursed), with the
exception that the parties to the settlement reserved their
respective rights with respect to any additional reasonable
fees, costs or expenses incurred subsequent to November 25,
2003 related to matters not reasonably contemplated by the
implementation of the settlement of the Northeast/ South Central
plan of reorganization.

The creditors of Northeast and South Central
subsidiaries are unimpaired by the Northeast/ South Central plan
of reorganization. This means that holders of allowed general
unsecured claims were paid in cash, in full on the effective
date of the Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization.
Holders of allowed secured claims will receive or have received
either (i) cash equal to the unpaid portion of their
allowed unsecured claim, (ii) treatment that leaves
unaltered the legal, equitable and contractual rights to which
such unsecured claim entitles the holder of such claim,
(iii) treatment that otherwise renders such unsecured claim
unimpaired pursuant to section 1124 of the bankruptcy code
or (iv) such other, less favorable treatment that is
confirmed in writing as being acceptable to such holder and to
the applicable debtor.

Note 2 — Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of
    Presentation

Between May 14, 2003 and December 5,
2003, we operated as a debtor-in-possession under the
supervision of the bankruptcy Court. Our financial statements
for reporting periods within that timeframe were prepared in
accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Position 90-7,

“Financial Reporting by Entities in
Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code.”

For financial reporting purposes, close of
business on December 5, 2003, represents the date of our
emergence from bankruptcy. As used herein, the following terms
refer to the Company and its operations:



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46,

“Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities,”

or “FIN No. 46.” FIN
No. 46 requires an enterprise’s consolidated financial
statements to include subsidiaries in which the enterprise has a
controlling interest. Historically, that requirement has been
applied to subsidiaries in which an enterprise has a majority
voting interest, but in many circumstances the enterprise’s
consolidated financial statements do not include the
consolidation of variable interest entities with which it has
similar relationships but no majority voting interest. Under FIN
No. 46, the voting interest approach is not the approach
used to identify the controlling financial interest. The new
rule requires that for entities to be consolidated that those
assets be initially recorded at their carrying amounts at the
date the requirements of the new rule first apply. If
determining carrying amounts as required is impractical, then
the assets are to be measured at fair value the first date the
new rule applies. Any difference between the net amounts of any
previously recognized interest in the newly consolidated entity
should be recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting
change. In December 2003, the FASB has published a revision to
Interpretation 46, or “FIN 46R”, to clarify
some of the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,”

and to exempt certain entities from its requirements. As
required by SOP 90-7, we have adopted FIN No. 46R as
of the adoption of Fresh Start. In connection with the adoption
of FIN No. 46R, we have recorded total assets of
$54.4 million and total liabilities of $47.5 million
as of December 6, 2003 that were previously recorded
through equity method investments. The nature of the operations
consolidated consisted of hydro power facilities on the East
Coast.

The consolidated financial statements include our
accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which
we have a controlling interest. We account for the operations of
LSP-Nelson Energy LLC and NRG Nelson Turbines LLC under the cost
method as they are currently in bankruptcy. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation. Accounting policies for all of our operations are
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. As discussed in Note 13, we
have investments in partnerships, joint ventures and projects.
Earnings from equity in international investments are recorded
net of foreign income taxes.

Fresh Start Reporting

In accordance with Statement of
Position 90-7,

“Financial Reporting by Entities in
Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code,”

certain
companies qualify for fresh start reporting in connection with
their emergence from bankruptcy. Fresh start reporting is
appropriate on the emergence from chapter 11 if the
reorganization value of the assets of the emerging entity
immediately before the date of confirmation is less than the
total of all post-petition liabilities and allowed claims, and
if the holders of existing voting shares immediately before
confirmation receive less than 50 percent of the voting
shares of the emerging entity. We met these requirements and
adopted Fresh Start reporting resulting in the creation of a new
reporting entity designated as Reorganized NRG.

The bankruptcy court issued a confirmation order
approving our Plan of reorganization on November 24, 2003.
Under the requirements of SOP 90-7, the Fresh Start date is
determined to be the confirmation date unless significant
uncertainties exist regarding the effectiveness of the
bankruptcy order. Our Plan of reorganization required completion
of the Xcel Energy settlement agreement prior to emergence from
bankruptcy. The Xcel Energy settlement agreement was entered
into on December 5, 2003. We believe this settlement
agreement was a significant contingency and thus delayed the
Fresh Start date until the Xcel Energy settlement agreement was
finalized on December 5, 2003.

Under the requirements of Fresh Start, we have
adjusted our assets and liabilities, other than deferred income
taxes, to their estimated fair values as of December 5,
2003. As a result of marking our assets and liabilities to their
estimated fair values, we determined that there was a negative
reorganization value that was reallocated back to our tangible
and intangible assets. Deferred taxes were determined in
accordance with SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for
Income Taxes.”

The net effect of all Fresh Start
adjustments resulted in a



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

gain of $3.9 billion, which is reflected in
the Predecessor Company’s results for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. The
application of the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90-7
created a new reporting entity having no retained earnings or
accumulated deficit.

As part of the bankruptcy process we engaged an
independent financial advisor to assist in the determination of
our reorganized enterprise value. The fair value calculation was
based on management’s forecast of expected cash flows from
our core assets. Management’s forecast incorporated forward
commodity market prices obtained from a third party consulting
firm. A discounted cash flow calculation was used to develop the
enterprise value of Reorganized NRG, determined in part by
calculating the weighted average cost of capital of the
Reorganized NRG. The Discounted Cash Flow, or “DCF”,
valuation methodology equates the value of an asset or business
to the present value of expected future economic benefits to be
generated by that asset or business. The DCF methodology is a
“forward looking” approach that discounts expected
future economic benefits by a theoretical or observed discount
rate. The independent financial advisor prepared a 30 year
cash flow forecast using a discount rate of approximately 11%.
The resulting reorganization enterprise value as included in the
Disclosure Statement ranged from $5.5 billion to
$5.7 billion. The independent financial advisor then
subtracted our project level debt and made several other
adjustments to reflect the values of assets held for sale,
excess cash and collateral requirements to estimate a range of
Reorganized NRG equity value of between $2.2 billion and
$2.6 billion.

In constructing our Fresh Start balance sheet
upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we used a reorganization
equity value of approximately $2.4 billion, as we believe
this value to be the best indication of the value of the
ownership distributed to the new equity owners. Our NRG Plan of
reorganization provided for the issuance of 100,000,000 shares
of NRG common stock to the various creditors resulting in a
calculated price per share of $24.04. Our reorganization value
of approximately $9.1 billion was determined by adding our
reorganized equity value of $2.4 billion, $3.7 billion
of interest bearing debt and our other liabilities of
$3.0 billion. The reorganization value represents the fair
value of an entity before liabilities and approximates the
amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the entity
immediately after restructuring. This value is consistent with
the voting creditors and Court’s approval of the Plan of
Reorganization.

Our Fresh Start adjustments consist primarily of
the valuation of our existing fixed assets and liabilities,
equity investments and recognition of the value of certain power
sales contracts that were deemed to be significantly valuable or
burdensome as either intangible assets or liabilities which will
be amortized into income over the respective terms of each
contract. A description of the adjustments and amounts is
provided in Note 3 — Emergence from Bankruptcy
and Fresh Start Reporting.

A separate plan of reorganization was filed for
our Northeast Generating and South Central Generating entities
that was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on November 25,
2003, and became effective on December 23, 2003, when the
final conditions of the plan were completed. In connection with
Fresh Start on December 5, 2003, we continued to
consolidate our Northeast Generating and South Central
Generating entities as we believe that we continued to maintain
control over the Northeast Generating and South Central
Generating facilities through out the bankruptcy process. As
previously stated, the Northeast Generating and South Central
Generating entities emerged from bankruptcy on December 23,
2003. However, since the creditors received full recovery, the
liabilities are not recorded as subject to compromise in the
December 6, 2003 balance sheet.

Due to the adoption of the Fresh Start upon our
emergence from bankruptcy, the Reorganized NRG balance sheet,
statement of operations and statement of cash flows have not
been prepared on a consistent basis with the Predecessor
Company’s financial statements and are therefore not
comparable to the financial statements prior to the application
of Fresh Start.

Nature of Operations

We are a wholesale power generation company,
primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of power
generation facilities and the sale of energy, capacity and
related products in the United States and



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

internationally. We have a diverse portfolio of
electric generation facilities in terms of geography, fuel type,
and dispatch levels, which help us mitigate risk. We seek to
maximize operating income through the efficient procurement and
management of fuel supplies and maintenance services, and the
sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services into attractive
spot, intermediate and long-term markets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid
investments (primarily commercial paper) with an original
maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists primarily of funds held
to satisfy the requirements of certain debt agreements and funds
held within our projects that are restricted in their use.

Inventory

Inventory is valued at the lower of weighted
average cost or market and consists principally of fuel oil,
spare parts, coal, kerosene, emission allowance credits and raw
materials used to generate steam.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost
however impairment adjustments are recorded whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate carrying values may not be
recoverable. On December 5, 2003, we recorded adjustments
to the property, plant and equipment to reflect such items at
fair value in accordance with Fresh Start reporting. A new cost
basis was established with these adjustments. Significant
additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized,
while repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the
life of the respective asset are charged to expense as incurred.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
following estimated useful lives:

Facilities and equipment

10-60  years

Office furnishings and equipment

3-15 years

The assets and related accumulated depreciation
amounts are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with
the resulting gain or loss included in operations.

Asset Impairments

Long-lived assets that are held and used are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable.
Such reviews are performed in accordance with
SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Asset.”

An impairment loss is
recognized if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows
expected from an asset are less than its carrying value. An
impairment charge is measured by the difference between an
asset’s carrying amount and fair value. Fair values are
determined by a variety of valuation methods, including
appraisals, sales prices of similar assets and present value
techniques.

Investments accounted for by the equity method
are reviewed for impairment in accordance with APB Opinion
No. 18,

“The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock.”

APB Opinion No. 18
requires that a loss in value of an investment that is other
than a temporary decline should be recognized. We identify and
measure losses in value of equity investments based upon a
comparison of fair value to carrying value.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Discontinued Operations

Long-lived assets are classified as discontinued
operations when all of the required criteria specified in
SFAS No. 144 are met. These criteria include, among
others, existence of a qualified plan to dispose of an asset, an
assessment that completion of a sale within one year is probable
and approval of the appropriate level of management and board of
directors. Discontinued operations are reported at the lower of
the asset’s carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Capitalized Interest

Interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance
projects expected to require more than three months to complete
is capitalized. Capitalization of interest is discontinued when
the asset under construction is ready for its intended use or
when a project is terminated or construction ceased. Capitalized
interest was approximately $27.2 million,
$64.8 million, $15.9 thousand and $1.5 thousand in
2001, 2002, 2003 Predecessor Company and 2003 Reorganized NRG,
respectively.

Capitalized Project Costs

Development costs and capitalized project costs
include third party professional services, permits, and other
costs that are incurred incidental to a particular project. Such
costs are expensed as incurred until an acquisition agreement or
letter of intent is signed, and our Board of Directors has
approved the project. Additional costs incurred after this point
are capitalized. When a project begins operation, previously
capitalized project costs are reclassified to equity investments
in affiliates or property, plant and equipment and amortized on
a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the
project’s related assets or revenue contract period.
Capitalized costs are charged to expense if a project is
abandoned or management otherwise determines the costs to be
unrecoverable.

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized
as interest expense on a basis, which approximates the effective
interest method over the terms of the related debt.

Goodwill and Intangible
    Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase
price of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in business
combinations over their estimated fair value. Effective
January 1, 2002, we implemented SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

or
“SFAS No. 142.” Pursuant to
SFAS No. 142, goodwill is not amortized but is subject
to periodic impairment testing. Prior to 2002, goodwill was
amortized on a straight line basis over 20 to 30 years.

Intangible assets represent contractual rights
held by us. Intangible assets are amortized over their economic
useful life and reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis.
Non-amortized intangible assets, including goodwill, are tested
for impairment annually and on an interim basis if an event or
circumstance occurs between annual tests that might reduce the
fair value of that asset.

Income Taxes

The Predecessor Company’s income tax
provision for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 has been recorded on the basis that
separate federal income tax returns will be filed. The
Reorganized NRG’s income tax provision for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 has been
recorded on the basis that we and our U.S. subsidiaries
will reconsolidate for federal income tax purposes as of
December 6, 2003. The income tax provision for the year
ended December 31, 2002 has been recorded on the



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

basis that we and our U.S. subsidiaries have
filed a consolidated federal income tax return for the period
January 1, 2002 through June 3, 2002 and filed
separate federal income tax returns for the remainder of 2002.

The Predecessor Company’s income taxes have
been recorded on the basis that Xcel Energy has not included us
in its consolidated federal income tax return following Xcel
Energy’s acquisition of our public shares on June 3,
2002. Since we and our U.S. subsidiaries will not be included in
the Xcel Energy consolidated tax group, each of our
U.S. subsidiaries that is classified as a corporation for
U.S. income tax purposes must file a separate federal
income tax return for the periods ended December 31, 2002
and December 5, 2003.

The Reorganized NRG is no longer owned by Xcel
Energy and thus, no longer included in the Xcel Energy
affiliated group. The change in ownership allows us to file a
consolidated federal income tax return with our U.S.
subsidiaries starting on December 6, 2003.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences in future years of temporary differences between
the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial
reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted tax laws and
statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. Income tax
expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during
the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. A valuation
allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount more likely than not to be realized.

Revenue Recognition

We are primarily an electric generation company,
operating a portfolio of majority-owned electric generating
plants and certain plants in which our ownership interest is 50%
or less and which are accounted for under the equity method. In
connection with our electric generation business, we also
produce thermal energy for sale to customers, principally
through steam and chilled water facilities. We also collect
methane gas from landfill sites, which are used for the
generation of electricity. In addition, we sell small amounts of
natural gas and oil to third parties.

Electrical energy revenue is recognized upon
delivery to the customer. In certain markets, which are
operated/controlled by an independent system operator and in
which we have entered into a netting agreement with the ISO,
which results in our receiving a netted invoice, we have
recorded purchased energy as an offset against revenues received
upon the sale of such energy. Capacity and ancillary revenue is
recognized when contractually earned. Disputed revenues are not
recorded in the financial statements until disputes are resolved
and collection is assured.

Revenue from long-term power sales contracts that
provide for higher pricing in the early years of the contract
are recognized in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 91-6,

“Revenue Recognition of Long Term
Power Sales Contracts.”

This results in revenue
deferrals and recognition on a levelized basis over the term of
the contract.

We provide contract operations and maintenance
services to some of our non-consolidated affiliates. Revenue is
recognized as contract services are performed.

We recognize other income for interest income on
loans to our non-consolidated affiliates, as the interest is
earned and realizable.

Foreign Currency Translation and
    Transaction Gains and Losses

The local currencies are generally the functional
currency of our foreign operations. Foreign currency denominated
assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates of
exchange. Revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at
weighted-average rates of exchange for the period. The resulting
currency translation adjustments are accumulated and reported as
a separate component of stockholders’ equity and are

not included in the determination of the results
of operations. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are
reported in results of operations. We recognized foreign
currency transaction gains (losses) of $1.8 million,
$(10.4) million, $(19.8) million and $0.4 million
in 2001, 2002, 2003 Predecessor Company and 2003 Reorganized
NRG, respectively.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, which potentially subject
us to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash,
accounts receivable, notes receivable and investments in debt
securities. Cash accounts are generally held in Federally
insured banks. Accounts receivable, notes receivable and
derivative instruments are concentrated within entities engaged
in the energy industry. These industry concentrations may impact
our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or
negatively, in that the customers may be similarly affected by
changes in economic, industry or other conditions. Receivables
are generally not collateralized; however, we believe the credit
risk posed by industry concentration is offset by the
diversification and creditworthiness of our customer base.

Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents,
receivables, accounts payables, and accrued liabilities
approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments. The carrying amounts of long-term receivables
approximate fair value, as the effective rates for these
instruments are comparable to market rates at year end,
including current portions. The fair value of long-term debt is
estimated based on quoted market prices for those instruments
which are traded or on a present value method using current
interest rates for similar instruments with equivalent credit
quality.

Pensions

The determination of our obligation and expenses
for pension benefits is dependent on the selection of certain
assumptions. These assumptions determined by management include
the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets
and the rate of future compensation increases. Our actuarial
consultants use assumptions for such items as retirement age.
The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results,
which may result in a significant impact to the amount of
pension obligation or expense recorded by us.

Stock Based Compensation

During the fourth quarter of 2003, in accordance
with SFAS Statement No. 148,

“Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosure”

we adopted SFAS No. 123 under the
prospective transition method which requires the application of
the recognition provisions to all employee awards granted,
modified, or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in
which the recognition provisions are first applied. As a result,
we applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123 as of January 1, 2003. As discussed
in Note 18, we recognized compensation expense for the
grants issued under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is calculated based on
the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the
period. Net income per share, assuming dilution is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and
common equivalent shares outstanding. Our only common equivalent
shares are those that result from dilutive common stock options
and restricted stock.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from these estimates.

In recording transactions and balances resulting
from business operations, we use estimates based on the best
information available. Estimates are used for such items as
plant depreciable lives, tax provisions, un-collectible
accounts, actuarially determined benefit costs and the valuation
of long-term energy commodities contracts, among others. In
addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets for
impairment and to determine fair value of impaired assets. As
better information becomes available (or actual amounts are
determinable), the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently,
operating results can be affected by revisions to prior
accounting estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified
for comparative purposes. These reclassifications had no effect
on our net income or total stockholders’ equity as
previously reported.

Recent Accounting
    Developments

As part of the provisions of SOP 90-7, we
are required to adopt, for the current reporting period, all
accounting guidance that is effective within a twelve-month
period. As a result, we have adopted all provisions of FASB
Interpretation No. 46R,

“Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities”

.

Note 3 — Emergence from
Bankruptcy and Fresh Start Reporting

In accordance with the requirements of
SOP 90-7, we determined the reorganization value of NRG and
subsidiaries emerging from bankruptcy to be approximately
$9.1 billion. Reorganization value generally approximates
fair value of the entity before considering liabilities and
approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets
of the entity immediately after the restructuring. Several
methods are used to determine the reorganization value; however,
generally it is determined by discounting future cash flows for
the reconstituted business that will emerge from chapter 11
bankruptcy. Our approach was consistent in that our independent
financial advisor’s estimated reorganization enterprise
value of our ongoing projects using a discounted cash flow
approach.

We allocated the reorganization value of
$9.1 billion to our assets in conformity with the
procedures specified by SFAS No. 141. We used a third party
to complete an independent appraisal of our tangible assets,
equity investments and intangible assets and contracts. In
completing the fair value allocation our assets were calculated
to be greater than the reorganization value. As a result, we
reallocated the negative reorganization value to our tangible
and intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 141. In
preparing our balance sheet we also recorded each liability
existing at the plan confirmation date, other than deferred
taxes, at the present value of amounts to be paid determined at
appropriate current interest rates. Deferred taxes were reported
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
under SFAS No. 109. Our equity was recorded at
approximately $2.4 billion representing a price per share
of $24.04 for the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of common stock
with bankruptcy emergence. We pushed down the effects of fresh
start reporting to all of our subsidiaries.

In constructing our Fresh Start balance sheet
using our reorganization value upon our emergence from
bankruptcy we used a reorganization equity value of
approximately $2.4 billion, as we believe this value to be
the best indication of the value of the ownership distributed to
the new equity owners. Accordingly, our



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reorganization value of $9.1 billion was
determined by adding our reorganized equity value of
$2.4 billion, $3.7 billion of interest bearing debt
and our other liabilities of $3.0 billion. This value is
consistent with the voting creditors and Court’s approval
of the Plan of Reorganization.

The determination of the enterprise value and the
allocations to the underlying assets and liabilities were based
on a number of estimates and assumptions, which are inherently
subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies.

We recorded approximately $3.9 billion of
net reorganization income in the Predecessor Company’s
statement of operations for 2003, which includes the gain on the
restructuring of debt and equity and the discharge of
obligations subject to compromise for less than recorded
amounts, as well as adjustments to the historical carrying
values of our assets and liabilities to fair market value.

Due to the adoption of Fresh Start as of
December 5, 2003, the Reorganized NRG balance sheet,
statement of operations and statement of cash flows have not
been prepared on a consistent basis with the Predecessor
Company’s financial statements and are not comparable in
certain respects to the financial statements prior to the
application of Fresh Start. A black line has been drawn on the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements to separate and
distinguish between Reorganized NRG and the Predecessor Company.
The effects of the reorganization and Fresh Start on our balance
sheet as of December 5, 2003, were as follows (in
thousands):

As required by SOP 90-7, we have adopted
    FASB Interpretation No. 46

“Consolidation of
    Variable Interest Entities,”

or
    “FIN 46,” as of the adoption of Fresh Start. The
    adoption of FIN 46 resulted in the consolidation of
    Northbrook New York, LLC and Northbrook Energy, LLC.

APB No. 18,

“The Equity Method of
Accounting for Investments in Common Stock”,

requires
us to effectively push down the effects of Fresh Start reporting
to our unconsolidated equity method investments and to recognize
an adjustment to our share of the earnings or losses of an
investee as if the investee was a consolidated subsidiary. As a
result of pushing down the impact of Fresh Start to our West
Coast Power affiliate we determined that a contract based
intangible asset with a one year remaining life, consisting of
the value of West Coast Power’s California Department of
Water Resources energy sales contract, must be established and
recognized as a basis adjustment to our share of the future
earnings generated by West Coast Power. This adjustment will
reduce our equity earnings in the amount of approximately
$10.4 million per month during 2004 until the contract
expires in December 2004.

Financial Instruments

The estimated December 31 fair values of our
recorded financial instruments are as follows:

For cash and cash equivalents and restricted
cash, the carrying amount approximates fair value because of the
short-term maturity of those instruments. The fair value of
notes receivable is based on expected future cash flows
discounted at market interest rates. The fair value of long-term
debt is estimated based on quoted market prices for those
instruments which are traded or on a present value method using
current interest rates for similar instruments with equivalent
credit quality.

Debtors’ Statements

As stated above, we and certain of our
subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under
chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code during 2003. On
December 5, 2003, we and five of our subsidiaries emerged

the Debtors’ financial records were closed for the
Prepetition Period. As required by SOP 90-7

Note 6 — Discontinued
Operations

SFAS No. 144 requires that discontinued
operations be valued on an asset-by-asset basis at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. In applying
those provisions our management considered cash flow analyses,
bids and offers related to those assets and businesses. This
amount is included in (loss)/income on discontinued operations,
net of income taxes in the accompanying Statement of Operations.
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144,
assets held for sale will not be depreciated commencing with
their classification as such.

We have classified certain business operations,
and gains/losses recognized on sale, as discontinued operations
for projects that were sold or have met the required criteria
for such classification.

The financial results for all of these businesses
have been accounted for as discontinued operations. Accordingly,
current period operating results and prior periods have been
restated to report the operations as discontinued.

Summarized results of operations of the
discontinued operations were as follows. For the years ended
December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, discontinued
results of operations included our Crockett Cogeneration, Bulo
Bulo, Csepel, Entrade, Killingholme, NEO Landfill
Gas, Inc., or “NLGI”, McClain, Timber Energy
Resources, Inc., or “TERI”, three NEO Corporation
projects (NEO Fort Smith LLC, NEO Woodville LLC, NEO
Phoenix LLC), Cahua and Energia Pacasmayo projects. For the
period from January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003,
discontinued results of operations include our Killingholme,
McClain, NLGI, NEO Corporation projects, TERI, Cahua and Energia
Pacasmayo projects. For the period December 6, 2003 to
December 31, 2003, discontinued results of operations
include our McClain project.

Operating and other expenses for 2001 and 2002
shown in the table above included asset impairment charges of $0
and approximately $502.0 million, respectively. The 2002
charges are comprised of approximately $477.9 million for
the Killingholme project. $12.4 million for the NEO
Landfill Gas, Inc. project and $11.7 million for the
TERI project. Operating and other expenses for 2003 include
asset impairment charges

Bulo
Bulo

— In June 2002, we
began negotiations to sell our 60% interest in Compania
Electrica Central Bulo Bulo S.A. (Bulo Bulo), a Bolivian
corporation. The transaction reached financial close in the
fourth quarter of 2002 resulting in cash proceeds of
$10.9 million (net of cash transferred of
$8.6 million) and a loss of $10.6 million.

Crockett Cogeneration
Project

— In September 2002,
we announced that we had reached an agreement to sell our 57.7%
interest in the Crockett Cogeneration Project, a 240 MW
natural gas fueled cogeneration plant near San Francisco,
California, to Energy Investment Fund Group, an existing LP, and
a unit of GE Capital. In November 2002, the sale closed and we
realized net cash proceeds of approximately $52.1 million
(net of cash transferred of $0.2 million) and a loss on
disposal of approximately $11.5 million.

Csepel and
Entrade

— In September 2002,
we announced that we had reached agreements to sell our Csepel
power generating facilities (located in Budapest, Hungary) and
our interest in Entrade (an electricity trading business
headquartered in Prague) to Atel, an independent energy group
headquartered in Switzerland. The sales of Csepel and Entrade
closed before year-end and resulted in cash proceeds of
$92.6 million (net of cash transferred of
$44.1 million) and a gain of approximately
$24.0 million. We accounted for the results of operations
of Csepel and Entrade as part of our power generation segment
within Europe.

Killingholme

—
During third quarter 2002, we recorded an impairment charge of
$477.9 million. In January 2003, we completed the sale of
our interest in the Killingholme project to our lenders for a
nominal value and forgiveness of outstanding debt with a
carrying value of approximately $360.1 million at



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

December 31, 2002. The sale of our interest
in the Killingholme project and the release of debt obligations
resulted in a gain on sale in the first quarter of 2003 of
approximately $191.2 million. The gain results from the
write-down of the project’s assets in the third quarter of
2002 below the carrying value of the related debt.

NLGI

—
During 2002, we recorded an impairment charge of
$12.4 million related to subsidiaries of NLGI, an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Energy. The charge was related
largely to asset impairments based on a revised project outlook.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2003, we recorded
impairment charges of $23.6 million related to subsidiaries
of NLGI and a charge of $14.5 million to write off our 50%
investment in Minnesota Methane, LLC. Through April 30,
2003, NRG Energy and NLGI failed to make certain payments
causing a default under NLGI’s term loan agreements. In May
2003, the project lenders to the wholly-owned subsidiaries of
NLGI and Minnesota Methane LLC foreclosed on our membership
interest in the NLGI subsidiaries and our equity interest in
Minnesota Methane LLC. There was no material gain or loss
recognized as a result of the foreclosure.

TERI

—
During 2002, we recorded an impairment charge of
$11.7 million based on a revised project outlook. In
September 2003, we completed the sale of TERI, a biomass
waste-fuel power plant located in Florida and a wood processing
facility located in Georgia, to DG Telogia Power, LLC. The sale
resulted in net proceeds of approximately $1.0 million. We
entered into an agreement to sell the wood processing facility
on behalf of DG Telogia Power, LLC. This sale was completed
during fourth quarter 2003 and we received cash consideration of
approximately $1.0 million, resulting in an net gain on
sale of approximately $1.0 million.

Peru
Projects

— In November 2003,
we completed the sale of the Cahua and Pacasmayo (Peruvian
Assets) resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately
$16.2 million and a loss of $36.9 million. In
addition, we expect to receive an additional consideration
adjustment of approximately $2 million during 2004.

NEO
Corporation

— In August of
1995, we entered into a Marketing, Development and Joint
Proposing Agreement, or “the Marketing Agreement”,
with Cambrian Energy Development LLC, or “Cambrian.”
Various claims had arisen in connection with this Marketing
Agreement. In November 2003, we entered into a Settlement
Agreement with Cambrian where we agreed to transfer our 100%
interest in three gasco projects (NEO Ft. Smith, NEO
Phoenix and NEO Woodville).

McClain

—
We reviewed the recoverability of our McClain assets pursuant to
SFAS No. 144 and recorded a charge of $100.7 million
in the second quarter of 2003. On August 14, 2003,
NRG’s Board of Directors approved a plan to sell its 77%
interest in McClain Generating Station, a 520 MW
combined-cycle, natural gas-fired facility located in New
Castle, Oklahoma. On August 18, 2003, we entered into an
Asset Purchase Agreement with Oklahoma Gas & Electric
Company pursuant to which we would, subject to the satisfaction
of certain conditions, sell all of the McClain assets in a sale
pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Codes as part of
McClain’s Chapter 11 proceeding that was subsequently
filed on August 19, 2003. In accordance with
Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the
Asset Purchase Agreement, we continued to seek alternative
transactions that would provide greater value to us and our
creditors than the transaction contemplated by the Asset
Purchase Agreement.

As a result of the formalization of the plan to
sell the McClain assets and the filing of petition under the
Bankruptcy Code by McClain, McClain is being accounted for as a
discontinued operation.

As part of our effort to seek alternative
transactions that would provide greater value and in accordance
with the bidding procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court, we
conducted an auction for the sale of McClain’s assets,
however no bids were submitted for the purchase of the assets.
The Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the terms of the
sale with Oklahoma Gas & Electric free and clear of all
liens. The closing of the sale is subject to various closing
conditions including approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. Upon consummation of the asset sale, we anticipate
that all proceeds from the sale will be used to repay
outstanding project debt under the secured term loan and working
capital facility.

Write Downs of Equity Method
Investments

NEO Corporation — Minnesota
Methane —

We recorded an
impairment charge of $12.3 million during 2002 to
write-down our 50% investment in Minnesota Methane. We recorded
an additional impairment charge of $14.5 million during the
first quarter of 2003. These charges were related to a revised
project outlook and management’s belief that the decline in
fair value was other than temporary. In May 2003, the project
lenders to the wholly-owned subsidiaries of NEO Landfill
Gas, Inc. and Minnesota Methane LLC foreclosed on our
membership interest in the NEO Landfill Gas, Inc.
subsidiaries and our equity interest in Minnesota Methane LLC.
Upon completion of the foreclosure, we recorded a gain of
$2.2 million. This gain resulted from the release of
certain obligations.

NEO Corporation — MM
Biogas —

We recorded an
impairment charge of $3.2 million during 2002 to write-down
our 50% investment in MM Biogas. This charge was related to
revised project outlook and management’s belief that the
decline in fair value was other than temporary. In November
2003, we entered into a sales agreement with Cambrian Energy
Development to sell our 50% interest in MM Biogas. We recorded
an additional impairment charge of $2.6 million during the
fourth quarter of 2003 due to developments related to the sale
that indicated an impairment of our book value that was
considered to be other than temporary.

Kondapalli

—
In the fourth quarter of 2002, we wrote down our investment in
Kondapalli by $12.7 million due to recent estimates of
sales value, which indicated an impairment of our book value
that was considered to be other than temporary. On
January 30, 2003, we signed a sale agreement with the
Genting Group of Malaysia, or “Genting”, to sell our
30% interest in Lanco Kondapalli Power Pvt Ltd, or
“Kondapalli”, and a 74% interest in Eastern Generation
Services (India) Pvt Ltd (the O&M company). Kondapalli is
based in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India, and is the owner
of a 368 MW natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine.
In the first quarter of 2003, we wrote down our investment in
Kondapalli by $1.3 million based on the final sale
agreement. The sale closed on May 30, 2003 resulting in net
cash proceeds of approximately $24 million and a gain of
approximately $1.8 million. The gain resulted from
incurring lower selling costs than estimated as part of the
first quarter impairment.

ECKG

— In
September 2002, we announced that we had reached agreement to
sell our 44.5% interest in the ECKG power station in connection
with our Csepel power generating facilities, and our interest in
Entrade, an electricity trading business, to Atel, an
independent energy group headquartered in Switzerland. The
transaction closed in January 2003 and resulted in cash proceeds
of $65.3 million and a net loss of less than
$1.0 million. In accordance with the purchase agreement, we
were to receive additional consideration if Atel purchased
shares held by our partner. During the second quarter of 2003,
we received approximately $3.7 million of additional
consideration.

Loy Yang

—
Based on a third party market valuation and bids received in
response to marketing Loy Yang for possible sale, we recorded a
write down of our investment of approximately
$111.4 million during 2002 ($53.6 million during the
third quarter and an additional $57.8 million during the
fourth quarter). This write-down reflected management’s
belief that the decline in fair value of the investment was
other than temporary. Accumulated other comprehensive loss at
December 31, 2002 included foreign currency translation
losses of approximately $76.7 million related to Loy Yang.

In May 2003, we entered into negotiations that
culminated in the completion of a Share Purchase Agreement to
sell 100% of the Loy Yang project. Completion of the sale is
subject to various conditions. Upon completion, the sale will
result in proceeds of approximately $25.0 million to
$31.0 million to us; however, the final sale proceeds will
vary depending on the foreign exchange rate and purchase price
adjustments. Consequently, we recorded an additional impairment
charge of approximately $146.4 million during 2003.

Mustang Station —

On July 7, 2003, we completed the
sale of our 50% interest in Mustang Station, a gas-fired
combined cycle power generating plant located in Denver City,
Texas, to EIF Mustang Holdings I, LLC. The sale resulted in
net cash proceeds of approximately $13.3 million and a net
gain of approximately $12.1 million.

Energy Development Limited —

On July 25, 2002, we announced
that we completed the sale of our ownership interests in an
Australian energy company, Energy Development Limited, or
“EDL.” EDL is a listed Australian energy company
engaged in the development and management of an international
portfolio of projects with a particular focus on renewable and
waste fuels. In October 2002, we received proceeds of
$78.5 million (AUS), or approximately $43.9 million
(USD), in exchange for our ownership interest in EDL with the
closing of the transaction. During the third quarter of 2002, we
recorded a write-down of the investment of approximately
$14.2 million to write down the carrying value of our
equity investment due to the pending sale.

Sabine

— In September 2002,
we agreed to transfer our indirect 50% interest in SRW
Cogeneration LP, or “SRW”, to our partner in SRW,
Conoco, Inc. in consideration for Conoco’s agreement
to terminate or assume all of our obligations, in relation to
SRW. SRW owns a cogeneration facility in Orange County, Texas.
We recorded a charge of approximately $48.4 million during
the quarter ended September 30, 2002 to write down the
carrying value of our investment due to the pending sale. The
transaction closed on November 5, 2002.

In December 2002, we completed the sale of our 25% interest in
Kingston Cogeneration LP, based near Toronto, Canada to
Northland Power Income Fund. We received net proceeds of
$15.0 million resulting in a gain on sale of approximately
$9.9 million.

Mt. Poso

—
In September 2002, we agreed to sell our 39.5% indirect
partnership interest in the Mt. Poso Cogeneration Company, a
California limited partnership, or “Mt. Poso”, for
approximately $10 million to Red Hawk Energy, LLC. Mt. Poso
owns a 49.5 MW coal-fired cogeneration power plant and
thermally enhanced oil recovery facility located 20 miles
north of Bakersfield, California. The sale closed in November
2002 resulting in a loss of approximately $1.0 million.

Powersmith

—
During the fourth quarter of 2002, we wrote down our investment
in Powersmith in the amount of approximately $3.4 million
due to recent developments, which indicated impairment of our
book value that is considered to be other than temporary.

Collinsville Power Station —

Based on third party market valuation
and bids received in response to marketing the investment for
possible sale, we recorded a write down of our investment of
approximately $4.1 million during the second quarter of
2002. In August 2002, we announced that we had completed the
sale of our 50% interest in the 192 MW Collinsville Power
Station in Australia, to our partner, a subsidiary of Transfield
Services Limited for $8.6 million (AUS), or approximately
$4.8 million (USD). Our ultimate loss on the sale of
Collinsville Power Station was approximately $3.6 million.

Other Charges (Credits)

Restructuring, impairment charges, legal
settlement costs and fresh start adjustments included in
operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
include the following:

Impairment Charges

We review the recoverability of our long-lived
assets in accordance with the guidelines of
SFAS No. 144. As a result of this review, we recorded
impairment charges of $2.6 billion and $228.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the period from
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 respectively,
as shown in the table below.

To determine whether an asset was impaired, we
compared asset carrying values to total future estimated
undiscounted cash flows. Separate analyses were completed for
assets or groups of assets at the lowest level for which
identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash
flows of other assets and liabilities. The estimates of future
cash flows included only future cash flows, net of associated
cash outflows, directly associated with and expected to arise as
a result of our assumed use and eventual disposition of the
asset. Cash flow estimates associated with assets in service
were based on the asset’s existing service potential. The
cash

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

flow estimates may include probability weightings
to consider possible alternative courses of action and outcomes,
given the uncertainty of available information and prospective
market conditions.

If an asset was determined to be impaired based
on the cash flow testing performed, an impairment loss was
recorded to write down the asset to its fair value. Estimates of
fair value were based on prices for similar assets and present
value techniques. Fair values determined by similar asset prices
reflect our current estimate of recoverability from expected
marketing of project assets. For fair values determined by
projected cash flows, the fair value represents a discounted
cash flow amount over the remaining life of each project that
reflects project-specific assumptions for long-term power pool
prices, escalated future project operating costs, and expected
plant operation given assumed market conditions.

Impairment charges (credits) included the
following asset impairments (realized gains) for the year ended
December 31, 2002 and for the period January 1, 2002
to December 5, 2003:

Credit rating downgrades, defaults under certain
credit agreements, increased collateral requirements and reduced
liquidity experienced during the third quarter of 2002 were
“triggering events” which required us to review the
recoverability of our long-lived assets. Adverse economic
conditions resulted in declining energy prices. Consequently, we
determined that many of our construction projects and
operational projects were impaired during the third quarter of
2002 and should be written down to fair market value.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Connecticut Facilities —

As a result of regulatory developments
and changing circumstances in the second quarter of 2003, we
updated the facilities’ cash flow models to incorporate
changes to reflect the impact of the April 25, 2003
FERC’s orders on regional and locational pricing, and to
update the estimated impact of future locational capacity or
deliverability requirements. Based on these revised cash flow
models, management determined that the new estimates of pricing
and cost recovery levels were not projected to return sufficient
revenue to cover the fixed costs at Devon Power LLC and
Middletown Power LLC. As a consequence, during the second
quarter of 2003 we recorded $64.2 million and
$157.3 million as impairment charges for Devon Power LLC
and Middletown Power LLC, respectively.

Langage
(UK)

— During the third
quarter of 2002, we reviewed the recoverability of our Langage
assets pursuant to SFAS No. 144 and recorded a charge
of $42.3 million. In August 2003 we closed on the sale of
Langage to Carlton Power Limited resulting in net cash proceeds
of approximately $1.5 million, of which $1.0 million
was received in 2003 and $0.5 million during the first
quarter of 2004, and a net gain of approximately
$3.1 million.

Arthur Kill Power,
LLC

— During the third
quarter of 2003, we cancelled our plans to re-establish fuel oil
capacity at our Arthur Kill plant. This resulted in a charge of
approximately $9.0 million to write-off assets under
development.

Turbines

—
In October 2003, we closed on the sale of three turbines and
related equipment. The sale resulted in net cash proceeds of
$70.7 million and a gain of approximately
$21.9 million.

Berrians
Project

— During the fourth
quarter of 2003, we cancelled plans to construct the Berrians
peaking facility on the land adjacent to our Astoria facility.
Berrians was originally scheduled to commence operations in the
summer of 2005; however, based on the remaining costs to
complete and the current risk profile of merchant peaking units,
the construction project was terminated. This resulted in a
charge of approximately $14.3 million to write off the
project’s assets.

Termo
Rio

— Termo Rio is a 1040
green field cogeneration project located in the state of Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil. Based on the project’s failure to meet
certain key milestones, we exercised our rights under the
project agreements to sell our debt and equity interests in the
project to our partner. We are in arbitration over the amount of
compensation we are to receive for our interests in the project.
Based on continued negotiations aimed at settling the case and
the positions of the parties in the arbitration we recorded an
impairment charge of $6.4 million to reflect our investment
interest at the amount expected to be recovered through a sale.
On March 8, 2003, the arbitral tribunal decided most, but
not all, of the issues in our favor. The final amount of the
arbitral award to NRG has not been conclusively determined and
the parties may seek to modify or challenge the award. We
believe we will recover the amount we have recorded on our
balance sheet.

There were no impairment charges for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003.

Reorganization Items

For the period from January 1, 2003 to
December 5, 2003, we incurred $197.8 million in
reorganization costs and for the period from December 6,
2003 to December 31, 2003 we incurred $2.5 million in



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reorganization costs. All reorganization costs
have been incurred since we filed for bankruptcy in May 2003.
The following table provides the detail of the types of costs
incurred:

Restructuring Charges

We incurred total restructuring charges of
approximately $111.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002. These costs consisted of employee
separation costs and advisor fees. We incurred an additional
$8.7 million of employee separation costs and advisor fees
during 2003 until we filed for bankruptcy in May 2003.
Subsequent to that date we recorded all advisor fees as
reorganization costs.

Legal Settlement

During the third quarter of 2003, we recorded
$396.0 million in connection with the resolution of the
FirstEnergy Arbitration Claim. As a result of this resolution,
FirstEnergy retained ownership of the Lake Plant Assets and
received an allowed general unsecured claim of
$396.0 million under the NRG plan of reorganization
submitted to the Bankruptcy Court.

In November 2003, we settled various litigation
with Fortistar Capital in which Fortistar Capital released us
from all litigation claims in exchange for a $60.0 million
pre-petition claim and an $8.0 million post-petition claim.
We had previously recorded $10.8 million in connection with
various legal disputes with Fortistar Capital; accordingly, we
recorded an additional $57.2 million during November 2003.

In August of 1995, we entered into a Marketing,
Development and Joint Proposing Agreement, “the Marketing
Agreement”, with Cambrian Energy Development LLC, or
“Cambrian.” Various claims had arisen in connection
with this Marketing Agreement. In November 2003, we entered into
a Settlement Agreement with Cambrian where we agreed to transfer
our 100% interest in three gasco projects (NEO Ft. Smith,
NEO Phoenix and NEO Woodville) and our 50% interest in two genco
projects (MM Phoenix and MM Woodville) to Cambrian. In addition,
we agreed to pay approximately $1.8 million in settlement
of royalties incurred in connection with the Marketing
Agreement. We had previously recorded a liability for royalties
owed to Cambrian therefore we recorded an additional
$1.4 million during November 2003.

In November 2003, we settled our dispute with
Dick Corporation in connection with Meriden Gas Turbines, which
resulted in our recording an additional liability of
$8.0 million in November, 2003.

Fresh Start Adjustments

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a
credit of $3.9 billion in connection with fresh start
adjustments as discussed in Note 3. Following is a summary
of the significant effects of the reorganization and Fresh Start:

Note 9 —

Asset Retirement Obligation

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted
SFAS No. 143,

“Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations”

or “SFAS No. 143.”
SFAS No. 143 requires an entity to recognize the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the
period in which it is incurred. Upon initial recognition of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation, an entity shall
capitalize an asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount as the
liability. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present
value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over
the useful life of the related asset. Retirement obligations
associated with long-lived assets included within the scope of
SFAS No. 143 are those for which a legal obligation
exists under enacted laws, statutes and written or oral
contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of
promissory estoppel.

We identified certain retirement obligations
within our power generation operations related to our North
America projects in the South Central region, the Northeast
region, Australia, our Alternative Energy projects and our
Thermal projects. These asset retirement obligations are related
primarily to the future dismantlement of equipment on leased
property and environment obligations related to ash disposal
site closures. We also identified other asset retirement
obligations including plant dismantlement that could not be
calculated because the assets associated with the retirement
obligations were determined to have an indeterminate life. The
adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in recording a
$2.6 million increase to property, plant and equipment and
a $4.2 million increase to other long-term obligations. The
cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 was
recorded as a $0.6 million increase to depreciation expense
and a $1.6 million increase to cost of majority-owned
operations in the period from January 1, 2003 to
December 5, 2003 as we considered the cumulative effect to
be immaterial.

The following represents the balances of the
asset retirement obligation as of January 1, 2003 and the
additions and accretion of the asset retirement obligation for
the periods January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003
and the period of December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003, which is included in other long-term
obligations in the consolidated balance sheet. Prior to
December 5, 2003, we completed our annual review of asset
retirement obligations. As part of that review we made revisions
to our previously recorded obligation in the amount of
$4.0 million. The revisions included identification of new
obligations as well as changes in costs or procedures required
at retirement date. As a result of adopting Fresh Start we
revalued our asset retirement obligations on December 6,
2003. We recorded an additional asset retirement obligation of
$7.3 million in connection with fresh start reporting. This
amount results from a change in the discount rate used between
adoption and fresh starting reporting as of December 5,
2003, equal to 500 to 600 basis points.

obligation of $8.4 million and $10.1 million would
have been recorded as an other long-term obligation as of

West Coast Power LLC Summarized Financial
    Information

We have a 50% interest in one company (West Coast
Power LLC) that was considered significant as of
December 31, 2003, as defined by applicable SEC
regulations, we account for our investment using the equity
method. Upon adoption of Fresh Start we adjusted our investment
in West Coast Power to fair value as of December 6, 2003.
In accordance with APB Opinion 18, we have reconciled the value
of our investment as of December 6, 2003 to our share of
West Coast Powers partner’s equity. As a result of pushing
down the impact of Fresh Start to the projects balance sheet we
determined that a contract based intangible asset with a one
year remaining life, consisting of the value of West Coast
Power’s CDWR energy sales contract, must be established and
recognized as a basis adjustment to our share of the future
earnings generated by West Coast Power. This adjustment will
reduce our equity earnings in the amount of approximately
$10.4 million per month during 2004 until the contract
expires in December 2004. Offsetting this reduction in earnings
is a favorable adjustment to reflect a lower depreciation
expense resulting from the corresponding reduced value of the
project’s fixed assets from Fresh Start reporting. During
the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003
we recorded equity earnings of $9.4 million for West Coast
Power after adjustments for the reversal of $2.6 million
project level depreciation expense, offset by a decrease in
earnings related to $8.8 million amortization of the
intangible asset for the CDWR contract. The following table
summarizes financial information for West Coast Power LLC,
including interests owned by us and other parties for the
periods shown below:

Fund”, was established to accumulate the
estimated funds necessary for such purpose. Approximately
$1.1 million was initially deposited in the Solid Waste
Disposal Trust Fund in 1989, and $116,000 has been funded
annually thereafter, based upon an estimated future
rehabilitation cost (in 1989 dollars) of approximately
$3.5 million and the remaining estimated useful life of the
Big Cajun II facilities. At December 31, 2002,
December 6, 2003 and December 31, 2003, the carrying
value of the trust fund investments was approximately
$4.6 million, $4.8 million and $4.8 million,
respectively. The trust fund investments are comprised of
various debt securities of the United States and are carried at
amortized cost, which approximates their fair value. The amounts
required to be deposited in this trust fund are separate from
our calculation of the asset retirement obligation recorded for
the Big Cajun II ash and waste water impoundment areas
discussed in Note No. 9.

Note 15 — Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

During the first quarter of 2002, we adopted
SFAS No. 142 —

“Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets”

or
“SFAS No. 142”, which requires new
accounting for intangible assets, including goodwill. Intangible
assets with finite lives will be amortized over their economic
useful lives and periodically reviewed for impairment. Goodwill
will no longer be amortized, but will be tested for impairment
annually and on an interim basis if an event occurs or a
circumstance changes between annual tests that may reduce the
fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Upon
the adoption of Fresh Start, we re-evaluated the recoverability
of our goodwill and intangibles. As a result, we have written
off all goodwill amounts as of December 5, 2003. We have
also established certain other contract based intangibles, which
will be amortized over their respective contractual lives.

Predecessor Company

We had intangible assets with a net carrying
value of $76.6 million at December 31, 2002. The
Aggregate amortization expense recognized for the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001 was approximately
$2.8 million and $4.2 million, respectively. The
amortization expense for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 was $3.8 million.

Reorganized NRG

We had intangible assets with a net carrying
value of $486.7 million and $481.5 million at
December 6, 2003 and December 31, 2003. The power
purchase agreements will be amortized as a reduction to revenue
over the terms and conditions of each contract. The weighted
average amortization period is 7 years for the power
purchase agreements. Emission allowances will be amortized as
additional fuel expense based upon the actual level of emissions
from the respective plant through 2023. The amortization expense
for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31,
2003 was $5.2 million related to power purchase agreements.
The annual aggregate amortization expense for each of the five
succeeding years is expected to approximate $57.5 million
in year one, $37.4 million in year two, $30.2 million
in years three and four, and $23.3 million in

    2003.

The following table summarizes the pro forma
impact of implementing SFAS No. 142 at January 1,
2001 on net income (loss) for the periods presented.

Note 16 — Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We have adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”

or
“SFAS No. 133”, as amended by
SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and
SFAS No. 149. SFAS No. 133 requires us to
record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivatives will be
immediately recognized in earnings. The criteria used to
determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are
a) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure,
b) whether or not the overall risk is being reduced and
c) if there is a high degree of correlation between the
value of the derivative instrument and the underlying
obligation. Formal documentation of the hedging relationship,
the nature of the underlying risk, the risk management
objective, and the means by which effectiveness will be assessed
is created at the inception of the hedge. Changes in fair values
of derivatives accounted for as hedges will either be recognized
in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of related
hedged assets, liabilities and firm commitments or, for
forecasted transactions, deferred and recorded as a component of
other accumulated comprehensive income, or “OCI”,
until the hedged



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

transactions occur and are recognized in
earnings. The ineffective portion of a hedging derivative
instrument’s change in fair value will be immediately
recognized in earnings. We also formally assess both at
inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
effective in offsetting the changes in either the fair value or
cash flows of the hedged item. This assessment includes all
components of each derivative’s gain or loss unless
otherwise noted. When it is determined that a derivative ceases
to be a highly effective hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued.

SFAS No. 133 applies to our long-term
power sales contracts, long-term gas purchase contracts and
other energy related commodities financial instruments used to
mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot
market prices, hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities
and protect investments in fuel inventories.
SFAS No. 133 also applies to various interest rate
swaps used to mitigate the risks associated with movements in
interest rates and foreign exchange contracts to reduce the
effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on foreign denominated
investments and other transactions. At December 31, 2003,
we had commodity contracts extending through December 2020.

Derivative Financial
    Instruments

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

As of December 6, 2003 and December 31,
2003, neither we nor our consolidating subsidiaries had any
outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts. At
December 31, 2002, we had various foreign currency exchange
instruments with combined notional amounts of $3.0 million.
These foreign currency exchange instruments were hedges of
expected future cash flows. If the hedges had been terminated at
December 31, 2002, we would have owed the counter-parties
$0.3 million.

Interest Rates

At December 31, 2002, December 6, 2003
and December 31, 2003, our consolidating subsidiaries had
various interest-rate swap agreements with combined notional
amounts of $1.7 billion, $617.4 million and
$620.5 million, respectively. These contracts are used to
manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. If these swaps
had been terminated at December 31, 2002, December 6,
2003 and December 31, 2003, we would have owed the
counter-parties $41.0 million, $53.6 million and
$50.2 million, respectively.

Energy Related Commodities

At December 31, 2002, December 6, 2003
and December 31, 2003, we had various energy related
commodities financial instruments with combined notional amounts
of $241.8 million, $519.7 million and
$521.1 million, respectively. These financial instruments
take the form of fixed price, floating price or indexed sales or
purchases, options, such as puts or calls, basis transactions
and swaps. These contracts are used to manage our exposure to
commodity price variability in electricity, emission allowances
and natural gas, oil and coal used to meet fuel requirements. If
these contracts were terminated at December 31, 2002,
December 6, 2003 and December 31, 2003, we would have
received $58.5 million, $46.3 million and
$46.0 million, from counter-parties, respectively. As of
December 31, 2003, we had various long-term power sales
contracts with combined notional amounts of approximately
$3.2 billion.

Credit Risk

We have an established credit policy in place to
minimize our overall credit risk. Important elements of this
policy include ongoing financial reviews of all counter-parties,
established credit limits, as well as monitoring, managing and
mitigating credit exposure.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive
    Income

The following table summarizes the effects of
SFAS No. 133 on our other comprehensive income balance
as of December 31, 2003:

During the period ended December 31, 2003,
we recorded a loss in OCI of approximately $0.5 million
related to changes in the fair values of derivatives accounted
for as hedges. The net balance in OCI relating to
SFAS No. 133 as of December 31, 2003 was an
unrecognized loss of approximately $0.5 million. We expect
$2.1 million of deferred net gains on derivative
instruments accumulated in OCI to be recognized in earnings
during the next twelve months.

The following table summarizes the effects of
SFAS No. 133 on our other comprehensive income balance
as of December 6, 2003:

During the period ended December 5, 2003, we
reclassified losses of $32.0 million from OCI to
current-period earnings as a result of the discontinuance of
cash flow hedges because it is probable that the original
forecasted transactions will not occur by the end of the
originally specified time period. Additionally, gains of
$114.8 million were reclassified from OCI to current period
earnings during the period ended December 5, 2003 due to
the unwinding of previously deferred amounts. These amounts are
recorded on the same line in the statement of operations in
which the hedged items are recorded. Also during the period
ended December 5, 2003, we recorded a gain in OCI of
approximately $51.4 million related to changes in the fair
values of derivatives accounted for as hedges. Our plan of
reorganization became effective December 5, 2003



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

and, accordingly, we made adjustments for Fresh
Start in accordance with SOP 90-7. These Fresh Start
adjustments resulted in a write-off of net losses recorded in
OCI of $5.1 million.

The following table summarizes the effects of
SFAS No. 133 on our other comprehensive income balance
as of December 31, 2002:

During the year ended December 31, 2002, we
reclassified gains of $23.3 million from OCI to
current-period earnings as a result of the discontinuance of
cash flow hedges because it is probable that the original
forecasted transactions will not occur by the end of the
originally specified time period. Also, gains of
$6.1 million were reclassified from OCI to current period
earnings due to the hedge items being terminated by the
counterparties. Additionally, gains of $53.2 million were
reclassified from OCI to current period earnings during the year
ended December 31, 2002 due to the unwinding of previously
deferred amounts. These amounts are recorded on the same line in
the statement of operations in which the hedged items are
recorded. Also during the year ended December 31, 2002, we
recorded a gain in OCI of approximately $37.7 million
related to changes in the fair values of derivatives accounted
for as hedges. The net balance in OCI relating to
SFAS No. 133 as of December 31, 2002 was an
unrecognized gain of approximately $26.3 million.

Energy Related Commodities

We are exposed to commodity price variability in
electricity, emission allowances and natural gas, oil and coal
used to meet fuel requirements. In order to manage these
commodity price risks, we enter into financial instruments,
which may take the form of fixed price, floating price or
indexed sales or purchases, and options, such as puts, calls,
basis transactions and swaps. Certain of these transactions have
been designated as cash flow hedges. We have accounted for these
derivatives by recording the effective portion of the cumulative
gain

SUBSIDIARIES

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

or loss on the derivative instrument as a
component of OCI in shareholders’ equity. We recognize
deferred gains and losses into earnings in the same period or
periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Such reclassifications are included on the same line of the
statement of operations in which the hedged item is recorded.

No ineffectiveness was recognized on commodity
cash flow hedges during the years ended December 31, 2001,
December 31, 2002 or during the periods January 1,
2003 through December 5, 2003 and December 6, 2003
through December 31, 2003.

Our pre-tax earnings for the years ended
December 31, 2001, December 31, 2002, the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and the
period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003,
were affected by an unrealized gain of $14.1 million, an
unrealized gain of $20.0 million, an unrealized gain of
$53.7 million and an unrealized loss of $0.7 million,
respectively, associated with changes in the fair value of
energy related derivative instruments not accounted for as
hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, we
reclassified gains of $83.7 million from OCI to
current-period earnings. During the periods January 1, 2003
through December 5, 2003 and December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 gains of $112.5 and $0 million,
respectively, were reclassified from OCI to current-period
earnings. Our plan of reorganization became effective
December 5, 2003 and, accordingly, we made adjustments for
Fresh Start in accordance with SOP 90-7. These Fresh Start
adjustments resulted in a write-off of net gains recorded in OCI
of $61.0 million on energy related derivative instruments
accounted for as hedges. We expect to reclassify an additional
$1.3 million of deferred gains to earnings during the next
twelve months on energy related derivative instruments accounted
for as hedges.

Interest Rates

To manage interest rate risk, we have entered
into interest-rate swaps that effectively fix the interest
payments of certain floating rate debt instruments.
Interest-rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow
hedges. The effective portion of the cumulative gain or loss on
the derivative instrument is reported as a component of OCI in
shareholders’ equity and recognized into earnings as the
underlying interest expense is incurred. Such reclassifications
are included on the same line of the statement of operations in
which the hedged item is recorded.

No ineffectiveness was recognized on interest
rate cash flow hedges during the year ended December 31,
2002 or during the periods January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 and December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003.

Our pre-tax earnings for the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2002 were increased by an unrealized
loss of $0 and $32.0 million, respectively, associated with
changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative
instruments not accounted for as hedges in accordance with
SFAS No. 133.

Our pre-tax earnings for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and the
period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003,
were affected by an unrealized loss of $15.1 million and an
unrealized gain of $2.0 million, respectively, associated
with changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative
instruments not accounted for as hedges in accordance with
SFAS No. 133.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, we
reclassified gains of $0.9 million from OCI to
current-period earnings. During the periods January 1, 2003
through December 5, 2003 and December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 losses of $29.7 and $0 million,
respectively, were reclassified from OCI to current-period
earnings. Our plan of reorganization became effective
December 5, 2003 and, accordingly, we made adjustments for
Fresh Start in accordance with SOP 90-7. These Fresh Start
adjustments resulted in a write-off of net losses recorded in
OCI of $65.9 million on interest rate swaps accounted for
as hedges. We

expect to reclassify an additional
$0.7 million of deferred gains to earnings during the next
twelve months on interest rate swaps accounted for as hedges.

Foreign Currency Exchange
    Rates

To preserve the U.S. dollar value of
projected foreign currency cash flows, we may hedge, or protect
those cash flows if appropriate foreign hedging instruments are
available.

No ineffectiveness was recognized on foreign
currency cash flow hedges during the years ended
December 31, 2001, December 31, 2002 or during the
periods January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003.

Our pre-tax earnings for the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2002 were increased by an unrealized
gain of $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively,
associated with foreign currency hedging instruments not
accounted for as hedges in accordance with
SFAS No. 133.

Our pre-tax earnings for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and the
period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003,
were increased by an unrealized gain of $0.1 million and
$0, respectively, associated with foreign currency hedging
instruments not accounted for as hedges in accordance with
SFAS No. 133.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, we
reclassified losses of $2.1 million from OCI to current
period earnings. During the periods January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 and December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 losses of $0 and $0 million,
respectively, were reclassified from OCI to current-period
earnings. Our plan of reorganization became effective
December 5, 2003 and, accordingly, we made adjustments for
Fresh Start in accordance with SOP 90-7. These Fresh Start
adjustments resulted in a write-off of net losses recorded in
OCI of $0.2 million on foreign currency swaps accounted for
as hedges. We do not expect to reclassify any deferred gains or
losses to earnings during the next twelve months on foreign
currency swaps accounted for as hedges.

Note 17 — Debt and Capital
Leases

Long-term debt and capital leases consist of the
following:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2003, we have timely made
scheduled payments on interest and/or principal on all of our
recourse debt and were not in default under any of our related
recourse debt instruments. However, a significant amount of our
subsidiaries’ debt and other obligations contain terms that
require that they be supported with letters of credit or cash
collateral following a ratings downgrade or a default on our
debt. As of December 31, 2003, as a result of the
downgrades and loan defaults that we experienced in 2002, we
estimate that we were in default of our obligations to post
collateral of approximately $71.4 million, principally to
fund contract termination penalties, revenue shortfall
guarantees and late completion penalties related to NRG Peaker
Finance Company LLC. On January 6, 2004, the debt held at
NRG Peaker Finance Company LLC was restructured, and this
collateral obligation ceased. As a result, we currently have no
unmet cash collateral obligations outstanding.

Short Term Debt

On December 23, 2003, we entered into a bank
facility for up to $1.45 billion, or “New Credit
Facility”, which included a $950.0 million, six and a
half-year senior secured term loan, a $250.0 million funded
letter of credit facility, and a four-year $250.0 million
revolving line of credit, or “corporate revolver”.
Portions of the corporate revolver are available as a swing-line
facility and as a revolving letter of credit sub-facility. As of

December 31, 2003, the corporate revolver
was undrawn. The $250 million funded letter of credit is
reflected as a funded deposit on the December 31, 2003
balance sheet.

Long-term Debt and Capital Leases

Senior Securities

As a result of our bankruptcy filing, we ceased
recording accrued interest on the following unsecured
facilities, as it was not probable of being paid. On
December 5, 2003, concurrent with our emergence from
bankruptcy, the following senior unsecured facilities were
terminated in conjunction with certain settlement provisions. We
have no outstanding obligations with respect to the following
terminated debt facilities:



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As part of and concurrent with the emergence from
bankruptcy, certain unsecured creditors received rights to
$500.0 million of 10% NRG Energy senior notes, or “POR
Notes” to be issued by us. However, the creditors accepted
$500 million in cash in lieu of the POR Notes, on
December 23, 2003 in conjunction with the financing
described below. Accrued interest of $2.5 million was paid
to these creditors based on the notional amount of the POR
Notes. As of December 31, 2003, there were no outstanding
obligations with respect to the POR Notes.

On December 23, 2003, we issued
$1.25 billion in 8% Second Priority Notes, due and payable
on December 15, 2013. The Second Priority Notes are general
obligations of ours. They are secured on a second-priority basis
by security interests in all assets of ours, with certain
exceptions, subject to the liens securing our obligations under
the New Credit Agreement (described below) and any other
priority lien debt. The notes are effectively subordinated to
our obligations under the New Credit Facility and any other
priority lien obligation, which will be secured on a
first-priority basis by the same assets that secure the Second
Priority Notes. The Second Priority Notes will be senior in
right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness.
Interest on the Second Priority Notes accrues at the rate of
8.0% per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears
on June 15 and December 15, commencing on
June 15, 2004.

Also on December 23, 2003, concurrently with
the offering of the notes, we and PMI entered into the New
Credit Facility for up to $1.45 billion with Credit Suisse
First Boston, as Administrative Agent, and Lehman Commercial
Paper, Inc., as Syndication Agent and a group of lenders.
The New Credit Facility consists of a $950 million, six and
a half-year senior secured term loan facility, a
$250 million, funded letter of credit facility, and a
four-year revolving credit facility in an amount of up to
$250 million. Portions of the revolving credit facility are
available as a swing-line facility and as a revolving letter of
credit sub-facility. No borrowings had been made under the
revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2003. Under
the letter of credit facility, $1.7 million had been issued
as of December 31, 2003.

The New Credit Facility is secured by, among
other things, first-priority perfected security interests in all
of the property and assets owned at any time or acquired by us
and our subsidiaries, other than the property and assets of
certain excluded project subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries and
certain other subsidiaries, with some exceptions.

Interest on the New Credit Facility consists of a
spread of either 3% over prime or 4% over a LIBO rate, to be
selected by the borrower. Other expenses associated with the New
Credit Facility include commitment fees on the undrawn portion
of the letter of credit facility, participation fees for the
credit-linked deposit and other fees. As of December 31,
2003, we did not have an interest rate swap in place to hedge
against fluctuations in prime or LIBO rates. On
February 25, 2004 we amended the new credit facility to
remove this requirement.

Proceeds of the December 23, 2003 Second
Priority Notes issuance and the New Credit Facility were used
for the following purposes:



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

•

Additional fees and expenses related to the
    transactions.

Significant affirmative covenants of the Second
Priority Notes and the New Credit Facility include the provision
of financial reports, reports of any events of default or
developments that could have a material adverse effect,
provision of notice with respect to changes in corporate
structure or collateral. In addition, the borrower must maintain
segregated cash accounts for certain deposits or settlements. A
provision that the borrower enter into an interest-rate swap
agreement on a portion of the term loan was waived by the
lenders pursuant to an amendment to the New Credit Agreement.

Significant negative covenants of the Second
Priority Notes and the New Credit Facility include limitations
on permitted indebtedness, including the provision of
intercompany loans among certain subsidiaries and affiliates;
permitted liens; permitted acquisitions and certain asset
dispositions. In addition, certain financial ratio tests must be
met.

Events of default under the Second Priority Notes
and the New Credit Facility include materially false
representation or warranty; payment default on principal or
interest; covenant defaults; cross-defaults to material
indebtedness; our or a material subsidiary’s bankruptcy and
insolvency; material unpaid judgments; ERISA events; failure to
be perfected on any material collateral; and a change in control.

On January 28, 2004, we issued an additional
$475.0 million in Second Priority Notes, under the same
terms and indenture as our December 23, 2003 offering.
Proceeds of the offering were used to prepay $503.5 million
of the outstanding principal on the term loan under the New
Credit Facility, described below, reducing the outstanding
principal of the term loan from $950.0 million to
$446.5 million.

Project Financings

For discussion of NRG FinCo, the Audrain capital
lease and LSP Pike Energy LLC see Note 24.

The LSP Kendall Energy LLC credit facility is
non-recourse to us and consists of a construction and term loan,
working capital and letter of credit facilities. As of
December 31, 2002, December 6, 2003 and
December 31, 2003, there were borrowings totaling
approximately $495.8 million, $489.2 million and
$487.0 million, respectively, outstanding under the
facility at a weighted average annual interest rate of 3.15%,
2.58% and 2.58%, respectively. In May 2002, LSP-Kendall Energy,
LLC received a notice of default from Societe Generale, the
administrative agent under LSP-Kendall’s Credit and
Reimbursement Agreement dated November 12, 1999. The notice
asserted that an event of default had occurred under the Credit
and Reimbursement Agreement as a result of liens filed against
the Kendall project by various subcontractors. In consideration
of the borrower’s implementation of a plan to remove the
liens, and our indemnification pursuant to an Indemnity
Agreement dated June 28, 2002, of the lenders to the
Kendall project from any claims or damages relating to these
liens or any dispute or action involving the project’s EPC
contractor, the administrative agent, with the consent of the
required lenders under the Credit and Reimbursement Agreement,
withdrew the notice of default and conditionally waived any
default or event of default described therein. Discussions with
the administrative agent regarding the liens continue. On
August 25, 2003, LSP-Kendall Energy LLC entered into a
Completion Extension and Amendment Agreement with the lenders
and Societe Generale whereby certain extensions were granted in
respect of project construction, lien removal and other items.
The Completion Extension and Amendment Agreement prohibits
LSP-Kendall Energy LLC from making any distributions to equity
owners until January 1, 2005, and thereafter only when
certain conditions are met. LSP-Kendall Energy LLC continues to
be in default with respect to certain covenants, however, and is
in discussions with the lenders regarding restructuring its
indebtedness.

In May 1999, LSP Energy Limited Partnership, or
“Partnership” and LSP Batesville Funding Corporation,
or “Funding” issued two series of Senior Secured
Bonds, or “Bonds” in the following total principal
amounts: $150 million 7.16% Series A Senior Secured
Bonds due 2014 and $176 million 8.160% Series B Senior
Secured Bonds due 2025. Interest is payable semiannually on each
January 15 and July 15. In



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

March 2000, a registration statement was filed by
Partnership and Funding and became effective. The registration
statement was filed to allow the exchange of the Bonds for two
series of debt securities, or “Exchange Bonds”, which
are in all material respects substantially identical to the
Bonds. The Exchange Bonds are secured by substantially all of
the personal property and contract rights of the Partnership and
Funding. The Exchange Bonds are redeemable, at the option of
Partnership and Funding, at any time in whole or from time to
time in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days
prior notice to the holders of that series of Exchange Bonds, on
any date prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to
100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Exchange Bonds
being redeemed and a make whole premium. In no event will the
redemption price ever be less than 100% of the principal amount
of the Exchange Bonds being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon. Principal payments are payable on each
January 15 and July 15 beginning July 15, 2001.
Under the credit arrangements, the project is required to
maintain minimum cash balances in certain reserve funds. Subject
to funding these reserve accounts and anticipated working
capital needs, and meeting certain debt coverage tests, the
project may distribute any remaining cash to us. As of
December 31, 2003, Batesville had sufficiently funded its
reserve accounts, but did not meet its debt coverage test.

In June 2002, NRG Peaker Finance Company LLC, or
“NRG Peaker”, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary,
completed the issuance of $325 million of Series A
Floating Rate Senior Secured Bonds due 2019. The bonds bear
interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus
1.07%. Interest on the bonds is payable on March 10,
June 10, September 10 and December 10 of each
year, commencing on September 10, 2002. NRG Peaker
subsequently entered into an interest rate swap agreement
pursuant to which it agreed to make 6.67% fixed rate interest
payments and receive floating rate interest payments. XL Capital
Assurance, or “XLCA”, guarantees principal, interest
and swap payments, through a financial guaranty insurance
policy. Such notes are also secured by substantially all of the
assets of and/or membership interests in our subsidiaries: Bayou
Cove Peaking Power LLC, Big Cajun I Peaking Power LLC, NRG
Sterlington Power LLC, NRG Rockford LLC, NRG Rockford II
LLC and NRG Rockford Equipment LLC. As of December 31,
2003, $311.4 million in aggregate principal remained
outstanding on these bonds. XLCA accelerated the bonds due to
cross-defaults on our debt and liens placed upon certain assets.
On January 6, 2004, we and XLCA consummated a comprehensive
restructuring arrangement which provides for, among other
things, the provision of a letter of credit by us for the
benefit of the secured parties in the NRG Peaker financing, the
cure or waiver of all defaults under the original financing
agreement and the mutual release of claims by the parties. With
the exception of distributions to pay taxes, distributions to
equity holders are subject to tests regarding NRG Peaker reserve
funding and financial ratios.

In May 2001, our wholly-owned subsidiary, NRG
Finance Company I LLC, or “NRG FinCo”, entered
into a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. The facility
was established to finance the acquisition, development and
construction of power generating plants located in the United
States and to finance the acquisition of turbines for such
facilities. The facility provided for borrowings of base rate
loans and Eurocurrency loans and was secured by mortgages and
security agreements in respect of the assets of the projects
financed under the facility, pledges of the equity interests in
the subsidiaries or affiliates of the borrower that own such
projects, and by guaranties from each such subsidiary or
affiliate. The NRG FinCo secured revolver was initially
scheduled to mature on May 8, 2006; however, due to
defaults hereunder by NRG FinCo and applicable guarantors, the
lenders accelerated all outstanding obligations on
November 6, 2002. As of our emergence, $1.1 billion
was outstanding under the facility, and there was an aggregate
of approximately $58 million of accrued but unpaid interest
and commitment fees. Of this, $842.0 million was allowed in
unsecured claims under NRG plan of reorganization, and was
settled at the time of our emergence. The remaining balance will
be satisfied when the NRG FinCo lenders exercise their perfected
security interests in our Nelson, Audrain and Pike projects (see
note 24).

Meriden Gas Turbines LLC, or “MGT” is
party to a $0.5 million Promissory Note and Security
Agreement with PowerSource LLC, issued and entered into on
February 13, 2003. MGT used the proceeds of



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the note issuance to allow the release of a lien
and claim on certain MGT assets, and for costs associated with
the transport of certain equipment to the MGT site. The note
became due and payable on May 14, 2003. We expect to repay
this note with the proceeds from the sale of the MGT assets in
2004.

In March 2001, we increased our ownership
interest in Penobscot Energy Recovery Company, or
“PERC”, which resulted in the consolidation of our
equity investment in PERC. As a result, the assets and
liabilities of PERC became part of our consolidated assets and
liabilities. Upon completion of the transaction, we recorded
approximately $37.9 million of outstanding Finance
Authority of Maine Electric, or “FAME” Rate
Stabilization Revenue Refunding Bonds Series 1998, or
“FAME bonds” which were issued on PERC’s behalf
by FAME in June 1998. The face amount of the bonds that were
initially issued was approximately $44.9 million and was
used to repay the Floating Rate Demand Resource Revenue Bonds
issued by the Town of Orrington, Maine on behalf of PERC. The
FAME bonds are fixed rate bonds with yields ranging from 3.75%
to 5.2%. The weighted average yield on the FAME bonds is
approximately 5.1%. The FAME bonds are subject to mandatory
redemption in annual installments of varying amounts through
July 1, 2018. Beginning July 1, 2008 the FAME bonds
are subject to redemption at the option of PERC at a redemption
price equal to 102% through June 30, 2009, 101% for the
period July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010 and 100%
thereafter, of the principal amount outstanding, plus accrued
interest. The loan agreement with FAME contains certain
restrictive covenants relating to the FAME bonds, which restrict
PERC’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, and
restricts the ability of the general partners to sell, assign or
transfer their general partner interests. The bonds are
collateralized by liens on substantially all of PERC’s
assets. As of December 31, 2003, $26.3 million in
principal remains outstanding.

In November 2001, NRG McClain LLC entered into a
$181.0 million term loan and $8.0 million working
capital facility with Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale,
New York branch, as agent to repay an outstanding term loan
used to finance the acquisition of the McClain generating
facility (non-recourse to us). The final maturity date of the
facility is November 30, 2006. As of December 31, 2002
and 2003, the aggregate amount outstanding under this facility
was $157.3 million and $156.5 million, respectively.
During the period ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, the
weighted average interest rate of such outstanding borrowings
was 4.51% and 5.89%, respectively. On September 17, 2002,
NRG McClain LLC received notice from the agent bank that the
project loan was in default as a result of our downgrades and of
defaults on material obligations under the Energy Management
Services Agreement. On August 19, 2003, NRG McClain signed
an asset purchase agreement with Oklahoma Gas and Electric
Company for substantially all of the assets of McClain and
contemporaneously filed for bankruptcy pursuant to the asset
purchase agreement. Upon consummation of the asset sale we
anticipate that all proceeds from the sale will be used to repay
outstanding project debt under the secured term loan and working
capital facility. On December 18, 2003, FERC issued an
order setting the application for hearing to determine remedies
FERC could impose as a condition of any approval for the
transaction. This sale will not be completed until FERC approval
is received. NRG McClain is recorded as a discontinued
operation in the accompanying balance sheets.

The Camas Power Boiler LP notes are secured
principally by its long-term assets. In accordance with the
terms of the note agreements, Camas Power Boiler LP is required
to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants
primarily related to incurring debt, disposing of assets, and
affiliate transactions. Camas Power Boiler was in compliance
with these covenants at December 31, 2003. Distributions to
us from Camas are permitted quarterly, contingent upon the
project sufficiently funding debt service accounts, and meeting
certain covenants and conditions. As of December 31, 2003,
Camas met all requirements for distributions.

In July 2002, NRG Energy Center Minneapolis LLC,
or “MEC”, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered
into an agreement allowing it to issue senior secured promissory
notes in the aggregate principal amount of up to
$150 million. In July 2002, under this agreement, MEC
issued $75 million of bonds in a private placement. Two
series of notes were issued in July 2002, the $55 million
Series A-Notes dated July 3, 2002, which matures on
August 1, 2017 and bears an interest rate of 7.25% per
annum and the $20 million

Series B-Notes dated July 3, 2002,
which matures on August 1, 2017 and bears an interest rate
of 7.12% per annum. NRG Thermal LLC, a directly-held,
wholly-owned subsidiary, which owns 100% of MEC, pledged its
interests in all of its district heating and cooling investments
throughout the United States as collateral. NRG Thermal and MEC
are required to maintain compliance with certain financial
covenants primarily related to incurring debt, disposing of
assets, and affiliate transactions. In August 1993, MEC issued
$84 million of 7.31% senior secured notes, due
June 15, 2013. The three MEC notes contain a covenant
providing the lender the option to choose prepayment of the
notes if, among other things, Xcel Energy no long directly or
indirectly owns a controlling interest in NRG Thermal. Xcel
Energy no longer owns a controlling interest in NRG Thermal as a
result of our emergence from bankruptcy. In anticipation of the
change in control, NRG Thermal has entered into a forbearance
agreement with the lender to allow time to negotiate a modified
loan covenant package that would enable the lender to choose not
to exercise its change in control option. Until a new loan
covenant package has been developed, terms of the forbearance
agreement prevent MEC or its subsidiaries from making
distributions to us. The forbearance agreement expires
June 1, 2004. As a result of the forbearance agreement, NRG
Thermal and MEC were in compliance with their credit covenants
at December 31, 2003.

STS Hydropower, LTD, or “STS
Hydropower” which is indirectly 50% owned by NEO
Corporation, or “NEO”, our wholly-owned subsidiary,
entered into a Note Purchase Agreement in March 1995 with
Allstate Life Insurance Co., or “Allstate”. Allstate
purchased from STS Hydropower $22.1 million of
9.155% senior secured debt due December 30, 2016. The
agreement was amended in 1996 to add $0.7 million of
8.24% senior secured debt due March 2011. The debt is
secured by substantially all assets of and interest in STS
Hydropower. Because of poor hydroelectric output due to drought
conditions, no principal or interest payments have been made on
this loan facility since October 2001. In May 2003, the facility
was restructured and currently has a maturity of March 2023 and
an interest rate of 9.133%. As of December 31, 2003, all
required covenants under the restructured facility had been met
and $25.2 million of principal was outstanding.

In September 1999, Northbrook New York LLC,
or “NNY”, which is indirectly owned by NEO, entered
into a $17.5 million term loan agreement with Heller
Financial. In December 2001, the credit agreement with Heller
Financial was amended to include $2.6 million of financing
for Northbrook Carolina Hydro, LLC, or “NCH”, which is
indirectly 50% owned by NEO, and to cross-collateralize the NNY
and NCH notes. Heller Financial was subsequently purchased by GE
Capital Services, which assumed the notes. The loan facilities
are secured by substantially all hydroelectric assets of and
membership interests in NCH and NNY. The NNY facility bears an
interest rate of LIBOR plus 3% and matures in December 2018. The
NCH facility bears interest at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 4%
and matures in December 2016. As of December 31, 2003, the
outstanding principal balance on the NNY facility and the NCH
facility was $17.2 million and $2.5 million,
respectively. On December 2001, NCH purchased a
$0.3 million subordinated note from NEO. This subordinated
note accrues interest at 11% per annum, and no payment is
due until maturity on December 31, 2018.

In September 2000, Flinders Power Finance Pty
Ltd, or “Flinders Power”, an Australian wholly owned
subsidiary, entered into a twelve year AUD $150 million
cash advance facility (US $81.4 million at September
2000). As of December 31, 2002 and 2003, there remains
AUD$143.4 million (US$80.5 million) and
AUD$135.0 million (US$101.6 million) outstanding under
this facility, respectively. The interest has fixed and variable
components. At December 31, 2002 and 2003, the interest
rate was 6.49% and 7.53%, respectively and is paid
semi-annually. Principal payments commence in 2006 and the
facility will be fully paid in 2012.

In March 2002, Flinders Power entered into a
10 year AUD$165 million (US$85.4 million at March
2002) floating rate loan facility for the purpose of
refurbishing the Flinders Playford generating station. As of
December 31, 2002 and 2003, the Company had drawn
AUD$33.3 million (US$18.7 million) and

AUD$114.3 million (US$86.0 million),
respectively, of this facility. The interest rate has fixed and
variable components. The interest rate at December 31, 2002
and 2003 was 6.14% and 7.03%, and is paid semi-annually.
Principal payments for the refurbishment facility commence in
2005. Upon our downgrades in 2002, there existed a potential
default under these facility agreements related to the funding
of reserve accounts. On May 13, 2003, Flinders Power and
its lenders entered into a Second Supplemental Deed, which
resolved these potential defaults. As part of the terms of that
Second Supplemental Deed, part of the refurbishment facility was
voluntarily cancelled by Flinders Power so as to reduce the
total available commitment from AUD$165 million to
AUD$137 million (US$103.1 million).

In connection with our acquisition of a
controlling interest in the COBEE facilities, we assumed
non-recourse long-term debt that is due in 18 semi-annual
installments of varying amounts beginning January 31, 1999
and ending July 31, 2007. The loan agreement provides an A
Loan of up to $30 million and a B Loan of up to
$45 million. The balance of the A and B loans was
$31.8 million as of December 31, 2003. Interest is
payable semi-annually in arrears at a rate equal to 6-month
LIBOR plus a margin of 4.5% on the A Loan and 6-month LIBOR plus
a margin of 4.0% on the B Loan. The A Loan and the B Loan are
collateralized by a mortgage on substantially all of
COBEE’s assets.

In connection with our purchase of
PowerGen’s interest in Saale Energie GmbH, we have
recognized a non-recourse capital lease on our balance sheet in
the amount of $333.9 million and $342.5 million, as of
December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively. The capital lease
obligation is recorded at the net present value of the minimum
lease obligation payable over the lease’s remaining period
of 19 years. In addition, a direct financing lease was
recorded in notes receivable in the amount of approximately
$366.4 million, $435.0 million and
$451.4 million, as of December 31, 2002,
December 6, 2003 and December 31, 2003, respectively.

Hsin Yu, which is approximately 63% indirectly
owned by us, entered into a NT$2,700.0 million syndicated loan
arrangement to finance construction of what was to be the first
phase of a multi-phase cogeneration facility. Chiao Tung Bank
led the original financing. Principal covenants of the
syndicated facility include maintaining a debt to equity ratio
below 250% until 2006, and a ratio below 200% thereafter, and
maintaining a debt service coverage ratio above 1.1, starting in
2004. The fair value adjustment reflects the uncertainty of
repayment of such obligations from project cash flows.

Annual maturities of long-term debt and capital
leases for the years ending after December 31, 2003 are as
follows:

Assets related to our capital leases were
revalued as of December 6, 2003, to $171.0 million and
remained at $171.0 million with no accumulated amortization
at December 31, 2003, as the amounts have been recorded at
recoverable values. Total net book value related to these assets
at December 31, 2002 was $258.2 million, net of
$2.3 million of accumulated amortization.

Note 18 — Capital
Stock

Reorganized Capital Structure

In connection with the consummation of our plan
of reorganization, on December 5, 2003 all shares of our
old common stock were canceled and 100,000,000 shares of
new common stock of NRG Energy were distributed pursuant to such
plan to the holders of certain classes of claims. A certain
number of shares of common stock was issued for distribution to
holders of disputed claims as such claims are resolved or
settled. In the event our disputed claims reserve is inadequate,
it is possible we would have to issue additional shares of our
common stock to satisfy such pre-petition claims or contribute
additional cash proceeds. See Note 24 — Disputed
Claims Reserve. Our authorized capital stock consists of
500,000,000 shares of NRG Energy common stock and
10,000,000 shares of Serial Preferred Stock. Further, a
total of 4,000,000 shares of our common stock, representing
approximately 4% of our outstanding common stock, are available
for issuance under our long-term incentive plan.

In addition to our issuance of new common stock,
on December 23, 2003, we completed a note offering
consisting of $1.25 billion of 8% Second Priority Senior
Secured Notes due 2013, and we entered into a new credit
facility consisting of a $950.0 term loan facility, a
$250.0 million funded letter of credit facility and a
$250 million revolving credit facility. We used the
proceeds of these offerings to retire certain project level
debt, pay certain unsecured creditors and relieve associated
cash traps. In January of 2004, we completed a supplementary
note offering whereby we issued an additional $475 million
of 8% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2013 at a premium
and used the proceeds there from to repay a portion of the
$950.0 million term loan. As of March 1, 2004, the
outstanding principal balance on the notes was
$1.725 billion and the principal amount outstanding under
the term loan was $446.5 million and $147.5 million
remains available under the funded letter of credit facility. As
of March 1, 2004, we had not drawn down on our revolving
credit facility. Finally, in connection with the consummation of
our plan of reorganization, we issued to Xcel Energy a
$10.0 million non-amortizing promissory note, which will
accrue interest at a rate of 3% per annum and mature
2.5 years after the effective date of our plan of
reorganization.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As part of our plan of reorganization, we
eliminated approximately $5.2 billion of corporate level
bank and bond debt and approximately $1.3 billion of
additional claims and disputes through our distribution of new
common stock and $1.04 billion in cash among our unsecured
creditors. In addition to the debt reduction associated with the
restructuring, we used the proceeds of the recent note offering
and borrowings under the New Credit Facility to retire
approximately $1.7 billion of project-level debt.

For additional information on our short term and
long term borrowing arrangements, see Note 17.

Sale of Stock

In June 2000, we sold 32.4 million shares of
common stock at $15 per share. Net proceeds from the
offering were $453.7 million. At that time we were
authorized to issue capital stock consisting of
550,000,000 shares of common stock, and
250,000,000 shares of Class A common stock. At
December 31, 2000, there were approximately
32,396,000 shares of common stock, and
147,605,000 shares of Class A common stock issued and
outstanding.

In March 2001, we completed the sale of
18.4 million shares of common stock for an initial price of
$27 per share. The offering was completed with all
18.4 million shares of common stock being sold including
the over-allotment shares of 2.4 million. We received gross
proceeds from the issuance of $496.6 million. Net proceeds
from the issuance were $473.4 million after deducting
underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering
expenses. The net proceeds were used in part to reduce amounts
outstanding under our short-term bridge credit agreement, which
was used to finance, in part, our acquisition of the LS Power
assets.

At December 31, 2001, there were
approximately 50,939,875 shares of common stock, and
147,605,000 shares of Class A common stock issued and
outstanding.

On June 3, 2002, Xcel Energy completed its
exchange offer for the 26% of our common shares that had been
previously publicly held. Xcel Energy issued to our shareholders
0.50 shares of Xcel Energy common stock in exchange for
each outstanding share of our common stock.

Incentive Compensation Plans

In June 2000, we adopted an incentive
compensation plan, or “the Stock Plan”, which was
approved by shareholders in June 2001. We accounted for this
plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB
Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,”

and related Interpretations. During 2002,
the Stock Plan, and all grants under the plan, were adopted by
the Xcel Energy Incentive Stock Plan. There were no grants to
our employees under the Xcel Energy Incentive Stock Plan. During
2001, we recognized approximately $1.9 million of stock
based compensation expense under the New Stock Plan. In 2002, we
recognized income due to the net reduction of our compensation
expense accrual by approximately $2.3 million for
terminated stock options during the period. The amount was
reported as a reduction of compensation expense for the year
ended December 31, 2002.

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS Statement
No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation”

or “SFAS No. 123.” In
accordance with SFAS Statement No. 148,

“Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosure”

or “SFAS No. 148”, we
adopted SFAS No. 123 under the prospective transition
method which requires the application of the recognition
provisions to all employee awards granted, modified, or settled
after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition
provisions are first applied. As a result, we recognized
compensation expense for any grants issued on or after
January 1, 2003. There were no grants issued during the
period from January 1, 2003 through December 4, 2003.

During 2003, we recognized approximately $540,000
of stock based compensation expense under the Long-Term
Incentive Plan, approximately $424,000 related to stock options
and approximately $116,000



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

related to restricted stock. In December 2003, we
adopted a new long-term incentive plan, or “the Long-Term
Incentive Plan”, which is described below.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

The Long-Term Incentive Plan became effective
upon our emergence from bankruptcy. The long-term incentive plan
provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, performance awards, deferred stock units and
dividend equivalent rights. Our directors, officers and
employees, as well as other individuals performing services for,
or to whom an offer of employment has been extended by us, are
eligible to receive grants under the long-term incentive plan.
The purpose of the long-term inventive plan is to promote our
long-term growth and profitability by providing these
individuals with incentives to maximize stockholder value and
otherwise contribute to our success and to enable us to attract,
retain and reward the best available persons for positions of
responsibility.

A total of 4,000,000 shares of our common
stock, representing approximately 4% of our outstanding common
stock, are available for issuance under the long-term incentive
plan, subject to adjustment in the event of a reorganization,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, combination of shares, merger or similar change in our
structure or our outstanding shares of common stock.

The compensation committee of our board of
directors will administer the long-term incentive plan. If for
any reason a compensation committee has not been appointed by
our board to administer the long-term incentive plan, our board
of directors will have the authority to administer the plan and
to take all actions under the plan.

The following is a summary of the material terms
of the long-term incentive plan, but does not include all of the
provisions of the plan.

Eligibility.

Our
directors, officers and employees, as well as other individuals
performing services for, or to whom an offer of employment has
been extended by, us are eligible to receive grants under the
long-term incentive plan. In each case, the compensation
committee will select the actual grantees.

Stock Options.

Under
the long-term incentive plan, the compensation committee may
award grants of incentive stock options conforming to the
requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code or
non-qualified stock options. The compensation committee may not
award to any one person in any calendar year options to purchase
more than 1,000,000 shares of common stock. In addition, it
may not award incentive stock options first exercisable in any
calendar year whose underlying shares have a fair market value
greater than $100,000, determined at the time of grant.

The compensation committee will determine the
exercise price of any options granted under the long-term
incentive plan. However, the exercise price of any option may
not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of our
common stock on the date of grant, and the exercise price of an
incentive stock option granted to a person who owns stock
constituting more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of
our stock may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of
a share of our common stock on the date of grant.

Unless the compensation committee determines
otherwise, the exercise price of any option may be paid in any
of the following ways:



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The compensation committee will determine the
term of each option in its discretion. However, no term may
exceed 10 years from the date of grant or, in the case of
an incentive stock option granted to a person who owns stock
constituting more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of
our stock, five years from the date of grant. In addition, all
options under the long-term incentive plan, whether or not then
exercisable, generally will cease vesting when a grantee ceases
to be a director, officer or employee of, or to otherwise
perform services for, us. Vested options will generally expire
90 days after the date of cessation of service.

There will be exceptions depending upon the
circumstances of cessation. In the case of a grantee’s
death, all options will become fully vested and will remain
exercisable for a period of one year after the date of death. In
the case of a grantee’s termination due to disability,
vested options will remain exercisable for a period of one year
after the date of termination due to disability while his or her
unvested options will be forfeited. In the event of retirement,
a grantee’s vested options will remain exercisable for a
period of two years after the date of retirement while his or
her unvested options will be forfeited. Upon termination for
cause, all options will terminate immediately. Upon a change in
control of NRG Energy, all of the options will become fully
vested and will remain exercisable until the expiration date of
the options. In addition, the compensation committee will have
the authority to grant options that will become fully vested and
exercisable automatically upon a change in control, whether or
not the grantee is subsequently terminated.

Upon a reorganization, merger, consolidation or
sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our
assets, the compensation committee may cancel any or all
outstanding options under the long-term incentive plan in
exchange for payment of an amount equal to the portion of the
consideration that would have been payable to the grantees in
the transaction if their options had been fully exercised
immediately prior to the transaction, less the exercise price
that would have been payable, or if the exercise price is
greater than the consideration that would have been payable in
the transaction, then for no consideration or payment.

Stock Appreciation
Rights.

Under the long-term incentive
plan, the compensation committee may grant stock appreciation
rights, or SARs, alone or in tandem with options, subject to
terms and conditions as the compensation committee may specify.
SARs granted in tandem with options will become exercisable only
when, to the extent and on the conditions that the related
options are exercisable, and they will expire at the same time
the related options expire. The exercise of an option will
result in the immediate forfeiture of any related SAR to the
extent the option is exercised, and the exercise of a SAR
results in the immediate forfeiture of any related option to the
extent the SAR is exercised.

Upon exercise of a SAR, the grantee will receive
an amount in cash, shares of our common stock or our other
securities equal to the difference between the fair market value
of a share of common stock on the date of exercise and the
exercise price of the SAR or, in the case of a SAR granted in
tandem with options, of the option to which the SAR relates,
multiplied by the number of shares as to which the SAR is
exercised. Unless otherwise provided in the grantee’s grant
agreement, each SAR will be subject to the same termination and
forfeiture provisions as the stock options described above.

Restricted Stock.

Under the long-term incentive plan, the compensation committee
may award restricted stock in the amounts that it determines in
its discretion. Each grant of restricted stock will be evidenced
by a grant agreement, which will specify the applicable
restrictions on such shares and the duration of the restrictions
(which will generally be at least six months). A grantee will be
required to pay us at least the aggregate par value of any
shares of restricted stock within ten days of the grant, unless
the shares are treasury shares. Unless otherwise provided in the
grantee’s grant agreement, each unit or share of restricted
stock will be subject to the same termination and forfeiture
provisions as the stock options described above.

Performance Awards.

Under the long-term incentive plan, the compensation committee
may grant performance awards contingent upon achievement by the
grantee, us or any of our divisions of specified performance
criteria, such as return on equity, over a specified performance
cycle, as determined by the compensation committee. Performance
awards may include specific dollar-value target awards;
performance



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

units, the value of which will be determined by
the compensation committee at the time of issuance; and/or
performance shares, the value of which will be equal to the fair
market value of common stock. The value of a performance award
may be fixed or may fluctuate based on specified performance
criteria. A performance award may be paid out in cash, shares of
our common stock or our other securities.

A grantee must be a director, officer or employee
of, or otherwise perform services for, us at the end of the
performance cycle in order to be entitled to payment of a
performance award issued in respect of such cycle, provided that
unless otherwise provided in the grantee’s grant agreement,
each performance award will be subject to the same termination
and forfeiture provisions as the stock options described above.

Deferred Stock
Units.

Under the long-term incentive
plan, the compensation committee may grant deferred stock units
from time to time in its discretion. A deferred stock unit will
entitle the grantee to receive the fair market value of one
share of common stock at the end of the deferral period, which
will be no less than one year. The payment of the value of
deferred stock units may be made by us in shares of our common
stock, cash or both. If a grantee ceases to be a director,
officer or employee of, or otherwise perform services for, us
upon his or her death prior to the end of the deferral period,
the grantee will receive payment of his or her deferred stock
units which would have matured or been earned at the end of the
deferral period as if the deferral period has ended as of the
date of his or her death. In the event of a termination due to
disability or retirement prior to the end of the deferral
period, the grantee will receive payment of his or her deferred
stock units at the end of the deferral period. If a grantee
ceases to be a director, officer or employee of, or otherwise
perform services for, us for any other reason, his or her
unvested deferred stock units will immediately be forfeited.
Upon a change in control in NRG Energy, a grantee will receive
payment of his or her deferred stock units as if the deferral
period has ended as of the date of the change in control.

Dividend Equivalent
Rights.

Under the long-term incentive
plan, the compensation committee may grant a dividend equivalent
right entitling the grantee to receive amounts equal to all or
any portion of the dividends that would be paid on shares of our
common stock covered by an award if those shares had been
delivered to the grantee pursuant to the award, subject to terms
and conditions as the committee may specify.

Vesting, Withholding Taxes and Transferability
of All Awards.

The terms and
conditions of each award made under the long-term incentive
plan, including vesting requirements, will be set forth
consistent with the plan in a written agreement with the
grantee. Except in limited circumstances and unless the
compensation committee determines otherwise, no award under the
long-term incentive plan may vest and become exercisable within
six months of the date of grant.

Unless the compensation committee determines
otherwise, a participant may elect to deliver shares of common
stock, or to have us withhold shares of common stock otherwise
issuable upon exercise of an option or a SAR or deliverable upon
grant or vesting of restricted stock or the receipt of common
stock, in order to satisfy our tax withholding obligations in
connection with any exercise, grant or vesting.

Unless the compensation committee determines
otherwise, no award made under the long-term incentive plan will
be transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution, and each option, SAR or performance award may be
exercised only by the grantee or his or her executor,
administrator, guardian or legal representative, or by a family
member of the grantee if he or she has acquired the option, SAR
or performance award by gift or qualified domestic relations
order.

Amendment and Termination of the Long-Term
Incentive Plan.

The board of directors
or the compensation committee may amend or terminate the
long-term incentive plan in its discretion, except that no
amendment will become effective without prior approval of our
stockholders if approval is required by applicable law or
regulations, including any NASDAQ or stock exchange listing
requirements, if the amendment would remove a provision of the
long-term incentive plan which, without giving effect to the
amendment, is subject to shareholder approval or if the
amendment would directly or indirectly increase the

share limit of 4,000,000 shares. If not
otherwise terminated, the long-term incentive plan will
terminate on the tenth anniversary of the effective date of our
plan of reorganization, which was December 5, 2003.

In December 2003, we issued one stock option
grant for a total of 632,751 shares of common stock under
the Long-Term Incentive Plan. These options have a three-year
graded vesting schedule and become exercisable through the year
2006 at a price of $24.03. Total compensation expense under the
stock option grant is approximately $8.3 million.
Compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003
was approximately $0.4 million. Compensation expense for
the years ended December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005
and December 31, 2006 will be approximately
$4.9 million, $2.2 million and $0.8 million,
respectively. At December 31, 2003, no employee stock
options were exercisable. Stock option transactions were:

The following table summarizes information about
stock options outstanding at December 31, 2003:

The fair value of the stock option grant was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 2003.

In December 2003, we issued 173,394 restricted
stock units under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. These units will
fully vest in December 2006. Total compensation expense under
the restricted stock grant is approximately $4.2 million.
Compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003
was approximately $0.1 million. Compensation expense for
the years ended December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005
and



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2006 will be approximately
$1.4 million, $1.4 million and $1.3 million,
respectively. The weighted-average fair value of our restricted
stock units for 2003 is $24.03.

Note 19 — Earnings Per
Share

Basic earnings per common share were computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common
stock shares outstanding. Shares issued during the year are
weighted for the portion of the year that they were outstanding.
Shares of common stock granted to our officers and employees are
included in the computation only after the shares become fully
vested. Diluted earnings per share is computed in a manner
consistent with that of basic earnings per share while giving
effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were
outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of the
potential exercise of outstanding options to purchase shares of
common stock is calculated using the treasury stock method. The
reconciliation of basic earnings per common share to diluted
earnings per share is shown in the following table:



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The options to purchase 632,751 shares of
common stock at a price of $24.03 per share were not
included in the computation because the options’ exercise
price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares and therefore the effect would be anti-dilutive.

Note 20 — Segment
Reporting

NRG Energy conducts its business within six
segments: Independent Power Generation in North
America, Independent Power Generation outside North America
(Europe, Asia Pacific and Other Americas regions), Alternative
Energy and Thermal projects. Our revenues from majority owned
operations attributable to Europe and Asia Pacific primarily
relate to operations in the United Kingdom and Australia,
respectively. These segments are distinct components with
separate operating results and management structures in place.
The “Other” category includes operations that do not
meet the threshold for separate disclosure and corporate charges
(primarily interest expense) that have not been allocated to the
operating segments. All non U.S.A. operations are included in
the Europe, Asia Pacific and Other Americas segments.

— Income Taxes

For the year ended December 31, 2002 and the
period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003,
income taxes have been recorded on the basis that Xcel Energy

As of December 5, 2003, we provided a
valuation allowance of approximately $545.0 million to
account for potential limitations on utilization of U.S. and
foreign net operating loss carryforwards compared to a valuation
allowance of $494.5 million for the same period in 2002. We
also provided a valuation allowance for other U.S. and foreign

$578.7 million for the same period in 2002.

The effective income tax rates of continuing

2003 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% as
follows:

Income tax (benefit)/expense for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 was a tax
benefit of ($0.7) million which includes
($1.5) million benefit and $0.8 million expense of
U.S. and foreign taxes, respectively. The U.S. tax benefit
recorded for this period is the result of a state tax refund
received from Xcel Energy pursuant to the tax matters agreement.
The foreign tax expense for the period is due to earnings in the
foreign jurisdictions.

The income tax (benefit)/expense for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 was a tax
expense of $16.6 million compared to a tax benefit of
($164.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
During 2003, an additional valuation allowance of
$33 million was recorded against the deferred tax assets of
NRG West Coast as a result of its conversion from a corporation
to a single member limited liability company (a disregarded
entity for federal income tax purposes). Subsequent to the
conversion, NRG West Coast will no longer be taxed as an entity
separate from us.

As of December 31, 2003, our management
intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings from our foreign
operations. Accordingly, U.S. income taxes and foreign
withholding taxes were not provided on the earnings from our
foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2003,
December 5, 2003, and December 31, 2002 no U.S. income
tax benefit was provided on the cumulative amount of losses from
our foreign subsidiaries of $432.5 million,
$438.4 million, and $341.7 million, respectively.

Note 22 — Related Party
Transactions

While we were an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of Xcel Energy, we became an independent public
company upon our emergence from bankruptcy on December 5,
2003. We no longer have any material affiliation or relationship
with Xcel Energy. Prior to December 5, 2003, we had entered
into material transactions and agreements with Xcel Energy.
Certain material agreements and transactions existing during
2003 between NRG Energy and Xcel Energy are described below.

Operating Agreements

We have two agreements with Xcel Energy for the
purchase of thermal energy. Under the terms of the agreements,
Xcel Energy charges us for certain costs (fuel, labor, plant
maintenance, and auxiliary power) incurred by Xcel Energy to
produce the thermal energy. We paid Xcel Energy
$7.1 million, $8.2 million and $9.6 million in
2001, 2002 and the period January 1, 2003 to
December 5, 2003, respectively, under these agreements. One
of these agreements expired on December 31, 2002 and the
other expires on December 31, 2006.

We have a renewable 10-year agreement with Xcel
Energy, expiring on December 31, 2006, whereby Xcel Energy
agreed to purchase refuse-derived fuel for use in certain of its
boilers and we agree to pay Xcel Energy a burn incentive. Under
this agreement, we received $1.6 million, $1.2 million
and $1.4 million from Xcel Energy, and paid
$2.8 million, $3.3 million and $3.9 million to
Xcel Energy in 2001, 2002 and the period January 1, 2003 to
December 5, 2003, respectively.

Administrative Services and Other
    Costs

We had an administrative services agreement in
place with Xcel Energy. Under this agreement we reimbursed Xcel
Energy for certain overhead and administrative costs, including
benefits administration, engineering support, accounting, and
other shared services as requested by us. In addition, our
employees participated in certain employee benefit plans of Xcel
Energy as discussed in Note 23. We reimbursed Xcel Energy
in the amounts of $12.2 million, $21.2 million and
$7.3 million during 2001, 2002 and the period
January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, respectively,
under this agreement. This agreement was terminated
December 5, 2003.

Natural Gas Marketing and Trading
    Agreement

We had an agreement with e prime, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy, under which e prime
provided natural gas marketing and trading from time to time at
our request. We paid $19.2 million to e prime in 2002
related to these services. This agreement was terminated by
e prime on December 12, 2002 and a termination charge
of $0.3 million was paid in the period January 1, 2003
to December 5, 2003.

Amounts owed to Xcel Energy

Included in accounts payable affiliate is
approximately $42.9 of amounts owed to Xcel Energy at
December 31, 2002. While we were an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of Xcel Energy, we became an independent public
company upon our emergence from bankruptcy on December 5,
2003. As part of our restructuring, amounts owed to Xcel Energy
were forgiven and replaced by a $10.0 million promissory
note, which was outstanding as of December 6, 2003 and
December 31, 2003.

Xcel Settlement Agreement

Included in the company’s balance sheet is a
$640.0 million receivable from Xcel Energy. Under the terms
of the settlement agreement, payments were to be made in three
installments. As of December 6, 2003 and December 31,
2003, the balance was $640.0 million.

Note 23 — Benefit Plans and
Other Postretirement Benefits

Reorganized NRG

Substantially all of our employees participate in
defined benefit pension plans. We have initiated a new NRG
Energy noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan effective
January 1, 2004, with credit for service from
December 5, 2003. On December 5, 2003, we recorded a
liability of approximately $48.0 million to record our
accumulated benefit obligations at fair value. As of
December 31, 2003, there were no plan assets related to the
plans assumed from Xcel Energy. We have chosen the plan Trustee
and are in the preliminary stages of defining the investment
strategies for this plan.

In addition, we provide postretirement health and
welfare benefits (health care and death benefits) for certain
groups of our employees. Generally, these are groups that were
acquired in recent years and for whom prior benefits are being
continued (at least for a certain period of time or as required
by union contracts). Cost sharing provisions vary by acquisition
group and terms of any applicable collective bargaining
agreements.

Cash Flow

We expect to contribute approximately
$2.0 million to our NRG pension plan and our postretirement
health and welfare plan in 2004.

NRG Flinders Retirement Plan

Employees of NRG Flinders, a wholly owned
subsidiary of NRG Energy, are members of the multiemployer
Electricity Industry Superannuation Schemes, or
“EISS.” Members of the EISS make contributions from
their salary and the EISS Actuary makes an assessment of our
liability. As a result of adopting Fresh Start we recorded a
liability of approximately $13.8 million at
December 5, 2003, to record our accumulated benefit
obligation plan assets on the balance sheet at fair value. The
balance sheet includes a liability related to the Flinders
retirement plan of $12.3 million, $13.8 million and
$13.7 million at December 31, 2002, December 5,
2003 and December 31, 2003, respectively. NRG Flinders
contributed $5.8 million, $4.5 million and $0 for the
year ended December 31, 2002, the period January 1 through
December 5, 2003 and the period December 6 through
December 31, 2003, respectively.

The Superannuation Board is responsible for the
investment of Scheme assets. The assets may be invested in
government securities, shares, property and a variety of other
securities and the Board may appoint professional investment
managers to invest all or part of the assets on its behalf.

participate in defined contribution 401(K) plans. Our
contributions to these plans were approximately
$3.2 million, $4.6 million and $3.8 million in
2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.

Predecessor Company

Prior to December 5, 2003, all eligible
employees participated in Xcel Energy’s multiemployer
noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan, which was
formerly sponsored by NSP. We sponsored two defined benefit
plans that were merged into Xcel Energy’s plan as of
June 30, 2002. Benefits are generally based on a
combination of an employee’s years of service and earnings.
Some formulas also take into account Social Security benefits.
Plan assets principally consisted of the common stock of public
companies, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities.

Prior to December 5, 2003, certain former
NRG Energy retirees were covered under the legacy Xcel Energy
plan, which was terminated for non-bargaining employees retiring
after 1998 and for bargaining employees retiring after 1999.

As a result of our emergence from bankruptcy on
December 5, 2003, we are no longer owned by or affiliated
with Xcel Energy and our employees are no longer participants of
the Xcel Energy plans.

Participation in Xcel Energy, Inc.
    Pension Plan and Postretirement Medical Plan

We did not make contributions to the Xcel Energy
pension plan and postretirement plan in 2001, 2002 or 2003. The
balance sheet includes a liability related to the Xcel Energy
Pension Plan of $1.7 million for 2002. The balance sheet
also includes a liability related to the Xcel Energy
Postretirement Medical Plan of $2.2 million for 2002. As of
December 31, 2003, there are no liabilities recorded
related to the Xcel Energy plans. The liabilities associated
with these plans were settled as part of the NRG plan of
reorganization. The net annual periodic cost
(credit) related to our portion of the Xcel Energy pension
plan and postretirement plans totaled $(8.9) million,
$(8.9) million and $0.2 million for 2001, 2002 and
2003, respectively.

Prior to December 5, 2003, certain employees
also participated in Xcel Energy’s noncontributory defined
benefit supplemental retirement income plan. This plan is for
the benefit of certain qualifying executive personnel. Benefits
for this unfunded plan are paid out of operating cash flows. The
balance sheet includes a liability related to this plan of
$3.2 million and $0.4 million as of December 31,
2002 and 2003, respectively.

2003 Medicare Legislation

On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed
into law the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003, or “the Act.” The Act
expanded Medicare to include, for the first time, coverage for
prescription drugs. This coverage is generally effective
January 1, 2006. The execution of this new legislation had
no significant impact on our statement of financial position or
results of operation as of

Note 24 — Commitments and
Contingencies

Operating Lease Commitments

We lease certain of our facilities and equipment
under operating leases, some of which include escalation
clauses, expiring on various dates through 2023. Rental expense
under these operating leases was $10.0 million, and
13.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2002, respectively and $12.2 million and $0.7 million
for the periods January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003 and December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003,
respectively. Future minimum lease commitments under these
leases for the years ending after December 31, 2003 are as
follows:

Capital Commitments

We anticipate funding our ongoing capital
requirements through committed debt facilities, operating cash
flows, and existing cash. Our capital expenditure program is
subject to continuing review and modification. The timing and
actual amount of expenditures may differ significantly based
upon plant operating history, unexpected plant outages, and
changes in the regulatory environment, and the availability of
cash.

NRG FinCo Settlement

In May 2001, our wholly-owned subsidiary, NRG
FinCo, entered into a $2.0 billion revolving credit
facility. The facility was established to finance the
acquisition, development and construction of power generating
plants located in the United States and to finance the
acquisition of turbines for such facilities. The facility
provided for borrowings of base rate loans and Eurocurrency
loans and was secured by mortgages and security agreements in
respect of the assets of the projects financed under the
facility, pledges of the equity interests in the subsidiaries or
affiliates of the borrower that own such projects, and by
guaranties from each such subsidiary or affiliate. The NRG FinCo
secured revolver was initially scheduled to mature on
May 8, 2006; however, due to defaults hereunder by NRG
FinCo and applicable guarantors, the lenders accelerated all
outstanding obligations on November 6, 2002. As of our
emergence, $1.1 billion was outstanding under the facility,
and there was an aggregate of approximately $58 million of
accrued but unpaid interest and commitment fees. Of this,
$842.0 million was allowed in unsecured claims under NRG
plan of reorganization, and was settled at the time of our
emergence. The remaining balance will be satisfied when the NRG
FinCo lenders exercise their perfected security interests in our
Nelson, Audrain and Pike projects. These project companies hold
assets with estimated fair market values of approximately
$55.2 million, $172.0 million and $48.0 million,
respectively. The amount of $55.2 million for Nelson
consists of a partially completed project. Since the Nelson
entity is currently in bankruptcy, we are recording the entity
as a cost method investment with the fair value of the assets
equaling the fair value of the obligation to the NRG FinCo
lenders. The Audrain project cost of $172.0 million
represents the fair value of the operating assets consisting of
property

plant and equipment. An offsetting liability of
$172.0 million was recorded as of Fresh Start to the NRG
FinCo lenders. The Pike entity holds a turbine with an estimated
fair value of approximately $48.0 million. Additionally, we
also recorded an equal liability of $48.0 million to the
NRG FinCo lenders. The obligations of Audrain and Pike totaling
$220.0 million is reflected on the balance sheet as other
bankruptcy settlement. We are in the process of marketing for
sale each of the Audrain, Pike, and Nelson projects on behalf of
the NRG FinCo lenders. The NRG FinCo lenders have authority
under their perfected security interest to accept or reject all
offers. As a result these entities are not reflected as a
discontinued operations. We believe we have no additional risk
of loss related to these entities.

In connection with our acquisition of the Audrain
facilities, we have recognized a capital lease on its balance
sheet within long-term debt in the amount of
$239.9 million, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. The
capital lease obligation is recorded at the net present value of
the minimum lease obligation payable. The lease terminates in
May 2023. During the term of the lease only interest payments
are due, no principal is due until the end of the lease. In
addition, we have recorded in notes receivable, an amount of
approximately $239.9 million, which represents its
investment in the bonds that the county of Audrain issued to
finance the project. During February 2004, we received a notice
of a waiver of a $24.0 million interest payment due on the
capital lease obligation. In connection with the transfer of the
security in the Audrain projects to NRG FinCo Lenders, the
Audrain entity will be liquidated resulting in the termination
of the lease obligation and the note receivable.

Environmental Regulatory
    Matters

The construction and operation of power projects
are subject to stringent environmental and safety protection and
land use laws and regulation in the United States. These laws
and regulations generally require lengthy and complex processes
to obtain licenses, permits and approvals from federal, state
and local agencies. If such laws and regulations become more
stringent and our facilities are not exempted from coverage, we
could be required to make extensive modifications to further
reduce potential environmental impacts.

Under various federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations, a current or previous owner
or operator of any facility, including an electric generating
facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases
or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or
petroleum products located at the facility, and may be held
liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property
damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs
incurred by the party in connection with any releases or
threatened releases. These laws, including the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
of 1986, impose liability without regard to whether the owner
knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and
courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict
(without fault) and joint and several. The cost of
investigation, remediation or removal of any hazardous or toxic
substances or petroleum products could be substantial. Although
we have been involved in on-site contamination matters, to date,
we have not been named as a potentially responsible party with
respect to any off-site waste disposal matter.

We strive to exceed the standards of compliance
with applicable environmental and safety regulations.
Nonetheless, we expect that future liability under or compliance
with environmental and safety requirements could have a material
effect on our operations or competitive position. It is not
possible at this time to determine when or to what extent
additional facilities or modifications of existing or planned
facilities will be required as a result of possible changes to
environmental and safety regulations, regulatory interpretations
or enforcement policies. In general, the effect of future laws
or regulations is expected to require the addition of pollution
control equipment or the imposition of restrictions on our
operations.

As part of acquiring existing generating assets,
we have inherited certain environmental liabilities associated
with regulatory compliance and site contamination. Often
potential compliance implementation plans are changed, delayed
or abandoned due to one or more of the following conditions:
(a) extended



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

negotiations with regulatory agencies, (b) a
delay in promulgating rules critical to dictating the design of
expensive control systems, (c) changes in
governmental/regulatory personnel, (d) changes in
governmental priorities or (e) selection of a less
expensive compliance option than originally envisioned.

West Coast Region

The Asset Purchase Agreements for the Long Beach,
El Segundo, Encina, and San Diego gas turbine generating
facilities provide that Southern California Edison and
San Diego Gas & Electric retain liability and
indemnify us for existing soil and groundwater contamination
that exceeds remedial thresholds in place at the time of
closing. Along with our business partner, we conducted
Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessments at
each of these sites for purposes of identifying such existing
contamination and provided the results to the sellers.
San Diego Gas & Electric has undertaken corrective
actions at the Encina and San Diego gas turbine generating
sites related to issues identified in these assessments,
although final government agency approval to certify
completeness of the corrective action has not yet been obtained.
While spills and releases of various substances have occurred at
many sites since establishing the historical baseline, all but
one has been remediated in accordance with existing laws. An
unquantified amount of soil contaminated by lubricating oil that
leaked from underground piping at the El Segundo Generating
Station has been allowed by the Regional Water Quality Control
Board to remain under the foundation of the Unit I
powerhouse until the building is demolished.

Our affiliates have incurred capital expenditures
at the Encina Generating Station to install Selective Catalytic
Reduction, or “SCR” emission control technology on all
five generating units. Units 4 & 5 were retrofitted
with SCRs during 2002; while Units 1, 2, and 3 were retrofitted
with SCRs in 2003. The cost to retrofit all five units totaled
approximately $42 million.

Eastern Region

Coal ash is produced as a by-product of coal
combustion at the Dunkirk, Huntley, and Somerset Generating
Stations. We attempt to direct its coal ash to beneficial uses.
Even so, significant amounts of ash are landfilled at on and
off-site locations. At Dunkirk and Huntley, ash is disposed at
landfills owned and operated by us. No material liabilities
outside the costs associated with closure, post-closure care and
monitoring are expected at these facilities. We maintain
financial assurance to cover costs associated with closure,
post-closure care and monitoring activities. In the past, we
have provided financial assurance via financial test and
corporate guarantee. As a result of our debt restructuring
process, we were required to re-establish financial assurance
via an instrument requiring complete collateralization of
closure and post-closure-related costs, such costs currently
estimated at approximately $5.9 million. We provided such
financial assurance via a trust fund established in this amount
on April 30, 2003.

We must also maintain financial assurance for
closing interim status RCRA facilities at the Devon, Middletown,
Montville and Norwalk Harbor Generating Stations. Previously, we
have provided financial assurance via financial test. As a
result of our debt restructuring process, we were required to
re-establish financial assurance via an instrument requiring
complete collateralization of closure and post-closure-related
costs, such costs currently estimated at approximately
$1.5 million. We provided such financial assurance via a
trust fund established in this amount on April 30, 2003.

Historical clean-up liabilities were inherited as
a part of acquiring the Somerset, Devon, Middletown, Montville,
Norwalk Harbor, Arthur Kill and Astoria Generating Stations. We
have recently satisfied clean-up obligations associated with the
Ledge Road property (inherited as part of the Somerset
acquisition). Site contamination liabilities arising under the
Connecticut Transfer Act at the Devon, Middletown, Montville and
Norwalk Harbor Stations have been identified and are currently
being refined as part of on-going site investigations. We do not
expect to incur material costs associated with completing the
investigations at these Stations or future work to cover and
monitor ash management areas pursuant to the Connecticut require-

ments. Remedial liabilities at the Arthur Kill
Generating Station have been established in discussions between
us and the New York State DEC and are expected to cost on
the order of $1.0 million. Remedial investigations are
on-going at the Astoria Generating Station. At this time, our
long-term cleanup liability at this site is not expected to
exceed $1.5 million.

We estimate that we will incur total
environmental capital expenditures of $79.7 million during
2004 through 2008 for the facilities in New York,
Connecticut and Massachusetts. These expenditures will be
primarily related to changes required to accommodate Power River
Basin coal at selected plants, landfill construction,
installation of NO

x

controls, installation of the
best technology available for minimizing environmental impacts
associated with impingement and entrainment of fish and larvae,
particulate matter control improvements, spill prevention
controls, and undertaking remedial actions. NRG Energy estimates
that it will incur in 2004 at all of its plants in the Northeast
Region approximately $23 million in capital expenditures
for plant modifications and upgrades required to comply with
environmental regulations.

As of December 31, 2003, we had recorded an
accrual of approximately $2.1 million to cover penalties
associated with historical opacity exceedances.

We are responsible for the costs associated with
closure, post-closure care and monitoring of the ash landfill
owned and operated by us on the site of the Indian River
Generating Station. No material liabilities outside such costs
are expected. Financial assurance to provide for closure and
post-closure-related costs is currently maintained by a trust
fund collateralized in the amount of approximately
$6.6 million.

We estimate that we will incur capital
expenditures of approximately $14.7 million during the
years 2004 through 2008 related to resolving environmental
concerns at the Indian River Generating Station. These concerns
include the expected closure of the existing ash landfill, the
construction of a new ash landfill nearby, the addition of
controls to reduce NO

x

emissions, fuel yard
modifications, and electrostatic precipitator refurbishments to
reduce opacity.

Central Region

Liabilities associated with closure, post-closure
care and monitoring of the ash ponds owned and operated on site
at the Big Cajun II Generating Station are addressed
through the use of a trust fund maintained by us (one of the
instruments allowed by the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality for providing financial assurance for expenses
associated with closure and post-closure care of the ponds). The
current value of the trust fund is approximately
$4.8 million and we are making annual payments to the fund
in the amount of about $116,000. See Note 14.

We estimate approximately $18 million of
capital expenditures will be incurred during the period 2004
through 2008 for the addition of NO

x

controls on
Units 1 and 2 of Big Cajun II. In addition, NRG Energy
estimates that it would incur up to $5 million to reduce
particulate matter emissions during start-up of Units 1 and 2 at
Big Cajun II.

NYISO Claims

In November 2002, the NYISO notified us of claims
related to New York City mitigation adjustments, general
NYISO billing adjustments and other miscellaneous charges
related to sales between November 2000 and October 2002. The
New York City mitigation adjustments totaled
$11.5 million. We did not contest that claim and it has
been fully reserved. The general NYISO billing adjustment issue
totaled $10.2 million and related to NYISO’s concern
that NRG would not have sufficient revenue to cover for
subsequent revisions to its energy market settlements. As of
December 31, 2003, the NYISO held $4.5 million in
escrow for such future settlement revisions.

Conectiv Agreement
    Termination

On November 8, 2002 Conectiv provided us
with a Notice of Termination of Transaction under the Master
Power Purchase and Sale Agreement, or “Master PPA”,
dated June 21, 2001. Under the Master PPA, which was
assumed by us in our acquisition of various assets from
Conectiv, we had been required to deliver 500 MW of
electrical energy around the clock at a specified price through
2005. In connection with the Conectiv acquisition, we recorded
as an out-of-market contract obligation for this contract. As a
result of the cancellation, we will lose approximately
$383.1 million in future contracted revenues. Also, in
conjunction with the terms of the Master PPA, we received from
Conectiv a termination payment in the amount of $955,000. At
December 31, 2002, the remaining unamortized balance of the
contract obligation was recognized as revenue. As a result,
during the fourth quarter approximately $50.7 million was
recognized as revenue.

Bill Lockyer, Attorney General, v. Dynegy, Inc.
et al.,

United States District
Court, Northern District of California, Case No. C-02-O1854
VRW; United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Case
No. 02-16619.

This action was filed in state court on
March 11, 2002 against us, Dynegy, Dynegy Power
Marketing, Inc., Xcel Energy, West Coast Power and four of
West Coast Power’s operating subsidiaries. Through our
subsidiary, NRG West Coast LLC, we are a 50 percent
beneficial owner with Dynegy of West Coast Power, which owns,
operates, and markets the power of California plants. Dynegy and
its affiliates and subsidiaries are responsible for gas
procurement and marketing and trading activities on behalf of
West Coast Power. It alleges that the defendants violated
California Business & Professions Code
§ 17200 by selling ancillary services to the Cal ISO,
and subsequently selling the same capacity into the spot market.
The California Attorney General seeks injunctive relief as well
as restitution, disgorgement and civil penalties.

On April 17, 2002, the defendants removed
the case to the United States District Court in
San Francisco. Thereafter, the case was transferred to
Judge Vaughn Walker, who is also presiding over various other
“ancillary services” cases brought by the California
Attorney General against other participants in the California
market, as well as other lawsuits brought by the Attorney
General against these other market participants. We have tolling
agreements in place with the Attorney General with respect to
such other proposed claims against us.

The Attorney General filed motions to remand,
which the defendants opposed in July of 2002. In an Order filed
in early September 2002, Judge Walker denied the remand motions.
The Attorney General has appealed that decision to the United
States Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit, and the appeal is
pending. The Attorney General also sought a stay of proceedings
in the district court pending the appeal, and this request was
also denied. In a lengthy opinion filed March 25, 2003,
Judge Walker dismissed the Attorney General’s action
against Dynegy and us with prejudice, finding it was barred by
the filed-rate doctrine and preempted by federal law. The
Attorney General filed a Notice of Appeal, and the appeal was
argued in August 2003 and also is pending.

Case
No. BC249705, Superior Court of California, Los Angeles
County (filed May 2, 2001).

All of West Coast Power’s operating
subsidiaries are defendants in at least one of these six
consolidated cases, which were all filed in late 2000 and 2001
in various state courts throughout California. They allege
unfair competition, market manipulation and price fixing. All
the cases were removed to the appropriate United States District
Courts, and were thereafter made the subject of a petition to
the Multi-District Litigation Panel (Case No. MDL 1405).
The cases were ultimately assigned to Judge Whaley. Judge Whaley
entered an order in 2001 remanding the cases to state court, and
thereafter the cases were coordinated pursuant to state court
coordination proceedings before a single judge in San Diego
Superior Court. Thereafter, Reliant Energy and Duke Energy filed
cross-complaints naming various Canadian, Mexican and United
States government entities. Some of these defendants once again
removed the cases to federal court, where they were again
assigned to Judge Whaley. The defendants filed motions to
dismiss and to strike under the filed-rate and federal
preemption theories, and the plaintiffs challenged the district
court’s jurisdiction and sought to have the cases remanded
to state court. In December 2002, Judge Whaley issued an opinion
finding that federal jurisdiction was absent in the district
court, and remanding the cases to state court. Duke Energy and
Reliant Energy then filed a notice of appeal with the Ninth
Circuit, and also sought a stay of the remand pending appeal.
The stay request was denied by Judge Whaley. On
February 20, 2003, however, the Ninth Circuit stayed the
remand order and accepted jurisdiction to hear the appeal of
Reliant Energy and Duke Energy on the remand order. We
anticipate that filed-rate/federal preemption pleading
challenges will be renewed once the remand appeal is decided.

include numerous industry participants unrelated to us, as well
as the operating subsidiaries established by West Coast Power
for each of its four plants: El Segundo Power, LLC; Long Beach

violations of the federal Sherman and Clayton Acts and
California’s Cartwright Act and Business and Professions
Code. In addition to naming West Coast Power and Dynegy the
complaint names numerous industry participants, as well as
“unnamed co-conspirators.” The complaint alleges that
defendants conspired to manipulate the spot price and basis
differential of natural gas with respect to the California
market allegedly enabling defendants to reap exorbitant and
illicit profits by gouging natural gas purchasers. Specifically,
the complaint alleges that defendants and their co-conspirators
employed a variety of false reporting techniques to manipulate
the published natural gas price indices. The complaint seeks
unspecified amounts of damages, including a trebling of
plaintiff’s and the putative class’s actual damages.
We are unable at this time to predict the outcome of this
dispute or the ultimate liability, if any, of West Coast Power.

California Investigations

FERC — California Market
    Manipulation

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has an
ongoing “Investigation of Potential Manipulation of
Electric and Natural Gas Prices,” which involves hundreds
of parties (including our affiliate, West Coast Power) and
substantial discovery. In June 2001, FERC initiated proceedings
related to California’s demand



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

for $8.9 billion in refunds from power
sellers who allegedly inflated wholesale prices during the
energy crisis. Hearings have been conducted before an
administrative law judge who issued an opinion in late 2002. The
administrative law judge stated that after assessing a refund of
$1.8 billion for “unjust and unreasonable” power
prices between October 2, 2000 and June 20, 2001,
power suppliers were owed $1.2 billion because the State
was holding funds owed to suppliers.

In August 2002, the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted a request by the
Electricity Oversight Board, the California Public Utilities
Commission and others, to seek out and introduce to FERC
additional evidence of market manipulation by wholesale sellers.
This decision resulted in FERC ordering an additional
100 days of discovery in the refund proceeding, and also
allowing the relevant time period for potential refund liability
to extend back an additional nine months, to January 1,
2000.

On December 12, 2002, FERC Administrative
Law Judge Birchman issued a Certification of Proposed Findings
on California Refund Liability in Docket No. EL00-95-045
et al., which determined the method for calculating the
mitigated energy market clearing price during each hour of the
refund period. On March 26, 2003, FERC issued an Order on
Proposed Findings on Refund Liability in Docket
No. EL00-95-045, or “Refund Order”, adopting, in
part, and modifying, in part, the Proposed Findings issued by
Judge Birchman on December 12, 2002. In the Refund Order,
FERC adopted the refund methodology in the Staff Final Report on
Price Manipulation in Western Markets issued contemporaneously
with the Refund Order in Docket No. PA02-2-000. This refund
calculation methodology makes certain changes to Judge
Birchman’s methodology, because of FERC Staff’s
findings of manipulation in gas index prices. This could
materially increase the estimated refund liability. The Refund
Order directed generators wanting to recover any fuel costs
above the mitigated market clearing price during the refund
period to submit cost information justifying such recovery
within 40 days of the issuance of the Refund Order, which
West Coast Power did. Dynegy and the West Coast Power entities
are currently engaged in settlement negotiations with FERC
Staff, the California Attorney General, the California Public
Utility Commission, the California Electricity Oversight Board,
PG&E, and Southern California Edison.

CFTC — Dynegy/ West Coast Power
    Natural Gas Futures Index Manipulation

On December 18, 2002, a Dynegy subsidiary,
Dynegy Marketing & Trade, or “DMT”, and West
Coast Power, collectively “the Respondents”, entered
into a consent Offer of Settlement and Order, “the Consent
Order”, with the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission,
or “CFTC.” The action is captioned In re Dynegy
Marketing & Trade and West Coast Power LLC, CFTC Docket
No. 03-03. The CFTC asserted various violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as well as CFTC regulations.

The CFTC alleged in the Consent Order that DMT
natural gas traders reported false natural gas trading
information, including price and volume information, to certain
industry publications that establish and publish indexes for
natural gas prices. The CFTC alleged that DMT submitted the
false information in an attempt to manipulate the indexes for
DMT’s benefit. The CFTC further alleged that DMT traders
directed other Dynegy personnel to report each of the same false
trades in the name of West Coast Power, as counterparty, in an
effort to lend credence to the trades’ validity. The
Respondents to the Consent Order did not admit or deny the
allegations or findings made by the CFTC, but agreed to an Offer
of Settlement, and agreed to pay a civil monetary fine of
$5 million. The Respondents also agreed to undertakings
regarding further cooperation with the CFTC and public
statements concerning the Consent Order. Dynegy agreed to pay
and be entirely responsible for the $5 million fine imposed
by the CFTC.

U.S. Attorney —
    San Francisco

According to press reports, the
U.S. Attorney in San Francisco has assembled an
“energy crisis” task force. While Dynegy received a
grand jury subpoena in November 2002, the scope and targets of
this investigation are unknown to us. We did not receive a
subpoena.

California State Senate Select
    Committee

This Committee, chaired by Senator Dunn,
subpoenaed records from us during the Summer of 2001. We
produced about 5,000 pages of documents; Dynegy produced a much
larger volume of documents. The Committee has apparently
concluded its activities without issuing any reports or findings.

CPUC

The CPUC continues to request data and documents
in several settings. First, it is one of the parties in the FERC
proceeding mentioned above. Second, inspectors have visited West
Coast Power plants, usually unannounced and usually immediately
following an unplanned outage. They have demanded documentation
concerning the reason for the outage. Third, the CPUC has
demanded documents to allow it to prepare “reports,”
one of which was issued in the fall of 2002, and another of
which was issued January 30, 2003. The FERC’s
above-referenced March 26 Refund Order undercut the
accuracy and reliability of these CPUC reports. Dynegy has made
extensive productions to the CPUC of plant-related materials as
well as trading data.

California Attorney General

In addition to the litigation it has undertaken
described above, the California Attorney General has undertaken
an investigation entitled “In the Matter of the
Investigation of Possibly Unlawful, Unfair, or Anti-Competitive
Behavior Affecting Electricity Prices in California.” In
this connection, the Attorney General has issued subpoenas to
Dynegy, served interrogatories on Dynegy and us, and informally
requested documents and interviews from Dynegy and Dynegy
employees as well as us and our employees. We responded to the
interrogatories in the summer of 2002, with the final set of
responses being served on September 3, 2002. We have also
produced a large volume of documentation relating to the West
Coast Power plants. In addition, our employees in California
have sat for informal interviews with representatives of the
Attorney General’s office. Dynegy employees have also been
interviewed.

On November 21, 2003, in conjunction with
confirmation of the NRG plan of reorganization, we reached an
agreement with the Attorney General and the State of California,
generally, whereby for purposes of distributions, if any, to be
made to the State of California under the NRG plan of
reorganization, the liquidated amount of any and all allowed
claims shall not exceed $1.35 billion in the aggregate. The
agreement neither affects our right to object to these claims on
any and all grounds nor admits any liability whatsoever. We
further agreed to waive any objection to the liquidation of
these claims in a non-bankruptcy forum having proper
jurisdiction.

Although any evaluation of the likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome or an estimate of the amount or range of
potential loss in the above-referenced private actions and
various investigations cannot be made at this time, we note that
the Gordon complaint alleges that the defendants, collectively,
overcharged California ratepayers during 2000 by
$4.0 billion. We know of no evidence implicating us in the
various private plaintiffs’ allegations of collusion. We
cannot predict the outcome of these cases and investigations at
this time.

recovery of amounts it claims are owing for congestion charges
under the terms of a SOS contract between the parties, dated
October 29, 1999. CL&P has served and filed its motion
for summary judgment to which PMI filed a response on
March 21, 2003. CL&P has withheld approximately
$30 million from amounts owed to PMI, claiming that it has
the right to offset those amounts under the contract. PMI has
counterclaimed seeking to recover those amounts, arguing among
other things that CL&P has no rights under the contract to
offset them. By reason of the previous bankruptcy stay, the
court has not ruled on the pending motion. On November 6,
2003, the parties filed a joint stipulation for relief from the
automatic stay in order to allow the proceeding to go forward.
PMI cannot estimate at this time the likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome in this matter, or the overall exposure for
congestion charges for the full term of the contract.

Connecticut Light & Power Company,

and PMI concerning which of party is responsible, under the
terms of the October 29, 1999 SOS contract, for costs
related to congestion and losses associated with the
implementation of standard market design, or “SMD-Related
Costs.” CL&P has withheld, in addition to the
$30 million discussed above, approximately $79 million
from amounts owed to PMI, claiming that it is entitled under the
contract to offset those additional amounts for SMD-Related
Costs. The parties have now reached a settlement, subject to
board approval, whereby CL&P will pay PMI $38.4 million
plus interest, and subject to adjustments and true-ups upon
final approval by FERC. The settlement agreement was filed with
FERC on March 3, 2004.

    Environmental Conservation v. Niagara Mohawk Power
    Corporation et al., United States District Court for the

    No. 02-CV-002S

In January 2002, the New York Department of
Environmental Conservation, or “DEC”, sued Niagara
Mohawk Power Corporation, or “NiMo”, and us in federal
court in New York. The complaint asserted that projects
undertaken at our Huntley and Dunkirk plants by NiMo, the former
owner of the facilities, required preconstruction permits
pursuant to the Clean Air Act and that the failure to obtain
these permits violated federal and state laws. In July, 2002, we
filed a motion to dismiss. On March 27, 2003, the court
dismissed the complaint against us with prejudice as to the
federal claims and without prejudice as to the state claims. It
is possible the state will appeal this dismissal to the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals. In the meantime, on December 31,
2003, the trial court granted the state’s motion to amend
the complaint to again sue us and various affiliates in this
same action in the federal court in New York, asserting
against us violations of operating permits and deficient
operating permits at the Huntley and Dunkirk plants. If the case
ultimately is litigated to an unfavorable outcome that could not
be addressed otherwise, we have estimated that the total
investment that would be required to install pollution control
devices could be as high as $300 million over a ten to
twelve-year period. We also could be found responsible for
payment of certain penalties and fines.

Huntley Power LLC, Dunkirk Power LLC and
    Oswego Power LLC

The DEC has alleged violations by the Huntley
Generating Station, the Dunkirk Generating Station and the
Oswego Generating Station with respect to opacity exceedances.
The above entities have been engaged in consent order
negotiations with the DEC relative to such opacity issues
affecting all three facilities since the plants were acquired.
In late February, 2004, a representative of each of the six
entities signed a proposed final version of the consent order,
which, if executed and thereby issued by the DEC, would quantify
the number of opacity exceedances at the three facilities
through the second quarter of 2003 and assess a cumulative
penalty of $1 million. In addition, among other provisions,
the consent order would establish stipulated penalties for
future violations of opacity requirements and of the consent
order and impose a Schedule of Compliance. In the event that the
consent order is not issued by DEC in the form in which it was
agreed to by the six entities and any subsequent negotiations
prove unsuccessful, it is not known what relief the DEC will
seek through an enforcement action and what the result of such
action will be.

Huntley Power LLC

On April 30, 2003, the Huntley Station
submitted a self-disclosure letter to the DEC reporting
violations of applicable sulfur in fuel limits, which had
occurred during 6 days in March 2003 at the chimney stack
serving Huntley Units 63-66. The Huntley Station self-disclosed
that the average sulfur emissions rates for those days had been
1.8 lbs/mm BTU, rather than the maximum allowance of 1.7 lbs/mm
BTU. NRG Huntley Operations discontinued use of Unit 65 (the
only unit utilizing the subject stack at the time) and has kept
the remaining three units off line until adherence with the
applicable standard is assured. On May 19, 2003, the DEC
issued Huntley Power LLC a Notice of Violation. Huntley Power
LLC has met with the DEC to discuss the circumstances
surrounding the event and the appropriate means of resolving the
matter. Huntley Power LLC does not know what relief the DEC will
seek through an enforcement action. Under applicable provisions
of the Environmental Conservation Law, the DEC asserts that it
may impose a civil penalty up to $10,000, plus an additional
penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each day that a violation
continues and may enjoin continuing violations.

On October 2, 2000, plaintiff NiMo commenced
this action against us to recover damages plus late fees, less
payments received through the date of judgment, as well as any
additional amounts due and owing, for electric service provided
to the Dunkirk Plant after September 18, 2000. Plaintiff
NiMo claims that we have failed to pay retail tariff amounts for
utility services commencing on or about June 11, 1999 and
continuing to September 18, 2000 and thereafter. Plaintiff
has alleged breach of contract, suit on account, violation of
statutory duty and unjust enrichment claims. On or about
October 23, 2000, we served an answer denying liability and
asserting affirmative defenses.

After proceeding through discovery, and prior to
trial, the parties and the court entered into a Stipulation and

This is the companion action filed by NiMo at
FERC, similarly asserting that NiMo is entitled to receive
retail tariff amounts for electric service provided to the
Huntley, Dunkirk and Oswego plants. On October 31, 2003,
the FERC Trial Staff, a party to the proceedings, filed a reply
brief in which it supported and agreed with each position taken
by our facilities. In short, the staff argued that our
facilities: (1) self-supply station power under the NYISO
tariff (which took effect on April 1, 2003) in any month
during which they produce more energy than they consume and, as
such, should not be assessed a retail rate; (2) are
connected only to transmission facilities and, as such, at most
should only pay NiMo a FERC-approved transmission rate; and
(3) should be allowed to net consumption and output even if
power is injected into the grid at a different point from which
it is drawn off. We are presently awaiting a ruling by FERC. At
this stage of the proceedings, we cannot estimate the likelihood
of success on this action. As noted above, the cumulative
potential loss could exceed $35 million.

In the Matter of Louisiana Generating, LLC,
    Adversary Proceeding No. 2002-1095 1-EQ on the docket of
    the Louisiana Division of Administrative Law

During 2000, DEQ issued a Part 70 Air Permit
modification to Louisiana Generating to construct and operate
two 240 MW natural gas-fired turbines. The Part 70 Air
Permit set emissions limits for the criteria air pollutants,
including NO

x

, based on the application of Best
Available Control Technology, or “BACT.” The BACT
limitation for NO

x

was based on the guarantees of the
manufacturer, Siemens-Westinghouse. Louisiana Generating sought
an interim emissions limit to allow Siemens-Westinghouse time to
install additional control equipment. To establish the interim
limit, DEQ issued a Compliance Order and Notice of Potential
Penalty, No. AE-CN-02-0022, on September 8, 2002,
which is, in part, subject to the referenced administrative
hearing. DEQ alleged that Louisiana Generating did not meet its
NO

x

emissions limit on certain days, did not conduct
all opacity monitoring and did not complete all record keeping
and certification requirements. Louisiana Generating intends to
vigorously defend certain claims and any future penalty
assessment, while also seeking an amendment of its limit for
NO

x

. An initial status conference was held with the
Administrative Law Judge and quarterly reports are being
submitted to that judge to describe progress, including
settlement and amendment of the limit. In late February 2004, we
timely submitted to the DEQ an amended BACT analysis and amended
Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permit
application to amend the NO

x

limit. In addition,
Louisiana Generating may assert breach of warranty claims
against the manufacturer. With respect to the administrative
action described above, at this time we are unable to predict
the eventual outcome of this matter or the potential loss
contingencies, if any, to which we may be subject.

NRG Sterlington Power, LLC

During 2002, NRG Sterlington conducted a review
of the Sterlington Power Facility’s Part 70 Air Permit
obtained by the facility’s former owner and operator, Koch
Power, Inc. Koch had outlined a plan to install eight
25 MW capacity turbines to reach a 200 MW capacity
limit in the permit. Due to the inability of several



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

units to reach their nameplate capacity, Koch
determined that it would need additional units to reach the
electric output target. In August 2000, NRG Sterlington acquired
the remaining interests in the facility not originally held on a
passive basis and sought the transfer of the Part 70 Air Permit
along with a modification to incorporate two 17.5 MW
turbines installed by Koch and to increase the total number of
turbines to ten. The permit modification was issued
February 13, 2002. During further review, NRG Sterlington
determined that a ninth unit had been installed prior to
issuance of the permit modification. In keeping with its
environmental policy, it disclosed this matter to DEQ in April,
2002. NRG Sterlington provided to DEQ additional information
during July 2002. A Consolidated Compliance Order &
Notice of Potential Penalty, No. AE-CN-01-0393, was issued
by DEQ on September 10, 2003, wherein DEQ formally alleged
that NRG Sterlington did not complete all certification
requirements, and installed a ninth unit prior to issuance of
its permit modification. We met with DEQ on November 19,
2003 to discuss mitigating circumstances and a settlement has
been agreed to between the parties. Under the settlement
agreement, without admitting any liability, NRG Sterlington has
agreed to pay DEQ the sum of $4,500. The agreement is subject to
a public comment period and review by the Louisiana attorney
general.

United States Environmental Protection
    Agency Request for Information under Section 114 of the
    Clean Air Act

On January 27, 2004, Louisiana Generating,
LLC and Big Cajun II received a request for information
under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act from the United
States Environmental Protection Agency, or “EPA”,
seeking information primarily relating to physical changes made
at Big Cajun II in 1994 and 1995 by the predecessor owner
of that facility. Louisiana Generating, LLC and Big
Cajun II intend to respond to the EPA request in an
appropriate and cooperative manner. At the present time, we
cannot predict the probable outcome in this matter.

General Electric Company and Siemens
    Westinghouse Turbine Purchase Disputes

We and/or our affiliates have entered into
several turbine purchase agreements with affiliates of General
Electric Company, or “GE” and Siemens Westinghouse
Power Corporation, or “Siemens.” GE and Siemens have
notified us that we are in default under certain of those
contracts, terminated such contracts, and demanded that we pay
the termination fees set forth in such contracts. GE’s
claim amounts to $120 million and Siemens’
approximately $45 million in cumulative termination
charges. We cannot estimate the likelihood of unfavorable
outcomes in these disputes.

Itiquira Energetica, S.A.

Our indirectly controlled Brazilian project
company, Itiquira Energetica S.A., the owner of a
156 MW hydro project in Brazil, is currently in arbitration
with the former EPC contractor for the project, Inepar
Industria e Construcoes, or “Inepar.” The dispute was
commenced by Itiquira in September of 2002 and pertains to
certain matters arising under the former EPC contract. Itiquira
principally asserts that Inepar breached the contract and caused
damages to Itiquira by (i) failing to meet milestones for
substantial completion; (ii) failing to provide adequate
resources to meet such milestones; (iii) failing to pay
subcontractors amounts due; and (iv) being insolvent.
Itiquira’s arbitration claim is for approximately
U.S. $40 million. Inepar has asserted in the
arbitration that Itiquira breached the contact and caused
damages to Inepar by failing to recognize events of force
majeure as grounds for excused delay and extensions of scope of
services and material under the contract. Inepar’s damage
claim is for approximately U.S. $10 million. The
parties submitted their respective statements of claims,
counterclaims and responses, and a preliminary arbitration
hearing was held on March 21, 2003. In lieu of taking
expert testimony at hearing, the court of arbitration ordered an
expert investigation process to cover technical and accounting
issues. We anticipate that the final report from the expert
investigation process will be delivered to the court of
arbitration in the last week of March, 2004. After reviewing the
final report, the court of arbitration may, if it deems it
necessary,



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

require expert testimony on technical and
accounting issues, which we anticipate would commence on
approximately May 15, 2004. We expect the arbitration panel
to issue its decision no later than July 31, 2004. We
cannot estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in this
dispute.

CFTC Trading Inquiry

On June 17, 2002, the CFTC served Xcel
Energy, on behalf of its affiliates, which then included us and
PMI, with a subpoena requesting certain information regarding
“round trip” or “wash” trading and general
trading practices in its investigation of several energy trading
companies. The CFTC now appears focused on possible efforts by
traders to submit false reports to index publications in an
attempt to manipulate the index. In January, 2004, the CFTC and
Xcel Energy’s subsidiary e prime, inc., reached a
settlement in connection with this investigation, which included
the payment of a $16 million fine and the entry of a cease
and desist order. Other industry participants that have settled
with the CFTC have paid fines of between $1 million and
$30 million and have agreed to the terms of cease and
desist orders. The CFTC has requested additional related
information from us and has subpoenaed to appear for testimony a
number of our present and former employees. We have sought to
cooperate with the CFTC and have submitted materials responsive
to the CFTC’s requests, while vigorously denying that we
engaged in any improper conduct. We cannot at this time predict
the outcome or financial impact of this investigation.

Additional Litigation

In addition to the foregoing, we are parties to
other litigation or legal proceedings, which may or may not be
material. There can be no assurance that the outcome of such
matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations.

Disputed Claims Reserve

As part of the NRG plan of reorganization, we
have funded a disputed claims reserve for the satisfaction of
certain general unsecured claims that were disputed claims as of
the effective date of the plan. Under the terms of the plan, to
the extent such claims are resolved now that we have emerged
from bankruptcy, the claimants will be paid from the reserve on
the same basis as if they had been paid out in the bankruptcy.
That means that their allowed claims will be reduced to the same
recovery percentage as other creditors would have received and
will be paid in pro rata distributions of cash and common stock.
We believe we have funded the disputed claims reserve is at a
sufficient level to settle the remaining unresolved proofs of
claim we received during the bankruptcy proceedings. However, to
the extent the aggregate amount of these payouts of disputed
claims ultimately exceeds the amount of the funded claim
reserve, we are obligated to provide additional cash and common
stock to the disputed claims reserve. We will continue to
monitor our obligation as the disputed claims are settled.
However, if excess funds remain in the disputed claims reserve
after payment of all obligations, such amounts will be
reallocated to the Creditor Pool. We have provided our common
stock and cash contribution to an escrow agent to complete the
distribution and settlement process. Since we have surrendered
control over the common stock and cash provided to the disputed
claims reserve, we recognized the issuance of the common stock
as of December 6, 2003 and removed the cash amounts from
our balance sheet. Similarly, we have moved the obligations
relevant to the claims from our balance sheet when the common
stock was issued and cash contributed.

In conjunction with confirmation of the NRG plan
of reorganization, we reached an agreement with the Attorney
General and the State of California that limits the potential
maximum amount of its claims, if any. Under the NRG plan of
reorganization, the liquidated amount of any allowed claims
shall not exceed $1.35 billion in total. The agreement
neither affects our right to object to these claims on any
grounds nor admits any liability. We further agreed to waive any
objection to the liquidation of these claims in a non-bankruptcy
forum having proper jurisdiction. Although we cannot make at
this time any evaluation of the



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or an
estimate of the amount or range of potential loss in the private
actions and various investigations, we know of no evidence
implicating us in the various private plaintiffs’
allegations of collusion. We cannot predict the outcome of these
cases and investigations at this time.

Note 25 — Cash Flow
Information

Detail of supplemental disclosures of cash flow
and non-cash investing and financing information was:

Reorganization Cash Payments and
Receipts

Cash Receipts

During the period May 14, 2003 through
December 31, 2003, we received $1.1 million of
interest income on cash balances. No such amounts were received
during the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003.

Cash Payments

Professional fees

During the period May 14, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 and December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003, we made cash payments for professional
fees to our financial and legal advisors of $33.5 million
and $14.4 million, respectively.

Refinancing activities

We made cash payments of $1.3 billion
related to the repayment of NRG Northeast Generating and NRG
South Central Generating’s debt, including accrued interest
upon their emergence from bankruptcy on December 23, 2003
with proceeds from our recently completed corporate level
refinancing. We also made cash payments of $19.6 million
for a prepayment settlement upon our early payment of the NRG
Northeast Generating and NRG South Central Generating debt.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND

Creditor payments

Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we made cash
payments to our creditors in the amounts of $518.6 million
during the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003.

Note 26 — Guarantees

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 45,

“Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.”

The
initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this
interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002,
irrespective of the guarantor’s fiscal year-end. The
disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements
of interim or annual periods ending after December 15,
2002. The interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by
a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about
its obligations under guarantees. The interpretation also
clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a
liability by a guarantor at the inception of the guarantee for
the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing the
guarantee.

In connection with the adoption of Fresh Start,
all outstanding guarantees were considered new; accordingly we
applied the provisions of FIN 45 to all of those
guarantees. Each guarantee was reviewed for the requirement to
recognize a liability at inception. As a result, we recorded a
$15.0 million liability, which is included in other
long-term liabilities.

We are directly liable for the obligations of
certain of our project affiliates and other subsidiaries
pursuant to guarantees relating to certain of their
indebtedness, equity and operating obligations. In addition, in
connection with the purchase and sale of fuel, emission credits
and power generation products to and from third parties with
respect to the operation of some of our generation facilities in
the United States, we may be required to guarantee a portion of
the obligations of certain of our subsidiaries. Additionally, as
a result of the downgrades of our unsecured debt ratings, we
were required to but failed to post cash collateral in the
amount of $71.4 million as of December 31, 2003. At
the time of the January 6, 2004 restructuring of the
project financing of NRG Peaker Finance Co., LLC, this equity
contribution requirement was extinguished and was replaced with
a $36.2 million NRG Energy letter of credit, for the
benefit of the secured parties in the Peaker financing, as well
as other provisions of the restructuring.

As of December 31, 2002, December 6,
2003 and December 31, 2003, our obligations pursuant to our
guarantees of the performance, equity and indebtedness
obligations of our subsidiaries were as follows:

As of December 6, 2003 and December 31,
2003, the nature and details of our guarantees were as follows:



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NRG ENERGY, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Recourse provisions for each of the guarantees
above are to the extent of their respective liability.
Additionally, no assets are held as collateral for any of the
above guarantees.

As of December 6, 2003 and December 31,
2003, the nature and details of our unmet cash collateral
obligations were as follows:

Note 27 — Sales to Significant
Customers

Reorganized NRG

For the period from December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003, we derived approximately 35.5% of our
total revenues from majority-owned operations from two
customers: NYISO (24.1%) and ISO New England (11.4%).

Predecessor Company

For the period from January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003, sales to one customer
(NYISO) accounted for 30.5% of our total revenues from
majority owned operations. During 2002, sales to one customer
(NYISO) accounted for 23.7% of our total revenues from
majority owned operations in 2002. During 2001, sales to two
customers accounted for 33.6% (NYISO) and 17.5%
(Connecticut Light and Power Co.) of our total revenues from
majority owned operations in 2001.

Note 28 — Jointly Owned
Plants

Big Cajun II Unit 3

On March 31, 2000, we acquired a 58%
interest in the Big Cajun II, Unit 3 generation plant.
Entergy Gulf States owns the remaining 42%. Big Cajun II,
Unit 3 is operated and maintained by Louisiana Generating
pursuant to a joint ownership participation and operating
agreement. Under this agreement, Louisiana Generating and
Entergy Gulf States are each entitled to their ownership
percentage of the hourly net electrical output of Big

approximately 3.7% interest in both the Keystone and Conemaugh
coal-fired generating facilities. The Keystone and Conemaugh
facilities are located near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and are
jointly owned by a consortium of energy companies. We purchased
our interest from Conectiv, Inc. Keystone and Conemaugh are
operated by GPU Generation, Inc., which sold its assets and
operating responsibilities to Sithe Energies. Keystone and
Conemaugh both consist of two operational coal-fired steam power
units with a combined net output of 1,700 MW, four diesel
units with a combined net output of 11 MW and an on-site
landfill. The units are operated pursuant to a joint ownership
participation and operating agreement. Under this agreement each
joint owner is entitled to its ownership ratio of the net
available output of the facility. All fixed costs are shared in
proportion to the ownership interests. All variable costs are
incurred in proportion to the energy delivered to the owners.
Our income statement includes our share of all fixed and
variable costs of operating the facilities.
