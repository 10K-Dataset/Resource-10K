NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

INDEX



PART I

Item 1 —

Business

General

NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG Energy or the Company) is
an energy company, primarily engaged in the ownership and
operation of power generation facilities and the sale of energy,
capacity and related products in the United States and
internationally. NRG Energy is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel
Energy Inc. (Xcel Energy), Xcel Energy directly owns six utility
subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in
12 states. Xcel Energy also owns or has interest in a
number of non-regulated businesses, the largest of which is NRG
Energy.

Since the early 1990’s, NRG Energy pursued a
strategy of growth through acquisitions. Starting in 2000, NRG
Energy added the development of new construction projects to
this strategy. This strategy required significant capital, much
of which was satisfied primarily with third party debt. As of
December 31, 2002, NRG Energy had approximately
$9.4 billion of debt on its balance sheet at the corporate
and project levels. Due to a number of reasons, including the
overall down-turn in the energy industry, NRG Energy’s
financial condition has deteriorated significantly. As a direct
consequence, in 2002 NRG Energy entered into discussions with
its creditors in anticipation of a comprehensive restructuring
in order to become a more stable and conservatively capitalized
company. In connection with its restructuring efforts, it is
likely that NRG Energy (and certain of its subsidiaries) will
file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. If NRG Energy
were to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Xcel
Energy’s equity ownership would most likely be eliminated
and a large number of NRG Energy’s creditors’ claims
would be impaired.

On March 26, 2003, Xcel Energy announced
that its board of directors had approved a tentative settlement
agreement with holders of most of NRG Energy’s long-term
notes and the steering committee representing NRG’s bank
lenders. The settlement is subject to certain conditions,
including the approval of at least a majority in dollar amount
of the NRG Energy bank lenders and long-term noteholders and
definitive documentation. There can be no assurance that such
approvals will be obtained. The terms of the settlement call for
Xcel Energy to make payments to NRG Energy over the next
13 months totaling up to $752 million for the benefit of
NRG Energy’s creditors in consideration for their waiver of
any existing and potential claims against Xcel Energy. Under the
settlement, Xcel Energy will make the following payments: (i)
$350 million at or shortly following the consummation of a
restructuring of NRG Energy’s debt. It is expected this
payment would be made prior to year-end 2003; (ii)
$50 million on January 1, 2004. At Xcel Energy’s
option, it may fill this requirement with either cash or Xcel
Energy common stock or any combination thereof; and (iii)
$352 million in April 2004.

NRG Energy is restructuring its operations to
become a domestic based owner-operator of a fuel-diverse
portfolio of electric generation facilities engaged in the sale
of energy, capacity and related products. NRG Energy is working
toward this goal by selective divestiture of non-core assets,
consolidation of management, reorganization and redirection of
power marketing philosophy and activities and an overall
financial restructuring that will improve liquidity and reduce
debt. NRG Energy does not anticipate any new significant
acquisitions or construction, and instead will focus on
operational performance and asset management. NRG Energy has
already made significant reductions in expenditures, business
development activities and personnel. Power sales, fuel
procurement and risk management will remain a key strategic
element of NRG Energy’s operations. NRG Energy’s
objective will be to optimize the fuel input and the energy
output of its facilities within an appropriate risk and
liquidity profile.

NRG Energy was incorporated as a Delaware
corporation on May 29, 1992. Its headquarters and principal
executive offices are located at 901 Marquette Avenue,
Suite 2300, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402. NRG Energy’s
telephone number is (612) 373-5300. NRG Energy and Xcel
Energy are required to file periodic reports and other documents
with the SEC. The public may read and copy the materials filed
with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at
450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20549. The public may
also obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference
Room by calling the SEC at



1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, electronic copies of
these periodic filings are available through the
Commission’s web site at www.sec.gov.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity Issues — Current Status
    and Chain of Events

In December 2001, Moody’s Investor Service
(Moody’s) placed NRG Energy’s long-term senior
unsecured debt rating on review for possible downgrade. In
response, Xcel Energy and NRG Energy put into effect a plan to
preserve NRG Energy’s investment grade rating and improve
its financial condition. This plan included financial support to
NRG Energy from Xcel Energy; marketing certain NRG Energy assets
for sale; canceling and deferring capital spending; and reducing
corporate expenses.

In response to a possible downgrade, during 2002,
Xcel Energy contributed $500 million to NRG Energy, and NRG
Energy and its subsidiaries sold assets and businesses that
provided NRG Energy in excess of $286 million in cash and
eliminated approximately $432.0 million in debt. NRG Energy
also cancelled or deferred construction of approximately
3900 MW of new generation projects. On July 26, 2002,
Standard & Poors’ (S&P) downgraded NRG
Energy’s senior unsecured bonds to below investment grade,
and three days later Moody’s also downgraded NRG
Energy’s senior unsecured debt rating to below investment
grade. Since July 2002, NRG Energy senior unsecured debt, as
well as the secured NRG Northeast Generating LLC bonds, the
secured NRG South Central Generating LLC bonds and secured LSP
Energy (Batesville) bonds were downgraded multiple times. After
NRG Energy failed to make payments due under certain unsecured
bond obligations on September 16, 2002, both Moody’s
and S&P lowered their ratings on NRG Energy’s and its
subsidiaries’ unsecured bonds once again. Currently, NRG
Energy’s unsecured bonds carry a rating of between CCC and
D at S&P and between Ca and C at Moody’s, depending on
the specific debt issue.

As a result of the downgrade of NRG Energy’s
credit rating, declining power prices, increasing fuel prices,
the overall down-turn in the energy industry and the overall
down-turn in the economy, NRG Energy has experienced severe
financial difficulties. These difficulties have caused NRG
Energy to, among other things, miss scheduled principal and
interest payments due to its corporate lenders and bondholders,
prepay for fuel and other related delivery and transportation
services and provide performance collateral in certain
instances. NRG Energy has also recorded asset impairment charges
of approximately $3.1 billion, related to various operating
projects, as well as projects that were under construction which
NRG Energy has stopped funding.



NRG Energy and its subsidiaries have failed to
timely make the following interest and/or principal payments on
its indebtedness:

These missed payments may have also resulted in
cross-defaults of numerous other non-recourse and limited
recourse debt instruments of NRG Energy. In addition, the
following issues have been accelerated, rendering the debt
immediately due and payable: on November 6, 2002, lenders
to NRG Energy accelerated the approximately $1.1 billion of
debt under the construction revolver facility; on
November 21, 2002, the bond trustee, on behalf of
bondholders, accelerated the approximately $750 million of
debt under the NRG South Central Generating, LLC facility; and
on February 27, 2003, ABN Amro, as administrative agent,
accelerated the approximately $1.0 billion corporate
revolver financing facility.

Since September, the following payments were
made: on December 10, 2002, $16.0 million in interest,
principal, and swap payments were made from restricted cash
accounts in relation to the $325,000,000 Series A Floating
Rate Senior Secured Bonds due 2019, issued by NRG Peaker Finance
Company LLC (the “Peaker financing facility”); on
December 27, 2002, NRG Northeast made the
$24.7 million interest payment due on the NRG Northeast
bonds but failed to make the $53.5 million principal
payment; in January 2003, the South Central Generating
bondholders unilaterally withdrew $35.6 million from a
restricted revenue account relating to the September 15,
2002 interest payment and fees; and on March 17, 2003 South
Central bondholders were paid $34.4 million due in relation
to the March semi-annual interest payment, but the
$12.8 million principal payment was deferred.



In addition to the payment defaults described
above, prior to the downgrades, many corporate guarantees and
commitments of NRG Energy and its subsidiaries required that
they be supported or replaced with letters of credit or cash
collateral within 5 to 30 days of a ratings downgrade below
Baa3 or BBB- by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s,
respectively. As a result of the downgrades on July 26 and
July 29, NRG Energy received demands to post collateral
aggregating approximately $1.1 billion.

On August 19, 2002, NRG Energy executed a
Collateral Call Extension Letter (CCEL) with various
secured project lender groups in which the banks agreed to
extend until September 13, 2002, the deadline by which NRG
Energy was to post its approximately $1.0 billion of cash
collateral in connection with certain bank loan agreements.

Effective as of September 13, 2002, NRG
Energy and these various secured project lenders entered into a
Second Collateral Call Extension Letter (Second CCEL) that
extended the deadline until November 15, 2002. Under the
Second CCEL, NRG Energy agreed to submit to the lenders a
comprehensive restructuring plan. NRG Energy submitted this plan
on November 4, 2002 and continues to work with its lenders
and advisors on an overall restructuring of its debt (see
further discussion below). The November 15, 2002 deadline
of the second CCEL passed without NRG Energy posting the
required collateral. NRG Energy and the secured project lenders
continue to work toward a plan of restructuring.

In August 2002, NRG Energy retained financial and
legal restructuring advisors to assist its management in the
preparation of a comprehensive financial and operational
restructuring. NRG Energy and its advisors have been meeting
regularly to discuss restructuring issues with an ad hoc
committee of its bondholders and a steering committee of its
bank lenders (the Ad Hoc Creditors Committees).

To aid in the design and implementation of a
restructuring plan, in the fall of 2002, NRG Energy prepared a
comprehensive business plan and forecast. Anticipating that NRG
Energy’s creditors will own all or substantially all of NRG
Energy’s equity interests after implementing the
restructuring plan, any plans and efforts to integrate NRG
Energy’s business operations with those of Xcel Energy were
terminated. Using commodity, emission and capacity prices
provided by an independent energy consulting firm to develop
forecasted cash flow information, management concluded that the
forecasted free cash flow available to NRG Energy after
servicing project level obligations will be insufficient to
service recourse debt obligations at the NRG Energy corporate
level. Based on that forecast, it is anticipated that NRG Energy
will remain in default of the various corporate level debt
obligations discussed more fully herein.

Based on this information and in consultation
with Xcel Energy and its financial and legal restructuring
advisors, NRG Energy prepared a comprehensive financial
restructuring plan. In November 2002, NRG Energy and Xcel Energy
presented the plan to the Ad Hoc Creditors Committees. The
restructuring plan has served as a basis for continuing
negotiations between the Ad Hoc Creditors Committees, NRG Energy
and Xcel Energy related to a consensual plan of reorganization
for NRG Energy. Negotiations have progressed substantially since
the initial plan was presented in November. If an agreement to a
consensual plan of reorganization is negotiated and NRG Energy
is unable to effectuate the restructuring through an exchange
offer or other non-bankruptcy mechanism, it is highly probable
that such plan would be implemented through the commencement of
a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. There can be
no assurance that NRG Energy’s creditors, including, but
not limited to the Ad Hoc Committees, will agree to the terms of
the consensual plan of reorganization currently being
negotiated. In addition, there can be no guarantee that lenders
will not seek to enforce their remedies under the various loan
agreements, provided that any such attempted enforcement would
be subject to the automatic stay and other relevant provisions
of the bankruptcy code. The commencement of a voluntary
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding without a consensual plan
of reorganization would increase the possibility of a prolonged
bankruptcy proceeding.

On November 22, 2002, five former NRG Energy
executives filed an involuntary Chapter 11 petition against
NRG Energy in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Minnesota. Under provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, NRG Energy
has the full authority to continue to operate its business as if
the involuntary petition had not been filed unless and until a
court hearing on the validity of the involuntary petition is
resolved adversely to NRG Energy. On December 16, 2002, NRG
Energy responded to the involuntary petition, contesting the
petitioners’ claims and filing a motion to dismiss the
case. On February 19, 2003, NRG Energy



announced that it had reached a settlement with
the petitioners. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District
of Minnesota will hear NRG Energy’s motion to consider the
settlement and/or dismiss the involuntary petition. Two of NRG
Energy’s creditors have objected to the motion to dismiss.
There can be no assurance that the court will dismiss the
involuntary petition. The Bankruptcy Court has discretion in the
review of the settlement agreement. There is a risk that the
Bankruptcy Court may, among other things, reject the settlement
agreement or enter an order for relief under Chapter 11.

On March 26, 2003, Xcel Energy announced
that its board of directors had approved a tentative settlement
agreement with holders of most of NRG Energy’s long-term
notes and the steering committee representing NRG’s bank
lenders. The settlement is subject to certain conditions,
including the approval of at least a majority in dollar amount
of the NRG Energy bank lenders and long-term noteholders and
definitive documentation. There can be no assurance that such
approvals will be obtained. The terms of the settlement call for
Xcel Energy to make payments to NRG Energy over the next
13 months totaling up to $752 million for the benefit of
NRG Energy’s creditors in consideration for their waiver of
any existing and potential claims against Xcel Energy. Under the
settlement, Xcel Energy will make the following payments:
(i) $350 million at or shortly following the
consummation of a restructuring of NRG Energy’s debt. It is
expected this payment would be made prior to year-end 2003;
(ii) $50 million on January 1, 2004. At Xcel
Energy’s option, it may fill this requirement with either
cash or Xcel Energy common stock or any combination thereof; and
(iii) $352 million in April 2004.

Domestic Assets

Eastern Region

The Eastern Region, comprising investments in the
New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), New England Power
Pool (NEPOOL) and Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and
Maryland (PJM) markets, is NRG Energy’s largest asset base.
As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy owned approximately
7,040 MW of net generating capacity in the Northeast United
States and Canada, primarily in New York, Connecticut and
Massachusetts. These generation facilities are diversified in
terms of dispatch level (base-load, intermediate and peaking),
fuel type (coal, natural gas and oil) and customers.

NRG Energy’s Northeast facilities are
generally competitively positioned within their respective
market dispatch levels with favorable market dynamics and
locations close to the major load centers in the NYISO and
NEPOOL.

As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy owned
approximately 1,400 MW of net generating capacity in the
Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, primarily Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania. These facilities are
primarily coal-type and are diversified in terms of dispatch.
These facilities provide interconnect to the PJM market.

Central Region

As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy owned
approximately 6400 MW of net generating capacity (including
projects under construction) in the Central United States,
primarily in Louisiana, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri,
Oklahoma and Texas. NRG Energy’s Central generating assets
consist primarily of its net ownership of power generation
facilities in New Roads, Louisiana (which are referred to as the
Cajun facilities) and its net ownership of power generation
facilities in Kendall and Rockford, Illinois. The Central region
also includes the Sterlington, McClain, Bayou Cove, Batesville,
Rocky Road, Audrain and Mustang generating facilities.

NRG Energy’s portfolio of plants in
Louisiana and Mississippi comprise the second largest generator
in the Southeastern Electric Reliability Counsel/ Entergy
(SERC/ETR) region. The core of these assets are the Cajun
facilities with capacity over 2000 MW of primarily
coal-fired assets supported by long-term power purchase
agreements with regional cooperatives.



West Coast Region

As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy owned
approximately 1,230 MW of net generating capacity on the
West Coast of the United States, primarily California and
Nevada. NRG Energy’s West Coast generation assets consist
primarily of a 50% interest in West Coast Power LLC (West Coast
Power), and a 50% interest in the Saguaro generation facility.

In May 1999, Dynegy Power Corporation (Dynegy)
and NRG Energy formed West Coast Power to serve as the holding
company for a portfolio of operating companies that own
generation assets in Southern California. This portfolio
currently is comprised of the El Segundo Generating
Station, the Long Beach Generating Station, the Encina
Generating Station and 17 combustion turbines in the
San Diego area. Dynegy provides power marketing and fuel
procurement services to West Coast Power, and NRG Energy
provides operations and management services. An application for
a permit to repower the existing El Segundo site, replacing
the retired unit 1 & 2 with 600 MW of new
generation has been filed. The permit is in the CEC (California
Energy Commission) review process, and it is anticipated that
the approval will be received by third or forth quarter of 2003.

International Assets

Historically, the majority of power generating
capacity outside of the United States has been owned and
controlled by governments. During the past decade, however, many
foreign governments moved to privatize power generation plant
ownership through sales to third parties and by encouraging new
capacity development and refurbishment of existing assets by
independent power developers.

Over the past decade NRG Energy invested in
international power generation projects in three distinct
markets, Asia Pacific, Europe and Other Americas. During 2002,
NRG Energy sold international generation projects with an
aggregate total generating capacity of approximately
600 MW. As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy has
investments in power generation projects located in Australia,
UK, Germany, South America, India, Taiwan and the Czech Republic
with approximately 4630 MW Total generating capacity. NRG
Energy currently anticipates that it will divest its remaining
international generating projects over time.

Alternative Energy

In addition to its traditional power generation
facilities discussed above, NRG Energy provides alternative
energy through NEO Corporation (NEO), one of the largest
landfill gas generation companies in the United States, and
through its NRG Resource Recovery business division, which
processes municipal solid waste as fuel used to generate power.

NEO Corporation.

NEO
is a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Energy that was formed to
develop power generation facilities, ranging in size from 1 to
50 MW, in the United States. NEO owns and operates
31 landfill gas collection systems and has 46 MW of
net ownership interests in related electric generation
facilities utilizing landfill gas as fuel. NEO also has
42 MW of net ownership interests in 18 hydroelectric
facilities and 109 MW of net ownership interests in five
distributed generation facilities including 90 MW of
gas-fired peaking engines in California (referred to as the Red
Bluff and Chowchilla facilities).

Resource Recovery Facilities.

NRG Energy’s Resource Recovery
business is focused on owning and operating alternative
fuel/“green power” generation and fuels processing
projects. The alternative fuels currently processed and
combusted are municipal solid waste (MSW), of which more than
90% is processed into refuse derived fuel (RDF), urban wood
waste (pallets, clean construction debris, etc.), forest
industry waste wood (bark, sawmill waste, tree trimmings, etc.),
agricultural waste (walnut shells, olive pits, peanut shells,
etc.), and non-recyclable waste paper and compost. NRG
Energy’s Resource Recovery business has MSW processing
capacity of over 4,000 tons per day and generation capacity of
35 MW, of which its net ownership interest is 26 MW.
NRG Energy’s Resource Recovery business owns and operates
MSW processing and/or generation facilities in Florida, Maine
and Minnesota. Resource Recovery also owns and operates NRG
Processing Solutions that includes thirteen composting and
biomass fuel processing sites in Minnesota of which three sites
are permitted to operate as MSW transfer stations.



Thermal

NRG Energy has interests in district heating and
cooling systems and steam transmission operations through its
subsidiary NRG Thermal LLC. NRG Thermal’s thermal and
chilled water businesses have a steam and chilled water capacity
of approximately of 1,290 megawatt thermal equivalents (MWt).

NRG Thermal LLC owns five district heating and
cooling systems in Minneapolis, Minnesota, San Francisco,
California, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
and San Diego, California. These systems provide steam
heating to approximately 600 customers and chilled water to
90 customers. In addition, NRG Thermal LLC owns and
operates three projects that serve industrial/ government
customers with high-pressure steam and hot water and an
88 MW combustion turbine peaking generation facility and an
18 MW coal-fired cogeneration facility in Dover, Delaware.

Power Marketing

NRG Energy’s energy marketing subsidiary,
NRG Power Marketing Inc. (NRG Power Marketing), began operations
in 1998. NRG Power Marketing provides a full range of energy
management services for NRG Energy’s generation facilities
in its Eastern and Central regions. These services are provided
under bilateral contracts or agency agreements pursuant to which
NRG Power Marketing manages the sales and purchases of energy,
capacity and ancillary services, procures the fuel (coal, oil
and natural gas) and associated transportation and manages the
emission allowance credits for these facilities. NRG Power
Marketing has continued to provide these services since NRG
Energy lost its investment grade ratings in July 2002, and
because of NRG Energy’s credit and liquidity limitations,
NRG Power Marketing has scaled back its activities. Since July
2002, NRG Power Marketing has focused primarily on procuring
fuel for, and marketing the power from, NRG Energy’s North
American generation facilities in the spot and short-term
markets.

Significant Customers

During 2002, NRG Energy (and its subsidiaries)
derived approximately 21.1% of its 2002 revenues from majority
owned operations from one customer: New York Independent System
Operator. During 2001, NRG Energy derived approximately 51.5% of
its 2001 revenues from majority owned operations from two
customers: New York Independent System Operator (33.9%) and
Connecticut Light and Power Company (17.6%). During 2000, NRG
Energy derived approximately 41.6% of its 2000 revenues from
majority owned operations from two customers: New York
Independent System Operator (26.8%) and Connecticut Light and
Power Company (14.8%).

Seasonality and Price Volatility

Annual and quarterly operating results can be
significantly affected by weather and price volatility. Since
NRG Energy’s peak demand is in the summer months,
temperature variations in summer months are generally more
significant than variations during winter months. Significant
other events, such as the war in Iraq, the precipitous decline
in natural gas inventories and productive capacity and reduced
hydroelectric capacity due to dry conditions in the Northwest,
have all combined to increase fuel and power price volatility.

Source and Availability of Raw
Materials

NRG Energy’s raw material requirements
primarily include various forms of fossil fuel energy sources,
including oil, natural gas and coal. NRG Energy obtains its oil,
natural gas and coal from multiple sources and availability is
generally not an issue, although localized shortages can and do
occur. The prices of oil, natural gas and coal are subject to
macro- and micro-economic forces that can change dramatically in
both the short term and the long term. For example, the prices
of natural gas and oil have been particularly high during the
winter of 2002-2003 due to weather volatility and geo-political
uncertainty in the Middle East. Oil, natural gas and coal
represented approximately 46% of NRG Energy’s cost of
operations during the year ended December 31, 2002.



Segment Information

For financial information on NRG Energy’s
operations on a geographical and on a segment basis, see
Item 15 — Note 23 to the Consolidated

Significant Business and Asset
Dispositions

Consolidated Business
    Dispositions

Bulo
Bulo

— In June 2002, NRG
Energy began negotiations to sell its 60% interest in Compania
Electrica Central Bulo Bulo S.A. (Bulo Bulo), a Bolivian
corporation. During the second quarter of 2002, NRG Energy
classified the Bulo Bulo project as held-for-sale and recognized
a loss on disposal of approximately $9.7 million in
discontinued operations. The transaction closed in the fourth
quarter of 2002.

Crockett Cogeneration
Project

— In November 2002,
NRG Energy sold its 57.7% interest in the Crockett Cogeneration
Project, a 240 MW natural gas fueled cogeneration plant
near San Francisco, California, to Energy Investment Fund
Group, an existing LP, and a unit of GE Capital. NRG Energy
recognized a net loss on sale of $11.5 million (pre-tax)
and net proceeds of $52.1 million which was used to reduce
debt.

Csepel and
Entrade

— In September 2002,
NRG Energy announced that it had reached agreements to sell its
Csepel power generating facilities (located in Budapest,
Hungary) and its interest in Entrade (an electricity trading
business headquartered in Prague) to Atel, an independent energy
group headquartered in Switzerland. The sales of Csepel and
Entrade closed before year-end and resulted in cash proceeds of
$92.6 million and a gain of approximately
$24.0 million.

Pending and Completed Consolidated Business
    Dispositions

Brazos
Valley

— In January 2003,
the project lenders foreclosed on NRG Energy’s 100%
ownership interests in NRG Brazos Valley, GP LLC, NRG Brazos
Valley LP, LLC NRG Brazos Valley Technology LP, LLC and NRG
Brazos Valley Energy, LP, and thereby acquired all of the assets
of the Brazos Valley project, a 633 MW gas-fired, combined
cycle facility under construction in Fort Bend County,
Texas — approximately 30 miles west of Houston,
Texas. NRG Energy agreed to the consensual foreclosure of the
companies to the project lenders. NRG Energy received no cash
proceeds upon completion of the foreclosure. As of
December 31, 2002, NRG Energy recorded $24.0 million
for the potential obligation to infuse additional amounts of
capital to fund a debt service reserve account and the potential
obligation to satisfy a contingent equity agreement.

Killingholme

—
In January 2003, NRG Energy completed the sale of its interest
in the Killingholme project to its lenders. This transfer of NRG
Energy’s interest in the Killingholme project resulted in a
gain on sale in the first quarter of 2003 of approximately
$182.3 million, primarily due to the removal of the related
debt on NRG Energy’s balance sheet. In 2002, NRG Energy
recorded an asset impairment charge of $477.9 million
related to the Killingholme project. Killingholme is reported as
a discontinued operation in NRG Energy’s December 31,
2002 financial statements.

Hsin Yu

—
During 2002, NRG Energy committed to sell its ownership interest
in Hsin Yu. As a result, Hsin Yu meets the criteria for
discontinued operations treatment and accordingly the assets and
liabilities and results of operations have been reflected as
such in the accompanying financial statements. During the third
quarter of 2002, NRG Energy recorded an impairment charge of
approximately $121.9 million for the Hsin Yu project.

Equity Investment
    Dispositions

During 2002, NRG Energy sold various equity
method investments and others have been approved for sale by the
NRG Board of Directors but are still owned as of
December 31, 2002. In the accompanying financial
statements, the operating results of these projects are
classified in revenue as equity in earnings from unconsolidated
investments. During 2002, NRG Energy recorded write-downs and
losses on disposal of $196.2 million of equity investments.



Energy Development
Limited

— In August 2002,
NRG Energy completed the sale of its ownership interests in an
Australian energy company, Energy Development Limited (EDL). NRG
Energy received proceeds of $78.5 million (AUS), or
approximately $43.9 million (U.S.), in the transaction.

Collinsville Power
Station

— In August 2002,
NRG Energy completed the sale of its 50% interest in the
192 MW Collinsville Power Station in Australia to its
partner, a subsidiary of Transfield Services Limited. NRG
Energy’s proceeds from the sale amounted to
$8.6 million (AUS), or approximately $4.8 million
(USD).

Sabine
River

— In September 2002,
NRG Energy agreed to transfer its indirect 50% interest in SRW
Cogeneration LP (SRW) to its partner in SRW, Conoco, Inc. in
consideration for Conoco’s agreement to terminate or assume
all of the obligations of NRG Energy in relation to SRW. SRW
owns a cogeneration facility in Orange County, Texas. NRG Energy
recorded a charge of approximately $48.4 million during the
quarter ended September 30, 2002 to writeoff the carrying
value of its investment due to the pending transfer. The
transfer closed on November 5, 2002.

Mt. Poso

—
In November 2002, NRG Energy completed the sale of its 39.5%
indirect partnership interest in the Mt. Poso Cogeneration
Company, a California limited partnership (Mt. Poso) for
approximately $10 million to Red Hawk Energy, LLC.
Mt. Poso owns a 49.5 MW coal-fired cogeneration power
plant and thermally enhanced oil recovery facility located
20 miles north of Bakersfield, California. NRG Energy
recorded a charge of approximately $1.0 million during 2002
to write down the carrying value of its investment.

NEO MESI
LLC

— On November 26,
2002, NRG Energy, through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary,
NEO MESI LLC, completed the transfer of its 50% interest in
MESI Fuel Station No. 1, LLC (MESI) to Power Fuel Partners
(PFP) in exchange for the assumption by PFP of all NEO MESI
LLC’s obligations under the MESI operating agreement,
estimated at the time of closing at $21.6 million, plus a
percentage of certain future fuel sales management fees payable
to PFP.

Kingston

—
In December, 2002, NRG Energy completed the sale of its
25% interest in Kingston Cogeneration LP, based near
Toronto, Canada to Northland Power Income Fund for approximately
$15 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately
$9.9 million.

ECKG

— In
January 2003, NRG Energy completed the sale of its
44.5% interest in the ECKG power station, the last
transaction in connection with NRG Energy’s sale of its
Csepel power generating facilities, its interest in Entrade, an
electricity trading business and ECKG, to Atel, an independent
energy group headquartered in Switzerland. The transaction
resulted in cash proceeds of $67.0 million and a net loss
of $2.1 million.

Other Equity Investments

The following investment projects are currently
being marketed for sale however, final approval has not been
granted by those having such authority as of December 31,
2002. In the accompanying financial statements, the operating
results of these projects are classified in revenue as equity in
earnings from unconsolidated investments. Write-downs of the
carrying amount of the investments and losses on disposal have
been classified and reported as a component of write-downs and
losses of equity method investments.

Loy Yang

—
Based on a third party market valuation and bids received in
response to marketing the investment for possible sale, NRG
Energy recorded a write down of its investment of approximately
$53.6 million in the third quarter of 2002. This write-down
reflected management’s belief that the decline in fair
value of the investment was other than temporary.

During the fourth quarter of 2002, NRG Energy and
the other owners of the Loy Yang project engaged in joint
marketing of the project for possible sale. In connection with
these efforts, a new independent market valuation analysis was
completed. Based on the new market valuation and negotiations
with a potential purchaser, NRG Energy recorded an additional
write-down of its investment in the amount of $57.8 million in
the fourth quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2002 the carrying
value of the investment in Loy Yang is approximately $72.9
million. Accumulated other comprehensive loss at
December 31, 2002 includes foreign



currency translation losses of approximately
$76.7 million related to Loy Yang. The foreign currency
translation losses will continue to be included as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive loss until NRG Energy commits
to a plan to dispose of its investment, as required by EITF
Issue No. 01-05. NRG Energy accounts for the results of
operations of its investment in Loy Yang as part of its power
generation segment within the Asia Pacific region.

Kondapalli

—
On January 30, 2003, NRG Energy signed a sale agreement
with the Genting Group of Malaysia to sell NRG’s 30%
interest in Lanco Kondapalli Power Pvt Ltd and a 74% interest in
Eastern Generation Services (India) Pvt Ltd. Kondapalli is based
in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India, and is the owner of a
368 MW natural gas fired Combined Cycle Gas Turbine. That
sale has not yet been completed, although completion is expected
before the end of the second quarter of 2003.

Powersmith —

During the fourth quarter of 2002, NRG
Energy wrote down its investment in Powersmith by approximately
$3.4 million due to impairment of its book value. NRG
Energy accounts for the results of operations of these
investments as part of its power generation segment within the
North America region.

Other

—
During 2002, NRG Energy wrote down other equity investments in
the amount of approximately $11.3 million due to impairment
of their book value. NRG Energy accounted for the results of
operations of these investments as part of its alternative
energy segment.

Regulation

Federal Energy Regulation

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or
FERC, is an independent agency within the Department of Energy
that regulates the transmission and wholesale sale of
electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the
Federal Power Act. FERC is also responsible for licensing and
inspecting private, municipal and state-owned hydroelectric
projects. FERC determines whether a public utility qualifies for
exempt wholesale generator status under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act, which was amended by the Energy Policy Act
of 1992.

Federal Power Act.

The Federal Power Act gives FERC exclusive rate-making
jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and
transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. FERC
regulates the owners of facilities used for the wholesale sale
of electricity and its transmission in interstate commerce as
“public utilities” under the Federal Power Act. The
Federal Power Act also gives FERC jurisdiction to review certain
transactions and numerous other activities of public utilities.

Under the Federal Power Act, an entity that sells
electricity in the wholesale market is a public utility, subject
to FERC’s jurisdiction. Public utilities are required to
obtain FERC’s acceptance of their rate schedules for
wholesale sales of electricity. Because NRG Energy is selling
electricity in the wholesale market, NRG Energy is deemed to be
a public utility for purposes of the Federal Power Act. In most
cases, FERC has granted NRG Energy the authority to sell
electricity at market-based rates. In New England, New York, PJM
(Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and parts of the
Midwest) the Midwest and California, FERC has established
Independent System Operators (ISOs) which file market based rate
tariffs, subject to FERC Approval. These tariffs/market rules
dictate how the wholesale markets are to operate and how
entities with market based rates shall be compensated within
those markets. The ISOs in these regions also control access to,
pricing of and the operation of the transmission grid within
their footprint. Outside of ISO controlled regions, NRG Energy
is allowed to sell at market based rates as determined by
willing buyers and sellers. Access to, pricing for and operation
of the transmission grid in such regions is controlled by the
local transmission owning utility according to their Pro Forma
Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) filed with and
approved by FERC.

Usually, FERC’s orders which grant NRG
Energy market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke
or revise NRG Energy’s market-based rate authority on a
prospective basis if FERC subsequently determines that NRG
Energy possesses excessive market power. If NRG Energy lost its
market-based rate authority, NRG Energy may be required to
obtain FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule
and may become subject to the accounting, record-keeping and
reporting requirements that are imposed only on



utilities with cost-based rate schedules. It
should be noted, however, that NRG Energy does have the right at
any time to petition FERC to grant cost of service based rates
pursuant to Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.

Public Utility Holding Company Act.

The Public Utility Holding Company
Act, known as PUHCA, provides that any entity that owns,
controls or has the power to vote 10% or more of the
outstanding voting securities of an “electric utility
company,” or a holding company for an electric utility
company, is subject to regulation under the Holding Company Act.

Registered holding companies under the Holding
Company Act are required to limit their utility operations to a
single, integrated utility system and divest any other
operations that are not functionally related to the operation of
the utility system. In addition, a company that is a subsidiary
of a holding company registered under the Holding Company Act is
subject to financial and organizational regulation, including
approval by the SEC of certain financings and transactions.
Under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, however, FERC can determine
that a company engaged exclusively in the business of owning or
operating an eligible facility used for the generation of
electric energy for sale at wholesale is an “exempt
wholesale generator.” Accordingly, it is exempt from the
Holding Company Act requirements. In the case of facilities
previously operated by regulated utilities, FERC can make an
exempt wholesale generator determination only after the state
utility commission finds that allowing the facility or
facilities to be eligible for exempt wholesale generator status
will benefit consumers, is in the public interest, and does not
violate state law. Each of NRG Energy’s operating
subsidiaries has been designated by FERC as an exempt wholesale
generator or is otherwise exempt from PUHCA because it is a
Qualifying Facility under the Public Utility Regulatory Policy
Act of 1978.

NRG Energy does not expect to engage in any
activities that will subject it to regulation under PUHCA. If
NRG Energy were to lose its exempt wholesale generator status,
it would become subject to regulation under the Holding Company
Act. It would be difficult for NRG Energy to comply with the
Holding Company Act absent a substantial restructuring.

Environmental and Safety Laws and
    Regulations

NRG Energy is subject to a broad range of
foreign, provincial, federal, state and local environmental and
safety laws and regulations applicable to the development,
ownership and operation of its United States domestic and
international projects. These laws and regulations impose
requirements relating to discharges of substances to the air,
water and land, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous
substances and wastes and the cleanup of properties affected by
pollutants. These laws and regulations generally require that
NRG Energy obtain a number of governmental permits and approvals
before construction or operation of a power plant commences and
after completion, that its facilities operate in compliance with
those permits and applicable legal requirements. NRG Energy
could also be held responsible under these laws for the cleanup
of pollutants released at its facilities or at off-site
locations where it has sent wastes.

NRG Energy strives at all times to comply with
the terms of all environmental and safety laws, regulations,
permits and licenses and NRG Energy believes that all of its
operating plants are in material compliance with applicable
environmental and safety requirements. NRG Energy also does not
expect that its liability under environmental laws for the
cleanup of contamination at its plants or off-site waste
disposal facilities will have a material effect on the results
of its operations. There can be no assurance, however, that in
the future it will not incur material environmental liabilities,
that it will obtain all necessary permits for its operations or
that it will operate in full compliance with environmental and
safety laws and regulations at all times. In addition,
regulatory compliance for the construction of new facilities is
a costly and time-consuming process. Intricate and rapidly
changing environmental regulations may require major capital
expenditures for permitting and create a risk of expensive
delays or material impairment of project value if projects
cannot function as planned due to changing regulatory
requirements or local opposition. Environmental laws have become
increasingly stringent over time, particularly with regard to
the regulation of air emissions from NRG Energy’s plants,
which requires regular major capital expenditures for power
plant upgrades and modifications. Therefore, it is NRG
Energy’s policy to integrate the consideration of potential
environmental impacts into



every decision it makes, and by doing so, strive
to improve its competitive advantage by meeting or exceeding
environmental and safety requirements pertaining to the
management and operation of its assets. (See
Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Environmental Matters).

Competition

The entire independent power industry in the
United States is in turmoil. Many of NRG Energy’s
competitors have announced plans to scale back their growth,
sell assets, and restructure their finances. The results of the
wholesale restructuring of the independent power industry are
impossible to predict, but they may include consolidation within
the industry, the sale or liquidation of certain competitors,
the re-regulation of certain markets, and the long-term
reduction in new investment into the industry. Under any
scenario, however, NRG Energy anticipates that it will continue
to face competition from numerous companies in the industry,
some of which may have more extensive operating experience,
larger staffs, and greater financial resources than NRG Energy
presently possesses.

Many companies in the regulated utility industry,
with which the independent power industry is closely linked, are
also restructuring or reviewing their strategies. Several of
these companies are discontinuing going forward with unregulated
investments, seeking to divest of their unregulated subsidiaries
or attempting to have their regulated subsidiaries acquire their
unregulated subsidiaries. This may lead to an increased
competition between the regulated utilities and the unregulated
power producers within certain markets. In such instances, NRG
Energy may compete with regulated utilities in the development
of market designs and rulemaking.

FERC, however, is attempting to level the
competitive playing field between regulated utilities and
unregulated energy suppliers by providing open,
non-discriminatory access to electricity markets and the
transmission grid. In April 1996, FERC issued Orders 888 and 889
that required all public utilities to file “open
access” transmission tariffs that give wholesale
generators, as well as other wholesale sellers and buyers of
electricity, access to transmission facilities on a
non-discriminatory basis. This led to the formation of the ISOs
described above. On December 20, 1999, FERC issued Order
2000, encouraging the creation of Regional Transmission
Organizations (RTOs). Finally, on July 31, 2002, FERC
issued its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Standard
Market Design. All three orders were intended to eliminate
market discrimination by incumbent vertically integrated
utilities and to provide for open access to the transmission
grid.

The full effect of these changes on NRG Energy is
uncertain at this time, because in many parts of the United
States, it has not been determined how entities will attempt to
comply with FERC’s initiatives. At this time, five ISOs
have been approved and are operational; New England (ISO-NE),
New York (NYISO), Pennsylvania, NJ, Maryland, DE and parts of
the midwest (collectively PJM), Central Midwest (MISO), South
Central (SPP) and in California (CA ISO). Two of these ISOs, PJM
and MISO, have been found to also qualify as RTOs. Three other
entities have also requested that FERC approve their
organizations as RTOs; WestConnect (Desert Southwest); RTO West
(Pacific Northwest and Rockies) and Setrans (Southeast).

NRG Energy is also impacted by rule/tariff
changes that occur in the existing ISOs. On March 1, 2003,
ISO-NE implemented its version of Standard Market Design. This
change dramatically modifies the New England market structure by
incorporating Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP —
pricing by location rather than on a New England wide basis).
Even though NRG Energy views this change as a significant
improvement to the existing market design, NRG Energy still
views the market within New England as insufficient to allow for
NRG Energy to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on
investment. Consequently, on February 26, 2003, NRG Energy
filed and requested a cost of service rate with FERC for most of
its Connecticut fleet, requesting a February 27th effective
date. NRG Energy remains committed to working with ISO-NE, FERC
and other stakeholders to continue to improve the New England
market that will hopefully make further reliance on a cost of
service rate unnecessary. While NRG Energy has the right to file
for such rate treatment, there are no assurances that FERC will
grant such rates in the form or amount that NRG Energy
petitioned for in its filing.



On March 25, 2003, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued an order (the Order) in
response to Devon Power LLC’s, Middletown Power LLC’s,
Montville Power LLC’s, and Norwalk Power LLC’s
(collectively, NRG Subsidiaries) Joint Motion for Emergency
Expedited Issuance of Order by March 17, 2003 in
Docket No. ER03-563-000 (the Emergency Motion). In the
Emergency Motion, the NRG Subsidiaries requested that FERC
accept the NRG Subsidiaries’ reliability must-run
agreements and assure the NRG Subsidiaries’ recovery of
maintenance costs for their New England generating facilities
prior to the peak summer season. FERC accepted the NRG
Subsidiaries’ filing as to the recovery of spring 2003
maintenance costs, subject to refund. FERC’s Order
authorizes the ISO New England Inc. to begin collecting these
maintenance costs in escrow for the benefit of the NRG
Subsidiaries as of February 27, 2003. Several intervenors
protested the Emergency Motion. FERC will rule on such protests
and the other issues raised in the Emergency Motion in a
subsequent order.

In New York, NRG Energy anticipates that the
NYISO will implement a demand curve in its capacity market. In
PJM, NRG Energy is closely following market power mitigation
modifications that may significantly impact the revenues
achievable in that market by modifying PJM’s price capping
mechanisms. The potential modifications are unknown at this
time, and it is unclear whether such changes would have a
positive or a negative effect on NRG Energy.

In the Midwest, it is anticipated that Exelon and
AEP will join PJM and will transition to PJM’s market
model, although there have been certain regulatory obstacles
affecting AEP’s ability to join PJM. This will allow NRG
Energy to market capacity and energy from its Chicago area
assets more effectively. The other Midwest ISO, MISO, continues
its market rule development as it moves toward a PJM styled
market. MISO and PJM have signed a Memorandum of Understanding
that lays out a common market design that both will employ. It
is anticipated that PJM and MISO will operate a common market
interface that will allow seamless trading between the two
regions. MISO presently has operational control over the
transmission facilities located within its footprint.

In the Southeast, Entergy and Southern Company
continue to support their RTO, Setrans. The future of Setrans is
uncertain given the recent loss of the local municipal Santee
Cooper.

Finally, in California, the California
Independent System Operator (CA ISO) continues to struggle with
market design changes intended to prevent a repeat of past
market dis-function. It is unlikely that modification initially
coined as Market Design 2002 (MDO2), will be implemented any
sooner than 2004. Although numerous stakeholder meetings have
been held, the final MDO2 design remains unknown at this time.
In addition, numerous legislative initiatives in California
create uncertainty and risk for NRG Energy. Most significantly,
SB39XX mandates that the California Public Utilities Commission
(CPUC) exercise jurisdiction over the maintenance of power
producers. It is unclear at this time where that process will
lead.

Proposals have been introduced in Congress to
repeal PURPA and PUHCA, and FERC has publicly indicated support
for the PUHCA repeal effort. If the repeal of PURPA or PUHCA
occurs, either separately or as part of legislation designed to
encourage the broader introduction of wholesale and retail
competition, the significant competitive advantages that
independent power producers currently enjoy over certain
regulated utility companies would be eliminated or sharply
curtailed, and the ability of regulated utility companies to
compete more directly with independent power companies would be
increased. To the extent competitive pressures increase and the
pricing and sale of electricity assumes more characteristics of
a commodity business, the economics of domestic independent
power generation projects may come under increasing pressure.
Deregulation may not only continue to fuel the current trend
toward consolidation among domestic utilities, but may also
encourage the dis-aggregation of vertically-integrated utilities
into separate generation, transmission and distribution
businesses.

In addition, the independent system operators who
oversee most of the wholesale power markets have in the past
imposed, and may in the future continue to impose, price
limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the
volatility in these markets. For example, the independent system
operator for the New York power pool and the California
independent system operator have imposed price limitations.
These types of price limitations and other mechanisms in New
York, California, the New England Power Pool and elsewhere may
adversely impact the profitability of NRG Energy’s
generation facilities that sell energy into the wholesale



power markets. Finally, the regulatory and
legislative changes that have recently been enacted in a number
of states in an effort to promote competition are novel and
untested in many respects. These new approaches to the sale of
electric power have very short operating histories, and it is
not yet clear how they will operate in times of market stress or
pressure, given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful
long-term price history in many of these markets and the
imposition of price limitations by independent system operators.

Employees

At December 31, 2002, NRG Energy had 3,173
employees, approximately 329 of whom are employed directly by
NRG Energy and approximately 2,844 of whom are employed by its
wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates. Approximately 1,757
employees are covered by bargaining agreements. NRG Energy has
experienced no significant labor stoppages or labor disputes at
its facilities.

Item 3 —

Legal Proceedings

Through March 2003, NRG Energy was involved in
the following material legal proceedings. NRG Energy is
vigorously defending itself in each of these matters.



California Wholesale Electricity Litigation
and Related Investigations

People of the State of California
ex. rel. Bill Lockyer, Attorney General, v. Dynegy, Inc. et
al.,

United States District Court,
Northern District of California, Case No. C-02-O1854 VRW;
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Case
No. 02-16619.

This action was filed in state court on
March 11, 2002. It alleges that the defendants violated
California Business & Professions Code
§ 17200 by selling ancillary services to the
California ISO, and subsequently selling the same capacity into
the spot market. The Attorney General seeks injunctive relief as
well as restitution, disgorgement and civil penalties.

On April 17, 2002, the defendants removed
the case to the United States District Court in San Francisco.
Thereafter, the case was transferred to Judge Vaughn Walker, who
is also presiding over various other “ancillary
services” cases brought by the California Attorney General
against other participants in the California market, as well as
other lawsuits brought by the Attorney General against these
other market participants. NRG Energy has tolling agreements in
place with the Attorney General with respect to such other
proposed claims against it.

The Attorney General filed motions to remand,
which the defendants opposed in July of 2002. In an Order filed
in early September 2002, Judge Walker denied the remand motions.
The Attorney General has appealed that decision to the United
States Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit, and the appeal
remains pending. The Attorney General also sought a stay of
proceedings in the district court pending the appeal, and this
request was also denied. A “Notice of Bankruptcy
Filing” respecting NRG Energy was filed in the Ninth
Circuit and in the District Court in mid-December 2002. The
Attorney General filed a paper asserting that the “police
power” exception to the automatic stay is applicable here.
Judge Walker agreed with the Attorney General on this issue. In
a lengthy opinion filed March 25, 2003, Judge Walker
dismissed the Attorney General’s action against NRG and
Dynegy with prejudice, finding it was barred by the filed rate
doctrine and preempted by federal law. The Attorney General has
announced it will appeal the dismissal. NRG Energy is unable at
this time to accurately estimate the damages sought by the
Attorney General against NRG Energy and its affiliates, or
predict the outcome of the case.

A “Notice of Bankruptcy Filing”
respecting NRG Energy was filed in the Ninth Circuit and in the
District Court in mid-December, 2002. The Attorney General filed
a paper asserting that the “police power” exception to
the automatic stay is applicable here.

Public Utility District of Snohomish
County v. Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc
et al.,

Case No. 02-CV-1993
RHW, United States District Court, Southern District of
California (part of MDL 1405).

This action was filed against Dynegy, NRG Energy,
Xcel Energy and several other market participants in the United
States District Court in Los Angeles on July 15, 2002. The
Complaint alleges violations of the California
Business & Professions Code § 16720 (the
Cartwright Act) and Business & Professions
Code § 17200. The basic claims are price fixing
and restriction of supply, and other market “gaming”
activities.

The action was transferred from Los Angeles to
the United States District Court in San Diego and was made
a part of the Multi-District Litigation proceeding described
below. All defendants filed motions to dismiss and to strike in
the fall of 2002. In an Order dated January 6, 2003, the
Honorable Robert Whaley, a federal judge from Spokane sitting in
the United States District Court in San Diego, pursuant to
the Order of the MDL Panel, granted the motions to dismiss on
the grounds of federal preemption and filed-rate doctrine. The
plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal.

In re: Wholesale Electricity Antitrust
Litigation,

MDL 1405, United States
District Court, Southern District of California, pending before
Honorable Robert H. Whaley. The cases included in this
proceeding are as follows:

1.

Pamela R Gordon, on Behalf of Herself
    and All Others Similarly Situated v Reliant Energy, Inc.
    et al.,

Case No. 758487, Superior Court of the
    State of California, County of San Diego (filed on
    November 27,

2000).



These cases were all filed in late 2000 and 2001
in various state courts throughout California. They allege
unfair competition, market manipulation, and price fixing. All
the cases were removed to the appropriate United States District
Courts, and were thereafter made the subject of a petition to
the Multi-District Litigation Panel (Case No. MDL 1405).
The cases were ultimately assigned to Judge Whaley. Judge Whaley
entered an order in 2001 remanding the cases to state court, and
thereafter the cases were coordinated pursuant to state court
coordination proceedings before a single judge in San Diego
Superior Court. The defendants filed motions to dismiss and to
strike under the filed-rate and federal preemption theories, and
the plaintiffs challenged the district court’s jurisdiction
and sought to have the cases remanded to state court. In
December 2002, Judge Whaley issued an opinion finding that
federal jurisdiction was absent in the district court, and
remanding the cases to state court. Duke and Reliant have filed
a notice of appeal with the Ninth Circuit, and also sought a
stay of the remand pending appeal. The stay request was denied
by Judge Whaley. On February 20, 2003, however, the Ninth
Circuit stayed the remand order and accepted jurisdiction to
hear the appeal of Reliant and Duke on the remand order. The
Company anticipates that filed-rate/federal preemption pleading
challenges will once again be filed once the remand appeal is
decided. A “Notice of Bankruptcy Filing” respecting
NRG Energy has also been filed in this action, providing notice
of the involuntary petition.

“Northern California” cases against
various market participants, not including NRG Energy (part of
MDL 1405). These include the

Millar, Pastorino, RDJ Farms,
Century Theatres, EI Super Burrito, Leo’s, J&M
Karsant,

and the

Bronco Don

cases. NRG Energy, Inc.
was not named in any of these cases, but in virtually all of
them, either West Coast Power or one or more of the operating
LLC’s with which the Company is indirectly affiliated is
named as a defendant. These cases all allege violation of
Business & Professions Code § 17200, and are
similar to the various allegations made by the Attorney General.
Dynegy is named as a defendant in all these actions, and
Dynegy’s outside counsel is representing both Dynegy and
the West Coast Power entities in each of these cases.

Bustamante v. McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.,
et al.

,

No. BC
285598,

California Superior Court, Los Angeles County

This putative class action lawsuit was filed on
November 20, 2002. In addition to naming WCP-related
entities as defendants, numerous industry participants are named
in this lawsuit that are unrelated to WCP or NRG Energy. The
Complaint generally alleges that the defendants attempted to
manipulate gas indexes by reporting false and fraudulent trades.
Named defendants in the suit are the LLCs established by WCP for



each of its four plants: El Segundo Power, LLC;
Long Beach Generation, LLC; Cabrillo Power I LLC; and
Cabrillo Power II LLC. NRG Energy is not named as a
defendant. The complaint seeks restitution and disgorgement of
“ill-gotten gains,” civil fines, compensatory and
punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and declaratory and
injunctive relief.

Dynegy has agreed with NRG Energy that it will
indemnify and hold harmless the named defendants in the
Bustamante lawsuit, as well as NRG Energy, from any civil fines,
compensatory damages, punitive damages, costs, and fees that may
be entered pursuant to either a final judgment or a settlement
of claims. Dynegy has also agreed that it will pay all costs and
attorneys’ fees associated with the defense of the named
defendants in the Bustamante lawsuit, as well as any defense
costs for NRG Energy.

Investigations

FERC — California Market
    Manipulation

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has an
ongoing “Investigation of Potential Manipulation of
Electric and Natural Gas Prices,” which involves hundreds
of parties and substantial discovery. In June, 2001, FERC
initiated proceedings related to California’s demand for
$8.9 billion in refunds from power sellers who allegedly
inflated wholesale prices during the energy crisis. Hearings
have been conducted before an administrative law judge who
issued an opinion in late 2002. The administrative law judge
stated that after assessing a refund of $1.8 billion for
“unjust and unreasonable” power prices between
October 2, 2000 and June 20, 2001, power suppliers
were owed $1.2 billion because the State was holding funds
owed to suppliers.

In August, 2002, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals granted a request by the Electricity Oversight Board,
the California Public Utilities Commission, and others, to seek
out and introduce to FERC additional evidence of market
manipulation by wholesale sellers. This decision resulted in
FERC ordering an additional 100 days of discovery in the
refund proceeding, and also allowing the relevant time period
for potential refund liability to extend back an additional nine
months, to January 1, 2000.

On December 12, 2002, FERC Administrative
Law Judge Birchman issued a Certification of Proposed Findings
on California Refund Liability in Docket No. EL00-95-045

et al.

, which determined the method for the
mitigated energy market clearing price during each hour of the
refund period. On March 26, 2003, FERC issued an Order on
Proposed Findings on Refund Liability in Docket
No. EL00-95-045 (Refund Order), adopting, in part, and
modifying, in part, the Proposed Findings issued by Judge
Birchman on December 12, 2002. In the Refund Order, FERC
adopted the refund methodology in the Staff Final Report on
Price Manipulation in Western Markets issued contemporaneously
with the Refund Order in Docket No. PA02-2-000. This refund
calculation methodology makes certain changes to Judge
Birchman’s methodology, because of FERC Staff’s
findings of manipulation in gas index prices. This could
materially increase the estimated refund liability. The Refund
Order also directs generators that want to recover any fuel
costs above the mitigated market clearing price during the
refund period to submit cost information justifying such
recovery within forty (40) days of the issuance of the
Refund Order. FERC announced in the Refund Order that it expects
that refunds will be paid by suppliers by the end of summer 2003.

California Attorney General

In addition to the litigation it has undertaken
described above, the California Attorney General has undertaken
an investigation entitled

In the Matter of the Investigation
of Possibly Unlawful, Unfair, or Anti-Competitive Behavior
Affecting Electricity Prices in California.

In this
connection, the Attorney General has issued subpoenas to Dynegy,
served interrogatories on Dynegy and NRG Energy, and informally
requested documents and interviews from Dynegy and Dynegy
employees as well as NRG Energy and NRG Energy employees. NRG
Energy responded to the interrogatories last summer, with the
final set of responses being served on September 3, 2002.
NRG Energy has also produced a large volume of documentation
relating to the West Coast Power plants. In addition, three NRG
Energy employees in California have sat for informal interviews
with representatives of the Attorney General’s office.
Dynegy employees have also been inter-



viewed. The Attorney General’s office has
requested an additional interview with NRG Energy’s plant
manager of El Segundo.

Although any evaluation of the likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome or an estimate of the amount or range of
potential loss in the above-referenced private actions and
various investigations cannot be made at this time, NRG Energy
notes that the Gordon complaint alleges that the defendants,
collectively, overcharged California ratepayers during 2000 by
$4.0 billion. NRG Energy knows of no evidence implicating
NRG Energy in plaintiffs’ allegations of collusion. NRG
Energy cannot predict the outcome of these cases and
investigations at this time.

The Minnesota Involuntary Bankruptcy
Case

On November 22, 2002, a petition commencing
an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Chapter 11
of the Bankruptcy Code was filed by five of NRG Energy’s
former officers, Brian Bird, Leonard Bluhm, Craig Mataczynski,
John Noer and David Peterson in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the District of Minnesota. Roy Hewitt and James Bender
subsequently joined in the petition. NRG Energy has subsequently
filed an answer and a motion to dismiss the Involuntary Case.
The court will consider the motion to dismiss. In their petition
filed with the Minnesota Bankruptcy Court, the petitioners
sought recovery of severance and other benefits in an aggregate
amount of $27.7 million.

Since the commencement of the Minnesota
involuntary case, NRG Energy and its counsel have been involved
in extensive negotiations with the petitioners and their
counsel. As a result of these negotiations, NRG Energy and the
petitioners reached an agreement and compromise regarding their
respective claims against each other. On February 17, 2003,
the Settlement Agreement was executed by the Petitioners and NRG
Energy, pursuant to which NRG Energy agreed to pay the
Petitioners an aggregate settlement in the amount of
$12.2 million.

On February 28, 2003, Stone &
Webster, Inc. and Shaw Constructors, Inc. filed a Joinder in
Involuntary Petition alleging that they hold unsecured,
non-contingent claims against NRG Energy, in a joint amount of
$100 million. On March 20, 2003, Connecticut Light
& Power Company filed an opposition to the NRG Energy motion
to dismiss the Involuntary Case.

The Minnesota Bankruptcy Court has discretion in
reviewing and ruling on the motion to dismiss and the review and
approval of the settlement agreement. There is a risk that the
Minnesota Bankruptcy Court may, among other things, reject the
settlement agreement or enter an order for relief under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, thus commencing a
Chapter 11 case for NRG Energy.

Fortistar Capital Inc. v. NRG Energy,
Inc., Hennepin County District Court.

On July 12, 1999, Fortistar Capital Inc.
sued NRG Energy in Minnesota state court. The complaint sought
injunctive relief and damages of over $50 million resulting
from NRG Energy’s alleged breach of a letter agreement with
Fortistar relating to the Oswego power plant. NRG Energy
asserted counterclaims. After considerable litigation, the
parties entered into a conditional, confidential settlement
agreement, which was subject to necessary board and lender
approvals. NRG Energy was unable to obtain necessary approvals.
Fortistar has moved the court to enforce the settlement, seeking
damages in excess of $35 million plus interest and
attorneys’ fees. NRG Energy is opposing Fortistar’s
motion on the grounds that conditions to contract performance
have not been satisfied. No decision has been made on the
pending motion, and NRG Energy cannot predict the outcome of
this dispute.

Fortistar RICO Claims/ Indemnity
Requests

On Feb. 26, 2003, Fortistar Capital, Inc.
and Fortistar Methane, LLC filed a lawsuit in the Federal
District Court for the Northern District of New York against
Xcel Energy and five present or former NRG Energy or NEO
officers and employees. NRG Energy is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Xcel Energy, and NEO is a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG
Energy. In the lawsuit, Fortistar claims that the defendants
violated the



Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (“RICO”) and committed fraud by engaging in a
pattern of negotiating and executing agreements “they
intended not to comply with” and “made false
statements later to conceal their fraudulent promises.” The
plaintiffs allege damages of some $350 million and also
assert entitlement to a trebling of these damages under the
provisions of the RICO Act. The present and former NRG Energy
and NEO officers and employees have requested indemnity from NRG
Energy, which requests NRG Energy is now examining. NRG Energy
cannot at this time estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable
outcome to the defendants in this lawsuit.

NEO Corporation, a Minnesota corporation on
behalf of Itself and on behalf of Minnesota Methane, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company v. Fortistar Methane,
LLC,

a Delaware limited liability
company, Hennepin County District Court

NEO Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG
Energy, brought this lawsuit in January of 2001. NEO has
asserted claims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent misrepresentations
and omissions, defamation, business disparagement and derivative
claims. Fortistar Methane, LLC denied NEO’s claims and
counterclaimed alleging breach of contract, fraud, negligent
misrepresentation and breach of warranty. NEO has denied
Fortistar Methane’s claims and intends to pursue its
claims. Discovery has not been conducted. The parties entered
into a conditional, confidential settlement of this matter and
the Fortistar Capital action, described above. The agreement,
however, was subject to necessary board and lender approvals.
NEO was unable to obtain necessary approvals. Fortistar Methane
has moved to enforce the settlement, seeking damages against NRG
Energy in excess of $35 million plus interest and
attorneys’ fees. NRG Energy and NEO are opposing
Fortistar’s motion on the grounds that conditions to
contract performance were not met. No decision has been rendered
on the pending motion. NRG Energy cannot predict the likelihood
of an unfavorable outcome.

Connecticut Light & Power
Company v. NRG Power Marketing
Inc.,

Docket No. 3:01-CV-2373
(A WT), pending in the United States District Court,
District of Connecticut

This matter involves a claim by Connecticut
Light & Power Company for recovery of amounts it claims
is owing for congestion charges under the terms of a Standard
Offer Services contract between the parties, dated
October 29, 1999. CL&P has served and filed its motion
for summary judgment to which NRG Power Marketing filed a
response on March 21, 2003. CL&P has offset
approximately $30 million from amounts owed to NRG Power
Marketing claiming that it has the right to offset those amounts
under the contract. NRG Power Marketing has counterclaimed
seeking to recover those amounts, arguing among other things
that CL&P has no rights under the contract to offset them.
NRG Power Marketing cannot estimate at this time the likelihood
of an unfavorable outcome in this matter, or the overall
exposure for congestion charges for the full term of the
contract.

The State of New York and Erin M. Crotty,
as Commissioner of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation v. Niagara Mohawk Power
Corporation et al.,

United States
District Court for the Western District of New York, Civil
Action No. 02-CV-002S

In January, 2002, NRG Energy and Niagara Mohawk
Power Corporation (“NiMo”) were sued by the New York
Department of Environmental Conservation in federal court in New
York. The complaint asserts that projects undertaken at NRG
Energy’s Huntley and Dunkirk plants by NiMo, the former
owner of the facilities, should have been permitted pursuant to
the Clean Air Act and that the failure to do so violated federal
and state laws. In July, 2002, NRG Energy filed a motion to
dismiss. The motion is still pending before the judge and there
has been no further action taken in connection with the case. On
March 27, 2003 the court dismissed the complaint against
NRG Energy without prejudice. It is possible the state will
appeal this dismissal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals or
re-file a case against NRG Energy. If the case ultimately is
litigated to a judgment and there is an unfavorable outcome that
could not be addressed through use of compliant fuels and/or a
plantwide applicability limit, NRG Energy has estimated that the
total investment that would be required to install pollution
control devices could be as high as $300 million over a ten
to twelve-year period, and NRG Energy may be responsible for
payment of certain penalties and fines.



Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation v.
NRG Energy, Inc., Huntley Power, LLC, and Dunkirk Power,
LLC,

Supreme Court, State of New York,
County of Onondaga, Case No. 2001-4372

NRG Energy has asserted that NiMo is obligated to
indemnify it for any related compliance costs associated with
resolution of the enforcement action. NiMo has filed suit in
state court in New York seeking a declaratory judgment with
respect to its obligations to indemnify NRG Energy under the
asset sales agreement.

Huntley Power LLC, Dunkirk Power LLC and
Oswego Harbor Power LLC

All three of these facilities have been issued
Notices of Violation with respect to opacity exceedances. NRG
Energy has been engaged in consent order negotiations with the
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation relative
to opacity issues affecting all three facilities periodically
since 1999. One proposed consent order was forwarded by DEC
under cover of a letter dated January 22, 2002, which makes
reference to 7,890 violations at the three facilities and
contains a proposed payable penalty for such violations of
$900,000. On February 5, 2003, DEC sent to us a proposed
Schedule of Compliance and asserted that it is to be used in
conjunction with newly-drafted consent orders. NRG Energy has
not yet received the consent orders although NRG Energy has been
told by DEC that DEC is now seeking a penalty in excess of that
cited in its January 22, 2002 letter. NRG Energy expects to
continue negotiations with DEC regarding the proposed consent
orders, including the Schedule of Compliance and the penalty
amount. NRG Energy cannot predict whether those discussions with
the DEC will result in a settlement and, if they do, what
sanctions will be imposed. In the event that the consent order
negotiations are unsuccessful, NRG Energy does not know what
relief DEC will seek through an enforcement action and what the
result of such action will be.

Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation v.
Dunkirk Power LLC, et al.,

Supreme Court, Erie County, Index No. 1-2000-8681

On October 2, 2000, plaintiff Niagara Mohawk
Power Corporation commenced this action against NRG Energy to
recover damages, plus late fees, less payments received, through
the date of judgment, as well as any additional amounts due and
owing for electric service provided to the Dunkirk Plant after
September 18, 2000. Plaintiff Niagara Mohawk claims that
NRG Energy has failed to pay retail tariff amounts for utility
services commencing on or about June 11, 1999 and
continuing to September 18, 2000 and thereafter. Plaintiff
has alleged breach of contract, suit on account, violation of
statutory duty, and unjust enrichment claims. On or about
October 23, 2000, NRG Energy served an answer denying
liability and asserting affirmative defenses.

After proceeding through discovery, and prior to
trial, the parties and the court entered into a stipulation and
order filed August 9, 2002 consolidating this action with
two other actions against the Company’s Huntley and Oswego
subsidiaries, both of which cases assert the same claims and
legal theories for failure to pay retail tariffs for utility
services.

On October 8, 2002, a Stipulation and Order
was filed in the Erie County Clerk’s Office staying this
action pending submission of some or all of the disputes in the
action to the FERC. NRG Energy cannot make an evaluation of the
likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. The cumulative potential
loss could exceed $35 million.

Pointe Coupee Parish Police Jury and
Louisiana Generating, LLC v. United States Environmental
Protection Agency and Christine Todd Whitman,
Administrator,

Adversary Proceeding
No. 02-61021 on the docket of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit

On December 2, 2002, a Petition for Review
was filed to appeal the United States Environmental Protection
Agency’s approval of the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality’s (“DEQ”) revisions to the
Baton Rouge State Implementation Plan (“SIP”). Pointe
Coupee and NRG Energy’s subsidiary, Louisiana Generating,
object to the approval of SIP Section

4.2.1. Permitting
NO

x

Sources

that purports to require DEQ
to obtain offsets of major increases in emissions of nitrogen
oxides (NO

x

) associated with major modifications of
existing facilities or construction of new facilities both in
the Baton Rouge Ozone Nonattainment Area and in four adjoining
attainment parishes referred to as the Region of Influence,



including Pointe Coupee Parish. The
plaintiffs’ challenge is based on DEQ’s failure to
comply with Administrative Procedures Act requirements related
to rulemaking and EPA’s regulations which prohibit EPA from
approving a SIP not prepared in accordance with state law. The
court granted a sixty (60) day stay of this proceeding on
February 25, 2003 to allow the parties to conduct
settlement discussions. At this time, NRG Energy is unable to
predict the eventual outcome of this matter or the potential
loss contingencies, if any, to which the Company may be subject.

In the Matter of Louisiana Generating,
LLC,

Adversary Proceeding
No. 2002-1095 1-EQ on the docket of the Louisiana Division
of Administrative Law

During 2000, DEQ issued a Part 70 Air Permit
modification to Louisiana Generating to construct and operate
two 240 MW natural gas-fired turbines. The Part 70 Air
Permit set emissions limits for the criteria air pollutants,
including NO

x

, based on the application of Best
Available Control Technology (“BACT”). The BACT
limitation for NO

x

was based on the guarantees of the
manufacturer, Siemens-Westinghouse. Louisiana Generating sought
an interim emissions limit to allow Siemens-Westinghouse time to
install additional control equipment. To establish the interim
limit, DEQ issued a Compliance Order and Notice of Potential
Penalty, No. AE-CN-02-0022, on September 8, 2002,
which is, in part, subject to the referenced administrative
hearing. DEQ alleged that Louisiana Generating did not meet its
NO

x

emissions limit on certain days, did not conduct
all opacity monitoring and did not complete all record keeping
and certification requirements. Louisiana Generating intends to
vigorously defend certain claims and any future penalty
assessment, while also seeking an amendment of its limit for
NO

x

. An initial status conference has been held with
the Administrative Law Judge and quarterly reports will be
submitted to describe progress, including settlement and
amendment of the limit. In addition, NRG Energy may assert
breach of warranty claims against the manufacturer. With respect
to the administrative action described above, at this time NRG
Energy is unable to predict the eventual outcome of this matter
or the potential loss contingencies, if any, to which the
Company may be subject.

NRG Sterlington Power, LLC

During 2002, NRG Sterlington conducted a review
of the Sterlington Power Facility’s Part 70 Air Permit
obtained by the facility’s former owner and operator, Koch
Power, Inc. Koch had outlined a plan to install eight 25
megawatt (MW) turbines to reach a 200 MW limit in the
permit. Due to the inability of several units to reach their
nameplate capacity, Koch determined that it would need
additional units to reach the electric output target. In August
2000, NRG Sterlington acquired the remaining interests in the
facility not originally held on a passive basis and sought the
transfer of the Part 70 Air Permit along with a
modification to incorporate two 17.5 MW turbines installed
by Koch and to increase the total number of turbines to ten. The
permit modification was issued February 13, 2002. During
further review, NRG Sterlington determined that a ninth unit had
been installed prior to issuance of the permit modification. In
keeping with its environmental policy, it disclosed this matter
to DEQ during April, 2002. Additional information was provided
during July 2002. As DEQ has not acted to date to institute an
enforcement proceeding, NRG Energy suspects that it may not.
However, as it is not time barred from doing so, NRG Energy is
unable at this time to predict the eventual outcome or potential
loss contingencies, if any, to which the Company may be subject.

FERC Investigation of Saguaro Power
Company

On February 24, 2003, FERC initiated an
investigation into whether Saguaro Power Company satisfied or
currently satisfies the statutory and regulatory requirements
for a qualifying facility under the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978 (“PURPA”). PURPA provides special
benefits for qualifying facilities regarding their rights to
sell the electrical output of generation projects to electric
utilities and exempts qualifying facilities from certain state
and federal regulation. NRG Energy’s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Eastern Sierra Power Company, owns a 49% general
partnership interest and a 1% limited partnership interest in
Saguaro. The FERC Order initiating the investigation notes that
certain financing arrangements between Enron North America and
Boulder Power LLC, an indirect owner of a 14% general
partnership interest and a 1% limited partnership interest in
Saguaro, may have caused Saguaro not to meet the limitations on
electric



utility ownership applicable to qualifying
facilities under PURPA and FERC regulations. At this time, NRG
Energy is unable to predict the likelihood of an unfavorable
outcome of this matter or the remedies that the FERC would
impose in the event it found that Sagauro did not or does not
satisfy the requirements for a qualifying facility.

Stone & Webster, Inc. and Shaw
Constructors, Inc. v. NRG Energy, Inc.
et al.

On October 17, 2002, Stone &
Webster, Inc. and Shaw Constructors, Inc. filed a lawsuit
against NRG Energy, Xcel Energy, Inc., NRG Granite Acquisition
LLC, Granite Power Partners II LP and two of Xcel
Energy’s executives relating to the construction of a power
plant in Pike County, Mississippi. Plaintiffs generally allege
that they were not paid for work performed to construct the
power plant, and have sued the parent entities of the company
with which they contracted to build the plant in order to
recover amounts allegedly owing. Plaintiffs assert claims for
breach of fiduciary duty, piercing the corporate veil, breach of
contract, tortious interference with contract, enforcement of
the NRG Energy guaranty, detrimental reliance, negligent or
intentional misrepresentation, conspiracy, and aiding and
abetting. On December 23, 2002, NRG Energy moved to dismiss
the complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim upon
which relief can be granted. NRG Energy is currently awaiting
plaintiffs’ response to the motion. No trial date has yet
been set in this matter and NRG Energy cannot presently predict
the outcome of the dispute.

The Mississippi Involuntary Case

On October 17, 2002, a petition commencing
an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Chapter 7
of the Bankruptcy Code was filed against LSP-Pike Energy, LLC, a
subsidiary of NRG Energy, by Stone & Webster, Inc. and
Shaw Constructors, Inc. — the joining petitioners in
the Minnesota involuntary case described above — in
the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi. In their petition filed with the Mississippi
Bankruptcy Court, the joining petitioners sought recovery of
allegedly unpaid contractual construction-related obligations in
an aggregate amount of $73,833,328, which amount LSP-Pike
Energy, LLC has disputed. LSP-Pike Energy, LLC filed an answer
to the petition in the Mississippi involuntary case and served
various interrogatory and deposition discovery requests on the
joining petitioners. The Mississippi Bankruptcy Court has not
entered any order for relief in the Mississippi involuntary case.

FirstEnergy Arbitration Claim

On November 29, 2001, The Cleveland Electric
Illuminating Company, The Toledo Edison Company and FirstEnergy
Ventures (“Sellers”) entered into Purchase and Sale
Agreements with NRG Able Acquisition LLC, which were guaranteed
by NRG (collectively, “Purchasers”), for the purchase
of certain power plants for approximately $1.5 billion. On
August 8, 2002, Sellers terminated the agreements and
asserted that Purchasers were liable for anticipatory breach of
the Purchase and Sale Agreements on the grounds that they could
not finance the purchases. On August 8, 2002, Purchasers
provided notice that they disagreed with Sellers’
assertion. After Sellers filed a motion seeking a waiver of the
automatic stay of Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, on
February 21, 2003, Sellers, NRG Energy, and NRG Northern
Ohio Generating LLC, f/k/a/ NRG Able, stipulated to the
United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Minnesota, that they
would agree to a waiver of the automatic stay, thereby allowing
Sellers to commence arbitration against Purchasers regarding
their dispute. The collection of any award, however, would
remain fully subject to NRG Energy’s automatic stay. The
Bankruptcy Court approved the stipulation. On February 26,
2002, Sellers provided notice of their intent to commence
arbitration proceedings against Purchasers. Sellers have yet to
quantify their damage claim, though Sellers have stated publicly
that they will seek to recover several hundred million dollars.
NRG Energy cannot presently predict the outcome of this dispute.

General Electric Company and Siemens
Westinghouse Turbine Purchase Disputes

NRG Energy and/or its affiliates have entered
into several turbine purchase agreements with affiliates of
General Electric Company and Siemens Westinghouse Power
Corporation. GE and Siemens have notified NRG Energy that it is
in default under certain of those contracts, terminated such
contracts, and demanded



that NRG Energy pay the termination fees set
forth in such contracts. GE’s claim amounts to
$120 million and Siemens’ approximately
$45 million in cumulative termination charges. NRG Energy
cannot at this time estimate the likelihood of unfavorable
outcomes in these disputes.

Itiquira Energetica, S.A.

NRG Energy’s indirectly controlled Brazilian
project company, Itiquira Energetica S.A., the owner of a 156MW
hydro project in Brazil, is currently in arbitration with the
former EPC contractor for the project, Inepar Industria e
Construcoes (Inepar). The dispute was commenced by Itiquira in
September, 2002 and pertains to certain matters arising under
the former EPC contract. Itiquira principally asserts that
Inepar breached the contract and caused damages to Itiquira by
(i) failing to meet milestones for substantial completion;
(ii) failing to provide adequate resources to meet such
milestones; (iii) failing to pay subcontractors amounts
due; and (iv) being insolvent. Itiquira’s arbitration
claim is for approximately US$40 million. Inepar has
asserted in the arbitration that Itiquira breached the contact
and caused damages to Inepar by failing to recognize events of
force majeure as grounds for excused delay and extensions of
scope of services and material under the contract. Inepar’s
damage claim is for approximately US$10 million. On
November 12, 2002, Inepar submitted its affirmative
statement of claim, and Itiquira submitted its response and
statement of counterclaims on December 14, 2002. Inepar
replied to Itiquira’s response and counterclaims on
January 14, 2003. Itiquira is to submit its reply to
Inepar’s January 14 filing on March 14, 2003, and
a hearing was held on March 21, 2003. NRG Energy cannot at
this time estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in
this dispute.

NRG Energy Credit Defaults

NRG Energy and various of its subsidiaries are in
default under various of their credit facilities, financial
instruments, construction agreements and other contracts, which
have given rise to liens, claims and contingencies against them
and may in the future give rise to additional liens, claims and
contingencies against them. In addition, NRG Energy and various
of its subsidiaries have entered into various guarantees, equity
contribution agreements, and other financial support agreements
with respect to the obligations of their affiliates, which have
given rise to liens, claims and contingencies against them and
may in the future give rise to additional liens, claims and
contingencies against the party or parties providing the
financial support. NRG Energy cannot at this time predict the
outcome or financial impact of these matters.

Item 7 —

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Due to the factors discussed below, as well as
other matters discussed herein, NRG Energy’s financial
condition has deteriorated significantly in the recent past. See
“Liquidity” below. As a result, NRG Energy does not
contemplate that it will have sufficient funds to make required
principal and interest payments on its corporate debt, which
means that NRG Energy will remain in default of the various
corporate level debt obligations discussed more fully herein. In
the absence of a consensual out of court restructuring or a
Chapter 11 reorganization, it is highly likely that NRG
Energy will be required to commence chapter 11 bankruptcy
cases to allow it to implement its own plan of reorganization.
The commencement of a voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceeding without a consensual plan of reorganization will
increase the possibility of a prolonged bankruptcy proceeding.

Industry Dynamics

An unregulated merchant power company in the
United States can be characterized in two ways, as a generator
or as an energy merchant, with some companies having
characteristics of both. In the United States generators are
either outgrowths of regulated utilities, developers or are
independent aggregators of plants divested by utilities.
Generators have grown through acquisitions or the construction
of new power plants. Energy merchants have emphasized risk
management and trading skills over the ownership of physical
assets. Energy deregulation paved the way for development of
these companies, with utilities in some regions forced to sell
off some of their generating capacity and buy electricity on the
wholesale market or through power procurement agreements.



Both generators and energy merchants prospered in
the late 1990’s. Starting in 1999, however, a number of
factors began to arise which had a negative effect on the
business model for merchant power companies. These factors
included:

California

—
When California restructured its electricity industry in the
mid-1990’s, it required utilities to sell generation assets
and buy electricity on the wholesale spot market, without the
stability of long-term contracts. At the time, California had
adequate supplies of power, but the State of California was
experiencing unusually high electricity demand growth while new
capacity additions were not keeping pace. Supply began to lag
behind demand, and previously moderate weather gave way to dryer
conditions, reducing hydroelectric supply. Shortages and
blackouts ensued in 1999 and 2000. Meanwhile, as wholesale
electricity prices moved higher, utilities were not allowed to
pass higher costs on to consumers under California’s
regulatory regime. Utilities were unable to bear the financial
burden, PG&E sought Chapter 11 protection, and
California took over the role of procuring electricity for the
utilities. Politicians have criticized the electricity
generators and the energy merchants, accusing them of improperly
manipulating supply, demand and market rules. Merchant power
companies in California are now embroiled in protracted
litigation with California and private parties, which is
discouraging new investment.

Economy

—
The United States economy, already headed towards a recession by
mid-2001, suffered a heavy blow on September 11, 2001.
This, along with a decrease in economically driven electricity
demand, exacerbated the drop in stock valuations of the energy
merchants. Other regions of the world economy have suffered
problems as well, which has exposed companies with international
assets to losses based on severe currency fluctuations.

Weather

—
On the whole, the summer of 2001, the winter of 2001/2002 and
the summer of 2002 were mild in the United States. This together
with excessive new construction in many markets has driven down
energy prices significantly.

Enron

—
The bankruptcy of Enron has devastated the merchant power
industry. The public and political perception created by Enron
put a stigma on the industry, drove investors away and increased
scrutiny of the industry. Enron also played a key role in the
energy trading markets, providing a widely used electronic
trading platform that accounted for an enormous amount of
trading volume. No other company has stepped in to fill this
role, and as a result the electricity markets have become far
less efficient and liquid.

Credit
ratings

— The credit rating
agencies were sharply criticized for not foreseeing Enron’s
problems. As a result, the agencies have been quick to
scrutinize the rest of the industry, and have tightened their
criteria for creditworthiness. The agencies have downgraded
most, if not all, of the industry participants. Many of these
downgrades were severe — ratings at times were dropped
several notches at once, or dropped more than once in a span of
weeks. This has resulted in most of the energy companies,
generators and merchants having non-investment grade credit
ratings at this time.

Oversupply

—
As wholesale electricity prices and market liquidity increased
in the late 1990’s the industry went on a building boom.
Through 2001 capital was readily available for the industry,
encouraging companies to build new generation facilities. The
years 2000 and 2001 saw record megawatt capacity additions in
the United States, and record years were on the horizon for 2002
and 2003. Even with steady economic growth this would have
created an oversupply of generation. Limited economic growth and
recession have exacerbated the oversupply situation.

Results of Operations

For the Year Ended December 31, 2002
    Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001

Net Loss

During the year ended December 31, 2002, NRG
Energy recognized a net loss of $3,464.3 million. This loss
represented a decrease in earnings of $3,729.5 million
compared to net income of $265.2 million for the same
period in 2001. NRG Energy’s loss from continuing
operations was $2,907.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 compared to net income of
$218.2 million from continuing operations for the same
period



in 2001. The loss from continuing operations
incurred during 2002 primarily consists of $2,656.1 million
of special charges comprised primarily of asset impairments.

During 2002, NRG Energy’s continuing
operations experienced less favorable results than those
experienced during the same period 2001. Overall, NRG
Energy’s domestic power generation operations were less
favorable than compared to the same period in 2001. NRG
Energy’s domestic operations experienced reductions in
domestic energy and capacity sales and an overall decrease in
power pool prices and related spark spreads (the monetary
difference between the price of power and fuel cost). During the
fourth quarter of 2002, an additional reserve for uncollectible
receivables in California was established by West Coast Power,
which reduced NRG Energy’s equity earnings by approximately
$58.5 million on a pre-tax basis. In addition, West Coast
Power’s results were already less than those recorded in
2001 due to less favorable contracts and reductions in sales of
energy and capacity. In addition, increased administrative
costs, depreciation and interest expense from completed
construction costs also contributed to the less than favorable
results in 2002. Partially off setting these earnings reductions
was the recognition, in the fourth quarter of 2002, of
approximately $51 million of additional revenues related to
the contractual termination of a power purchase agreement with
NRG Energy’s Indian River project.

During the third quarter of 2002, NRG Energy
experienced credit rating downgrades, defaults under certain
credit agreements, increased collateral requirements and reduced
liquidity. These events led to impairments on a number of NRG
Energy assets, resulting in pre-tax charges related to
continuing operations of approximately $2,544.8 million
during 2002. In addition, approximately $196.2 million of
net losses on sales and write-downs of equity method investments
were recorded in 2002. Operating results of majority owned
projects that were sold or have met the criteria to be
considered as held-for-sale have been classified as discontinued
operations.

As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy’s
Killingholme project and Hsin Yu project were classified as held
for sale. The sales of Bulo Bulo, Csepel, Entrade and Crockett
had been completed. In addition, the sale of NRG Energy’s
investments in Mt. Poso, Collinsville, EDL, Sabine River Works,
Kingston and NEO MESI had also taken place. The sale of NRG
Energy’s investment in ECKG was pending at the end of 2002,
and was completed in January 2003, along with the transfer of
NRG Energy’s ownership interest in the Killingholme and the
transfer of the ownership interest in the Brazos Valley project
to its lenders.

During 2002, NRG Energy expensed approximately
$111.3 million in 2002 for costs related to its financial
restructuring. These costs include expenses for financial and
legal advisors, contract termination costs, employee separation
and other restructuring activities.

Revenues and Equity in Earnings of
    Unconsolidated Affiliates

During 2002, total operating revenues and equity
earnings from continuing operations were $2,281.1 million
compared to $2,411.5 million in the prior year, a decrease
of $130.4 million, or 5.4%. The primary reason for this
decrease was a reduction in Equity earnings from unconsolidated
affiliates of $141.0 million. The $141.0 million
decrease in equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates is
due primarily to lower results at West Coast Power in 2002 as
compared to the same period in 2001. During 2002, West Coast
Power had long-term contracts that were less favorable than
those held in 2001. In addition during 2002, West Coast Power
also established reserves for certain receivables not considered
recoverable. NRG Energy’s share of this reserve was
approximately $58.5 million on a pre-tax basis.

Revenues from Majority-Owned
    Operations

NRG Energy’s operating revenues from
majority-owned operations were $2,212.2 million in 2002
compared to $2,201.4 million in the prior year, an increase
of $10.8 million or approximately 0.5%. Revenues from
majority-owned operations for the year ended December 31,
2002, consisted primarily of power generation revenues from
domestic operations of approximately $1,650.9 million in
2002 compared with $1,679.6 million in 2001, a decrease of
$28.7 million. This decrease in domestic generation revenue
is due to reductions in energy and capacity sales and an overall
decrease in power pool prices.



Within the North American Segment, NRG
Energy’s Eastern region revenues decreased by approximately
20.9%. The Eastern region revenues were significantly affected
by a combination of lower capacity revenues and a decline in
megawatt hour generation compared with 2001. This decline in
generation is attributable to an unseasonably warm winter and
cooler spring and a slowing economy which reduced demand for
electricity, together with new regulation which reduced price
volatility, particularly in New York City. The Central region
generated increased revenues of 39.9% primarily due to a full
year of operations compared to plants acquired and completed in
2001.

NRG Energy’s International revenues from
majority owned operations increased by $22.4 million or
7.1% from 2001 to 2002. The Asia Pacific region reported a
reduction in revenues of $42.4 million while increases were
reported from Europe of $34.9 million and Other Americas of
$29.9 million. The reduction in Asia Pacific revenue is
primarily due to a decline in energy prices and the loss of a
significant contract at Flinders. The increase in Europe and
other Americas revenue is primarily due to a full year of
operations for acquisitions made in 2001.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated
    Affiliates

For the year ended December 31, 2002, NRG
Energy had equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of
$69.0 million, compared to $210.0 million for 2001, a
decrease of $141.0 million or approximately 67.1%. The
$141.1 million decrease in Equity earnings from
unconsolidated affiliates is due primarily to unfavorable
results at West Coast Power in 2002 as compared to the same
period in 2001. During 2002, West Coast Power had long-term
contracts that were less favorable than those held in 2001. In
addition during 2002, West Coast Power established reserves for
certain receivables not considered recoverable. NRG
Energy’s share of this reserve was approximately
$58.5 million on a pre-tax basis.

Operating Costs and Expenses

For the year ended December 31, 2002, cost
of majority-owned operations related to continuing operations
was $1,510.6 million compared to $1,430.0 million for
2001, an increase of $80.6 million or approximately 5.6%.
For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, cost of
majority-owned operations represented approximately 68.3% and
65.0% of revenues from majority-owned operations, respectively.
Cost of majority-owned operations consists primarily of cost of
energy (primarily fuel costs), labor, operating and maintenance
costs and non-income based taxes related to NRG Energy’s
majority-owned operations.

Cost of energy increased from $974.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2001 to
$1,015.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
This represents an increase of $40.5 million or 4.2%. As a
percent of revenue from majority owned operations cost of energy
was 45.9% and 44.2% for the years ended December 31, 2002
and 2001, respectively.

Operating and maintenance costs increased from
$356.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 to
$415.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
This represents an increase of $58.9 million or 16.5%. As a
percent of revenue from majority owned operations, operating and
maintenance costs represented 18.8% and 16.2%, for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The dollar
increase in operating and maintenance expense is primarily due
to a full year of expense in 2002 related to assets acquired
during 2001.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
depreciation and amortization related to continuing operations
was $256.2 million, compared to $169.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of
$86.6 million or approximately 51.1%. This increase is
primarily due to the addition of property, plant and equipment
related to NRG Energy’s recently completed acquisitions of
electric generating facilities.

General, Administrative and
    Development

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
general, administrative and development costs were
$250.1 million, compared to $193.9 million, an
increase of $56.2 million or approximately 29.0%. For the
year ended



December 31, 2002 and 2001, general,
administrative and development costs represent 11.3% and 8.8% of
revenues from majority-owned operations, respectively. This
increase is primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of
approximately $39.2 million over 2001. Additionally there
was an increase in other general administrative expenses due to
2001 acquisitions, newly constructed facilities coming on line.
These increases were partially offset by decreases in business
development expenses and other reductions to costs previously
incurred to support international and expanded operations.

Write-Downs and Losses on Sales of Equity
    Method Investments

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
write-downs and losses on equity method investments were
$196.2 million. The $196.2 million charge consists
primarily of write downs taken related to NRG Energy’s
investment in Loy Yang in the total amount of
$111.4 million. In addition, NRG Energy recorded a loss of
$48.4 million upon the transfer of its investment in SRW
Cogeneration and recorded write-downs of $14.2 million and
$3.6 million of its investments in EDL and Collinsville,
respectively.

Special Charges

During the third quarter of 2002, NRG Energy
experienced credit rating downgrades, defaults under certain
credit agreements, increased collateral requirements and reduced
liquidity. NRG Energy applied the provisions of
SFAS No. 144 to its construction and operational
projects. NRG Energy completed an analysis of the recoverability
of the asset carrying values of its projects factoring in the
probability of different courses of action available to NRG
Energy given its financial position and liquidity constraints.
As a result, NRG Energy determined during the third quarter that
many of its construction projects and certain operational
projects were impaired and should be written down to fair market
value. To estimate fair value, NRG Energy management considered
discounted cash flow analyses, bids and offers related to those
projects and prices of similar assets. During 2002, NRG Energy
recorded asset impairment and other special charges related to
continuing operations of $2,656.1 million. See
Item 15 — Note 3 to the Consolidated
financial statements and notes of this Form 10-K for
additional information.

Additional asset impairments and other charges
may be recorded by NRG Energy in periods subsequent to
December 31, 2002, given the changing business conditions
and the resolution of the pending restructuring plan. Management
is unable to determine the possible magnitude of any additional
asset impairments.

During 2002, NRG Energy expensed charges of
$25.6 million for expected severance costs, primarily
related to terminated executives, associated with the
restructuring of NRG Energy, and of this amount,
$4.7 million of cash was paid as of December 31, 2002.

In addition to asset impairment charges and
severance costs, NRG Energy has incurred $85.8 million of
restructuring costs consisting of financial and legal advisor
fees, contract termination fees and other such costs. NRG Energy
expects that costs such as these will continue for the near term
as NRG Energy continues to restructure its operations.

NRG Energy is also impacted by rule/tariff
changes that occur in the existing ISOs. On March 1, 2003,
ISO-NE implemented its version of Standard Market Design. This
change dramatically modifies the New England market
structure by incorporating Locational Marginal Pricing
(LMP — pricing by location rather than on a New
England wide basis.) Even though NRG Energy views this change as
a significant improvement to the existing market design, NRG
Energy still views the market within New England as
insufficient to allow for NRG Energy to recover its costs and
earn a reasonable return on investment. Consequently, on
February 26, 2003, NRG Energy filed and requested a cost of
service rate with FERC for most of its Connecticut fleet,
requesting a February 27th effective date. NRG Energy
remains committed to working with ISO-NE, FERC and other
stakeholders to continue to improve the New England market
that will hopefully make further reliance on a cost of service
rate unnecessary. While NRG Energy has the right to file for
such rate treatment, there are no assurances that FERC will
grant such rates in the form or amount that NRG Energy
petitioned for in its filing. If FERC declines to grant cost of
service based rates in Connecticut, there may be additional
impairments related to the Connecticut assets.



On March 25, 2003, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) issued an order (the
“Order”) in response to Devon Power LLC’s,
Middletown Power LLC’s, Montville Power LLC’s, and
Norwalk Power LLC’s (collectively, “NRG
Subsidiaries”) Joint Motion for Emergency Expedited
Issuance of Order by March 17, 2003 in
Docket No. ER03-563-000 (the “Emergency
Motion”). In the Emergency Motion, the NRG Subsidiaries
requested that FERC accept the NRG Subsidiaries’
reliability must-run agreements and assure the NRG
Subsidiaries’ recovery of maintenance costs for their New
England generating facilities prior to the peak summer season.
FERC accepted the NRG Subsidiaries’ filing as to the
recovery of spring 2003 maintenance costs, subject to refund.
FERC’s Order authorizes the ISO New England Inc. to begin
collecting these maintenance costs in escrow for the benefit of
the NRG Subsidiaries as of February 27, 2003. Several
intervenors protested the Emergency Motion. FERC will rule on
such protests and the other issues raised in the Emergency
Motion in a subsequent order.

Other Income (Expense)

For the year ended December 31, 2002, total
other expense was $485.0 million, compared to
$371.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001,
an increase of $113.3 million or approximately 30.5%. The
increase in total other expense from 2001 consisted primarily of
an increase in interest expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
interest expense (which includes both corporate and project
level interest expense) was $494.0 million, compared to
$389.3 million in 2001, an increase of $104.7 million
or approximately 26.9%. This increase is due primarily to
increased corporate and project level debt. NRG Energy issued
substantial amounts of long-term debt at both the corporate
level (recourse debt) and project level (non-recourse debt) to
either directly finance the acquisition of electric generating
facilities or refinance short-term bridge loans incurred to
finance such acquisitions.

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries was a
gain of $4.8 million, compared to a loss of
$2.3 million, an increase of $7.1 million, as compared
to 2001. The decrease is primarily due to lower earnings from
Timber Energy Resources, as compared to 2001.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, other
income, net, was a gain of $4.2 million, as compared to
$19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a
decrease of $15.7 million, or approximately 78.9%. Other
income, net consists primarily of interest income on cash
balances and realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange
gains and losses.

Income tax

It is likely that Xcel Energy will not request
Internal Revenue Service consent to consolidate NRG Energy for
income tax purposes for 2002. Therefore, the income tax
provision for NRG Energy is based on a consolidated NRG Energy
group through June 3, 2002, and separate income tax returns
starting June 4, 2002. On a stand-alone basis, it is
uncertain if NRG Energy would be able to fully realize tax
benefits on its losses and therefore a valuation allowance has
been provided.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, income
tax benefit from continuing operations was $165.4 million,
compared to an income tax expense of $28.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of
$193.5 million. NRG Energy recorded an income tax benefit
in 2002 for operating losses to the extent realization was
considered more likely than not. Tax benefits were not recorded
for items NRG was uncertain that there would be sufficient
operating losses to offset operating income in future periods.

Discontinued Operations

As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy has
classified the operations and gains/losses recognized on the
sales of certain entities as discontinued operations.
Discontinued operations consist of the historical operations and
net gains/losses related to its Crockett Cogeneration, Entrade,
Killingholme, Csepel, Hsin Yu and Bulo Bulo projects that were
sold in 2002 or were deemed to have met the required criteria
for such classification



pending final disposition (the Killingholme and
Hsin Yu projects). For 2002, the results of operations related
to such discontinued operations was a net loss of
$556.6 million as compared to a gain of $47.0 million
for the same period in 2001. The primary reason for the loss
recognized in 2002 is due to asset impairments recorded at
Killingholme and Hsin Yu.

For the Year Ended December 31, 2001
    Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2000

Net Income

Net income for 2001 was $265.2 million,
compared to $182.9 million for 2000, an increase of
$82.3 million or approximately 45.0%. Net income for 2001
increased by $82.3 million due to the factors described
below.

Revenues and Equity in Earnings of
    Unconsolidated Affiliates

For the year ended December 31, 2001, NRG
Energy had total revenues and equity earnings from continuing
operations of $2,411.5 million, compared to
$1,810.1 million for 2000, an increase of
$601.4 million or approximately 33.2%.

Revenues from majority-owned
    operations

NRG Energy’s operating revenues from
majority-owned operations were $2,201.4 million compared to
$1,670.8 million, an increase of $530.6 million or
approximately 31.8%. Revenues from majority-owned operations for
the year ended December 31, 2001 consisted primarily of
power generation revenues from domestic operations of
approximately $1,679.6 million, operations in Europe of
$72.6 million, Asia-Pacific $214.8 million and Other
Americas $28.2 million, resulting in increases of
$231.3 million, $71.2 million, $120.0 million and
$27.9 million compared to 2000, respectively. In addition,
NRG Energy recognized revenues from majority-owned operations
from its alternative energy, thermal and other operations of
approximately $79.5 million, $108.3 million and
$18.5 million respectively, resulting in increases of
$45.1 million, $23.4 million and $11.7 million
compared to 2000, respectively.

The increase of $231.3 million related to
NRG Energy’s domestic power generation operations is due
primarily to additional sales at NRG Energy’s Eastern
region facilities which were acquired in June 2001 from Conectiv
and increased sales at NRG Energy’s South Central region
facilities which were primarily acquired in March 2000 from
Cajun Electric and expanded with the acquisition of the
Batesville facility from LS Power in January 2001 and completion
of the Sterlington and Big Cajun 1 peaking facilities in 2001.

The increase of $71.2 million related to NRG
Energy’s Europe power generation operations is due
primarily to operations at Saale Energie in Germany (SEG).

The increase of $120.0 million related to
NRG Energy’s Asia-Pacific’s power generation
operations is due primarily to a full year of operations at the
Flinders Power facilities which was acquired in August 2000.

The increase of $27.9 million related to NRG
Energy’s Other America’s power generation operations
is due primarily to the consolidation in 2001 of the COBEE
facility which was previously accounted for under the equity
method.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated
    Affiliates

For the year ended December 31, 2001, NRG
Energy had equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of
$210.0 million, compared to $139.4 million for 2000,
an increase of $70.6 million or approximately 50.6%. The
increase of $70.6 million is primarily comprised of
favorable results from NRG Energy’s domestic and
international power generation equity investments. During 2001,
NRG Energy’s domestic power generation investment in West
Coast Power contributed $41.0 million of this increase.
Additionally, approximately $40.2 million of the increase
is from NRG Energy’s international power generation
investments. These increases were partially offset by
unfavorable results at NRG Energy’s other investments
accounted for under



the equity method and continued reductions in the
equity earnings attributable to NEO Corporation. NEO Corporation
derives a significant portion of its net income from
Section 29 tax credits.

Operating Costs and Expenses

For the year ended December 31, 2001, cost
of majority-owned operations was $1,430.0 million compared
to $1,060.1 million for 2000, an increase of
$369.9 million or approximately 34.9%. For the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, cost of majority-owned
operations represented approximately 65.0% and 63.4% of revenues
from majority-owned operations, respectively. Cost of
majority-owned operations consists primarily of cost of energy
(primarily fuel costs), labor, operating and maintenance costs
and non-income based taxes related to NRG Energy’s
majority-owned operations.

Cost of energy increased from $718.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $974.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2001 primarily due to 2001
domestic and international acquisitions. This represents an
increase of $256.3 million or 35.7%. As a percent of
revenue from majority owned operations, cost of energy was 44.3%
and 43.0% for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Approximately 69.3% of the increase in operating
costs and expenses for 2001 compared to 2000 of
$369.9 million is primarily due to increased cost of energy.

Operating and maintenance costs increased from
$259.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to
$356.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
This represents an increase of $97.5 million or 37.6%. As a
percent of revenue from majority owned operations operating and
maintenance costs represented 16.2% and 15.5%, for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The dollar
increase in operating and maintenance expense is primarily due
to 2001 domestic and international acquisitions.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the year ended December 31, 2001,
depreciation and amortization from continuing operations was
$169.6 million, compared to $97.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $72.3 million
or approximately 74.3%. This increase is primarily due to the
addition of property, plant and equipment related to NRG
Energy’s recently completed acquisitions of electric
generating facilities.

General, Administrative and
    Development

For the year ended December 31, 2001,
general, administrative and development costs were
$193.9 million, compared to $169.0 million, an
increase of $24.9 million or approximately 14.7%. This
increase is primarily due to increased business development
activities, associated legal, technical and accounting expenses,
employees and equipment resulting from expanded operations and
pending acquisitions. This also includes a $10.3 million
expense related to Enron’s bankruptcy. This amount includes
a pre-tax charge of $22.4 million to establish bad debt
reserves, which was partially offset by a pre-tax gain of
$12.1 million on a credit swap agreement entered into as
part of the NRG Energy’s credit risk management program.

Other Income (Expense)

For the year ended December 31, 2001, total
other expense was $371.7 million, compared to
$245.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000,
an increase of $125.9 million or approximately 51.2%. The
increase in total other expense of $125.9 million, from
2000, consisted primarily of an increase in interest expense
that was partially offset by an increase in other income and a
reduction in minority interest in earnings of consolidated
subsidiaries.

For the year ended December 31, 2001,
interest expense (which includes both corporate and project
level interest expense) was $389.3 million, compared to
$250.8 million in 2000, an increase of $138.5 million
or approximately 55.2%. This increase is due to increased
corporate and project level debt issued during 2001. During
2001, NRG Energy issued substantial amounts of long-term debt at
both the corporate level (recourse debt) and project level
(non-recourse debt) to either directly finance the acquisition
of electric generating facilities or refinance short-term bridge
loans incurred to finance such acquisitions.



For the year ended December 31, 2001,
minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries was
$2.2 million, compared to $0.8 million, an increase of
$1.4 million or approximately 175.0%, as compared to 2000.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, other
income, net, was $19.9 million, as compared to
$5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an
increase of $14.1 million, or approximately 243.1%. Other
income, net, consists primarily of interest income on cash
balances and loans to affiliates, and miscellaneous other items,
including the income statement impact of certain foreign
currency translation adjustments and the impact of gains and
losses on the dispositions of investments. Approximately
$18.0 million of the increase relates to interest on cash
balances and loans to affiliates, primarily West Coast Power.
The increase also includes gains on foreign currency translation
adjustments and miscellaneous asset sales that were partially
offset by a $3.8 million charge to write-off capitalized
costs associated with the Estonia project.

Income Tax

For the year ended December 31, 2001, income
tax expense was $28.1 million, compared to an income tax
expense of $86.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000, a decrease of $58.8 million.
Approximately $14.7 million of the decrease is attributed
to additional IRC Section 29 energy credits that were
recorded in 2001, as compared to the same period in 2000. NRG
Energy reported a worldwide effective tax rate of approximately
11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to
approximately 36.5% for the year ended December 31, 2000.
The overall reduction in tax rates was primarily due to the
increase in energy credits, the implementation of state tax
planning strategies and a higher percentage of NRG Energy’s
overall earnings derived from foreign projects in lower tax
jurisdictions.

Discontinued Operations

Income from discontinued operations was
$47.0 million in 2001 compared to $32.0 million in
2000.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

NRG Energy’s discussion and analysis of its
financial condition and results of operations are based upon NRG
Energy’s consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The preparation of these
financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires
the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and
guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily
involves judgments regarding future events, including the
likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and
regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves,
could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures
based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use.
In addition, the financial and operating environment also may
have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the
business, but on the results reported through the application of
accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements
and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting
policies have not changed.

On an ongoing basis, NRG Energy, evaluates its
estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with
experts and other methods NRG Energy considers reasonable. In
any case, actual results may differ significantly from NRG
Energy’s estimates. Any effects on NRG Energy’s
business, financial position or results of operations resulting
from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in
which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.

NRG Energy’s significant accounting policies
are summarized in Item 15 — Note 2 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table
identifies certain of the significant accounting policies listed
in Item 15 — Note 2 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The table also identifies the judgments
required and uncertainties involved in the application of each.
These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and
judgments made by NRG Energy’s management in their
application, have a significant impact on NRG Energy’s
consolidated financial statements. NRG Energy identifies its
most critical accounting policies as those that are the most
pervasive and important to the portrayal of NRG Energy’s
financial position and



results of operations, and that require the most
difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management
regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Of all of the accounting policies identified in
the above table, NRG Energy believes that the following policies
and the application thereof to be those having the most direct
impact on NRG Energy’s financial position and results of
operations.

Capitalization Practices and Purchase
    Accounting

As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy has a
carrying value of approximately $6.8 billion of net
property, plant and equipment, $623.8 million of which is
under construction or turbines being marketed, representing
approximately 62.4% and 5.7% of total assets, respectively. The
majority of the carrying value of



property, plant and equipment is the result of
NRG Energy’s recent asset acquisitions and constructions.
These amounts represent the estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition and construction.

For those assets that were or are being
constructed by NRG Energy the carrying value reflects the
application of NRG Energy’s property, plant and equipment
policies which incorporate estimates, assumptions and judgments
by management relative to the capitalized costs and useful lives
of NRG Energy’s generating facilities. Interest incurred on
funds borrowed to finance projects expected to require more than
three months to complete is capitalized. Capitalization of
interest is discontinued when the asset under construction is
ready for its intended use or when construction is terminated.
Capitalized interest was approximately $64.8 million in
2002. Development costs and capitalized project costs include
third party professional services, permits, and other costs
which are incurred incidental to a particular project. Such
costs are expensed as incurred until an acquisition agreement or
letter of intent is signed, and the project has been approved by
NRG Energy’s Board of Directors. Additional costs incurred
after this point are capitalized. When a project begins
operation, previously capitalized project costs are reclassified
to equity investments in affiliates or property plant and
equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser
of the life of the project’s related assets or revenue
contract period.

Impairment of Long Lived
    Assets

NRG Energy evaluates property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever
indicators of impairment exist. Recoverability of assets to be
held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset, through considering project specific
assumptions for long-term power pool prices, escalated future
project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by
factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of
action available to NRG Energy. Generally, fair value will be
determined using valuation techniques such as the present value
of expected future cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less
the cost to sell. As of December 31, 2002, net income from
continuing operations was reduced by $2.5 billion due to
impairments recorded in 2002. Asset impairment evaluations are,
by nature highly subjective.

Revenue Recognition and Uncollectible
    Receivables

NRG Energy is primarily an electric generation
company, operating a portfolio of majority-owned electric
generating plants and certain plants in which its ownership is
50% or less which are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. NRG Energy also produces thermal energy for sale to
customers and collects methane gas from landfill sites, which is
then used for the generation of electricity. Both physical and
financial transactions are entered into to optimize the
financial performance of NRG Energy’s generating
facilities. Electric energy is recognized upon transmission to
the customer. Capacity and ancillary revenue is recognized when
contractually earned. Revenues from operations and maintenance
services is recognized when the services are performed. NRG
Energy uses the equity method of accounting to recognize its pro
rata share of the net income or loss of its unconsolidated
investments. NRG Energy continually assesses the collectibility
of its receivables, and in the event it believes a receivable to
be uncollectible, an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded
or, in the event of a contractual dispute, the receivable and
corresponding revenue may be considered unlikely of recovery and
not recorded in the financial statements until management is
satisfied that it will be collected.

Derivative Financial
    Instruments

In January 2001, NRG Energy adopted
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 137 and
SFAS No. 138. SFAS No. 133 requires NRG
Energy to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair
value. Changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivatives are
immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives accounted for as hedges are either recognized in
earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the
related hedged assets, liabilities and firm commitments or for
forecasted transactions, deferred and recorded as a component of
accumulated



other comprehensive income (OCI) until the
hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings. NRG
Energy primarily applies SFAS No. 133 to long-term
power sales contracts, long-term gas purchase contracts and
other energy related commodities and financial instruments used
to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot
market prices, hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities
and protect investments in fuel inventories.
SFAS No. 133 also applies to interest rate swaps and
foreign currency exchange rate contracts. The application of
SFAS No. 133 results in increased volatility in
earnings due to the impact market prices have on the market
positions and financial instruments that NRG Energy has entered
into. In determining the fair value of these
derivative/financial instruments NRG Energy uses estimates,
various assumptions, judgment of management and when considered
appropriate third party experts in determining the fair value of
these derivatives.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

In December 2001, Moody’s Investor Service
(Moody’s) placed NRG Energy’s long-term senior
unsecured debt rating on review for possible downgrade. In
response, Xcel Energy and NRG Energy put into effect a plan to
preserve NRG Energy’s investment grade rating and improve
its financial condition. This plan included financial support to
NRG Energy from Xcel Energy; marketing certain NRG Energy assets
for sale; canceling and deferring capital spending; and reducing
corporate expenses.

In response to a possible downgrade, during 2002,
Xcel Energy contributed $500 million to NRG Energy, and NRG
Energy and its subsidiaries sold assets and businesses that
provided NRG Energy in excess of $286 million in cash and
eliminated approximately $432.0 million in debt. NRG Energy
also cancelled or deferred construction of approximately
3,900 MW of new generation projects. On July 26, 2002,
Standard & Poors’ (S&P) downgraded NRG
Energy’s senior unsecured bonds to below investment grade,
and three days later Moody’s also downgraded NRG
Energy’s senior unsecured debt rating to below investment
grade. Since July 2002, NRG Energy senior unsecured debt, as
well as the secured NRG Northeast Generating LLC bonds and the
secured NRG South Central Generating LLC bonds and Secured LSP
Energy (Batesville) bonds were downgraded multiple times. After
NRG Energy failed to make payments due under certain unsecured
bond obligations on September 16, 2002, both Moody’s
and S&P lowered their ratings on NRG Energy’s and its
subsidiaries’ unsecured bonds once again. Currently, NRG
Energy’s unsecured bonds carry a rating of between CCC and
D at S&P and between Ca and C at Moody’s, depending on
the specific debt issue.

As a result of the downgrade of NRG Energy’s
credit rating, declining power prices, increasing fuel prices,
the overall down-turn in the energy industry, and the overall
down-turn in the economy, NRG Energy has experienced severe
financial difficulties. These difficulties have caused NRG
Energy to, among other things, miss scheduled principal and
interest payments due to its corporate lenders and bondholders,
prepay for fuel and other related delivery and transportation
services and provide performance collateral in certain instances
NRG Energy has also recorded asset impairment charges of
approximately $3.1 billion, related to various operating
projects as well as for projects that were under construction
which NRG Energy has stopped funding.



NRG Energy and its subsidiaries have failed to
timely make the following interest and/or principal payments on
its indebtedness:

These missed payments may have also resulted in
cross-defaults of numerous other non-recourse and limited
recourse debt instruments of NRG Energy. In addition, the
following issues have been accelerated, rendering the debt
immediately due and payable: on November 6, 2002, lenders
to NRG Energy accelerated the approximately $1.1 billion of
debt under the construction revolver facility; on
November 21, 2002, the bond trustee, on behalf of
bondholders, accelerated the approximately $750 million of
debt under the NRG South Central Generating, LLC facility; and
on February 27, 2003, ABN Amro as administrative agent,
accelerated the approximately $1.0 billion corporate
revolver financing facility.

Since September, the following payments were
made: on December 10, 2002, $16.0 million in interest,
principal, and swap payments were made from restricted cash
accounts in relation to the $325,000,000 Series A Floating
Rate Senior Secured Bonds due 2019, issued by NRG Peaker Finance
Company LLC (the “Peaker financing facility”); on
December 27, 2002, NRG Northeast made the $24.7 million
interest payment due on the NRG Northeast bonds but failed to
make the $53.5 million principal payment; in January 2003, the
South Central Generating bondholders unilaterally withdrew $35.6
million from a restricted revenue account relating to the
September 15, 2002 interest payment and fees; and on
March 17, 2003 South Central bondholders were paid $34.4
million due in relation to the March semi-annual interest
payment, but the $12.8 million principal payment was
deferred.

In addition to the payment defaults described
above, prior to the downgrades many corporate guarantees and
commitments of NRG Energy and its subsidiaries required that
they be supported or replaced with letters



of credit or cash collateral within 5 to
30 days of a ratings downgrade below Baa3 or BBB- by
Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, respectively.
As a result of the downgrades on July 26 and July 29,
NRG Energy received demands to post collateral aggregating
approximately $1.1 billion.

On August 19, 2002, NRG Energy executed a
Collateral Call Extension Letter (CCEL) with various
secured project lender groups in which the banks agreed to
extend until September 13, 2002, the deadline by which NRG
Energy was to post its approximately $1.0 billion of cash
collateral in connection with certain bank loan agreements.

Effective as of September 13, 2002, NRG
Energy and these various secured project lenders entered into a
Second Collateral Call Extension Letter (Second CCEL) that
extended the deadline until November 15, 2002. Under the
Second CCEL, NRG Energy agreed to submit to the lenders a
comprehensive restructuring plan. NRG Energy submitted this plan
on November 4, 2002 and continues to work with its lenders
and advisors on an overall restructuring of its debt (see
further discussion below). The November 15, 2002 deadline
of the second CCEL passed without NRG Energy posting the
required collateral. NRG Energy and the secured project lenders
continue to work toward a plan of restructuring.

In August 2002, NRG Energy retained financial and
legal restructuring advisors to assist its management in the
preparation of a comprehensive financial and operational
restructuring. NRG Energy and its advisors have been meeting
regularly to discuss restructuring issues with an ad hoc
committee of its bondholders and a steering committee of its
bank lenders (the Ad Hoc Creditors Committees).

To aid in the design and implementation of a
restructuring plan, in the fall of 2002, NRG Energy prepared a
comprehensive business plan and forecast. Anticipating that NRG
Energy’s creditors will own all or substantially all of NRG
Energy’s equity interests after implementing the
restructuring plan, any plans and efforts to integrate NRG
Energy’s business operations with those of Xcel Energy were
terminated. Using commodity, emission and capacity prices
provided by an independent energy consulting firm to develop
forecasted cash flow information, management concluded that the
forecasted free cash flow available to NRG Energy after
servicing project level obligations will be insufficient to
service recourse debt obligations at the NRG Energy corporate
level. Based on that forecast, it is anticipated that NRG Energy
will remain in default of the various corporate level debt
obligations discussed more fully herein.

Based on this information and in consultation
with Xcel Energy and its financial and legal restructuring
advisors, NRG Energy prepared a comprehensive financial
restructuring plan. In November 2002, NRG Energy and Xcel Energy
presented the plan to the Ad Hoc Creditors Committees. The
restructuring plan has served as a basis for continuing
negotiations between the Ad Hoc Creditors Committees, NRG Energy
and Xcel Energy related to a consensual plan of reorganization
for NRG Energy. Negotiations have progressed substantially since
the initial plan was presented in November. If an agreement to a
consensual plan of reorganization is negotiated and NRG Energy
is unable to effectuate the restructuring through an exchange
offer or other non-bankruptcy mechanism, it is highly probable
that such plan would be implemented through the commencement of
a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. There can be
no assurance that NRG Energy’s creditors, including, but
not limited to the Ad Hoc Committees, will agree to the terms of
the consensual plan of reorganization currently being
negotiated. In addition, there can be no guarantee that lenders
will not seek to enforce their remedies under the various loan
agreements, provided that any such attempted enforcement would
be subject to the automatic stay and other relevant provisions
of the bankruptcy code. The commencement of a voluntary
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding without a consensual plan
of reorganization would increase the possibility of a prolonged
bankruptcy proceeding.

On November 22, 2002, five former NRG Energy
executives filed an involuntary Chapter 11 petition against
NRG Energy in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Minnesota. Under provisions of federal law, NRG Energy has the
full authority to continue to operate its business as if the
involuntary petition had not been filed unless and until a court
hearing on the validity of the involuntary petition is resolved
adversely to NRG Energy. On December 16, 2002, NRG Energy
responded to the involuntary petition, contesting the
petitioners’ claims and filing a motion to dismiss the
case. On February 19, 2003, NRG Energy announced that it
had reached a settlement with the petitioners. The
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota will
hear NRG Energy’s motion to approve the settlement and
dismiss the involuntary petition. Two of NRG



Energy’s creditors have objected to the
motion to dismiss. There can be no assurance that the court will
dismiss the involuntary petition. The Bankruptcy Court has
discretion in the review and approval of the settlement
agreement. There is a risk that the Bankruptcy Court may, among
other things, reject the settlement agreement or enter an order
for relief under Chapter 11.

On March 26, 2003, Xcel Energy announced
that its board of directors had approved a tentative settlement
agreement with holders of most of NRG Energy’s long-term
notes and the steering committee representing NRG’s bank
lenders. The settlement is subject to certain conditions,
including the approval of at least a majority in dollar amount
of the NRG Energy bank lenders and long-term noteholders and
definitive documentation. There can be no assurance that such
approvals will be obtained. The terms of the settlement call for
Xcel Energy to make payments to NRG Energy over the next
13 months totaling up to $752 million for the benefit of
NRG Energy’s creditors in consideration for their waiver of
any existing and potential claims against Xcel Energy. Under the
settlement, Xcel Energy will make the following payments: (i)
$350 million at or shortly following the consummation of a
restructuring of NRG Energy’s debt. It is expected this
payment would be made prior to year-end 2003; (ii)
$50 million on January 1, 2004. At Xcel Energy’s
option, it may fill this requirement with either cash or Xcel
Energy common stock or any combination thereof; and (iii)
$352 million in April 2004.

Cash Flows

Historically, NRG Energy and its subsidiaries
have obtained cash from operations, issuance of debt and equity
securities, borrowings under credit facilities, capital
contributions from Xcel Energy, reimbursement by Xcel Energy of
tax benefits pursuant to a tax sharing agreement and proceeds
from non-recourse project financings. NRG Energy has used these
funds to finance operations, service debt obligations, fund the
acquisition, development and construction of generation
facilities, finance capital expenditures and meet other cash and
liquidity needs.

Net cash provided by operating activities
increased during 2002 compared with 2001, primarily due to NRG
Energy’s efforts to conserve cash by deferring the payment
of interest and managing its cash flows more closely. Net cash
provided by operating activities decreased during 2001 compared
with 2000, primarily due to adverse changes to working capital
and increased undistributed equity earnings from unconsolidated
affiliates. These decreases to net cash were partially offset by
increases in net income after non-cash adjustments for
depreciation and amortization in 2001 as compared to 2000. The
adverse changes to working capital are primarily due to
increases in inventory balances, accrued income taxes
receivables and changes in other long term assets and
liabilities, partially offset by a favorable change in other
current liabilities.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased
in 2002, compared with 2001, primarily as a result of NRG Energy
terminating its acquisition program due to its financial
difficulties and the receipt of cash upon the sale of assets
during 2002. Net cash used in investing activities increased in
2001, compared with 2000, primarily due to additional
acquisitions of electric generating facilities and increased
capital expenditures and project investments.

Net cash provided by financing activities during
2002 decreased, compared to 2001 due to constraints on NRG
Energy’s ability to access the capital markets and the
cancellation and termination of construction projects reducing
the need for capital. Net cash provided by financing activities
during 2001 increased compared to 2000 due to the issuance of
debt and equity securities to finance asset acquisitions.



Short-term borrowing as a source of short-term
funding is affected by access to reasonably priced capital
markets. This varies based on financial performance and existing
debt levels. If current debt levels are perceived to be at or
higher than standard industry levels or those levels that can be
sustained by current operating levels, access to reasonable
short-term borrowings could be limited. These factors are
evaluated by credit rating agencies that review NRG Energy and
its subsidiary operations on an ongoing basis. As discussed
above, NRG Energy’s credit situation has been adversely
affected by its credit ratings and is significantly limited in
its access to short-term funding.

NRG Energy’s operating cash flows have been
adversely affected by lower operating margins as a result of low
power prices since mid-2001. Seasonal variations in demand and
market volatility in prices are not unusual in the independent
power sector, and NRG Energy does normally experience higher
margins in peak summer periods and lower margins in non-peak
periods. NRG Energy has also incurred significant amounts of
debt to finance its acquisitions in the past several years and
the servicing of interest and principal repayments from such
financing is largely dependent on domestic project cash flows.
NRG Energy’s management has concluded that the forecasted
free cash flow available to NRG after servicing project-level
obligations will be insufficient to service recourse debt
obligations at NRG Energy.

For additional information on NRG Energy’s
short term and long term borrowing arrangements, see
Item 15 — Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Prospective Capital
    Requirements

Working Capital.

As
of February 28, 2003, NRG Energy had cash in the following
amounts:

NRG Energy anticipates that these cash resources,
in addition to operating cash flows and net proceeds from asset
sales, will be adequate to meet its corporate operating and
capital expenditure needs going forward. However, NRG Energy
does not anticipate having any cash available in 2003 to meet
debt service on its corporate-level notes and loans. NRG Energy
is in negotiations with certain lenders who are considering
making credit available to NRG Energy and/or its subsidiaries
through a debtor-in-possession facility in the event NRG Energy
and/or its subsidiaries becomes a debtor under Chapter 11
of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Other than a potential
debtor-in-possession facility, or entering into a negotiated
recapitalization of its debt obligations, NRG Energy does not
contemplate access to any new financing in 2003.

Capital Expenditures.

NRG Energy’s management forecasts
capital expenditures, which includes refurbishments and
environmental compliance, to total approximately
$475 million to $525 million in the years 2003 through
2007. NRG Energy anticipates funding its ongoing capital
requirements through committed debt facilities, operating cash
flows, and existing cash. NRG Energy’s capital expenditure
program is subject to continuing review and modification. The
timing and actual amount of expenditures may differ
significantly based upon plant operating history, unexpected
plant outages, changes in the regulatory environment, the
availability of cash and restructuring efforts.

Project Finance.

Substantially all of NRG Energy’s
operations are conducted by project subsidiaries and project
affiliates. NRG Energy’s cash flow and ability to service
corporate-level indebtedness when due is dependent upon receipt
of cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from NRG
Energy’s projects and other subsidiaries. NRG Energy has
generally financed the acquisition and development of its
projects under financing arrangements to be repaid solely from
each of its project’s cash flows, which are typically
secured by the plant’s physical assets and NRG
Energy’s equity interests in the project company. In August
2002, NRG Energy suspended substantially all of its acquisition
and development activities indefinitely, pending a



comprehensive restructuring of NRG Energy. The
debt agreements of NRG Energy’s subsidiaries and project
affiliates generally restrict their ability to pay dividends,
make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to NRG Energy. As
of December 31, 2002, Loy Yang, Energy Center Kladno, LSP
Energy (Batesville), NRG South Central, and NRG Northeast
Generating do not currently meet the minimum debt service
coverage ratios required for these projects to make payments to
NRG Energy. In addition, NRG Energy’s subsidiaries,
including LSP Kendall, NRG McClain, NRG Mid-Atlantic, NRG South
Central and NRG Northeast Generating are in default on their
various debt instruments, resulting in dividend payment
restrictions.

Off Balance-Sheet Items

As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy does not
have any significant relationships with structured finance or
special purpose entities that provide liquidity, financing or
incremental market risk or credit risk.

In March 2000, an NRG Energy sponsored
non-consolidated pass through trust issued $250 million of
8.70% certificates due March 15, 2005. Each certificate
represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the
assets of the trust. Interest is payable on the certificates
semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each
year through 2005. The sole assets of the trust consist of
£160 million principal amount 7.97% Reset Senior Notes
due March 15, 2020 issued by NRG Energy. Interest is
payable semi-annually on the Reset Senior Notes on March 15
and September 15 through March 15, 2005, and then at
intervals and interest rates established in a remarketing
process. If the Reset Senior Notes are not remarketed on
March 15, 2005, they must be mandatorily redeemed by NRG
Energy on such date.

NRG Energy has numerous investments of generally
less then 50% interests in energy and energy related entities
that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as
disclosed in Item 15 — Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. NRG Energy’s pro-rata
share of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was
approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2002. In
the normal course of business NRG Energy may be asked to loan
funds to these entities on both a long and short-term basis.
Such transactions are generally accounted for as accounts
payables and receivables to/from affiliates and notes
receivables from affiliates and if appropriate, bear
market-based interest rates. For additional information
regarding amounts accounted for as notes receivables to
affiliates see Item 15 — Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial
Commitments

NRG Energy has a variety of contractual
obligations and other commercial commitments that represent
prospective cash requirements in addition to its capital
expenditure programs. The following is a summarized table of
contractual obligations. See additional discussion in
Item 15 — Notes 13, 14 and 22 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.



Interdependent Relationships

NRG Energy does not have any significant
interdependent relationships. Since it is an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy there are certain related party
transactions that take place in the normal course of business.
For additional information regarding NRG Energy’s related
party transactions see Item 15 — Note 11 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements and
Item 13 — Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions.

Environmental Matters

Domestic Environmental Regulatory
    Matters

The construction and operation of power projects
are subject to stringent environmental and safety protection and
land use laws and regulation in the United States. These laws
and regulations generally require lengthy and complex processes
to obtain licenses, permits and approvals from federal, state
and local agencies. If such laws and regulations become more
stringent and NRG Energy’s facilities are not exempted from
coverage, NRG Energy could be required to make extensive
modifications to further reduce potential environmental impacts.
Also, NRG Energy could be held responsible under environmental
and safety laws for the cleanup of pollutant releases at its
facilities or at off-site locations where it has sent wastes.

NRG Energy and its subsidiaries strive to exceed
the standards of compliance with applicable environmental and
safety regulations. Nonetheless, NRG Energy expects that future
liability under or compliance with environmental and safety
requirements could have a material effect on its operations or
competitive position. It is not possible at this time to
determine when or to what extent additional facilities or
modifications of existing or planned facilities will be required
as a result of possible changes to environmental and safety
regulations, regulator interpretations or enforcement policies.
In general, the effect of future laws or regulations is expected
to require the addition of pollution control equipment or the
imposition of restrictions on NRG Energy’s operations.

NRG Energy establishes accruals where reasonable
estimates of probable environmental and safety liabilities are
possible. NRG Energy adjusts the accruals when new remediation
responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become
estimable, or when current remediation estimates are adjusted to
reflect new information. For more information on Environmental
Matters see Item 15 — Note 22 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

U.S. Federal Regulatory
    Initiatives

Several federal regulatory and legislative
initiatives are being undertaken in the U.S. to further
limit and control pollutant emissions from fossil-fuel-fired
combustion units. Although the exact impact of these initiatives
is not known at this time, all of NRG Energy’s power plants
will be affected in some manner by the expected changes in
federal environmental laws and regulations. In Congress,
legislation has been proposed that would impose annual caps on
U.S. power plant emissions of nitrogen oxides
(NO

x

), sulfur dioxide (SO


), mercury, and,
in some instances, carbon dioxide (CO


). NRG Energy
is currently participating in the debates around such
legislative proposals as a member of the Electric Power Supply
Association. Federal legislation relating to NO

x

,
SO


and mercury is likely in the next two years. The
prospects for passage of the legislation



relating to CO


is more uncertain. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is
scheduled to propose in December 2003 and finalize in December
2004 rules governing mercury emissions from power plants. In
support of this schedule, USEPA and critical stakeholders, some
of which are aligned with NRG Energy’s interests, are
presently conducting a thorough review of existing power plant
mercury emissions data. Since these mercury rules have not yet
been proposed and legislation has not yet supplanted them, it is
not possible for NRG Energy to determine the extent to which the
rules will affect its domestic operations.

USEPA has finalized federal rules governing ozone
season NO

x

emissions across the eastern United
States. These ozone season rules will be implemented in two
phases. The first phase of restrictions will occur in the Ozone
Transport Commission region during the 2003 and subsequent ozone
seasons; all of NRG Energy’s existing, wholly owned
generating units in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions are
included in this part of the program. The second phase of
NO

x

reductions will extend to states within the Ozone
Transport Assessment Group (OTAG) region and restrict 2004
and subsequent ozone season NO

x

emissions in most
states east of the Mississippi River. These rules require one
NO

x

allowance to be held for each ton of
NO

x

emitted from any fossil fuel-fired stationary
boiler, combustion turbine, or combined cycle system that
(i) at any time on or after January 1, 1995, served a
generator with a nameplate capacity greater than 25 MWe and
sold any amount of electricity or (ii) has a maximum design
heat input greater than 250 mmBtu/hr. NRG Energy’s
facilities that are subject to this rule in the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic Regions have been allocated NO

x

emissions allowances, but NRG Energy expects that those
allowances may not be sufficient for the anticipated operation
of these facilities. Where insufficient allowances exist, NRG
Energy must purchase NO

x

allowances from sources
holding excess allowances. The need to purchase these additional
NO

x

allowances could have a material affect on NRG
Energy’s operations in these regions.

During the first quarter of 2002, USEPA proposed
new rules governing cooling water intake structures at existing
power facilities. These rules are scheduled to be finalized by
February 16, 2004. The proposed rules specify certain
location, design, construction, and capacity standards for
cooling water intake structures at existing power plants using
the largest amounts of cooling water. These rules will require
implementation of the best technology available for minimizing
adverse environmental impacts unless a facility shows that such
standards would result in very high costs or little
environmental benefit. The proposed rules would require NRG
Energy facilities that withdraw water in amounts greater than
50 million gallons per day to submit with wastewater permit
applications certain surveys, plans, operational measures, and
restoration measures that combined would act to minimize adverse
environmental impacts. These anticipated cooling water intake
structure rules could have a material effect on NRG
Energy’s operations.

Other Federal initiatives that could affect NRG
Energy and that would govern regional haze, fine particulate
matter, and ozone are underway, but under extended compliance
implementation timeframes ranging from 2009 and beyond.

Regional U.S. Regulatory
    Initiatives

West Coast Region

The El Segundo and Long Beach Generating Stations
are both regulated by the South Coast Air Quality Management
District’s (SCAQMD) Regional Clean Air Incentives
Market (RECLAIM) program. This program, which regulates
NO

x

emissions in the Los Angeles area, was amended on
May 11, 2001, and mandated major changes with respect to
air emissions control at power generation facilities in southern
California. New RECLAIM Rule 2009 requires that all
existing power generation facilities meet Best Available
Retrofit Control Technology (BARCT) for NO

x

emissions from all utility boilers by January 1, 2003, and
for all peaking units by January 1, 2004. Under the new
rule, existing power generation facilities were required to
submit compliance plans by September 1, 2001, listing how
each unit at the stations would meet BARCT by the deadlines. El
Segundo’s compliance plan did not propose additional
NO

x

controls to meet BARCT since Units 3 & 4
are already equipped with acceptable SCR technology (first
installed on Unit 4 in 1995 and on Unit 3 in 2001).
Further, NRG Energy is planning to decommission Units
1 & 2 so that it can build a new 621 MW combined
cycle plant. SCAQMD approved the El Segundo Rule 2009
Compliance Plan on October 17, 2002, indicating that the
SCRs on Units 3 & 4 meet BARCT and requiring



that Units 1 & 2 be retired on or
before December 31, 2002. SCAQMD approved the Long Beach
Generating Station Rule 2009 Compliance Plan on
April 25, 2002, which proposed modifications to the Long
Beach NO

x

control system by December 31, 2002,
and specified a new NO

x

emission concentration limit
of 16.6 parts per million. The Long Beach plant completed all
control system modifications and demonstrated compliance with
16.6 parts per million limit before the December 31, 2002
deadline. Therefore, all Long Beach and El Segundo units have
met the Rule 2009 BARCT requirement, and NRG Energy does
not at this time anticipate additional material capital
expenditures associated with the amended RECLAIM rules.

Eastern Region

Final rules implementing changes in air
regulations in the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut were
promulgated in 2000. The Connecticut rules required that
existing facilities reduce their emissions of SO


in
two steps, the first of which took place on January 1,
2002. The second SO


milestone will occur on
January 1, 2003. The NRG Energy plants in Connecticut have
operated in compliance with the first phase rules and are now
operating in compliance with the second phase rules.
Connecticut’s rules governing emissions of NO

x

were also modified in 2000 to restrict the average, non-ozone
season NO

x

emission rate to 0.15 pound per million
Btu heat input. NRG Energy plans to comply with the new
NO

x

rules, in part, through selective firing of
natural gas, use of selective non-catalytic reduction
(SNCR) technology presently installed at its Norwalk Harbor
and Middletown Power Stations, improved combustion controls, use
of emission reduction credits, and purchase of allowances. In
2002, the Connecticut legislature passed a law further
tightening air emission standards by eliminating in-state
emissions credit trading subsequent to January 1, 2005 as a
means of meeting Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP) regulatory standards for
SO


emissions from older power plants. The
termination of SO


emissions trading in Connecticut
by 2005 could have a material effect on NRG Energy’s
operations in that state.

The new Massachusetts rules set forth schedules
under which six existing coal-fired power plants in-state were
required to meet stringent emission limits for NO

x

,
SO


, mercury, and CO


. The state has
reserved the issue of control of carbon monoxide and particulate
matter emissions for future consideration. On
February 25th, 2003, NRG Energy received from the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP) a
permit to install natural gas reburn technology to meet the
NO

x

and SO


limits specified in the new
rule at its Somerset Generating Station. NRG Energy is projected
to incur total capital expenditures of approximately
$5.4 million to implement the reburn technology at the
Somerset Station, of which about $3.0 million remains to be
spent during 2003. MADEP is evaluating the technological and
economic feasibility of controlling and eliminating emissions of
mercury from the combustion of solid fossil fuel in
Massachusetts. Within six months of completing the feasibility
evaluation, MADEP must propose emission standards for mercury,
with a proposed compliance date of October 1, 2006. NRG
Energy believes it can comply with any future mercury reductions
required by the rules through achieving early reductions of
mercury via early implementation of the natural gas reburn
technology and with its January 1, 2010 commitment to
shutdown Somerset Station’s existing boiler. NRG Energy is
still considering its options with respect to how it will
address MADEP’s CO


emission standards. Such
options include using early reductions of CO


achieved through early implementation of the natural gas reburn
technology or by filing a legal challenge with respect to
MADEP’s legal authority to regulate CO


emissions.

New York proposed rules reducing allowable
SO


and NO

x

emissions from large,
fossil-fuel-fired combustion units in New York State on
February 20, 2002 (6NYCRR Part 237: Acid Deposition
Reduction NO

x

Budget Trading Program and
Part 238: Acid Deposition Reduction SO


Budget
Trading Program). As proposed, these rules would affect every
NRG Energy generator in-state. NRG Energy provided testimony on
the proposed rules in public hearings conducted in Buffalo and
Albany on April 4, 2002, and May 20, 2002,
respectively. In addition, NRG Energy filed written comments on
the proposed rules on May 28, 2002. NRG Energy’s
comments focused on (i) material changes in electric
markets that had occurred since the conduct of studies upon
which the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) had
based their proposal, (ii) the need to increase the
quantity of upwind allowances for use in offsetting in-state
emissions, and (iii) the disproportionately minimal
reduction in in-state acid deposition that could be expected
from the significant emissions reductions proposed. NRG Energy
has received a pre-publication version of the rules that will be



considered by the New York State DEC’s
Environmental Board at the Board’s March 26, 2003
meeting. Indications are that the rules will provide for
increased use of upwind SO


and NO

x

reductions and will continue to allow for the use of early
emission reductions. NRG Energy’s strategy for complying
with the new rules will be to generate early reductions of
SO


and NO

x

associated with fuel switching
and use such reductions to extend the timeframe for implementing
technological controls, which could include the addition of flue
gas desulfurization (FGD) and selective catalytic reduction
(SCR) equipment. NRG Energy anticipates that it could incur
capital expenditures up to $300 million in the 2008 through
2012 timeframe to implement upgrades and modifications to its
plants in New York to meet new state and federal regulatory
requirements if NRG cannot address such requirements through use
of compliant fuels and/or plantwide applicability limits.

While no material impending rule changes
affecting NRG Energy’s existing facilities have been
formally proposed. Delaware is considering in 2003 whether or
not to develop Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT)
standards for mercury. In support of this effort, the State is
beginning to test large combustion sources for mercury
emissions. In addition, the State is establishing Total Maximum
Daily Loading (TMDL) standards for mercury in its watersheds.
NRG is participating as a stakeholder in such policy-making
efforts along with the Governor’s Energy Task Force,
legislators and the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and
Environmental Control (DNREC) to ensure that any rules
promulgated adequately consider impacts on NRG’s in-state
sources.

Central Region

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
has promulgated State Implementation Plan revisions to bring the
Baton Rouge ozone non-attainment area into compliance with
National Ambient Air Quality Standards. NRG Energy participated
in development of the revisions, which require the reduction of
NO

x

emissions at the gas-fired Big Cajun I Power
Station and coal-fired Big Cajun II Power Station to
0.1 pounds NO

x

per million Btu heat input and
0.21 pounds NO

x

per million Btu heat input,
respectively. This revision of the Louisiana air rules would
appear to constitute a change-in-law covered by agreement
between Louisiana Generating LLC and the electric cooperatives
allowing the costs of added combustion controls to be passed
through to the cooperatives. The capital cost of combustion
controls required at the Big Cajun II Generating Station to
meet the State’s NO

x

regulations will total
about $10.0 million each for Units 1 & 2. Unit 3
has already made such changes.

Domestic Site Remediation
    Matters

Under various federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations, a current or previous owner
or operator of any facility, including an electric generating
facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases
or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or
petroleum products located at the facility, and may be held
liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property
damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs
incurred by the party in connection with any releases or
threatened releases. These laws, including the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
of 1986, impose liability without regard to whether the owner
knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and
courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict
(without fault) and joint and several. The cost of
investigation, remediation or removal of any hazardous or toxic
substances or petroleum products could be substantial. Although
NRG Energy has been involved in on-site contamination matters,
to date, NRG Energy has not been named as a potentially
responsible party with respect to any off-site waste disposal
matter.

West Coast Region

The Asset Purchase Agreements for the Long Beach,
El Segundo, Encina, and San Diego gas turbine generating
facilities provide that Southern California Edison and
San Diego Gas & Electric retain liability and
indemnify NRG Energy for existing soil and groundwater
contamination that exceeds remedial thresholds in place at the
time of closing. NRG Energy and its business partner conducted
Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessments at
each of these sites for purposes of identifying such existing
contamination



and provided the results to the sellers. Southern
California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric
have agreed to address contamination identified by these studies
and are undertaking corrective action at the Encina and
San Diego gas turbine generating sites. Spills and releases
of various substances have occurred at these sites since
establishing the historical baseline, all but one of which has
been remediated in accordance with existing laws.

A recent oil leak in underground piping at the El
Segundo Generating Station contaminated soils adjacent to and
underneath the Unit 1 powerhouse. NRG Energy excavated and
disposed of contaminated soils that could be removed in
accordance with existing laws. NRG Energy filed a request with
the Regional Water Quality Control Board to allow contaminated
soils to remain underneath the building foundation until the
building is demolished.

Eastern Region

Coal ash is produced as a by-product of coal
combustion at the Dunkirk, Huntley, and Somerset Generating
Stations. NRG Energy attempts to direct its coal ash to
beneficial uses. Even so, significant amounts of ash are
landfilled at on and off-site locations. At Dunkirk and Huntley,
ash is disposed at landfills owned and operated by NRG Energy.
No material liabilities outside the costs associated with
closure, post-closure care and monitoring are expected at these
facilities. NRG Energy maintains financial assurance to cover
costs associated with closure, post-closure care and monitoring
activities. In the past, NRG Energy has provided financial
assurance via financial test and corporate guarantee. NRG Energy
must re-establish financial assurance via an instrument
requiring complete collateralization of closure and
post-closure-related costs, currently estimated at approximately
$5.8 million. NRG Energy is required to provide an
alternative instrument to provide such financial assurance on or
before April 30, 2003.

NRG must also maintain financial assurance for
closing interim status RCRA facilities at the Devon, Middletown,
Montville and Norwalk Harbor Generating Stations. Previously,
NRG Energy has provided financial assurance via financial test.
NRG Energy must re-establish financial assurance via an
instrument requiring complete collateralization of closure and
post-closure-related costs. NRG Energy is required to provide an
alternative instrument to provide such financial assurance on or
before April 30, 2003.

Historical clean-up liabilities were inherited as
a part of acquiring the Somerset, Devon, Middletown, Montville,
Norwalk Harbor, Arthur Kill and Astoria Generating Stations. NRG
Energy has recently satisfied clean-up obligations associated
with the Ledge Road property (inherited as part of the Somerset
acquisition). Site contamination liabilities arising under the
Connecticut Transfer Act at the Devon, Middletown, Montville and
Norwalk Harbor Stations have been identified and are currently
being refined as part of on-going site investigations. NRG
Energy does not expect to incur material costs associated with
completing the investigations at these Stations or future work
to cover and monitor landfill areas pursuant to the Connecticut
requirements. Remedial liabilities at the Arthur Kill Generating
Station have been established in discussions between NRG Energy
and the New York State DEC and are expected to cost on the order
of $1.0 million; for contingency purposes, NRG Energy has
budgeted $2 million to complete its Arthur Kill remedial
obligations. Remedial investigations are on-going at the Astoria
Generating Station. At this time, NRG Energy’s long term
cleanup liability at this site is not expected to exceed
$2.5 million; for contingency purposes, NRG Energy has
budgeted $4.3 million to complete its Astoria remedial
obligations.

NRG Energy is responsible for the costs
associated with closure, post-closure care and monitoring of the
ash landfill owned and operated by NRG Energy on the site of the
Indian River Generating Station. No material liabilities outside
such costs are expected. Financial assurance to provide for
closure and post-closure-related costs is currently maintained
by a trust fund collateralized in the amount of approximately
$6.6 million.

Central Region

Liabilities associated with closure, post-closure
care and monitoring of the ash ponds owned and operated on site
at the Big Cajun II Generating Station are addressed
through the use of a trust fund maintained by NRG Energy (one of
the instruments allowed by the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality for providing financial assurance for
expenses associated with closure and post-closure care of the
ponds). The



current value of the trust fund is approximately
$4.5 million and NRG Energy is making annual payments to
the fund in the amount of about $116,000.

International Environmental
    Matters

Most of the foreign countries in which NRG Energy
owns or may acquire or develop independent power projects have
environmental and safety laws or regulations relating to the
ownership or operation of electric power generation facilities.
These laws and regulations are typically significant for
independent power producers because they are still changing and
evolving. In particular, NRG Energy’s international power
generation facilities will likely be affected by evolving
emissions limitations and operational requirements imposed by
the Kyoto Protocol and country-based restrictions pertaining to
global climate change concerns.

NRG Energy retains appropriate advisors in
foreign countries and seeks to design its international
development and acquisition strategy to comply with and take
advantage of opportunities presented by each country’s
environmental and safety laws and regulations. There can be no
assurance that changes in such laws or regulations will not
adversely effect NRG Energy’s international operations.

Australia

The most significant environmental issue for the
Australian NRG businesses is the response to global climate
change. Climate change issues are considered a long-term issue
(

e.g.,

2010 and beyond), and the Federal
Government’s response to date has included a number of
initiatives, all of which have had no impact or minimal impact
on NRG Energy’s current operations. The Australian
Government has stated that Australia will achieve its Kyoto
target of 108% of 1990 levels for the 2008 to 2012 reporting
period but that it will not ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Each
Australian State Government is considering implementing a number
of climate change initiatives that will vary considerably state
to state. NRG Energy currently expects that climate change
initiatives will not have a material impact on NRG Energy’s
businesses in Australia.

MIBRAG/ Schkopau, Germany

CO


emissions trading is supposed to
start in 2005, but NRG Energy cannot quantify the possible
effect of this trading on its operations in Germany at this time
because implementation details are still being negotiated among
businesses, lobbyists, and the regulatory authorities.
Fundamental issues such as “grandfathering” existing
plants or availability of credits for plants previously closed
or upgraded are still unsettled. Given the uncertainty regarding
the emissions trading program, NRG Energy cannot estimate at
this time the possible effect such requirements would have on
its future operations.

Proposed changes in sections 13 and 17 of
the German Emission Control Directive are expected to tighten
emission limits for plants firing conventional fuels, and for
those co-firing waste products. As with CO


emissions
trading, these changes are currently being vigorously debated
with issues such as exemptions based on size or purpose of
plants and “grandfathering” remaining undecided.

The European Union’s Groundwater Directive
and Mine Wastewater Management Directive are in the rule-making
stage with the final outcome still under debate. Given the
uncertainty regarding the possible outcome of the on-going
debate on these directives, NRG Energy cannot quantify at this
time the possible effect such requirements would have on its
future coal mining operations in Germany.

UK

NRG Energy’s Enfield Generating Station uses
state-of-the-art combined cycle technology and is set to fire
natural gas as its primary fuel. Currently the facility complies
with all conditions in its environmental permits and its
operation is not under challenge by any governmental or
non-governmental parties.

India

NRG Energy’s Kondapalli Generating Station
is in compliance with its environmental permits, is not being
challenged by any parties on environmental grounds, has incurred
no fines or penalties associated with



violations of operating conditions, and there are
no capital costs anticipated for maintaining the Station in
compliance with existing consents or rules. To NRG Energy’s
knowledge, no regulatory proposals that would materially affect
the Station’s operation are pending or proposed.

Recent Accounting Developments

In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 143,

“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”

This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs.
SFAS No. 143 requires an entity to recognize the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the
period in which it is incurred. Upon initial recognition of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation, an entity shall
capitalize an asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount as the
liability. SFAS No. 143 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2002. NRG Energy has not completed its analysis of
SFAS No. 143. NRG Energy will complete its analysis in
2003 and in accordance with the accounting guidance, be required
to restate prior quarterly statements to the extent the impact
of the adoption is material.

In April 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 145,

“Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13,
and Technical Corrections”,

that supersedes previous
guidance for the reporting of gains and losses from
extinguishment of debt and accounting for leases, among other
things.

SFAS No. 145 requires that only gains
and losses from the extinguishment of debt that meet the
requirements for classification as “Extraordinary
Items,” as prescribed in Accounting Practices Board Opinion
No. 30, should be disclosed as such in the financial
statements. Previous guidance required all gains and losses from
the extinguishment of debt to be classified as
“Extraordinary Items.” This portion of
SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after May 15, 2002, with restatement of prior periods
required.

In addition, SFAS No. 145 amends
SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for Leases”,

as it relates to accounting by a lessee for certain lease
modifications. Under SFAS No. 13, if a capital lease
is modified in such a way that the change gives rise to a new
agreement classified as an operating lease, the assets and
obligation are removed, a gain or loss is recognized and the new
lease is accounted for as an operating lease. Under
SFAS No. 145, capital leases that are modified so the
resulting lease agreement is classified as an operating lease
are to be accounted for under the sale-leaseback provisions of
SFAS No. 98,

“Accounting for Leases”

.
These provisions of SFAS No. 145 are effective for
transactions occurring after May 15, 2002.

SFAS No. 145 will be applied as
required. Adoption of SFAS No. 145 is not expected to
have a material impact on NRG Energy.

In June 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities,”

(SFAS No. 146), SFAS No. 146 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with
exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue
No. 94-3,

“Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring).”

SFAS No. 146 applies to
costs associated with an exit activity that does not involve an
entity newly acquired in a business combination or with a
disposal activity covered by SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.”

The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are
effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged.
SFAS No. 146 will be applied as required.

In December 2002, FASB issued
SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure —
an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.

This Statement
amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this
Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to
require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. The provisions of



SFAS No. 148 are effective for
financial statements for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2002 and for interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2002.

In November 2002, The FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.

The initial
recognition and initial measurement provisions of this
interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002,
irrespective of the guarantor’s fiscal year-end. The
disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements
of interim or annual periods ending after December 15,
2002. The interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by
a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about
its obligations under guarantees. The interpretation also
clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a
liability by a guarantor at the inception of the guarantee for
the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing the
guarantee.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities

(FIN No. 46). FIN No. 46
requires an enterprise’s consolidated financial statements
to include subsidiaries in which the enterprise has a
controlling interest. Historically, that requirement has been
applied to subsidiaries in which an enterprise has a majority
voting interest, but in many circumstances the enterprise’s
consolidated financial statements do not include the
consolidation of variable interest entities with which it has
similar relationships but no majority voting interest. Under FIN
No. 46 the voting interest approach is not effective in
identifying controlling financial interest. The new rule
requires that for entities to be consolidated that those assets
be initially recorded at their carrying amounts at the date the
requirements of the new rule first apply. If determining
carrying amounts as required is impractical, then the assets are
to be measured at fair value the first date the new rule
applies. Any difference between the net amount of any previously
recognized interest in the newly consolidated entity should be
recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. FIN
No. 46 becomes effective in the third quarter of 2003. NRG
Energy is currently evaluating this standard and is presently
unable to determine its impact.

California

NRG Energy’s California generation assets
include a 50% interest in the West Coast Power partnership with
Dynegy.

In March 2001, the California Power Exchange (PX)
filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code, and in April 2001, the Pacific Gas & Electric
Company (PG&E) also filed for bankruptcy under
Chapter 11. PG&E’s filing delayed collection of
receivables owed to the Crockett facility. In September 2001,
PG&E filed a proposed plan of reorganization. Under the
terms of the proposed plan, which is subject to challenge by
interested parties, unsecured creditors such as NRG
Energy’s California affiliates would receive 60% of the
amounts owed upon approval of the plan. The remaining 40% would
be paid in negotiable debt with terms from 10 to 30 years.
The California PX’s ability to repay its debt is
dependent on the extent to which it receives payments from
PG&E and Southern California Edison Company (SCE). During
the fourth quarter of 2002, West Coast Power recorded an
approximately $117.0 million charge to write-off the
remaining amounts owed to it by the California PX and ISO.
NRG Energy’s share of this charge was approximately
$58.5 million (pre-tax).

NRG Energy uses a variety of financial
instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates on its international project cash flows,
interest rates on its cost of borrowing and energy and energy
related commodities prices.

Currency Exchange Risk

NRG Energy is also subject to currency risks
associated with foreign denominated distributions from
international investments. In the normal course of business, NRG
Energy receives distributions denominated in Australian Dollar,
British Pound and Euro. Upon completion of the Itiquira plant in
Brazil, NRG Energy is also subject to currency risk with the
Brazilian Real. NRG Energy engages in a strategy of hedging
foreign denominated cash flows through a program of matching
currency inflows and outflows, and to the extent required,
fixing the U.S. Dollar equivalent of net foreign
denominated distributions with currency forward and swap
agreements with highly credit worthy financial institutions.

NRG Energy has £160 million in
long-term debt due 2020 which is subject to market fluctuations.

As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy had two
foreign currency exchange contracts with notional amounts of
$3.0 million. If the contracts had been discontinued on
December 31, 2002, NRG Energy would have owed the
counter-parties approximately $0.3 million.

Interest Rate Risk

NRG Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to
fluctuations in interest rates when entering into variable rate
debt obligations to fund certain power projects. Exposure to
interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into
derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps,
collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure
to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate
debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the
variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument.
NRG Energy’s risk management policy allows the company to
reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt
obligations.

During 2002, as a result of the various defaults
under certain loan agreements, NRG Energy’s counter-parties
have terminated interest rate swaps with NRG Energy, Brazos
Valley LP and NRG Finance Company I LLC. Until NRG Energy
successfully restructures outstanding debt and returns to credit
quality, NRG Energy will not seek to manage interest rate risk
through the use of financial derivatives.



As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy had
various interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts
totaling approximately $1.7 billion. If the swaps had been
discontinued on December 31, 2002, NRG Energy would have
owed the counter parties approximately $41.0 million. Based
on the investment grade rating of the counter parties, NRG
Energy believes that its exposure to credit risk due to
nonperformance by the counter-parties to its hedging contracts
is insignificant.

NRG Energy and its subsidiaries have both long
and short-term debt instruments that subject it to the risk of
loss associated with movements in market interest rates. As of
December 31, 2002, a 100 basis point change in the
benchmark rate on NRG Energy’s variable rate debt would
impact net income by approximately $39.3 million. As of
December 31, 2001, a 100 basis point change in the
benchmark rate on NRG Energy’s variable rate debt would
have impacted net income by approximately $16.6 million.

Commodity Price Risk

NRG Energy is exposed to commodity price
variability in electricity, emission allowances and natural gas,
oil and coal used to meet fuel requirements. To manage earnings
volatility associated with these commodity price risks, NRG
Energy enters into financial instruments, which may take the
form of fixed price, floating price or indexed sales or
purchases, and options, such as puts, calls, basis transactions
and swaps.

NRG Energy utilizes an undiversified
“Value-at-Risk” (VAR) model to estimate a maximum
potential loss in the fair value of its commodity portfolio
including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral
physical and financial transactions. The key assumptions for the
NRG Energy VAR model include (1) a lognormal distribution
of price returns (2) three day holding period and
(3) a 95% confidence interval. The volatility estimate is
based on the implied volatility for at the money call options.
This model encompasses the following generating regions:
Entergy, NEPOOL, NYPP, PJM, WSCC, SPP and Main.

The estimated maximum potential three-day loss in
fair value of its commodity portfolio, calculated using the VAR
model is as follows:

NRG Power Marketing has risk management policies
in place to measure and limit market and credit risk associated
with NRG’s power marketing activities. These policies do
not permit speculative or directional trading. An independent
department within NRG Power Marketing is responsible for the
enforcement of such policies. NRG Energy is currently in the
process of reviewing and revising these policies to reflect
changes in industry dynamics and the NRG Energy reorganization.

Credit Risk

NRG Energy is exposed to credit risk in its risk
management activities. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss
resulting from the nonperformance by a counter party of its
contractual obligations. NRG Energy actively manages its
counter-party credit risk. NRG Energy has an established credit
policy in place to minimize



overall credit risk. Important elements of this
policy include ongoing financial reviews of all counter-parties,
established credit limits, as well as monitoring, managing, and
mitigating credit exposure.

Pension Plan Tables

NRG Energy participates in Xcel Energy’s
noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan. Such plan covers
substantially all of NRG Energy’s employees. As of
January 1, 1999, the pension benefit formula that applies
to the Named Executive Officers was changed and each Named
Executive Officer, together with all other affected
nonbargaining employees, was given an opportunity to choose
between two retirement programs, the traditional program and the
pension equity program. Messrs. Peterson and Mataczynski
have selected the traditional program and Messrs. Pieper,
Sass and Brewster have selected the pension equity program.

Under the traditional program applicable to
certain of the Named Executive Officers, the pension benefit is
computed by taking the highest average compensation below the
integration level times 1.1333% plus the highest average
compensation above the integration level times 1.6333%. The
result is multiplied by credited service. The integration level
is one-third of the social security wage base. The annual
compensation used to calculate average compensation is base
salary for the year. After an employee has reached 30 years of
service, no additional years of service are used in determining
the pension benefit under the traditional program. The benefit
amounts under the traditional program are computed in the form
of a straight-life annuity.

Under the pension equity program applicable to
certain of the Named Executive Officers, the formula for
determining the pension benefit is average compensation times
credited years of service times 10%. The annual compensation
used to calculate average compensation is base salary for the
year plus bonus compensation paid in that same year. There is no
maximum on the number of years of service used to determine the
pension benefit. The benefit amounts under the pension equity
program are computed in the form of a lump sum.

Both programs feature a retirement spending
account, which credits $1,400 plus interest annually. The
opening balance as of January 1, 1999 was $1,400,
multiplied by years of service.



The following table illustrates the approximate
retirement benefits payable to employees retiring at the normal
retirement age of 65 years under the traditional program
applicable to certain of the Named Executive Officers:

greater of: (a) Mr. Davido’s average bonus over
the last two years or (b) Mr. Davido’s target
annual bonus established under a bonus plan for the year in

All of the obligations under
Mr. Davido’s Key Executive Retention, Restructuring
Bonus and Severance Agreement are guaranteed by Xcel Energy. In
addition, Mr. Davido has agreed not to compete with NRG
Energy for a period of one year after the termination of his
employment.

Ershel Redd

Ershel Redd is party to a severance agreement
with NRG Energy dated as of January 30, 2003. Under the
agreement, Mr. Redd is entitled to severance benefits
equivalent to those under the Xcel Energy Business Unit Vice
President Severance Plan. Specifically, if
(i) Mr. Redd’s employment is terminated without
cause, (ii) his position is eliminated without a comparable
position being offered, (iii) his salary is reduced by more
than 10% (and he subsequently voluntarily terminates his
employment) or (iv) he is required to relocate (and he
subsequently voluntarily terminates his employment), then
Mr. Redd is entitled to lump-sum and continuing severance
benefits during the “severance period” (18 months
after employment termination). Further, all of the obligations
under Mr. Redd’s severance plan are guaranteed by Xcel
Energy.

The lump-sum severance benefit is equal to the
aggregate of: (i) unpaid annual salary through the date of
termination and a prorata share of Mr. Redd’s target

Mr. Redd’s salary and target annual incentive;
(iii) certain retirement benefits Mr. Redd would have
earned had he been employed during the severance period; and
(iv) certain contributions the NRG would have made to
Mr. Redd’s defined contribution and supplemental
executive savings plans. The continuing benefits include:

William Pieper

William Pieper is party to an NRG Executive
Officer and Key Personnel Severance Plan with NRG Energy dated
as of July 16, 2001 (as modified by a letter agreement
between Mr. Pieper, NRG Energy and Xcel Energy dated as of
July 16, 2002).

Under the agreement, if Mr. Pieper’s
employment is terminated by NRG Energy without cause or
Mr. Pieper voluntarily terminates his employment within
three months of a material change or reduction in his

benefits of medical, dental and term life



insurance for twelve months, (iv) a cash

Incentive and Compensation Plan for a period of two years.

In addition, under the agreement, if there is a
change of control of NRG Energy and Mr. Pieper’s
employment is terminated within 6 months prior to such
change of control or 12 months following such change of
control, then Mr. Pieper is entitled to certain severance
benefits. Specifically, Mr. Pieper is entitled to
(i) 2.5 times the sum of (a) his base salary and
(b) the greater of (x) Mr. Pieper’s average
annual bonus over the two years preceding the termination or
(y) Mr. Pieper’s target annual bonus for the year

time and (v) all outstanding long-term incentive awards
subject to the treatment provided under the long-term incentive
plan of NRG Energy.

The letter agreement dated July 16, 2002
provides that rather than immediately terminating his employment
and seeking severance benefits due to a material change or
reduction in his responsibilities at NRG Energy (after NRG
Energy became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy), NRG
Energy has instead extended the time frame in which
Mr. Pieper may terminate his employment and seek such
severance benefits by 15 months, provided Mr. Pieper
does not terminate his employment within 12 months of
July 16, 2002.

George Schaefer

with NRG Energy dated as of December 18, 2002 which

Item 13 —

Certain Relationships and Related
    Transactions

NRG Energy was initially incorporated in
Minnesota in 1989, and was reincorporated in Delaware in 1992 as
a wholly owned subsidiary of NSP. NRG Energy became publicly
traded on May 31, 2000. In August 2000, NSP merged with NCE
to form Xcel Energy. Following the completion in March 2001 of a
public offering by NRG Energy of 18.4 million shares of
Common Stock (the March 2001 Offering), Xcel Energy owned an
approximate 74% interest in the Common Stock and Class A
Common Stock of NRG Energy on a combined basis, representing
96.7% of the total voting power of the Common Stock and
Class A Common Stock on a combined basis. On June 3,
2002, Xcel Energy completed its exchange offer for the 26% of
NRG Energy’s shares that had been previously publicly held.
In addition, 3 directors of NRG Energy are executive
officers of Xcel Energy.

Operating Agreements

NRG Energy has one thermal contract with Xcel
Energy in 2002 that expires on December 31, 2006. This
contract relates to incremental costs associated with the sale
of steam at Xcel Energy’s King plant in Bayport, Minnesota.
The NRG Energy Center Rock-Tenn, LLC has two contracts with Xcel
Energy in 2002; one is a coal contract that expired
December 31, 2002, and the other covers the use and
operation of certain facilities at Xcel Energy’s Highbridge
plant in St. Paul, Minnesota that expires December 31,
2010. NRG Energy paid $8.2 million in 2002 under these
agreements.



NRG Energy has a renewable 10-year agreement with
Xcel Energy, expiring on December 31, 2006, under which
Xcel Energy agrees to purchase refuse-derived fuel for use in
certain of its boilers, and NRG Energy agrees to pay Xcel Energy
a burn incentive. Under this agreement, NRG Energy received from
Xcel Energy $1.2 million in 2002, and NRG Energy paid to
Xcel Energy $3.3 million in 2002.

Reimbursement for Administrative
Services

NRG Energy reimburses Xcel Energy for certain
overhead and administrative costs, including benefits
administration, engineering support, accounting, and other
shared services. Employees of NRG Energy participate in certain
employee benefit plans of Xcel Energy. NRG Energy paid Xcel
Energy $21.2 million in 2002 as reimbursement for certain
overhead costs and the cost of services provided.

Consulting Services Agreement

NRG Energy has an agreement with Utility
Engineering Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel
Energy, under which Utility Engineering provides consulting
services to NRG Energy. Consulting services are provided from
time to time at NRG Energy’s request. NRG Energy paid
$698,000 to Utility Engineering for consulting services in 2002.

Tax Allocation Agreement

NRG Energy was formerly a member of Xcel
Energy’s consolidated tax group for United States federal
income tax purposes. The responsibility for payment of taxes and
the allocation between Xcel Energy and NRG Energy of tax
benefits and liabilities was previously governed by a tax
sharing agreement between NRG Energy and Xcel Energy. Such tax
sharing agreement was replaced by a tax allocation agreement,
which became effective as of December 2000, that formalized the
various practices which arose under the previous tax sharing
agreement and reflected the change in NRG Energy’s status
from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy to a
majority-owned subsidiary. Following the completion of the March
2001 Offering, Xcel Energy owned equity securities representing
less than 80% of NRG Energy’s value and, accordingly, NRG
Energy was no longer a member of Xcel Energy’s consolidated
tax group.

On June 3, 2002 Xcel Energy completed its
exchange offer for the 26% of NRG Energy’s shares that had
been publicly held. Starting June 4, 2002, NRG Energy and
subsidiaries can rejoin Xcel Energy’s consolidated group
for federal income tax purposes provided the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) consents to such rejoining. To date, no request
has been made to the IRS for consent to permit Xcel Energy to
reconsolidate NRG Energy for federal income tax purposes. It is
likely that Xcel Energy will not request IRS consent to
consolidate NRG Energy for income tax purposes for 2002.

Services Agreement

NRG Power Marketing, Inc. has an agreement with e
prime, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy under
which e prime, Inc. provides strategic and other business advice
relating to origination opportunities with NRG Energy’s
plant output. These services are provided from time to time at
the request of NRG Power Marketing, Inc.

Natural Gas Marketing and Trading
Agreement

NRG Energy has agreements with e prime, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy, under which e prime
provides natural gas and related products from time to time at
NRG Energy’s request. NRG Energy paid $19.2 million to
e prime in 2002.

Item 14 —

Controls and Procedures

The CEO, Vice President and Treasurer and Vice
President and Controller (the Certifying Officers) have
evaluated NRG Energy’s disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in the rules of the SEC within 90 days of the
filing date of this report and have determined that, except to
the extent indicated otherwise in



this paragraph, disclosure controls and
procedures were effective in ensuring that material information
required to be disclosed by NRG in the reports filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms. During the fourth quarter of 2002,
the Certifying Officers determined that there were certain
deficiencies in the internal controls relating to financial
reporting at NRG Energy caused by the NRG’s pending
financial restructuring and business realignment. During the
second half of 2002, there were material changes and vacancies
in senior NRG management positions and a diversion of NRG
financial and management resources to restructuring efforts.
These circumstances detracted from NRG’s ability through
its internal controls to timely monitor and accurately assess
the impact of certain transactions, as would be expected in an
effective financial reporting control environment. NRG has
dedicated and will continue to dedicate in 2003 resources to
make corrections to those control deficiencies. Notwithstanding
the foregoing and as indicated in the certification accompanying
the signature page to this report, the Certifying Officers have
certified that, to the best of their knowledge, the financial
statements, and other financial information included in this
report on Form 10-K, fairly present in all material
respects the financial conditions, results of operations and
cash flows of NRG Energy as of, and for the periods presented in
this report.

NRG’s Energy’s Certifying Officers are
primarily responsible for the accuracy of the financial
information that is represented in this report. To meet their
responsibility for financial reporting, they have established
internal controls and procedures which, subject to the
disclosure in the foregoing paragraph, they believe are adequate
to provide reasonable assurance that NRG assets are protected
from loss. There were no significant changes in internal
controls or in other factors that could significantly affect
these controls subsequent to the date of the Certifying Officers
evaluation.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder

of NRG Energy, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows and stockholder’s (deficit)/equity
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of NRG Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will
continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company is experiencing
credit and liquidity constraints and has various credit
arrangements that are in default. As a direct consequence,
during 2002 the Company entered into discussions with its
creditors to develop a comprehensive restructuring plan. In
connection with its restructuring efforts, it is likely the
Company and certain of its subsidiaries will file for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these
matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

As discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets”, for the year ended December 31,
2002. As discussed in Note 26 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” on
January 1, 2001. As discussed in Notes 3 and 5 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” on
January 1, 2002.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Note 1 —

Organization

NRG Energy, Inc., (NRG Energy or the Company),
was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on May 29, 1992.
Beginning in 1989, NRG Energy conducted business through its
predecessor companies, NRG Energy, Inc. and NRG Group, Inc.,
Minnesota corporations, which were merged into NRG Energy
subsequent to its incorporation. NRG Energy, together with its
majority owned subsidiaries and affiliates, is an energy company
primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of power
generation facilities and the sale of energy, capacity and
related products.

On June 5, 2000, NRG Energy completed its
initial public offering. Prior to its initial public offering,
NRG Energy was a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern States
Power (NSP). In August 2000, NSP merged with New Century
Energies, Inc. (NCE), a Colorado-based public utility holding
company. The surviving corporation in the merger was renamed
Xcel Energy Inc. (Xcel Energy or Parent), Xcel Energy directly
owns six utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural
gas customers in 12 states. Xcel Energy also owns or has
interests in a number of non-regulated businesses, the largest
of which is NRG Energy. In March 2001, NRG Energy completed a
second public offering of 18.4 million shares of its common
stock. Following this offering, Xcel Energy indirectly owned a
74% interest in NRG Energy’s common stock and class A
common stock, representing 96.7% of the total voting power of
NRG Energy’s common stock and class A common stock.

Since the early 1990’s, NRG Energy pursued a
strategy of growth through acquisitions. Starting in 2000, NRG
Energy added the development of new construction projects to
this strategy. This strategy required significant capital, much
of which was satisfied primarily with third party debt. As of
December 31, 2002, NRG Energy had approximately
$9.4 billion of debt on its balance sheet at the corporate
and project levels. Due to a number of reasons, including the
overall down-turn in the energy industry, NRG Energy’s
financial condition has deteriorated significantly. As a direct
consequence, in 2002 NRG Energy entered into discussions with
its creditors in anticipation of a comprehensive restructuring
in order to become a more stable and conservatively capitalized
company. In connection with its restructuring efforts, it is
likely that NRG Energy (and certain of its subsidiaries) will
file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. If NRG Energy
were to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Xcel
Energy’s equity ownership would most likely be eliminated
and a large number of NRG Energy’s creditors’ claims
would be impaired.

On March 26, 2003, Xcel Energy announced
that its board of directors had approved a tentative settlement
agreement with holders of most of NRG Energy’s long-term
notes and the steering committee representing NRG’s bank
lenders. The settlement is subject to certain conditions,
including the approval of at least a majority in dollar amount
of the NRG Energy bank lenders and long-term noteholders and
definitive documentation. There can be no assurance that such
approvals will be obtained. The terms of the settlement call for
Xcel Energy to make payments to NRG Energy over the next
13 months totaling up to $752 million for the benefit of
NRG Energy’s creditors in consideration for their waiver of
any existing and potential claims against Xcel Energy. Under the
settlement, Xcel Energy will make the following payments: (i)
$350 million at or shortly following the consummation of a
restructuring of NRG Energy’s debt. It is expected this
payment would be made prior to year-end 2003; (ii)
$50 million on January 1, 2004. At Xcel Energy’s
option, it may fill this requirement with either cash or Xcel
Energy common stock or any combination thereof; and (iii)
$352 million in April 2004.

NRG Energy is restructuring its operations to
become a domestic based owner-operator of a fuel-diverse
portfolio of electric generation facilities engaged in the sale
of energy, capacity and related products. NRG Energy is working
toward this goal by selective divestiture of non-core assets,
consolidation of management, reorganization and redirection of
power marketing philosophy and activities and an overall
financial restructuring that will improve liquidity and reduce
debt. NRG Energy does not anticipate any new significant
acquisitions or construction, and instead will focus on
operational performance and asset management. NRG Energy has
already made significant reductions in expenditures, business
development activities and personnel. Power sales, fuel
procurement and risk management will remain a key strategic
element of NRG Energy’s



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

operations. NRG Energy’s objective will be
to optimize the fuel input and the energy output of its
facilities within an appropriate risk and liquidity profile.

In December 2001, Moody’s Investor Service
(Moody’s) placed NRG Energy’s long-term senior
unsecured debt rating on review for possible downgrade. In
response, Xcel Energy and NRG Energy put into effect a plan to
preserve NRG Energy’s investment grade rating and improve
its financial condition. This plan included financial support to
NRG Energy from Xcel Energy; marketing certain NRG Energy assets
for sale; canceling and deferring capital spending; and reducing
corporate expenses.

In response to a possible downgrade, during 2002,
Xcel Energy contributed $500 million to NRG Energy, and NRG
Energy and its subsidiaries sold assets and businesses that
provided NRG Energy in excess of $286 million in cash and
eliminated approximately $432 million in debt. NRG Energy
also cancelled or deferred construction of approximately
3,900 MW of new generation projects. On July 26, 2002,
Standard & Poors’ (S&P) downgraded NRG
Energy’s senior unsecured bonds to below investment grade,
and three days later Moody’s also downgraded NRG
Energy’s senior unsecured debt rating to below investment
grade. Since July 2002, NRG Energy senior unsecured debt, as
well as the secured NRG Northeast Generating LLC bonds, the
secured NRG South Central Generating LLC bonds and secured LSP
Energy (Batesville) bonds were downgraded multiple times. After
NRG Energy failed to make payments due under certain unsecured
bond obligations on September 16, 2002, both Moody’s
and S&P lowered their ratings on NRG Energy’s and its
subsidiaries’ unsecured bonds once again. Currently, NRG
Energy’s unsecured bonds carry a rating of between CCC and
D at S&P and between Ca and C at Moody’s, depending on
the specific debt issue.

As a result of the downgrade of NRG Energy’s
credit rating, declining power prices, increasing fuel prices,
the overall down-turn in the energy industry and the overall
down-turn in the economy, NRG Energy has experienced severe
financial difficulties. These difficulties have caused NRG
Energy to, among other things, miss scheduled principal and
interest payments due to its corporate lenders and bondholders,
prepay for fuel and other related delivery and transportation
services and provide performance collateral in certain
instances. NRG Energy has also recorded asset impairment charges
of approximately $3.1 billion, related to various operating
projects, as well as projects that were under construction which
NRG Energy has stopped funding.

NRG Energy and its subsidiaries have failed to
timely make interest and/or principal payments on substantial
amounts of its indebtedness:

In addition, the following issues have been
accelerated, rendering the debt immediately due and payable: on
November 6, 2002, lenders to NRG Energy accelerated the
approximately $1.1 billion of debt under the construction
revolver facility; on November 21, 2002, the bond trustee,
on behalf of bondholders, accelerated the approximately
$750 million of debt under the NRG South Central
Generating, LLC facility; and on February 27, 2003, ABN
Amro, as administrative agent, accelerated the approximately
$1.0 billion corporate revolver financing facility.

In addition to payment defaults, prior to the
downgrades, many corporate guarantees and commitments of NRG
Energy and its subsidiaries required that they be supported or
replaced with letters of credit or cash collateral within 5 to
30 days of a ratings downgrade below Baa3 or BBB- by
Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, respectively.
As a result of the downgrades on July 26 and July 29,
NRG Energy received demands to post collateral aggregating
approximately $1.1 billion.

On August 19, 2002, NRG Energy executed a
Collateral Call Extension Letter (CCEL) with various
secured project lender groups in which the banks agreed to
extend until September 13, 2002, the deadline by which NRG
Energy was to post its approximately $1.0 billion of cash
collateral in connection with certain bank loan agreements.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Effective as of September 13, 2002, NRG
Energy and these various secured project lenders entered into a
Second Collateral Call Extension Letter (Second CCEL) that
extended the deadline until November 15, 2002. Under the
Second CCEL, NRG Energy agreed to submit to the lenders a
comprehensive restructuring plan. NRG Energy submitted this plan
on November 4, 2002 and continues to work with its lenders
and advisors on an overall restructuring of its debt (see
further discussion below). The November 15, 2002 deadline
of the second CCEL passed without NRG Energy posting the
required collateral. NRG Energy and the secured project lenders
continue to work towards a plan of restructuring.

In August 2002, NRG Energy retained financial and
legal restructuring advisors to assist its management in the
preparation of a comprehensive financial and operational
restructuring. NRG Energy and its advisors have been meeting
regularly to discuss restructuring issues with an ad hoc
committee of its bondholders and a steering committee of its
bank lenders (the Ad Hoc Creditors Committees).

To aid in the design and implementation of a
restructuring plan, in the fall of 2002, NRG Energy prepared a
comprehensive business plan and forecast. Anticipating that NRG
Energy’s creditors will own all or substantially all of NRG
Energy’s equity interests after implementing the
restructuring plan, any plans and efforts to integrate NRG
Energy’s business operations with those of Xcel Energy were
terminated. Using commodity, emission and capacity prices
provided by an independent energy consulting firm to develop
forecasted cash flow information, management concluded that the
forecasted free cash flow available to NRG Energy after
servicing project level obligations will be insufficient to
service recourse debt obligations at the NRG Energy corporate
level. Based on that forecast, it is anticipated that NRG Energy
will remain in default of the various corporate level debt
obligations discussed more fully herein.

Based on this information and in consultation
with Xcel Energy and its financial and legal restructuring
advisors, NRG Energy prepared a comprehensive financial
restructuring plan. In November 2002, NRG Energy and Xcel Energy
presented the plan to the Ad Hoc Creditors Committees. The
restructuring plan has served as a basis for continuing
negotiations between the Ad Hoc Creditors Committees, NRG Energy
and Xcel Energy related to a consensual plan of reorganization
for NRG Energy. Negotiations have progressed substantially since
the initial plan was presented in November. If an agreement to a
consensual plan of reorganization is negotiated and NRG Energy
is unable to effectuate the restructuring through an exchange
offer or other non-bankruptcy mechanism, it is highly probable
that such plan would be implemented through the commencement of
a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. There can be
no assurance that NRG Energy’s creditors, including, but
not limited to the Ad Hoc Committees, will agree to the terms of
the consensual plan of reorganization currently being
negotiated. In addition, there can be no guarantee that lenders
will not seek to enforce their remedies under the various loan
agreements, provided that any such attempted enforcement would
be subject to the automatic stay and other relevant provisions
of the bankruptcy code. The commencement of a voluntary
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding without a consensual plan
of reorganization would increase the possibility of a prolonged
bankruptcy proceeding.

On November 22, 2002, five former NRG Energy
executives filed an involuntary Chapter 11 petition against
NRG Energy in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Minnesota. Under provisions of federal law, NRG Energy has the
full authority to continue to operate its business as if the
involuntary petition had not been filed unless and until a court
hearing on the validity of the involuntary petition is resolved
adversely to NRG Energy. On December 16, 2002, NRG Energy
responded to the involuntary petition, contesting the
petitioners’ claims and filing a motion to dismiss the
case. On February 19, 2003, NRG Energy announced that it
had reached a settlement with the petitioners. The
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota will
hear NRG Energy’s motion to consider the settlement and/or
dismiss the involuntary petition. Two of NRG Energy’s
creditors have objected to the motion to dismiss. There can be
no assurance that the court will dismiss the involuntary
petition. The Bankruptcy Court has discretion in the review of
the settlement agreement. There is a risk that the Bankruptcy
Court may, among other things, reject the settlement agreement
or enter an order for relief under Chapter 11.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On March 26, 2003, Xcel Energy announced
that its board of directors had approved a tentative settlement
agreement with holders of most of NRG Energy’s long-term
notes and the steering committee representing NRG’s bank
lenders. The settlement is subject to certain conditions,
including the approval of at least a majority in dollar amount
of the NRG Energy bank lenders and long-term noteholders and
definitive documentation. There can be no assurance that such
approvals will be obtained. The terms of the settlement call for
Xcel Energy to make payments to NRG Energy over the next
13 months totaling up to $752 million for the benefit
of NRG Energy’s creditors in consideration for their waiver
of any existing and potential claims against Xcel Energy. Under
the settlement, Xcel Energy will make the following payments:
(i) $350 million at or shortly following the
consummation of a restructuring of NRG Energy’s debt. It is
expected this payment would be made prior to year-end 2003;
(ii) $50 million on January 1, 2004. At Xcel
Energy’s option, it may fill this requirement with either
cash or Xcel Energy common stock or any combination thereof; and
(iii) $352 million in April 2004.

NRG Energy expects to have cash available for
operations through 2003. This forecast does not assume further
investment by Xcel Energy or modification of NRG Energy’s
current debt obligations. In the event that NRG Energy is unable
to work through the issues as described above and is unable to
obtain adequate financing on terms acceptable to NRG Energy to
continue its operations, NRG Energy may have to file bankruptcy.
NRG Energy’s inability to obtain timely waivers and avoid
defaults on their credit obligations could lead to additional
involuntary bankruptcy proceedings. In any case, there is
substantial doubt as to NRG Energy’s ability to continue as
a going concern.

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming NRG Energy will continue as a going concern.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Note 2 —

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of
    Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include NRG
Energy’s accounts and those of its subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation. Accounting policies for all of NRG
Energy’s operations are in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 10, NRG Energy has investments in
partnerships, joint ventures and projects. Investments in such
businesses in which NRG Energy does not have control, but has
the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating
and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity
method. Earnings from equity in international investments are
recorded net of foreign income taxes. The more significant
accounting policies are as follows:

Nature of operations

The principal business of NRG Energy is the
ownership and operation, through its subsidiaries, of power
generation facilities and the sale of energy, capacity and
related products in the United States and internationally. NRG
Energy also has investments in alternative energy, thermal and
resource recovery facilities.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid
investments (primarily commercial paper) with an original
maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists primarily of cash
collateral for letters of credit issued in relation to project
development activities, funds held in trust accounts to satisfy
the requirements of certain debt agreements and funds held
within NRG Energy’s projects that are restricted in their
use.

Inventory

Inventory is valued at the lower of weighted
average cost or market and consists principally of fuel oil,
spare parts, coal, kerosene, emission allowance credits and raw
materials used to generate steam.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost
or the present value of minimum lease payments for assets under
capital leases. Significant additions or improvements extending
asset lives are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance that
do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are
charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the following estimated useful
lives:

The assets and related accumulated depreciation
amounts are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with
the resulting gain or loss included in operations. NRG Energy
expenses all repair and maintenance as incurred, including
planned major maintenance.

Asset Impairments

Long-lived assets that are held and used are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable.
Such reviews were performed in accordance with SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,” (SFAS No. 144) in 2002 and SFAS
No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of” (SFAS
No. 121) in prior years. An impairment loss is recognized
if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected
from an asset is less than its carrying value. An impairment
charge is measured by the difference between an asset’s
carrying amount and fair value. Fair values are determined by a
variety of valuation methods, including appraisals, sales prices
of similar assets and present value techniques.

Investments accounted for by the equity method
are reviewed for impairment in accordance with APB Opinion
No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock.” APB Opinion No. 18
requires that a loss in value of an investment that is other
than a temporary decline should be recognized. NRG Energy
identifies and measures loss in value of equity investments
based upon a comparison of fair value to carrying value.

Assets Held for Sale

Long-lived assets are classified as held for sale
when all of the required criteria specified in SFAS No. 144
are met. These criteria include, among others, existence of a
qualified plan to dispose of an asset, an assessment that
completion of a sale within one year is probable and approval of
the appropriate level of management and board of directors.
Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the
asset’s carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Capitalized Interest

Interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance
projects expected to require more than three months to complete
is capitalized. Capitalization of interest is discontinued when
the asset under construction is ready for its intended use or
when a project is terminated or construction ceased. Capitalized
interest was approximately $64.8 million,
$27.2 million, and $2.7 million in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

Capitalized Project Costs

Development costs and capitalized project costs
include third party professional services, permits, and other
costs that are incurred incidental to a particular project. Such
costs are expensed as incurred until an acquisition agreement or
letter of intent is signed, and the project has been approved by
NRG Energy’s Board of Directors. Additional costs incurred
after this point are capitalized. When a project begins
operation, previously capitalized project costs are reclassified
to equity investments in affiliates or property, plant and
equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser
of the life of the project’s related assets or revenue
contract period. Capitalized costs are charged to expense if a
project is abandoned or management otherwise determines the
costs to be unrecoverable.

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized
as interest expense on a basis which approximates the effective
interest method over the terms of the related debt.

Goodwill and Intangible
    Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase
price of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in business
combinations over their estimated fair value. Effective
January 1, 2002, NRG Energy implemented
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
(SFAS No. 142). Pursuant to SFAS No. 142,
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic impairment
testing. Prior to 2002, goodwill was amortized on a straight
line basis over 20 to 30 years.

Intangible assets represent contractual rights
held by NRG Energy. Intangible assets are amortized over their
economic useful life and reviewed for impairment on a periodic
basis. Non-amortized intangible assets are tested for impairment
annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance
occurs between annual tests that might reduce the fair value of
that asset.

Income Taxes

Following the completion of Xcel Energy’s
exchange offer on June 3, 2002, NRG and subsidiaries can
rejoin the Xcel Energy’s group for federal income tax
purposes provided the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) consents.
Because it is likely that Xcel Energy will not request IRS
consent to consolidate NRG Energy for income tax purposes in
2002, the income tax provision for NRG Energy, is based on a
consolidated NRG Energy group through June 3, 2002 and
separate corporate tax returns starting June 4, 2002 as
discussed in Note 15. On a stand-alone basis, NRG Energy
does not have the ability to recognize all tax benefits that may
ultimately accrue from losses occurring in 2002. Deferred tax
benefits have been recorded only to the extent a valuation
allowance was not considered necessary. A current tax benefit
has been recorded to the extent the 2002 tax losses can be
carried back. Current tax expense has been recorded for those
entities generating positive taxable income on a stand-alone
basis in 2002.

In March 2001, NRG Energy was deconsolidated from
Xcel Energy for federal income tax purposes. Prior to
March 13, 2001, NRG Energy was included in the consolidated
tax returns of Xcel Energy. NRG Energy calculated its income tax
provision on a separate return basis under a tax sharing
agreement with Xcel Energy. Current Federal and certain state
income taxes were payable to or receivable from Xcel Energy.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences in future years of differences between the tax
basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts at each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory
tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Income tax expense is the tax
payable for the period and the change during the period in
deferred tax assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is
recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely
than not to be realized.

Revenue Recognition

NRG Energy is primarily an electric generation
company, operating a portfolio of majority-owned electric
generating plants and certain plants in which its ownership
interest is 50% or less and which are accounted for under the
equity method. In connection with its electric generation
business, NRG Energy also produces thermal energy for sale to
customers, principally through steam and chilled water
facilities. NRG Energy also collects methane gas from landfill
sites, which is used for the generation of electricity. In
addition, NRG Energy sells small amounts of natural gas and oil
to third parties.

Electrical energy revenue is recognized upon
delivery to the customer. Capacity and ancillary revenue is
recognized when contractually earned. Disputed revenues are not
recorded in the financial statements until disputes are resolved
and collection is assured.

Revenue from long-term power sales contracts that
provide for higher pricing in the early years of the contract
are recognized in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 91-6, “Revenue Recognition of Long Term
Power Sales Contracts.” This results in revenue deferrals
and recognition on a levelized basis over the term of the
contract.

NRG Energy provides contract operations and
maintenance services to some of its non-consolidated affiliates.
Revenue is recognized as contract services are performed.

NRG Energy uses the equity method of accounting
to recognize as revenue its pro rata share of the net income or
loss of unconsolidated investments.

NRG Energy recognizes other income for interest
income on loans to affiliates as the interest is earned and
realizable.

Foreign Currency Translation and
    Transaction Gains and Losses

The local currencies are generally the functional
currency of NRG Energy’s foreign operations. Foreign
currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at
end-of-period rates of exchange. Revenues, expenses and cash
flows are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange for
the period. The resulting currency translation adjustments are
accumulated and reported as a separate component of
stockholder’s equity and are not included in the
determination of the results of operations. Foreign currency
transaction gains or losses are reported in results of
operations. NRG Energy recognized foreign currency transaction
losses of $10.4 million, gains of $1.8 million and
losses of $0.6 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject
NRG Energy to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable and investments in
debt securities. Cash accounts are generally held in Federally
insured banks. Accounts receivable, notes receivable and
derivative instruments are concentrated within entities engaged
in the energy industry. These industry concentrations may impact
NRG Energy’s overall exposure to credit risk, either
positively or negatively, in that the customers may be similarly



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

affected by changes in economic, industry or
other conditions. Receivables are generally not collateralized;
however, NRG Energy believes the credit risk posed by industry
concentration is offset by the diversification and
creditworthiness of its customer base.

Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents,
receivables, accounts payables, and accrued liabilities
approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments. The carrying amounts of long-term receivables
approximate fair value as the effective rates for these
instruments are comparable to market rates at year end,
including current portions. The fair value of long term debt is
estimated based on quoted market prices and similar instruments
with equivalent credit quality.

Stock Based Compensation

In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standard Board
(FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(SFAS) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation.” NRG Energy has elected to continue to
account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method prescribed in Accounting Principle Board Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.” Accordingly, NRG Energy records expense, in an
amount equal to the excess of the quoted market price on the
grant date over the option price. Such expense is recognized at
the grant date for options fully vested. For options with a
vesting period, the expense is recognized over the vesting
period. As of June 3, 2002, all stock options were
converted into Xcel Energy stock options.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from these estimates.

In recording transactions and balances resulting
from business operations, NRG Energy uses estimates based on the
best information available. Estimates are used for such items as
plant depreciable lives, tax provisions, un-collectible
accounts, and actuarially determined benefit costs and the
valuation of long-term energy commodities contracts, among
others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived
assets for impairment and to determine fair value of impaired
assets. As better information becomes available (or actual
amounts are determinable), the recorded estimates are revised.
Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to
prior accounting estimates.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 143,

“Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations”

(SFAS No. 143). This statement
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143
requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability
for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is
incurred. The liability is initially capitalized as part of the
cost of the related tangible long-lived asset and thus
depreciated over the asset’s useful life. Accretion of the
liabilities due to the passage of time will be an operating
expense. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived
assets included within the scope of SFAS No. 143 are
those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws,
statutes written or oral contracts, including obligations
arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. NRG Energy is
required to adopt SFAS No. 143 on January 1,
2003. NRG Energy is in the process of evaluating the impact of
adopting SFAS No. 143 on its financial condition.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In April 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 145,

“Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13,
and Technical Corrections,”

(SFAS No. 145)
that supercedes previous guidance for the reporting of gains and
losses from extinguishment of debt and accounting for leases,
among other things. SFAS No. 145 requires that only
gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt that meet the
requirements for classification as “Extraordinary
Items,” as prescribed in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 30, should be disclosed as such in the
financial statements. Previous guidance required all gains and
losses from the extinguishment of debt to be classified as
“Extraordinary Items.” This portion of
SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after May 15, 2002, with restatement of prior periods
required. NRG Energy has no extraordinary gains or losses
resulting from extinguishment of debt during the three years
ended December 31, 2002 that will require restatement upon
adoption of this part of the statement.

In addition, SFAS No. 145 amends
SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for Leases,”

(SFAS No. 13) as it relates to accounting by a lessee
for certain lease modifications. Under SFAS No. 13, if
a capital lease is modified in such a way that the change gives
rise to a new agreement classified as an operating lease, the
assets and obligation are removed, a gain or loss is recognized
and the new lease is accounted for as an operating lease. Under
SFAS No. 145, capital leases that are modified so the
resulting lease agreement is classified as an operating lease
are to be accounted for under the sale-leaseback provisions of
SFAS No. 98,

“Accounting for Leases.”

These provisions of SFAS No. 145 were effective for
transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. Adoption of
SFAS No. 145 is not expected to have a material impact
on NRG Energy.

In June 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities,”

(SFAS No. 146), SFAS No. 146 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with
exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3,

“Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring).”

SFAS No. 146 applies to
costs associated with an exit activity that does not involve an
entity newly acquired in a business combination or with a
disposal activity covered by SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.”

The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are
effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December 31, 2002.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.

The initial
recognition and initial measurement provisions of this
interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002,
irrespective of the guarantor’s fiscal year-end. The
disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements
of interim or annual periods ending after December 15,
2002. The interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by
a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about
its obligations under guarantees. The interpretation also
clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a
liability by a guarantor at the inception of the guarantee for
the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing the
guarantee. See Note 14.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities

(FIN No. 46). FIN No. 46
requires an enterprise’s consolidated financial statements
to include subsidiaries in which the enterprise has a
controlling interest. Historically, that requirement has been
applied to subsidiaries in which an enterprise has a majority
voting interest, but in many circumstances the enterprise’s
consolidated financial statements do not include the
consolidation of variable interest entities with which it has
similar relationships but no majority voting interest. Under FIN
No. 46 the voting interest approach is not effective in
identifying controlling financial interest. Assets of entities
consolidated upon adoption of the new standard will be initially
recorded at their carrying amounts at the date the requirements
of the new rule first apply. If determining carrying amounts as
required is impractical, then the assets are to be measured at
fair value the first date the new rule applies. Any difference
between the net amount of any previously recognized interest in
the newly consolidated entity should be recognized as the
cumulative effect of an accounting

change. FIN No. 46 becomes effective in the
third quarter of 2003. Fin No. 46 is not expected to have a
significant impact on NRG Energy.

Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified
for comparative purposes. These reclassifications had no effect
on net income or total stockholder’s equity as previously
reported.

Note 3 —

Special Charges

The credit rating downgrades, defaults under
certain credit agreements, increased collateral requirements and
reduced liquidity experienced by NRG Energy during the third
quarter of 2002 were “triggering events” which,
pursuant to SFAS No. 144, required the Company to
review the recoverability of its long-lived assets. As a result
of this review, NRG Energy recorded asset impairment charges
during 2002 totaling $2.5 billion for various projects in
operation, under construction and in development as shown in the
table below.

To determine whether an asset was impaired, NRG
Energy compared asset carrying values to total future estimated
undiscounted cash flows. Separate analyses were completed for
assets or groups of assets at the lowest level for which
identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash
flows of other assets and liabilities. The estimates of future
cash flow included only future cash flows, net of associated
cash outflows, directly associated with and expected to arise as
a result of NRG Energy’s assumed use and eventual
disposition of the asset. Cash flow estimates associated with
assets in service were based on the asset’s existing
service potential, whereas assets under construction or in
development were based on expected service potential when
complete. The cash flow estimates included probability
weightings to consider possible alternative courses of action
and outcomes, given NRG Energy’s financial position and
liquidity constraints.

If an asset was determined to be impaired based
on the cash flow testing performed, an impairment loss was
recorded to write down the asset to its fair value. Estimates of
fair value were based on appraisals, prices for similar assets
and present value techniques.

Special charges from continuing operations
included in Operating Expenses include the following:



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Special Charges included the following asset
impairments in 2002:

(1)

Certain amounts have been combined from
    impairments disclosed in the September 30, 2002,
    Form 10-Q for turbines and other items.

All of these impairment charges relate to assets
considered held for use under SFAS No. 144. Fair
values determined by similar asset prices reflect NRG
Energy’s current estimate of recoverability from expected
marketing of project assets. Fair values determined by estimated
market price represent market bids or appraisals received that
NRG Energy believes is best reflective of value. For fair values
determined by projected cash flows, the fair value represents a
discounted cash flow amount over the remaining life of each
project that reflects project-specific assumptions for long-term
power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs, and
expected plant operation given assumed market conditions.

Additional asset impairments may be recorded by
NRG Energy in periods subsequent to December 31, 2002,
given the changing business conditions and the resolution of the
pending restructuring plan. Management is unable to determine
the possible magnitude of any additional asset impairments, but
they could be material.

Severance and Other Charges

NRG Energy recorded severance charges of
$25.6 million for employees terminated during 2002 and

Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for
    Sale

Pursuant to the requirements of
SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”

NRG Energy has
classified and is accounting for certain of its assets as
held-for-sale at December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 144
requires that assets held for sale be valued on an
asset-by-asset basis at the lower of carrying amount or fair
value less costs to sell. In applying those provisions NRG
Energy’s management considered cash flow analyses, bids and
offers related to those assets and businesses. This amount is
included in loss from discontinued operations in the
accompanying Statement of Operations. In accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 144, assets held for sale will
not be depreciated commencing with its classification as such.

Discontinued Operations

During 2002, NRG Energy entered into agreements
to dispose of four consolidated international projects and one
consolidated domestic project. Sales of four of the projects
closed during 2002 (Bulo Bulo, Csepel, Entrade and Crockett
Cogeneration) and one project (Killingholme) was sold in January
2003. In addition, NRG Energy has committed to a plan to sell a
sixth project (Hsin Yu). Sale of this project is expected to be
completed in 2003.

The financial results for all of these businesses
have been accounted for as discontinued operations in 2002.
Accordingly, operating results of prior periods have been
restated to report the operations as discontinued.

completed the sale of its interest in the Killingholme project
to its lenders for a nominal value and forgiveness of
outstanding debt with a carrying value of approximately
$360.1 million at December 31, 2002. The sale of NRG
Energy’s interest in the Killingholme project and the
release of debt obligations will result in a gain on sale in the
first quarter of 2003 of approximately $182.3 million. The
gain results from the write-down of the project’s assets in
the third quarter of 2002 below the carrying value of the
related debt. NRG Energy accounted for the results of operations
of Killingholme as part of its power generation segment within
Europe

Hsin Yu

—
During 2002 NRG Energy committed to sell its ownership
interest in Hsin Yu located in Taiwan. During the third
quarter of 2002, NRG Energy recorded an impairment charge of

Energy owns 60% with one other party owning the remaining
minority interest. At the present time, NRG Energy is
negotiating to sell its interest in the project to the minority
owner for a nominal value plus assumption of its future funding
obligations. No assurance can be provided that the negotiations
will be successful and, if not, NRG Energy is committed to
pursue other sales alternatives. NRG Energy accounted for
the results of operations of Hsin Yu as part of its power
generation segment within Asia Pacific.

Inc., owns the remaining 50% of MIBRAG.

In August 2001, NRG Energy acquired from Indeck
Energy Services, Inc. an approximately 2,255 MW portfolio
of operating projects and projects in advanced development, that
are located in Illinois and upstate New York.

In August 2001, NRG Energy acquired Duke
Energy’s 77% interest in the approximately 520 MW
natural-gas fired McClain Energy Generating Facility located
near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The Oklahoma Municipal Power
Authority owns the remaining 23% interest. The McClain facility
commenced operations in June 2001.

In September 2001, NRG Energy acquired a 50%
interest in TermoRio SA, a 1,040 MW gas-fired cogeneration
facility currently under construction in Rio de Janeiro State,
Brazil, from Petroleos Brasileiros SA (Petrobras). Commercial
operation of the facility is expected to begin in March 2004.
NRG Energy has the option to put its interest in the project
back to Petrobras after March 2002 if by that time certain
milestones have not been met, including final agreement on the
terms of all project documents.

During fiscal year 2001, NRG Energy also acquired
other minor interests in projects in Taiwan, India, Peru and the
State of Nevada.

The respective purchase prices have been
allocated to the net assets of the acquired entities as follows:

In July 2001, NRG Energy signed agreements to
acquire from Edison Mission Energy a 50% interest in the
375 MW Commonwealth Atlantic gas and oil-fired generating
station located near Chesapeake, Virginia, and a 50% interest in
the 110 MW James River coal-fired generating facility in
Hopewell, Virginia. NRG Energy closed the acquisition of the
Commonwealth Atlantic and James River generating facilities in
January 2002, for $11.2 million and $6.5 million,
respectively.

Terminated Asset Acquisitions

Conectiv

—
In April 2002, NRG Energy terminated its purchase agreement with
a subsidiary of Conectiv to acquire 794 MW of generating
capacity and other assets, including an additional 66 MW of
the Conemaugh Generating Station and an additional 42 MW of
the Keystone Generating Station. The purchase price for these
assets was approximately $230 million. No incremental costs
were incurred by NRG Energy related to the termination of this
agreement.

FirstEnergy

—
In November 2001, NRG Energy signed purchase agreements to
acquire or lease a portfolio of generating assets from
FirstEnergy Corporation. Under the terms of the agreements, NRG
Energy agreed to pay approximately $1.6 billion for four
primarily coal-fueled generating stations.

On July 2, 2002, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued an order approving the
transfer of FirstEnergy generating assets to NRG Energy;
however, the FERC conditioned the approval on NRG Energy’s
assumption of FirstEnergy’s obligations under a separate
agreement between FirstEnergy and the City of Cleveland. These
conditions required FirstEnergy to protect the City of Cleveland
in the event the generating assets are taken out of service. On
July 16, 2002, FERC clarified that the condition would
require NRG Energy to provide notice to the City of Cleveland
and FirstEnergy if the generating assets were taken out of
service and that other obligations remain with FirstEnergy.

On August 8, 2002, FirstEnergy notified NRG
Energy that the agreements regarding the transfer of generating
assets from FirstEnergy to NRG Energy had been cancelled.
FirstEnergy cited the reason for canceling the agreements as an
alleged anticipatory breach of certain obligations in the
agreements by NRG Energy. On February 27, 2003, FirstEnergy
gave NRG Energy notice that it was commencing arbitration
against NRG Energy to determine whether NRG Energy is liable to
FirstEnergy for failure to close the transaction. NRG Energy
believes it has meritorious defenses against FirstEnergy’s
claim and intends to

been accrued for this contingency. Management is unable to
predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, however, an adverse
decision could be material to NRG Energy’s financial

Investments Accounted for by the Equity
    Method

NRG Energy has investments in various
international and domestic energy projects. The equity method of
accounting is applied to such investments in affiliates, which
include joint ventures and partnerships, because the ownership
structure prevents NRG Energy from exercising a controlling
influence over operating and financial policies of the projects.
Under this method, equity in pretax income or losses of domestic
partnerships and, generally, in the net income or losses of
international projects, are reflected as equity in earnings of
unconsolidated affiliates.

Operating Agreements

NRG Energy has two agreements with Xcel Energy
for the purchase of thermal energy. Under the terms of the
agreements, Xcel Energy charges NRG Energy for certain costs
(fuel, labor, plant maintenance, and auxiliary power) incurred
by Xcel Energy to produce the thermal energy. NRG Energy paid
Xcel Energy $8.2 million, $7.1 million and
$5.5 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, under

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Saale Energie GmbH (SEG) has a long-term
electricity supply contract with its sole customer, VEAG. SEG
supplies its total available electricity capacity to VEAG. The
contract has a term of 25 years. VEAG is obligated to pay
on a monthly basis a price that covers the availability of power
supply capacity and the operating costs incurred to produce
electricity. During 2002 and the nine months subsequent to NRG
Energy’s consolidation of SEG in March 2001, approximately
$46.0 million and $56.3 million, respectively, was
recognized as revenue under this agreement. NRG Energy expects
SEG to recognize revenues of approximately $40 million each
year under this agreement.

Investment in bonds is comprised of marketable
debt securities. These securities consist of municipal bonds of
Audrain County, Missouri and Jackson County, Mississippi. The
Audrain County bonds mature in 2023 and the Jackson County bonds
mature in 2010. These investments in bonds are classified as
held to maturity and are recorded at amortized cost. The
carrying value of these bonds approximates fair value. Both the

Debt and Capital Leases

Long-term debt and capital leases consist of the
following:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(1)

NRG Energy has not reclassified the long term
    portions of these debt issuances to current as they are not
    currently callable within one year from the balance sheet date.

As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy has
failed to make scheduled payments on interest and/or principal
on approximately $4.0 billion of its recourse debt and is
in default under the related debt instruments. These missed
payments also have resulted in cross-defaults of numerous other
non-recourse and limited recourse debt instruments of NRG
Energy. In addition to the missed debt payments, a significant
amount of NRG Energy’s debt and other obligations contain
terms, which require that they be supported with letters of
credit or cash collateral following a ratings downgrade. As a
result of the downgrades that NRG Energy has experienced in
2002, NRG Energy estimates that it is in default of its
obligations to post collateral of approximately
$1.1 billion, principally to fund equity guarantees
associated with its construction revolver



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

financing facility, to fund debt service reserves
and other guarantees related to NRG Energy projects and to fund
trading operations. In early November 2002, NRG Energy presented
a restructuring plan to its creditors.

In mid-December 2002, the NRG Energy bank
steering committee submitted a counter-proposal to the
restructuring plan. In January 2003, a new restructuring
proposal was presented to the creditors and negotiations are
ongoing. On March 26, 2003, Xcel Energy announced that its
board of directors had approved a tentative settlement agreement
with holders of most of NRG Energy’s long-term notes and
the steering committee representing NRG Energy’s bank
lenders. The settlement is subject to certain conditions,
including the approval of at least a majority in dollar amount
of the NRG Energy bank lenders and long-term noteholders and
definitive documentation. There can be no assurance that such
approvals will be obtained. The terms of the settlement call for
Xcel Energy to make payments to NRG Energy over the next
13 months totaling up to $752 million for the benefit
of NRG Energy’s creditors in consideration for their waiver
of an existing and potential claims against Xcel Energy. Under
the settlement, Xcel Energy will make the following payments:
(i) $350 million at or shortly following the
consummation of a restructuring of NRG Energy’s debt. It is
expected this payment would be made prior to year-end 2003;
(ii) $50 million on January 1, 2004. At Xcel
Energy’s option, it may fill this requirement with either
cash or Xcel Energy common stock or any combination thereof; and
(iii) $352 million in April 2004.

Absent an agreement on a comprehensive
restructuring plan, NRG Energy will remain in default under its
debt and other obligations, because it does not have sufficient
funds to meet such requirements and obligations. As a result,
the lenders will be able, if they so choose, to seek to enforce
their remedies at any time, which would likely lead to a
bankruptcy filing by NRG Energy. There can be no assurance that
NRG Energy’s creditors ultimately will accept any
consensual restructuring plan, or that, in the interim, NRG
Energy’s lenders and bondholders will continue to forbear
from exercising any or all of the remedies available to them,
including acceleration of NRG Energy’s indebtedness,
commencement of an involuntary proceeding in bankruptcy and, in
the case of certain lenders, realization on the collateral for
their indebtedness.

Pending the resolution of NRG Energy’s
credit contingencies, NRG Energy has classified as current
liabilities those long-term debt obligations that lenders have
the ability to accelerate within twelve months of the balance
sheet date.

Short Term Debt

In March 2002, NRG Energy’s
$500 million recourse revolving credit facility matured and
was replaced with a $1.0 billion 364-day revolving line of
credit, which matured on March 7, 2003. The facility is
unsecured and provides for borrowings of “Base Rate
Loans” and “Eurocurrency Loans”. The Base Rate
Loans bear interest at the greater of the Administrative
Agent’s prime rate or the sum of the prevailing per annum
rates for overnight funds plus 0.5% per annum, plus an
additional margin which varies from 0.375% to 0.50% based upon
NRG Energy’s utilization of the facility and its
then-current senior debt credit rating. The Eurocurrency loans
bear interest at an adjusted rate based on LIBOR plus an
adjustment percentage, which varies depending on NRG
Energy’s senior debt credit rating and the amount
outstanding under the facility. The credit agreement for this
facility was amended in April 2002 to revise the interest
coverage ratio covenant. As amended, the covenant requires NRG
Energy to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 1.75 to
1, as determined at the end of each fiscal quarter. The facility
contains additional covenants that, among other things, restrict
the incurrence of liens and require NRG Energy to maintain a net
worth of at least $1.5 billion plus 25% of NRG
Energy’s consolidated net income from January 1, 2002
through the determination date. In addition, NRG Energy must
maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 0.68 to
1.00 as defined in the credit agreement. The failure to comply
with any of these covenants would be an Event of Default under
the terms of the credit agreement. At December 31, 2002,
NRG Energy had a $1.0 billion outstanding balance under
this credit facility. As of December 31, 2002, the weighted
average interest rate of such outstanding advances was
5.14% per year. NRG Energy missed a $7.6 million
interest payment due on September 30, 2002, and as of that
date, NRG Energy violated both the minimum net worth covenant
and the minimum interest coverage ratio. NRG Energy also failed
to make a fourth quarter interest payment of approximately



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$18.6 million due December 31, 2002. On
February 27, 2003, ABN AMRO issued a notice on default on
the corporate revolver financing facility, rendering the debt
immediately due and payable. The recourse revolving credit
facility matured on March 7, 2003 and the $1 billion
drawn remains outstanding. Accordingly, the facility is in
default.

NRG Energy’s $125 million syndicated
letter of credit facility contains terms, conditions and
covenants that are substantially the same as those in NRG
Energy’s $1.0 billion 364-day revolving line of
credit. During the second quarter of 2002, the letter of credit
facility agreement was amended to incorporate the same covenant
revisions and other amendments that had previously been made to
the terms and conditions of NRG Energy’s $1.0 billion
revolving credit facility, including the addition of an interest
coverage ratio covenant. As of December 31, 2002, NRG
Energy violated both the minimum net worth covenant and the
minimum interest coverage ratio. Accordingly, the facility is in
default. NRG Energy had $110 million and $170 million
in outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2002
and 2001, respectively.

As of December 31, 2001, NRG Energy, through
its wholly owned subsidiary, NRG South Central Generating LLC,
had outstanding approximately $40 million under a project
level, non-recourse revolving credit agreement which matured in
March 2002. During the period ended December 31, 2001, the
weighted average interest rate of such outstanding advances was
4.46%. NRG South Central extended this facility in March 2002,
for an additional 3 months, on substantially similar terms.
NRG South Central paid down the outstanding balance in June
2002. The weighted average interest rate for the three months
ended June 30, 2002 was 3.1%. As of December 31, 2002,
this facility no longer exists.

In January 2001, NRG Energy entered into a bridge
credit agreement with a final maturity date of December 31,
2001. Approximately $600 million was borrowed under this
facility to partially finance NRG Energy’s acquisition of
the LS Power generation assets. In March 2001, the bridge credit
facility was repaid with proceeds from NRG Energy’s
offering of common stock and equity units.

In June 2001, NRG Energy entered into a
$600 million term loan facility. The facility was unsecured
and provided for borrowings of base rate loans and Eurocurrency
loans. The facility terminated on June 21, 2002. As of
December 31, 2001, the aggregate amount outstanding under
this facility was $600 million. During the period ended
December 31, 2001 the weighted average interest rate of
such outstanding advances was 3.94%. NRG Energy repaid this
facility in March 2002, in connection with the closing of its
new $1.0 billion unsecured corporate-level revolving line
of credit and the receipt of $300 million of cash from Xcel
Energy.

Long-term Debt and Capital Leases

Senior Securities

On March 13, 2001, NRG Energy completed the
sale of 11.5 million equity units for an initial price of
$25 per unit. The 11.5 million equity units sold
included 1.5 million units sold pursuant to the
underwriters’ over-allotment option. NRG Energy received
gross proceeds from the issuance of $287.5 million. Net
proceeds from this issuance were $278.4 million after
deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated
offering expenses. Each equity unit initially consists of a
corporate unit comprising a $25 principal amount of NRG
Energy’s senior debentures and an obligation to acquire
shares of NRG Energy common stock no later than May 18,
2004 at a price ranging from between $27.00 and $32.94.
Approximately $4.1 million of the gross proceeds have been
recorded as additional paid in capital to reflect the value of
the obligation to purchase NRG Energy’s common stock.
Interest payments will be payable on the debentures quarterly in
arrears on each February 16, May 16, August 16
and November 16, commencing May 16, 2001. Interest
will be payable initially at an annual rate of 6.50% of the
principal amount of $25 per debenture to, but excluding,
February 17, 2004, or May 18, 2004. If the interest
rate is not reset three business days prior to February 17,
2004 or three business days prior to May 18, 2004, the
debentures will bear interest from February 17, 2004, or
May 18, 2004, as applicable, at the reset rate to, but
excluding, May 16, 2006. In



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

addition, original issued discount will accrue on
the debentures. The net proceeds were used in part to reduce
amounts outstanding under NRG Energy’s $600 million
short-term bridge credit agreement, which was used to finance in
part NRG Energy’s acquisition of LS Power generation
assets. As a result of the merger by Xcel Energy of NRG, holders
of the NRZ equity units are no longer obligated to purchase
shares of NRG common stock under the purchase contracts.
Instead, holders of the equity units are now obligated to
purchase a number of shares of Xcel Energy common stock upon
settlement of the purchase contracts equal to the adjusted
“settlement rate” or the adjusted “early
settlement rate” as applicable. As a result of the
short-form merger, the adjusted settlement rate is 0.4630 and
the adjusted early settlement rate is 0.3795, subject to the
terms and conditions of the purchase contracts set forth in a
purchase contract agreement. On October 29, 2002, NRG
Energy announced it would not make the November 16, 2002
quarterly interest payment on the 6.50% senior unsecured
debentures due in 2006, which trade with the associated purchase
contracts as NRG corporate units (NRZ). The 30-day grace period
to make payment ended December 16, 2002, and NRG Energy did
not make payment to the NRZ holders and, as a result, this issue
is in default. In addition, NRG Energy did not make the
February 17, 2003 quarterly interest payment. In the event
of an NRG Energy bankruptcy, the obligation to purchase shares
of Xcel Energy stock terminates.

In April 2001, NRG Energy issued
$690 million of senior notes in two tranches. The first
tranche of $350 million matures in April 2011 and bears an
interest rate of 7.75%. The second tranche of $340 million
matures in April 2031 and bears an interest rate of 8.625%.
Interest on the notes is due semi-annually each April and
October. The net proceeds of the issuance were used for
repayment of short-term indebtedness incurred to fund
acquisitions, for investments, general corporate purposes and to
provide capital for future planned acquisitions.

In June 2001, NRG filed a shelf registration with
the SEC to sell up to $2 billion in debt securities, common
and preferred stock, warrants and other securities.
Approximately $1.5 billion remains outstanding under this
shelf registration filing as of December 31, 2002.

In July 2001, NRG Energy completed the sale of
$500 million of unsecured senior notes under this shelf
registration. The senior notes were issued in two tranches, the
first tranche of $340 million of 6.75% Senior Notes is
due July 2006 and the second tranche of $160 million of
8.625% Senior Notes is due April 2031. Interest payments
are due semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 until
maturity for the Senior Notes due 2006 and April 1 and
October 1 until maturity for the Senior Notes due 2031. NRG
received net proceeds from the sale of both series of notes of
approximately $505.2 million, including interest on the
senior notes due 2031, accrued from April 5, 2001. The net
proceeds were used to repay all amounts outstanding under
NRG’s revolving credit agreement and for investments and
other general corporate purposes and to provide capital for
planned acquisitions. On October 1, 2002, NRG Energy failed
to make a $13.6 million interest payment on the
$350 million 7.75% senior unsecured notes due 2011, a
$11.5 million interest payment due on the $340 million
of 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2006, and a
$21.6 million payment on the combined $500 million of
8.625% senior unsecured notes due 2031. The 30-day grace
period to make payment related to these issues has passed and
NRG Energy did not make the required payments. NRG Energy is in
default on these notes.

In March 2000, an NRG Energy sponsored
non-consolidated pass through trust issued $250 million of 8.70%
certificates due March 15, 2005. Each certificate
represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the
assets of the trust. Interest is payable on the certificates
semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each
year through 2005. The sole assets of the trust consist of
£160 million (approximately $250 million on the date of
issuance) principal amount 7.97% Reset Senior Notes due
March 15, 2020 issued by NRG Energy. The Reset Senior Notes
were used principally to finance NRG Energy’s acquisition
of the Killingholme facility. Interest is payable semi-annually
on the Reset Senior Notes on March 15 and September 15
through March 15, 2005, and then at intervals and interest
rates established in a remarketing process. If the Reset Senior
Notes are not remarketed on March 15, 2005, they must be
mandatorily redeemed by NRG Energy on

such date. On September 16, 2002, NRG Pass-
through Trust I failed to make a $10.9 million
interest payment due on the $250 million bonds, as a
consequence of NRG Energy failing to pay interest due on
£160 million of 7.97% debt. The 30-day grace
period to make payment related to this issue has passed and NRG
Energy did not make the required payments, NRG Energy is in
default on these bonds.

The NRG Energy senior notes are unsecured and are
used to support equity requirements for projects acquired and in
development. Interest is paid semi-annually.

The NRG Energy $125 million,
$250 million, $300 million, $350 million, and
$240 million senior notes are unsecured and are used to
support equity requirements for projects acquired and in
development. The interest is paid semi-annually and mature in
February 2006, June 2007, June 2009, September 2010, and
November 2013, respectively. On September 16, 2002, NRG
Energy failed to make a $14.4 million interest payment due
on $350 million of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due in
2010. On November 1, 2002, NRG Energy failed to make a
$9.6 million interest payment due on $240 million of
8.0% senior unsecured notes due in 2013. On
December 31, 2002, NRG Energy failed to make an
$11.3 million interest payment due on $300 million of
7.5% senior unsecured notes due in 2009. On
December 15, 2002, NRG Energy failed to make a
$9.4 million interest payment due on $250 million of
7.5% senior unsecured notes due in 2007. On
February 1, 2003, NRG Energy failed to make a
$4.8 million interest payment due on the $125 million
of 7.625% senior unsecured notes due 2006. The 30-day grace
period to make payment related to these issues has passed and
NRG Energy did not make the required payments, and NRG Energy is
in default on these notes.

The $240 million NRG Energy Senior notes due
November 1, 2013 are ROARS. November 1, 2003 is the
first remarketing date for these notes. Interest is payable
semi-annually on May 1, and November 1, of each year
through 2003, and then at intervals and interest rates as
discussed in the indenture. On the remarketing date, the notes
must either be mandatorily tendered to and purchased by Credit
Suisse Financial Products or mandatorily redeemed by NRG Energy
at prices discussed in the indenture. The notes are unsecured
debt that rank senior to all of NRG Energy’s existing and
future subordinated indebtedness. On October 16, 2002 NRG
Energy entered into a Termination Agreement with the agent CSFB
that, terminated the Remarketing Agreement. A termination
payment of $31.4 million due on October 17, 2002 has
not been paid.

Project financings

In May 2001, NRG Energy’s wholly-owned
subsidiary, NRG Finance Company I LLC, entered into a
$2 billion revolving credit facility. The facility was
established to finance the acquisition, development and
construction of power generating plants located in the United
States and to finance the acquisition of turbines for such
facilities. The facility provides for borrowings of base rate
loans and Eurocurrency loans and is secured by mortgages and
security agreements in respect of the assets of the projects
financed under the facility, pledges of the equity interests in
the subsidiaries or affiliates of the borrower that own such
projects, and by guaranties from each such subsidiary or
affiliate. Provided that certain conditions are met that assure
the lenders that sufficient security remains for the remaining
outstanding loans, the borrower may repay loans relating to one
project and have the liens relating to that project released.
Loans that have been repaid may be re-borrowed, as permitted by
the terms of the facility. The facility terminates on
May 8, 2006. The facility is non-recourse to NRG Energy
other than its obligation to contribute equity at certain times
in respect of projects and turbines financed under the facility.
NRG Energy estimates the obligation to contribute equity to be
approximately $819 million as of December 31, 2002. As
of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the aggregate amount
outstanding under this facility was $1.08 billion and
$697.5 million, respectively. During the period ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, the weighted average interest
rate of such outstanding advances was 4.92% and 4.83%,
respectively. At December 31, 2002, interest and fees due
in September 2002 were not paid

and NRG Energy has suspended required equity
contributions to the projects. Supporting construction and other
contracts associated with NRG Energy’s Pike and Nelson
projects were violated by NRG Energy, in September and October
2002, respectively. NRG Energy is in default of this agreement
and on November 6, 2002, lenders to NRG Energy accelerated
the approximately $1.08 billion of debt under the
construction revolver facility, rendering the debt immediately
due and payable.

As part of NRG Energy’s acquisition of the
LS Power assets in January 2001, NRG Energy, through its wholly
owned subsidiary, LSP Kendall Energy LLC, acquired a
$554.2 million credit facility. The facility is
non-recourse to NRG Energy and consists of a construction and
term loan, working capital and letter of credit facilities. As
of December 31, 2002 and 2001, there were borrowings
totaling approximately $495.8 million and
$499.5 million, respectively, outstanding under the
facility at a weighted average annual interest rate of 3.19% and
5.12%, respectively. In May 2002, LSP-Kendall Energy, LLC
received a notice of default from Societie General, the
administrative agent under LSP-Kendall’s Credit and
Reimbursement Agreement dated November 12, 1999. The notice
asserted that an event of default had occurred under the Credit
and Reimbursement Agreement as a result of liens filed against
the Kendall project by various subcontractors. In consideration
of the borrower’s implementation of a plan to remove the
liens, and NRG Energy’s indemnification pursuant to an
Indemnity Agreement dated June 28, 2002, of the lenders to
the Kendall project from any claims or damages relating to these
liens or any dispute or action involving the projects EPC
contractor, the administrative agent, with the consent of the
required lenders under the Credit and Reimbursement Agreement,
withdrew the notice of default and conditionally waived any
default or event of default described therein. Discussions with
the administrative agent regarding the liens continue. On
January 10, 2003, NRG Energy received a notice of default
from LSP Kendall’s lenders indicating that certain events
of default have taken place and that by issuing this notice of
default the lenders have preserved all of their rights and
remedies under the Credit Agreement and other Credit Documents.
NRG Energy is negotiating a waiver to this default notice with
the creditors to LSP Kendall.

Upon the acquisition of the LS Power assets, a
subsidiary of NRG Energy assumed approximately $326 million
of bonds outstanding originally issued to finance the
construction of the Batesville generation plant. In May 1999,
LSP Energy Limited Partnership (Partnership) and LSP Batesville
Funding Corporation (Funding) issued two series of Senior
Secured Bonds (Bonds) in the following total principle amounts:
$150 million 7.16% Series A Senior Secured Bonds due
2014 and $176 million 8.160% Series B Senior Secured
Bonds due 2025. Interest is payable semiannually on each
January 15 and July 15. In March 2000, a registration
statement was filed by Partnership and Funding and became
effective. The registration statement was filed to allow the
exchange of the Bonds for two series of debt securities
(Exchange Bonds), which are in all material respects
substantially identical to the Bonds. The Exchange Bonds are
secured by substantially all of the personal property and
contract rights of the Partnership and Funding. The Exchange
Bonds are redeemable, at the option of Partnership and Funding,
at any time in whole or from time to time in part, on not less
than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice to the holders
of that series of Exchange Bonds, on any date prior to their
maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding
principal amount of the Exchange Bonds being redeemed and a make
whole premium. In no event will the redemption price ever be
less than 100% of the principal amount of the Exchange Bonds
being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
Principal payments are payable on each January 15 and
July 15 beginning July 15, 2001.

In March 2001, NRG Energy increased its ownership
interest in Penobscot Energy Recovery Company (PERC), which
resulted in the consolidation of its equity investment in PERC.
As a result, the assets and liabilities of PERC became part of
the assets and liabilities of NRG Energy. Upon completion of the
transaction, NRG Energy recorded approximately
$37.9 million of outstanding Finance Authority of Maine
(FAME) Electric Rate Stabilization Revenue Refunding Bonds
Series 1998 (FAME bonds) which were issued on PERC’s
behalf by FAME in June 1998. The face amount of the bonds that
were initially issued was approximately $44.9 million and
was used to repay the Floating Rate Demand Resource Revenue
Bonds issued by the Town of Orrington, Maine on behalf of PERC.
The FAME bonds are fixed rate bonds with

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

yields ranging from 3.75% to 5.2%. The weighted
average yield on the FAME bonds is approximately 5.1%. The FAME
bonds are subject to mandatory redemption in annual installments
of varying amounts through July 1, 2018. Beginning
July 1, 2008 the FAME bonds are subject to redemption at
the option of PERC at a redemption price equal to 102% through
June 30, 2009, 101% for the period July 1, 2009 to
June 30, 2010 and 100% thereafter, of the principal amount
outstanding, plus accrued interest. The loan agreement with FAME
contains certain restrictive covenants relating to the FAME
bonds, which restrict PERC’s ability to incur additional
indebtedness, and restricts the ability of the general partners
to sell, assign or transfer their general partner interests. The
bonds are collateralized by liens on substantially all of
PERC’s assets. As of December 31, 2002, there remains
$28.7 million of bonds outstanding.

On June 22, 2001, NRG MidAtlantic Generating
LLC (MidAtlantic), a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Energy,
borrowed approximately $420.9 million under a five year
term loan agreement (Agreement) to finance, in part, the
acquisition of certain generating facilities from Conectiv. The
Agreement terminates in November 2005 and provides for a total
credit facility of $580 million. Interest is payable
quarterly. The debt is guaranteed by MidAtlantic and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. The Agreement provides for a variable
interest rate at either the higher of the Prime rate or the
Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or the London Interbank Offered
Rate (LIBOR) of interest. During the period ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, the weighted average interest
rate for amounts outstanding under the Agreement was 3.30% and
4.56%, respectively. MidAtlantic is obligated to pay a
commitment fee of 0.375% of the unused portion of the credit
facility. The Agreement requires MidAtlantic to comply with
certain covenants concerning limitations on additional
borrowings, sales of assets, capital expenditures, and payment
of dividends or other distributions to shareholders.

In June 2001, NRG Energy through its wholly owned
subsidiaries, Brazos Valley Energy LP and Brazos Valley
Technology LP, entered into a $180 million non-recourse
construction credit facility to fund the construction of the
600 MW Brazos Valley gas-fired combined cycle merchant
generation facility located in Fort Bend County, Texas. On
October 8, 2002, bank lenders and the project company
executed amendments to the loan documents that provided for
additional advances to fund certain construction costs. As of
December 31, 2002, there existed an outstanding balance of
$194.4 million under this credit agreement. The weighted
average interest rate as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was
4.41% and 4.61%, respectively. Interest is payable quarterly. On
January 31, 2003, NRG Energy consented to the foreclosure
of its Brazos Valley project by its lenders. As consequence of
foreclosure, NRG Energy no longer has any interest in the Brazos
Valley project, however, NRG Energy may be obligated to infuse
additional amounts of capital to fund a debt service reserve
account that had never been funded and may be obligated to make
an equity infusion to satisfy a contingent equity agreement.

In connection with NRG Energy’s acquisition
of the COBEE facilities, NRG Energy recorded on its balance
sheet approximately $56.3 million of non-recourse long-term
debt that is due in 18 semi-annual installments of varying
amounts beginning January 31, 1999 and ending July 31,
2007. The loan agreement provides an A Loan of up to
$30 million and a B Loan of up to $45 million.
Interest is payable semi-annual in arrears at a rate equal to
6-month LIBOR plus a margin of 4.5% on the A Loan and 6-month
LIBOR plus a margin of 4.0% on the B Loan. The A Loan and the B
Loan are collateralized by a mortgage on substantially all of
COBEE’s assets.

In August 2001, NRG Energy entered into a 364-day
term loan of up to $296 million. The credit facility was
structured as a senior unsecured loan and was partially
non-recourse to NRG Energy. The proceeds were used to finance
the McClain generating facility acquisition. In November 2001,
the credit facility was repaid from the proceeds of a
$181.0 million term loan and $8.0 million working
capital facility entered into by NRG McClain LLC, with
Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, New York branch, as agent
(non-recourse to NRG Energy). The final maturity date of the
facility is November 30, 2006. As of December 31, 2002
and 2001, the aggregate amount outstanding under this facility
was $157.3 million and $159.9 million, respectively.

On February 22, 2000, NRG Northeast
Generating LLC (NRG Northeast), an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of NRG Energy, issued $750 million of project
level senior secured bonds, to refinance short-term project
borrowings and for certain other purposes. The bond offering
included three tranches: $320 million with an interest rate
of 8.065% due in 2004, $130 million with an interest rate
of 8.842% due in 2015 and $300 million with an interest
rate of 9.292% due in 2024. Interest and principal payments are
due semi- annually. The bonds are jointly and severally
guaranteed by each of NRG Northeast’s subsidiaries. The
bonds are secured by a security interest in NRG Northeast’s
membership or other ownership interests in the guarantors and
its rights under all inter-company notes between NRG Northeast
and the guarantors. In December 2000, NRG Northeast exchanged
all of its outstanding bonds for bonds registered under the
Securities Act of 1933. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
there remains $556.5 million and $610 million of
outstanding bonds, respectively. On December 15, 2002, NRG
Northeast failed to make $24.7 million interest and
$53.5 million principal payments. NRG Northeast Generating
had a 15-day grace period to make payment. On December 27,
2002, NRG Northeast made the $24.7 million interest payment
due on the NRG Northeast bonds, but failed to make the
$53.5 million principal payment. As a result, the payment
default associated with its failure to make principal payments
when they come due is currently in effect. NRG Northeast also
failed to make a debt service reserve account cash deposit
within 30 days of NRG Energy’s credit rating downgrade
in July 2002. In addition, NRG Northeast is also in default of
its debt covenants because of the lapse of the 60 day grace
period regarding the necessary dismissal of an involuntary
bankruptcy proceeding.

security interest in NRG Central U.S. LLC’s and South
Central Generating Holding LLC’s membership interests in
NRG South Central and NRG South Central’s membership
interests in Louisiana Generating and all of the assets related
to the Cajun facilities including its rights under a guarantor

outstanding bonds, respectively. On September 15, 2002, NRG
South Central missed a $47 million principal and interest
payment. The 15-day grace period to make payment related to this
issue passed and NRG South Central did not make the required
payments. In January 2003, the South Central Generating
bondholders unilaterally withdrew $35.6 million from the
restricted revenue account, relating to the September 15,
2002, interest payment and fees. On March 17th, 2003 South

refurbishing the Flinders Playford generating
station. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had drawn
$18.7 million (AUD $33 million) of this facility. The
interest rate has fixed and variable components. The effective
interest rate at December 31 ,2002 was 6.14%, and is paid

In June 2002, NRG Peaker Finance Company LLC (NRG
Peaker), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Energy,
completed the issuance of $325 million of Series A
Floating Rate Senior Secured Bonds due 2019. The bonds bear
interest at a floating rate equal to three-months
USD-LIBOR — BBA plus 1.07%. Interest on the bonds is
payable on March 10, June 10, September 10 and
December 10 of each year, commencing on September 10,
2002. Scheduled principal payments of $8.0 million,
$10.5 million, $4.3 million, $6.8 million,
$11.2 million and $278.6 million are due on
December 10 of 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and thereafter
through June 2019, respectively. The final scheduled repayment
of principal is due on June 10, 2019. The bonds may be
redeemed at any time prior to maturity at a price that, in
certain circumstances, will include a redemption premium. The
initial bond proceeds of $250 million were used to make
loans to affiliates which own natural-gas fired
“peaker” electric generating projects located in
either Louisiana or Illinois. The project owners used the
proceeds of the loans to (1) reimburse NRG Energy for
construction and/or acquisition costs for the peaker projects
previously paid by NRG Energy, (2) pay to XL Capital
Assurance (XLCA) the premium for the Bond Policy,
(3) provide funds to NRG Peaker to collateralize a portion
of NRG Energy’s contingent guaranty obligations and
(4) pay transaction costs incurred in connection with the
offering of the bonds (including reimbursement of NRG Energy for
the portion of such costs previously paid by NRG Energy). The
Bond Policy is a financial guaranty insurance policy that
unconditionally and irrevocably guaranties payment of scheduled
principal and interest payments on the Bonds. The Bond Policy
does not, however, guaranty the payment of principal of or
interest on the bonds prior to the applicable scheduled payment
dates, unless XLCA elects to make such payments. The bonds are
secured by a pledge of membership interests in NRG Peaker and a
security interest in all of its assets, which initially consist
of notes evidencing loans to the affiliate project owners. The
project owners’ jointly and severally guaranty the entire
principal amount of the bonds and interest on such principal
amount. The project owner guaranties are secured by a pledge of
the membership interest in three of five project owners and a
security interest in substantially all of the project
owners’ assets related to the peaker projects, including
equipment, real property rights, contracts and permits. NRG
Energy has entered into a contingent guaranty agreement in favor
of the collateral agent for the benefit of the secured parties,
under which it agreed to make payments to cover scheduled
principal and interest payments on the bonds and regularly
scheduled payments under the interest rate swap agreement, to
the extent that the net revenues from the peaker projects are
insufficient to make such payments, in specified circumstances.
This financing contains a cross-default provision related to the
failure by NRG Energy to make payment of principal, interest or
other amounts due on debt for borrowed money in excess of
$50 million, a covenant that was violated in October 2002.
In addition, in 2002 mechanics liens were placed against the
Bayou Cove facility resulting in an additional default. On
October 22, 2002, XL Capital issued a notice of default on the
Peaker financing facility. On December 10, 2002,
$16.0 million in interest, principal, and swap payments
were made from restricted cash accounts. As a result,
$319.4 million in principal remains outstanding as of
December 31, 2002.

NRG Peaker has also entered into an interest rate
swap agreement pursuant to which it agreed to make fixed rate
interest payments and receive floating rate interest payments.
The interest rate swap counter-party will have a security
interest in the collateral for the bonds and the collateral for
the project owner guaranties. Net payments to be made by NRG
Peaker under the interest rate swap agreement will be guaranteed
pursuant to a separate financial guaranty insurance policy, the
issuer of which will have a security interest in the

collateral for the bonds and the collateral for
the project owner guaranties. NRG Peaker was in compliance with
this agreement at December 31, 2002.

LSP-Pike Energy LLC received a loan to construct
its power generation facility in Pike County, Mississippi, from
Mississippi Business Finance Corporation that was financed by
the issuance of Industrial Revenue Bonds (Series 2002). NRG
Finance Company LLC, an affiliate of LSP-Pike Energy LLC,
purchased the Series 2002 bonds. These bonds have been
classified as debt on the financial statements. The principal
and the interest on these bonds is due and payable as of
January 1, 2010 and bears a variable interest rate
equivalent to the interest rate payable on the loan funds used
to finance the bond purchase by NRG Finance Company I LLC.
These bonds are subject to a subordination agreement between NRG
Finance Company I LLC, as purchaser, LSP-Pike Energy LLC,
and Credit Suisse First Boston, as administrative agent to a
senior claim, so that in the case of insolvency or bankruptcy
proceedings, or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or
other similar proceedings, and even in the event of any
proceedings for voluntary liquidation, dissolutions, or other
winding up of the company, then the holders of the senior claims
shall be entitled to receive payment in full or cash equivalents
of all principal, interest, charges and fees on all senior
claims before the purchaser is entitled to receive any payment
on account of the principal of or interest on these bonds. As of
October 17, 2002, the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Southern District of Mississippi granted an order of relief
to the debtor under the US bankruptcy laws, thus, forcing
LSP-Pike Energy LLC into default and cessation of all benefits
granted under the terms of the loan agreement and issuance of
the bonds.

Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.

The initial
recognition and initial measurement provisions of this
interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002,
irrespective of the guarantor’s fiscal year-end. The
disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements
of interim or annual periods ending after December 15,
2002. The interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by
a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about
its obligations under guarantees. The interpretation also
clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a
liability by a guarantor at the inception of the guarantee for
the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing the
guarantee.

NRG Energy is directly liable for the obligations
of certain of its project affiliates and other subsidiaries
pursuant to guarantees relating to certain of their
indebtedness, equity and operating obligations. In addition, in
connection with the purchase and sale of fuel, emission credits
and power generation products to and from third parties with
respect to the operation of some of NRG Energy’s generation
facilities in the United States, NRG Energy may be required to
guarantee a portion of the obligations of certain of its
subsidiaries. Additionally, as a result of the downgrades of NRG
Energy’s unsecured debt ratings, the Company is required to
post cash collateral in the amount of $1.1 billion,
however, NRG Energy has been unable to do so.

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, NRG

held. Starting June 4, 2002, NRG Energy and subsidiaries
can rejoin Xcel Energy’s consolidated group for federal
income tax purposes provided the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
consents to such rejoining. Without such consent, separate
income tax returns will be required for each NRG Energy entity
that is treated as a corporation for income tax purposes.

To date, no request has been made to the IRS for
consent to permit Xcel Energy to reconsolidate NRG Energy for
federal income tax purposes. Because it is likely that Xcel
Energy will not request such a consent, the income tax provision
for NRG Energy is based on a consolidated NRG Energy group
through June 3, 2002, and separate corporate tax returns
starting June 4, 2002.

NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy provided
a valuation allowance to account for potential limitations on
utilization of U.S. and Foreign net operating loss carryforwards
of approximately $1,143.5 million and $81.9 million,
respectively. The net operating loss carryforwards expire
between 2003 and 2021. NRG Energy also provided a valuation
allowance for other U.S. deferred income tax assets of
approximately $513.3 million. The increase in U.S. deferred
income tax assets is primarily due to the recognition of
impairment charges. During the year ended December 31,
2002, the valuation allowance increased $1,010.4 million
due to the increases in net operating loss carryforwards and
deferred income tax assets for which NRG Energy is unable to
conclude that there will be sufficient taxable earnings in
future periods to offset the tax benefits.

As of December 31, 2002, a net deferred tax
asset of approximately $33 million was recorded relating to
the investment West Coast Power. On a separate company basis,
there will be sufficient taxable earnings in future periods for
utilization of the tax benefits.

The effective income tax rates of continuing
operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001
differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% as
follows:



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the
income tax benefit was $165.4 million, compared to an
income tax expense of $28.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001, a decrease of $193.5 million. The
decrease in tax expense compared to 2001 was primarily due to
the reduction in domestic earnings.

The effective income tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2002 differs from the statutory federal income
tax rate of 35% primarily due to limitation on tax benefits. The
effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31,
2001 differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%
primarily due to state tax, foreign tax and tax credits as shown
above.

As of December 31, 2001 NRG Energy
management intended to reinvest the earnings of foreign
operations to the extent the earnings were subject to current
U.S. income taxes. Accordingly, U.S. income taxes and
foreign withholding taxes were not provided on a cumulative
amount of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries of
approximately $345 million December 31, 2001. As of
December 31, 2002 NRG Energy management has revised its
strategy and no longer intends to indefinitely reinvest the full
amount of earnings of foreign operations. However, no
U.S. income tax benefit has been provided on the cumulative
amount of unremitted losses of $339.7 million at
December 31, 2002 due to the uncertainty of realization.

— Benefit Plans and Other
    Postretirement Benefits

Substantially all of NRG Energy’s employees
participate in defined benefit pension plans. All eligible
employees participate in Xcel Energy’s noncontributory,
defined benefit pension plan which was formerly sponsored by
NSP. NRG Energy sponsored two defined benefit plans that were
merged into Xcel Energy’s plan as of June 30, 2002.
Benefits are generally based on a combination of an
employee’s years of service and earnings. Some formulas
also take into account Social Security benefits. Plan assets
principally consist of the common stock of public companies,
corporate bonds and U.S. government securities.

In addition, NRG Energy provides postretirement
health and welfare benefits (health care and death benefits) for
certain groups of its employees. Generally, these are groups
that were acquired in recent years and for whom prior benefits
are being continued (at least for a certain period of time or as
required by union contracts). Cost sharing provisions vary by
acquisition group and terms of any applicable collective
bargaining agreements. Certain former NRG Energy retirees are
covered under the legacy Xcel Energy plan, which was terminated
for non-bargaining employees retiring after 1998 and for
bargaining employees retiring after 1999.

Participation in Xcel Energy Inc. Pension
    Plan and Postretirement Medical Plan

Substantially, all eligible employees participate
in Xcel Energy’s noncontributory, defined benefit pension
plan which was formerly sponsored by NSP. NRG Energy’s
contributions to the Xcel Energy pension plan and postretirement
plan totaled $0, $0 and $20,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000. The
balance sheet includes a liability related to the Xcel Energy
Pension Plan of $1.7 million and $5.0 million for 2002
and 2001, respectively. The balance sheet also includes a
liability related to the Xcel Energy Postretirement Medical Plan
of $2.2 million and $2.3 million for 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The applicable portion of the total plan benefits
and net assets of these plans is not separately identifiable.
The net annual periodic credit related to NRG’s portion of
the Xcel Energy pension plan and postretirement plans totaled
$8.9 million, $8.9 million and $1.7 million for
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Certain NRG employees also participate in Xcel
Energy’s noncontributory defined benefit supplemental
retirement income plan. This plan is for the benefit of certain
qualifying executive personnel. Benefits for this unfunded plan
are paid out of operating cash flows. The balance sheet includes
a liability related to this plan of $3.2 million and
$2.6 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Defined Contribution Plans

Some NRG Energy employees participated in Xcel
Energy’s defined contribution 401(K) plan. NRG Energy
contributions to the plan were approximately $0.9 million
and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002
and 2001, respectively.

NRG Energy also assumed several contributory,
defined contribution employee savings plans as a result of its
2000 and 1999 acquisition activity. These plans comply with
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and covered
substantially all of our employees who were not covered by Xcel
Energy’s 401(k) Plan. NRG Energy matched specified amounts
of employee contributions to the plan. Employer contributions
made to these plans were approximately $2.4 million and
$1.6 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The Xcel Energy plan (NRG portion) was rolled
into the NRG plans for 2002. Employer contributions made to all
plans for 2002 were approximately $4.6 million.

NRG Equity Plan

During 1998 and 1999, NRG Energy’s employees
were eligible to participate in its Equity Plan (the Plan). The
Plan granted, to employees, phantom equity units that were
intended to simulate Stock options. Grant size was based on the
participant’s position in NRG Energy and base salary.
Equity unit valuations were performed annually by an outside
valuation firm. The value of an equity unit was the approximate
value per share of NRG Energy’s stockholder equity as of
the valuation date, less the value of Xcel Energy’s
(formerly NSP) equity investments. The units were awarded to
employees annually at the respective year’s calculated
share price (grant price). The Plan provided employees with a
cash pay out for the unit’s appreciation in value over the
vesting period. The Plan had a seven year vesting schedule with
actual payments beginning after the end of the third year and
continuing at 20% each year for the subsequent five years.
During 2002, 2001 and



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2000, NRG Energy recorded compensation expense of
approximately $0, $0, and $6.0 million, respectively, for
the Plan.

The Plan included a change of control provision,
which allowed all shares to vest if NRG Energy’s ownership
were to change. Subsequent to the completion of NRG
Energy’s initial public offering in June 2000, the Plan was
converted to a new stock option plan (see Note 20).

Pension and Other Benefits — 2001
    Acquisitions

During 2001, NRG Energy acquired several
generating assets and assumed benefit obligations for a number
of employees associated with those acquisitions. The plans
assumption included noncontributory defined benefit pension
plans, and contributory post-retirement welfare plans. Of the
2001 acquisitions where these obligations were assumed,
approximately 79% percent of such employees are represented by
one local union under collective bargaining agreements, which
expire on July 1, 2004. Plan liability and expense amounts
for these acquisitions are included in the pension and
postretirement health care amounts shown above.

— Sales to Significant
    Customers

During 2002, sales to one customer (New York
Independent System Operator) accounted for 22.1% of total
revenues from majority owned operations in 2002. During 2001,
sales to two customers accounted for 33.9% (New York Independent
System Operator) and 17.6% (Connecticut Light and Power Co.) of
total revenues from majority owned operations in 2001. During
2000, sales to two customers accounted for 26.8% (New York
Independent System Operator) and 14.8% (Connecticut Light and
Power Co.) of total revenues from majority owned operations in
2000.

Note 18

— Financial Instruments

The estimated December 31 fair values of NRG
Energy’s recorded financial instruments are as follows:

For cash and cash equivalents and restricted
cash, the carrying amount approximates fair value because of the
short-term maturity of those instruments. The fair value of
notes receivable is based on expected future cash flows
discounted at market interest rates. The fair value of long-term
debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same
or similar issues.

Derivative Financial
    Instruments

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

At December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, NRG
Energy had various foreign currency exchange instruments with
combined notional amounts of $3.0 million,
$46.3 million and $8.8 million, respectively. These
foreign currency exchange instruments were hedges of expected
future cash flows. If the hedges had been terminated at
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, NRG Energy would have
owed the counter-parties $0.3 million, $2.4 million
and $0.7 million, respectively.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Interest Rates

At December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, NRG
Energy had various interest-rate swap agreements with combined
notional amounts of $1.7 billion, $2.4 billion and
$530 million, respectively. These contracts are used to
manage NRG Energy’s exposure to changes in interest rates.
If these swaps had been terminated at December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, NRG Energy would have owed the counter-parties
$41.0 million, $81.5 million and $28.9 million,
respectively.

Energy Related Commodities

At December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 NRG
Energy had various energy related commodities financial
instruments with combined notional amounts of
$241.8 million, $1.0 billion and $309.0 million,
respectively. These financial instruments take the form of fixed
price, floating price or indexed sales or purchases, and
options, such as puts, calls, basis transactions and swaps.
These contracts are used to manage NRG Energy’s exposure to
commodity price variability in electricity, emission allowances
and natural gas, oil and coal used to meet fuel requirements. If
these contracts were terminated at December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000, NRG Energy would have received $58.5 million,
$224.1 million and $52.8 million from counter-parties,
respectively.

Credit Risk

NRG Energy’s counter-parties to its hedging
contracts consist principally of financial institutions and
major energy companies. NRG Energy actively manages its exposure
to counter-party risk. NRG Energy has an established credit
policy in place to minimize overall credit risk. Important
elements of this policy include ongoing financial reviews of all
counter-parties, established credit limits, as well as
monitoring, managing and mitigating credit exposure.

Note 19 — Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

During the first quarter of 2002, NRG Energy
adopted SFAS No. 142 —

“Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets”

(SFAS No. 142),
which requires new accounting for intangible assets, including
goodwill. Intangible assets with finite lives will be amortized
over their economic useful lives and periodically reviewed for
impairment. Goodwill will no longer be amortized, but will be
tested for impairment annually and on an interim basis if an
event occurs or a circumstance changes between annual tests that
may reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
value.

NRG Energy had goodwill of $34.2 million at
December 31, 2002, which will not be amortized. As of
December 31, 2002, NRG Energy performed impairment tests of
its goodwill balances. To date, such tests completed have
concluded that no write-down of goodwill is necessary primarily
because the majority of the goodwill that NRG Energy has
recorded relates to its Thermal operations, which have
sufficient on going cashflows.

Aggregate amortization expense recognized for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was
approximately $2.8 million, $4.2 million and
$3.1 million, respectively. The annual aggregate



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amortization expense for each of the five
succeeding years is expected to approximate $2.8 million.
Intangible assets consisted of the following:

The following table summarizes the pro forma
impact of implementing SFAS No. 142 at January 1,
2000 on net income (loss) for the periods presented.

Note 20 — Capital Stock

Sale of Stock

In June 2000, NRG Energy sold 32.4 million
shares of common stock at $15 per share. Net proceeds from
the offering were $453.7 million. NRG Energy has authorized
capital stock consisting of 550,000,000 shares of common
stock, and 250,000,000 shares of Class A common stock.
At December 31, 2000, there were approximately
32,396,000 shares of common stock, and
147,605,000 shares of Class A common stock issued and
outstanding.

In March 2001, NRG Energy completed the sale of
18.4 million shares of common stock for an initial price of
$27 per share. The offering was completed with all
18.4 million shares of common stock being sold including
the over-allotment shares of 2.4 million. NRG Energy
received gross proceeds from the issuance of
$496.6 million. Net proceeds from the issuance were
$473.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts,
commissions and estimated offering expenses. The net proceeds
were used in part to reduce amounts outstanding under NRG
Energy’s short-term bridge credit agreement, which was used
to finance in part NRG Energy’s acquisition of the LS Power
assets. At December 31, 2001, there were approximately
50,939,875 shares of common stock, and
147,605,000 shares of Class A common stock issued and
outstanding.

On June 3, 2002, Xcel Energy completed its
exchange offer for the 26% of NRG Energy’s shares that had
been previously publicly held. Xcel Energy issued NRG Energy
shareholders 0.50 shares of Xcel Energy common stock in
exchange for each outstanding share of NRG Energy common stock.

Incentive Compensation Plan

In June 2000, NRG Energy adopted a new incentive
compensation plan (the New Stock Plan), which was approved by
shareholders in June 2001 and which will be administered by a
committee appointed by the



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Board of Directors. The New Stock Plan provides
for awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, performance units, performance shares,
or cash based awards as determined by the Board of Directors.
All officers, certain other employees, and non-employee
directors are eligible to participate in the plan. Nine million
shares of common stock are authorized for issuance under the
Stock Plan. Initially, only stock option grants will be made to
certain officers, independent directors and employees under the
plan.

Each new option granted is valued at the fair
market value per share at date of grant. The difference between
the option price and the market value of the stock at the date
of grant, if any, of each option on the date of grant is
recorded as compensation expense over a vesting period. Options
granted prior to June 2001 vest over a period of five years,
with 25% vesting in each of the years two through five and
generally expire ten years from the date of grant. Options
granted in June 2001 and subsequently, vest over a four year
period, with 25% vesting each year and generally expire ten
years from the date of grant. The board’s independent
directors’ options vested immediately upon being granted.
The average exercise price of vested options at
December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $14.39 and $9.51,
respectively, all of which were granted in replacement of units
previously outstanding under the equity plan. There were no
grants in 2002. NRG Energy has recognized approximately
$1.9 million and $7.3 million of stock based
compensation expense for the periods ended December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002, NRG Energy recognized
income due to the net reduction of its compensation expense
accrual by approximately $2.3 million for terminated stock
options during the period. This amount has been reported as a
reduction of compensation expense for the year ended
December 31, 2002.

During 2002, the New Stock Plan and all grants
under the plan were adopted by the Xcel Energy Incentive Stock
Plan. There were no grants to NRG Energy employees under this
new plan.

minimum lease commitments under these leases for the years
ending after December 31, 2002 are as follows:

Capital Commitments

NRG Energy anticipates funding its ongoing
capital requirements through committed debt facilities,
operating cash flows, and existing cash. NRG Energy’s
capital expenditure program is subject to continuing review and
modification. The timing and actual amount of expenditures may
differ significantly based upon plant operating history,
unexpected plant outages, and changes in the regulatory
environment, and the availability of cash.

California

NRG Energy’s California generation assets
include a 50% interest in the West Coast Power partnership with
Dynegy.

In March 2001, the California Power Exchange
(PX) filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code, and in April 2001, the Pacific Gas &
Electric Company (PG&E) also filed for bankruptcy under
Chapter 11. In September 2001, PG&E filed a proposed
plan of reorganization. Under the terms of the proposed plan,
which is subject to challenge by interested parties, unsecured
creditors such as NRG Energy’s California affiliates would
receive 60% of the amounts owed upon approval of the plan. The
remaining 40% would be paid in negotiable debt with terms from
10 to 30 years. The California PX’s ability to repay
its debt is dependent on the extent to which it receives
payments from PG&E and Southern California Edison Company
(SCE). During the fourth quarter of 2002, after assuring the
collectibility of its California receivables and other recent
related developments, West Coast Power recorded an approximate
$117.0 million charge to write-off the remaining amounts
owed to it by the California PX and ISO. NRG Energy’s share
of this charge was approximately $58.5 million (pre-tax).

Connecticut

NRG Energy is impacted by rule/tariff changes
that occur in the existing ISOs. On March 1, 2003, ISO-NE
implemented its version of Standard Market Design. This change
dramatically modifies the New England market structure by
incorporating Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP —
pricing by location rather than on a New England wide basis).
Even though NRG Energy views this change as a significant
improvement to the existing market design, NRG Energy still
views the market within New England as insufficient to allow for
NRG Energy to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on
investment. Consequently, on February 26, 2003, NRG Energy
filed and requested a cost of service rate with FERC for most of
its Connecticut fleet, requesting a February 27th effective
date. NRG Energy remains committed to working with ISO-NE, FERC
and other stakeholders to continue to improve the New England
market that will hopefully make further reliance on a cost of
service rate unnecessary. While NRG Energy has the right to



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

file for such rate treatment, there are no
assurances that FERC will grant such rates in the form or amount
that NRG Energy petitioned for in its filing.

Contractual Commitments

In connection with the acquisition of certain
generating facilities NRG Energy entered into various long-term
transition agreements and standard offer agreements that
obligated NRG Energy to provide its customers, primarily the
previous owners of the acquired facilities, with a certain
portion of the energy and capacity output of the acquired
facilities.

During 1999, NRG Energy acquired the Huntley and
Dunkirk generating facilities from Niagara Mohawk Power
Corporation (NiMo). In connection with this acquisition, NRG
Energy entered into a 4-year agreement with NiMo that requires
NRG Energy to provide to NiMo pursuant to a predetermined
schedule fixed quantities of energy and capacity at a fixed
price.

During 1999, NRG Energy acquired certain
generating facilities from Connecticut Light and Power Company
(CL&P). NRG also entered into a 4-year standard offer
agreement that requires NRG Energy to provide to CL&P a
portion of its load requirements through the year 2003 at a
substantially fixed rate.

During 2000, NRG Energy acquired the non-nuclear
generating assets of Cajun Electric. Upon acquisition of the
facilities, NRG Energy entered into various long-term power
purchase agreements with the former customers of Cajun Electric,
primarily distribution cooperatives and municipalities. These
agreements specify that NRG Energy provide these customers with
all requirements necessary to satisfy the energy and capacity
needs of their retail load.

Also during 2000, NRG Energy acquired the
Killingholme generating facilities from National Power plc. In
connection with this acquisition, NRG Energy entered into
certain agreements to provide the natural gas to operate the
facility, which generally sells its power into the spot market.
NRG Energy entered into two gas purchase agreements, the first
being a 5-year agreement that provides approximately 30% of the
generating facilities natural gas requirements and the second
agreement being a 10-year agreement that provides approximately
70% of the generating facilities natural gas requirements. NRG
Energy also entered into a 5-year fixed price agreement to
resell up to 15% of the gas it has contracted for at a slightly
higher price. As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy has
entered into an agreement whereby the Killingholme facilities
would be turned over to its lenders therefore the assets and
liabilities and results of operations have been classified as
discontinued operations and held for sale. On January 31,
2003, the Killingholme facilities were sold to its lenders. The
obligations under the gas contracts were assumed by the lenders
in the sales transaction.

Also during 2000, NRG Energy acquired the
Flinders Power operations in South Australia. Upon the closing
of the acquisition, NRG Energy assumed a gas purchase and sales
agreement relating to the Osborne generating plant with a
remaining life of 18-years. These agreements require NRG Energy
to purchase a specified quantity of natural gas from a third
party supplier at a fixed price for 18-years and resell the
natural gas to Osborne at a fixed price for 13-years. The sales
price is substantially lower than the purchase price. NRG Energy
has recorded the liability associated with this out of the
market contract in the amount of approximately $66 million
in other long-term obligations and deferred income on its
balance sheet. As of December 31, 2002 there remains
approximately $73.3 million on NRG Energy’s balance sheet.
In addition, NRG Energy has entered into a contract for
differences agreement which provides for the sale of energy into
the South Australian power pool through the year 2002. The
agreement provides for a swap of the variable market price to a
fixed price.

During 2001, NRG Energy acquired a portfolio of
projects located in Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania from
Conectiv. Upon closing of the acquisition, NRG Energy assumed a
power purchase agreement. This agreement, which is not project
specific, requires NRG Energy to deliver and Conectiv to
purchase 500 MW of electric energy around the clock at
a specified price through 2005. The sales price of the



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

contracted electricity was substantially lower
than the fair value that the electricity on the merchant market
at the date of acquisition. During 2001, NRG Energy recorded the
liability associated with the out of market contract on the
balance sheet in the amount of approximately $89.4 million.
Approximately $45.1 million was recorded in other current
liabilities and approximately $44.3 million in other
long-term obligations and deferred income. The difference was to
be amortized into income over the life of the agreement. In the
fourth quarter of 2002, Conectiv terminated this agreement and
NRG Energy recorded the unamortized balance into income as
revenue, see below for additional information.

Environmental Regulatory
    Matters

The construction and operation of power projects
are subject to stringent environmental and safety protection and
land use laws and regulation in the United States. These laws
and regulations generally require lengthy and complex processes
to obtain licenses, permits and approvals from federal, state
and local agencies. If such laws and regulations become more
stringent and NRG Energy’s facilities are not exempted from
coverage, NRG Energy could be required to make extensive
modifications to further reduce potential environmental impacts.

Under various federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations, a current or previous owner
or operator of any facility, including an electric generating
facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases
or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or
petroleum products located at the facility, and may be held
liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property
damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs
incurred by the party in connection with any releases or
threatened releases. These laws, including the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
of 1986, impose liability without regard to whether the owner
knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and
courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict
(without fault) and joint and several. The cost of
investigation, remediation or removal of any hazardous or toxic
substances or petroleum products could be substantial. Although
NRG Energy has been involved in on-site contamination matters,
to date, NRG Energy has not been named as a potentially
responsible party with respect to any off-site waste disposal
matter.

NRG Energy and its subsidiaries strive to exceed
the standards of compliance with applicable environmental and
safety regulations. Nonetheless, NRG Energy expects that future
liability under or compliance with environmental and safety
requirements could have a material effect on its operations or
competitive position. It is not possible at this time to
determine when or to what extent additional facilities or
modifications of existing or planned facilities will be required
as a result of possible changes to environmental and safety
regulations, regulatory interpretations or enforcement policies.
In general, the effect of future laws or regulations is expected
to require the addition of pollution control equipment or the
imposition of restrictions on NRG Energy’s operations.

As part of acquiring existing generating assets,
NRG Energy has inherited certain environmental liabilities
associated with regulatory compliance and site contamination.
Often potential compliance implementation plans are changed,
delayed or abandoned due to one or more of the following
conditions: (a) extended negotiations with regulatory
agencies, (b) a delay in promulgating rules critical to
dictating the design of expensive control systems,
(c) changes in governmental/regulatory personnel,
(d) changes in governmental priorities or
(e) selection of a less expensive compliance option than
originally envisioned.

In response to liabilities associated with these
activities, NRG Energy has established accruals where reasonable
estimates of probable liabilities are possible. As of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, NRG Energy has established such
accruals in the amount of approximately $3.8 million and
$5.0 million, respectively, primarily related to its
Northeast region facilities (Arthur Kill and Astoria projects).
NRG Energy has not used discounting in determining its accrued
liabilities for environmental remediation and no claims for
possible recovery from third party issuers or other parties
related to environmental costs have been recognized in NRG

Energy’s consolidated financial statements.
NRG Energy adjusts the accruals when new remediation
responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become
estimable, or when current remediation estimates are adjusted to
reflect new information. During the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, NRG Energy recorded
expenses of approximately $10.9 million, $15.3 million
and $3.4 million related to environmental matters,
respectively.

West Coast Region

The Asset Purchase Agreements for the Long Beach,
El Segundo, Encina, and San Diego gas turbine generating
facilities provide that Southern California Edison and
San Diego Gas & Electric retain liability and
indemnify NRG Energy for existing soil and groundwater
contamination that exceeds remedial thresholds in place at the
time of closing. NRG Energy and its business partner conducted
Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessments at
each of these sites for purposes of identifying such existing
contamination and provided the results to the sellers.
San Diego Gas & Electric is proceeding to address
contamination identified by these studies by undertaking
corrective action at the Encina and San Diego gas turbine
generating sites. While spills and releases of various
substances have occurred at many sites since establishing the
historical baseline, all but one has been remediated in
accordance with existing laws. An unquantified amount of soil
contaminated by lubricating oil that leaked from underground
piping at the El Segundo Generating Station has been allowed by
the Regional Water Quality Control Board to remain under the
foundation of the Unit I powerhouse until the building is
demolished.

NRG Energy’s affiliates have incurred and
anticipates further environmental capital expenditures at the
Encina Generating Station to install Selective Catalytic
Reduction (SCR) emission control technology on all five
generating units. Units 4 & 5 were retrofitted with
SCRs during 2002; the additional SCR on Unit 3 was completed in
February 2003. SCR emission controls on Units 1 and 2 are
expected to be completed in 2003. NRG Energy estimates the cost
to retrofit all five units to be approximately $42 million.

Eastern Region

Coal ash is produced as a by-product of coal
combustion at the Dunkirk, Huntley, and Somerset Generating
Stations. NRG Energy attempts to direct its coal ash to
beneficial uses. Even so, significant amounts of ash are
landfilled at on and off-site locations. At Dunkirk and Huntley,
ash is disposed at landfills owned and operated by NRG Energy.
No material liabilities outside the costs associated with
closure, post-closure care and monitoring are expected at these
facilities. NRG Energy maintains financial assurance to cover
costs associated with closure, post-closure care and monitoring
activities. In the past, NRG Energy has provided financial
assurance via financial test and corporate guarantee. NRG Energy
must re-establish financial assurance via an instrument
requiring complete collateralization of closure and
post-closure-related costs, currently estimated at approximately
$5.8 million. NRG Energy is required to provide an
alternative instrument to provide such financial assurance on or
before April 30, 2003.

NRG must also maintain financial assurance for
closing interim status RCRA facilities at the Devon, Middletown,
Montville and Norwalk Harbor Generating Stations. Previously,
NRG Energy has provided financial assurance via financial test.
NRG Energy must re-establish financial assurance via an
instrument requiring complete collateralization of closure and
post-closure-related costs, currently estimated not to exceed
$2.4 million. NRG Energy is required to provide an
alternative instrument to provide such financial assurance on or
before April 30, 2003.

Historical clean-up liabilities were inherited as
a part of acquiring the Somerset, Devon, Middletown, Montville,
Norwalk Harbor, Arthur Kill and Astoria Generating Stations. NRG
Energy has recently satisfied clean-up obligations associated
with the Ledge Road property (inherited as part of the Somerset
acquisition). Site contamination liabilities arising under the
Connecticut Transfer Act at the Devon, Middletown, Montville and
Norwalk Harbor Stations have been identified and are currently
being refined as part of on-going site

investigations. NRG Energy does not expect to
incur material costs associated with completing the
investigations at these Stations or future work to cover and
monitor landfill areas pursuant to the Connecticut requirements.
Remedial liabilities at the Arthur Kill Generating Station have
been established in discussions between NRG Energy and the New
York State DEC and are expected to cost on the order of
$1.0 million. Remedial investigations are on-going at the
Astoria Generating Station. At this time, NRG Energy’s
long-term cleanup liability at this site is not expected to
exceed $1.5 million.

NRG Energy estimates that it will incur total
environmental capital expenditures of $53 million during
2003 through 2007 for the facilities in New York, Connecticut
and Massachusetts. These expenditures will be primarily related
to landfill construction, installation of NO

x

controls, installation of the best technology available for
minimizing environmental impacts associated with impingment and
entrainment of fish and larvae, particulate matter control
improvements, spill prevention controls, and undertaking
remedial actions. NRG Energy estimates that it will incur in
2003 at all of its plants in the Northeast Region about
$8 million in capital expenditures for plant modifications
and upgrades required to comply with environmental regulations.

As of December 31, 2002, NRG Energy had
recorded an accrual in the amount of $1.6 million to cover
penalties associated with historical opacity exceedances.

NRG Energy is responsible for the costs
associated with closure, post-closure care and monitoring of the
ash landfill owned and operated by NRG Energy on the site of the
Indian River Generating Station. No material liabilities outside
such costs are expected. Financial assurance to provide for
closure and post-closure-related costs is currently maintained
by a trust fund collateralized in the amount of approximately
$6.6 million.

NRG Energy estimates that it will incur capital
expenditures of approximately $25 million during the years
2003 through 2007 related to resolving environmental concerns at
the Indian River Generating Station. These concerns include the
expected closure of the existing ash landfill, the construction
of a new ash landfill nearby, the addition of controls to reduce
NO

x

emissions, fuel yard modifications, and
electrostatic precipitator refurbishments to reduce opacity.

Central Region

Liabilities associated with closure, post-closure
care and monitoring of the ash ponds owned and operated on site
at the Big Cajun II Generating Station are addressed
through the use of a trust fund maintained by NRG Energy (one of
the instruments allowed by the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality for providing financial assurance for
expenses associated with closure and post-closure care of the
ponds). The current value of the trust fund is approximately
$4.5 million and NRG Energy is making annual payments to
the fund in the amount of about $116,000. See Note 25.

NRG Energy estimates approximately
$20 million of capital expenditures will be incurred during
the period 2003 and 2007 for the addition of NO

x

controls on Units 1 and 2 of Big Cajun II. In addition, NRG
Energy estimates that it would incur up to $5 million to
reduce particulate matter emissions during start-up of
Units 1 and 2 at Big Cajun II.

NYISO Claims

In November 2002, the NYISO notified NRG Energy
of claims related to New York City mitigation adjustments,
general NYISO billing adjustments and other miscellaneous
charges related to sales between November 2000 and October 2002.
NRG Energy contests both the validity and calculation of the
claims and is currently negotiating with the NYISO over the
ultimate disposition. Accordingly, NRG Energy reduced its
revenues by $21.7 million and recorded a corresponding
reserve for the receivable.

Conectiv Agreement
    Termination

On November 8, 2002 Conectiv provided NRG
Energy with a Notice of Termination of Transaction under the
Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement (Master PPA) dated
June 21, 2001. Under the Master PPA, which was assumed by
NRG Energy in its acquisition of various assets from Conectiv,
NRG Energy had been required to deliver 500 MW of
electrical energy around the clock at a specified price through
2005. In connection with the Conectiv acquisition, NRG Energy
recorded as an out-of-market contract obligation for this
contract. As a result of the cancellation, NRG Energy will lose
approximately $383.1 million in future contracted revenues.
Also, in conjunction with the terms of the Master PPA, NRG
Energy received from Conectiv a termination payment in the
amount of $955,000. At December 31, 2002, the remaining
unamortized balance of the contract obligation was recognized as
revenue. As a result, during the fourth quarter approximately
$50.7 million was recognized as revenue.

People of the State of California
ex. rel. Bill Lockyer, Attorney General, v. Dynegy, Inc.
et al.,

United States District
Court, Northern District of California, Case No. C-02-O1854
VRW; United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Case
No. 02-16619.

This action was filed in state court on
March 11, 2002. It alleges that the defendants violated
California Business & Professions Code § 17200 by
selling ancillary services to the California ISO, and
subsequently selling the same capacity into the spot market. The
Attorney General seeks injunctive relief as well as restitution,
disgorgement and civil penalties.

On April 17, 2002, the defendants removed
the case to the United States District Court in San Francisco.
Thereafter, the case was transferred to Judge Vaughn Walker, who
is also presiding over various other “ancillary
services” cases brought by the California Attorney General
against other participants in the California market, as well as
other lawsuits brought by the Attorney General against these
other market participants. NRG Energy has tolling agreements in
place with the Attorney General with respect to such other
proposed claims against it.

The Attorney General filed motions to remand,
which the defendants opposed in July of 2002. In an Order filed
in early September 2002, Judge Walker denied the remand motions.
The Attorney General has appealed that decision to the United
States Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit, and the appeal
remains pending. The Attorney General also sought a stay of
proceedings in the district court pending the appeal, and this
request was also denied. A “Notice of Bankruptcy
Filing” respecting NRG Energy was filed in the Ninth
Circuit and in the District Court in mid-December 2002. The
Attorney General filed a paper asserting that the “police
power” exception to the automatic stay is applicable here.
Judge Walker agreed with the Attorney General on this issue. In
a lengthy opinion filed March 25, 2003, Judge Walker
dismissed the Attorney General’s action against NRG and
Dynegy with prejudice, finding it was barred by the filed rate
doctrine and preempted by federal law. The Attorney General has
announced it will appeal the dismissal. NRG Energy is unable at
this time to accurately estimate the damages sought by the
Attorney General against NRG Energy and its affiliates, or
predict the outcome of the case.

This action was filed against Dynegy, NRG Energy,
Xcel Energy and several other market participants in the United
States District Court in Los Angeles on July 15, 2002. The
Complaint alleges violations of the California
Business & Professions Code § 16720 (the
Cartwright Act) and Business & Professions Code
§ 17200. The basic claims are price fixing and
restriction of supply, and other market “gaming”
activities.

The action was transferred from Los Angeles to
the United States District Court in San Diego and was made
a part of the Multi-District Litigation proceeding described
below. All defendants filed motions to dismiss and to strike in
the fall of 2002. In an Order dated January 6, 2003, the
Honorable Robert Whaley, a federal judge from Spokane sitting in
the United States District Court in San Diego, pursuant to
the Order of the MDL Panel, granted the motions to dismiss on
the grounds of federal preemption and filed-rate doctrine. The
plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal.

In re: Wholesale Electricity Antitrust
Litigation,

MDL 1405, United
States District Court, Southern District of California, pending
before Honorable Robert H. Whaley. The cases included in
this proceeding are as follows:

These cases were all filed in late 2000 and 2001
in various state courts throughout California. They allege
unfair competition, market manipulation, and price fixing. All
the cases were removed to the appropriate United States District
Courts, and were thereafter made the subject of a petition to
the Multi-District Litigation Panel (Case No. MDL 1405).
The cases were ultimately assigned to Judge Whaley. Judge Whaley
entered an order in 2001 remanding the cases to state court, and
thereafter the cases were coordinated pursuant to state court
coordination proceedings before a single judge in San Diego
Superior Court. The defendants filed motions to dismiss and to
strike under the filed-rate and federal preemption theories, and
the plaintiffs challenged the district court’s jurisdiction
and sought to have the cases remanded to state court. In
December 2002, Judge Whaley issued an opinion finding that
federal jurisdiction was absent in the district court, and
remanding the cases to state court. Duke Energy and Reliant
Energy have filed a notice of appeal with the Ninth Circuit, and
also sought a stay of the remand pending appeal. The stay
request was denied by Judge Whaley. On February 20, 2003,
however, the Ninth Circuit stayed the remand order and accepted
jurisdiction to hear the appeal of Reliant Energy and Duke
Energy on the remand order. The Company anticipates that

This putative class action lawsuit was filed on
November 20, 2002. In addition to naming WCP-related
entities as defendants, numerous industry participants are named
in this lawsuit that are unrelated to WCP or NRG Energy. The
Complaint generally alleges that the defendants attempted to
manipulate gas indexes by reporting false and fraudulent trades.
Named defendants in the suit are the LLCs established by WCP for
each of its four plants: El Segundo Power, LLC; Long Beach
Generation, LLC; Cabrillo Power I LLC; and Cabrillo
Power II LLC. NRG Energy is not named as a defendant. The
complaint seeks restitution and disgorgement of “ill-gotten
gains”, civil fines, compensatory and punitive damages,
attorneys’ fees, and declaratory and injunctive relief.

Dynegy has agreed with NRG Energy that it will
indemnify and hold harmless the named defendants in the
Bustamante lawsuit, as well as NRG Energy, from any civil fines,
compensatory damages, punitive damages, costs, and fees that may
be entered pursuant to either a final judgment or a settlement
of claims. Dynegy has also agreed that it will pay all costs and
attorneys’ fees associated with the defense of the named
defendants in the Bustamante lawsuit, as well as any defense
costs for NRG Energy.

Investigations

FERC — California Market
    Manipulation

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has an
ongoing “Investigation of Potential Manipulation of
Electric and Natural Gas Prices,” which involves hundreds
of parties and substantial discovery. In June, 2001, FERC
initiated proceedings related to California’s demand for
$8.9 billion in refunds from power sellers who allegedly
inflated wholesale prices during the energy crisis. Hearings
have been conducted before an administrative law judge who
issued an opinion in late 2002. The administrative law judge
stated that after assessing a refund of $1.8 billion for
“unjust and unreasonable” power prices between
October 2, 2000 and June 20, 2001, power suppliers
were owed $1.2 billion because the State was holding funds
owed to suppliers.

In August, 2002, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals granted a request by the Electricity Oversight Board,
the California Public Utilities Commission, and others, to seek
out and introduce to FERC additional evidence of market
manipulation by wholesale sellers. This decision resulted in
FERC ordering an additional 100 days of discovery in the
refund proceeding, and also allowing the relevant time period
for potential refund liability to extend back an additional nine
months, to January 1, 2000.

On December 12, 2002, FERC Administrative
Law Judge Birchman issued a Certification of Proposed Findings
on California Refund Liability in Docket No. EL00-95-045

et al.

, which determined the method for the
mitigated energy market clearing price during each hour of the
refund period. On March 26, 2003, FERC issued an Order on
Proposed Findings on Refund Liability in Docket
No. EL00-95-045 (“Refund Order”), adopting, in
part, and modifying, in part, the Proposed Findings issued by
Judge Birchman on December 12, 2002. In the Refund Order,
FERC adopted the refund methodology in the Staff Final Report on
Price Manipulation in Western Markets issued contemporaneously
with the Refund Order in Docket No. PA02-2-000. This refund
calculation methodology makes certain changes to Judge
Birchman’s methodology, because of FERC Staff’s
findings of manipulation in gas index prices. This could
materially increase the estimated refund liability. The Refund
Order also directs generators that want to recover any fuel
costs above the mitigated market clearing price during the
refund period to submit cost information justifying such
recovery within forty (40) days of the issuance of the
Refund Order. FERC announced in the Refund Order that it expects
that refunds will be paid by suppliers by the end of summer 2003.

California Attorney General

In addition to the litigation it has undertaken
described above, the California Attorney General has undertaken
an investigation entitled

In the Matter of the Investigation
of Possibly Unlawful, Unfair, or Anti-Competitive Behavior
Affecting Electricity Prices in California.

In this
connection, the Attorney General has issued subpoenas to Dynegy,
served interrogatories on Dynegy and NRG Energy, and informally
requested documents and interviews from Dynegy and Dynegy
employees as well as NRG Energy and NRG Energy employees. NRG
Energy responded to the interrogatories last summer, with the
final set of responses being served on September 3, 2002.
NRG Energy has also produced a large volume of documentation
relating to the West Coast Power plants. In addition, three NRG
Energy employees in California have sat for informal interviews
with representatives of the Attorney General’s office.
Dynegy employees have also been interviewed. The Attorney
General’s office has requested an additional interview with
NRG Energy’s plant manager of El Segundo.

Although any evaluation of the likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome or an estimate of the amount or range of
potential loss in the above-referenced private actions and
various investigations cannot be made at this time, NRG Energy
notes that the Gordon complaint alleges that the defendants,
collectively, overcharged California ratepayers during 2000 by
$4.0 billion. NRG Energy knows of no evidence implicating
NRG Energy in plaintiffs’ allegations of collusion. NRG
Energy cannot predict the outcome of these cases and
investigations at this time.

The Minnesota Involuntary Bankruptcy
    Case

On November 22, 2002, a petition commencing
an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Chapter 11
of the Bankruptcy Code was filed by five of NRG Energy’s
former officers, Brian Bird, Leonard Bluhm, Craig Mataczynski,
John Noer and David Peterson in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the District of Minnesota. Roy Hewitt and James Bender
subsequently joined in the petition. NRG Energy has subsequently
filed an answer and a motion to dismiss the Involuntary Case.
The court will consider the motion to dismiss. In their petition
filed with the Minnesota Bankruptcy Court, the petitioners
sought recovery of severance and other benefits in an aggregate
amount of $27.7 million.

Since the commencement of the Minnesota
involuntary case, NRG Energy and its counsel have been involved
in extensive negotiations with the petitioners and their
counsel. As a result of these negotiations, NRG Energy and the
petitioners reached an agreement and compromise regarding their
respective claims against each other. On February 17, 2003,
the Settlement Agreement was executed by the Petitioners and NRG
Energy, pursuant to which NRG Energy agreed to pay the
Petitioners an aggregate settlement in the amount of
$12.2 million.

Fortistar relating to the Oswego power plant. NRG Energy
asserted counterclaims. After considerable litigation, the
parties entered into a conditional, confidential settlement
agreement, which was subject to necessary board and lender
approvals. NRG Energy was unable to obtain necessary approvals.
Fortistar has moved the court to enforce the settlement, seeking

subsidiary of NRG Energy. In the lawsuit, Fortistar claims that
the defendants violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (“RICO”) and committed fraud by
engaging in a pattern of negotiating and executing agreements
“they intended not to comply with” and “made
false statements later to conceal their fraudulent
promises.” The plaintiffs allege damages of some
$350 million and also assert entitlement to a trebling of
these damages under the provisions of the RICO Act. The present

United States
    District Court for the Western District of New York, Civil
    Action No. 02-CV-002S

In January, 2002, NRG Energy and Niagara Mohawk
Power Corporation (“NiMo”) were sued by the New York
Department of Environmental Conservation in federal court in New
York. The complaint asserts that projects undertaken at NRG
Energy’s Huntley and Dunkirk plants by NiMo, the former
owner of the facilities, should have been permitted pursuant to
the Clean Air Act and that the failure to do so violated federal
and state laws. In July, 2002, NRG Energy filed a motion to
dismiss. The motion is still pending before the judge and there
has been no further action taken in connection with the case. On
March 27, 2003 the court dismissed the complaint against
NRG Energy without prejudice. It is possible the State will
appeal this dismissal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals or
could re-file a case against NRG Energy. If the case ultimately
is litigated to a judgment and there is an unfavorable outcome
that could not be addressed through use of compliant fuels
and/or a plant wide applicability limit, NRG Energy has
estimated that the total investment that would be required to
install pollution control devices could be as high as
$300 million over a ten to twelve-year period, and NRG
Energy maybe responsible for payment of certain penalties and
fines.

Schedule of Compliance and asserted that it is to be used in
conjunction with newly-drafted consent orders. NRG Energy has
not yet received the consent orders although NRG Energy has been
told by DEC that DEC is now seeking a penalty in excess of that

expects to continue negotiations with DEC regarding the proposed
consent orders, including the Schedule of Compliance and the
penalty amount. NRG Energy cannot predict whether those
discussions with the DEC will result in a settlement and, if
they do, what sanctions will be imposed. In the event that the
consent order negotiations are unsuccessful, NRG Energy does not
know what relief DEC will seek through an enforcement action and
what the result of such action will be.

Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation v.
    Dunkirk Power LLC, et al.,

Supreme Court, Erie County, Index
    No. 1-2000-8681

On October 2, 2000, plaintiff Niagara Mohawk
Power Corporation commenced this action against NRG Energy to
recover damages, plus late fees, less payments received, through
the date of judgment, as well as any additional amounts due and
owing for electric service provided to the Dunkirk Plant after
September 18, 2000. Plaintiff Niagara Mohawk claims that
NRG Energy has failed to pay retail tariff amounts for utility
services commencing on or about June 11, 1999 and
continuing to September 18, 2000 and thereafter. Plaintiff
has alleged breach of contract, suit on account, violation of
statutory duty, and unjust enrichment claims. On or about
October 23, 2000, NRG Energy served an answer denying
liability and asserting affirmative defenses.

After proceeding through discovery, and prior to
trial, the parties and the court entered into a stipulation and
order filed August 9, 2002 consolidating this action with
two other actions against the Company’s Huntley and Oswego
subsidiaries, both of which cases assert the same claims and
legal theories for failure to pay retail tariffs for utility
services.

On October 8, 2002, a Stipulation and Order
was filed in the Erie County Clerk’s Office staying this
action pending submission of some or all of the disputes in the
action to the FERC. NRG Energy cannot make an evaluation of the
likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. The cumulative potential
loss could exceed $35 million.

Pointe Coupee Parish Police Jury and
    Louisiana Generating, LLC v. United States Environmental
    Protection Agency and Christine Todd Whitman, Administrator,

Adversary Proceeding No. 02-61021
    on the Docket of the United States Court of Appeals for the
    Fifth Circuit

On December 2, 2002, a Petition for Review
was filed to appeal the United States Environmental Protection
Agency’s approval of the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality’s (“DEQ”) revisions to the
Baton Rouge State Implementation Plan (“SIP”). Pointe
Coupee and NRG Energy’s subsidiary, Louisiana Generating,
object to the approval of SIP Section

4.2.1. Permitting
NO

x

Sources that purports to require DEQ to
obtain offsets of major increases in emissions of nitrogen
oxides (NO

x

) associated with major modifications of
existing facilities or construction of new facilities both in
the Baton Rouge Ozone Nonattainment Area and in four adjoining
attainment parishes referred to as the Region of Influence,
including Pointe Coupee Parish. The plaintiffs’ challenge
is based on DEQ’s failure to comply with Administrative
Procedures Act requirements related to rulemaking and EPA’s
regulations which prohibit EPA from approving a SIP not prepared
in accordance with state law. The court granted a sixty
(60) day stay of this proceeding on February 25, 2003
to allow the parties to conduct settlement discussions. At this
time, NRG Energy is unable to predict the eventual outcome of
this matter or the potential loss contingencies, if any, to
which the Company may be subject.

In the Matter of Louisiana Generating, LLC,

Adversary Proceeding
    No. 2002-1095 1-EQ on the Docket of the Louisiana Division
    of Administrative Law

During 2000, DEQ issued a Part 70 Air Permit
modification to Louisiana Generating to construct and operate
two 240 MW natural gas-fired turbines. The Part 70 Air
Permit set emissions limits for the criteria air pollutants,
including Nox, based on the application of Best Available
Control Technology (“BACT”). The BACT limitation for
NO

x

was based on the guarantees of the manufacturer,
Siemens-Westinghouse.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Louisiana Generating sought an interim emissions
limit to allow Siemens-Westinghouse time to install additional
control equipment. To establish the interim limit, DEQ issued a
Compliance Order and Notice of Potential Penalty,
No. AE-CN-02-0022, on September 8, 2002, which is, in
part, subject to the referenced administrative hearing. DEQ
alleged that Louisiana Generating did not meet its
NO

x

emissions limit on certain days, did not conduct
all opacity monitoring and did not complete all record keeping
and certification requirements. Louisiana Generating intends to
vigorously defend certain claims and any future penalty
assessment, while also seeking an amendment of its limit for
NO

x

. An initial status conference has been held with
the Administrative Law Judge and quarterly reports will be
submitted to describe progress, including settlement and
amendment of the limit. In addition, NRG Energy may assert
breach of warranty claims against the manufacturer. With respect
to the administrative action described above, at this time NRG
Energy is unable to predict the eventual outcome of this matter
or the potential loss contingencies, if any, to which the
Company may be subject.

NRG Sterlington Power, LLC

During 2002, NRG Sterlington conducted a review
of the Sterlington Power Facility’s Part 70 Air Permit
obtained by the facility’s former owner and operator, Koch
Power, Inc. Koch had outlined a plan to install eight 25
megawatt (MW) turbines to reach a 200 MW limit in the
permit. Due to the inability of several units to reach their
nameplate capacity, Koch determined that it would need
additional units to reach the electric output target. In August
2000, NRG Sterlington acquired the remaining interests in the
facility not originally held on a passive basis and sought the
transfer of the Part 70 Air Permit along with a modification to
incorporate two 17.5 MW turbines installed by Koch and to
increase the total number of turbines to ten. The permit
modification was issued February 13, 2002. During further
review, NRG Sterlington determined that a ninth unit had been
installed prior to issuance of the permit modification. In
keeping with its environmental policy, it disclosed this matter
to DEQ during April, 2002. Additional information was provided
during July 2002. As DEQ has not acted to date to institute an
enforcement proceeding, NRG Energy suspects that it may not.
However, as it is not time barred from doing so, NRG Energy is
unable at this time to predict the eventual outcome or potential
loss contingencies, if any, to which the Company may be subject.

FERC Investigation of Saguaro Power
    Company

On February 24, 2003, FERC initiated an
investigation into whether Saguaro Power Company satisfied or
currently satisfies the statutory and regulatory requirements
for a qualifying facility under the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978 (“PURPA”). PURPA provides special
benefits for qualifying facilities regarding their rights to
sell the electrical output of generation projects to electric
utilities and exempts qualifying facilities from certain state
and federal regulation. NRG Energy’s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Eastern Sierra Power Company, owns a 49% general
partnership interest and a 1% limited partnership interest in
Saguaro. The FERC Order initiating the investigation notes that
certain financing arrangements between Enron North America and
Boulder Power LLC, an indirect owner of a 14% general
partnership interest and a 1% limited partnership interest in
Saguaro, may have caused Saguaro not to meet the limitations on
electric utility ownership applicable to qualifying facilities
under PURPA and FERC regulations. At this time, NRG Energy is
unable to predict the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of
this matter or the remedies that the FERC would impose in the
event it found that Sagauro did not or does not satisfy the
requirements for a qualifying facility.

parent entities of the company with which they
contracted to build the plant in order to recover amounts
allegedly owing. Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of
fiduciary duty, piercing the corporate veil, breach of contract,
tortious interference with contract, enforcement of the NRG
Energy guaranty, detrimental reliance, negligent or intentional
misrepresentation, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. On
December 23, 2002, NRG Energy moved to dismiss the
complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim upon
which relief can be granted. NRG Energy is currently awaiting
plaintiffs’ response to the motion. No trial date has yet
been set in this matter and NRG Energy cannot presently predict
the outcome of the dispute.

The Mississippi Involuntary
    Case

On October 17, 2002, a petition commencing
an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Chapter 7
of the Bankruptcy Code was filed against LSP-Pike Energy, LLC, a
subsidiary of NRG Energy, by Stone & Webster, Inc. and
Shaw Constructors, Inc. — the joining petitioners in
the Minnesota involuntary case described above — in
the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi. In their petition filed with the Mississippi
Bankruptcy Court, the joining petitioners sought recovery of
allegedly unpaid contractual construction-related obligations in
an aggregate amount of $73,833,328, which amount LSP-Pike
Energy, LLC has disputed. LSP-Pike Energy, LLC filed an answer
to the petition in the Mississippi involuntary case and served
various interrogatory and deposition discovery requests on the
joining petitioners. The Mississippi Bankruptcy Court has not
entered any order for relief in the Mississippi involuntary case.

FirstEnergy Arbitration Claim

On November 29, 2001, The Cleveland Electric
Illuminating Company, The Toledo Edison Company and FirstEnergy
Ventures (“Sellers”) entered into Purchase and Sale
Agreements with NRG Able Acquisition LLC, which were guaranteed
by NRG (collectively, “Purchasers”), for the purchase
of certain power plants for approximately $1.5 billion. On
August 8, 2002, Sellers terminated the agreements and
asserted that Purchasers were liable for anticipatory breach of
the Purchase and Sale Agreements on the grounds that they could
not finance the purchases. On August 8, 2002, Purchasers
provided notice that they disagreed with Sellers’
assertion. After Sellers filed a motion seeking a waiver of the
automatic stay of Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, on
February 21, 2003, Sellers, NRG Energy, and NRG Northern
Ohio Generating LLC, f/k/a/ NRG Able, stipulated to the United
States Bankruptcy Court, District of Minnesota, that they would
agree to a waiver of the automatic stay, thereby allowing
Sellers to commence arbitration against Purchasers regarding
their dispute. The collection of any award, however, would
remain fully subject to NRG Energy’s automatic stay. The
Bankruptcy Court approved the stipulation. On February 26,
2002, Sellers provided notice of their intent to commence
arbitration proceedings against Purchasers. Sellers have yet to
quantify their damage claim, though Sellers have stated publicly
that they will seek to recover several hundred million dollars.
NRG Energy cannot presently predict the outcome of this dispute.

General Electric Company and Siemens
    Westinghouse Turbine Purchase Disputes

NRG Energy and/or its affiliates have entered
into several turbine purchase agreements with affiliates of
General Electric Company and Siemens Westinghouse Power
Corporation. GE and Siemens have notified NRG Energy that it is
in default under certain of those contracts, terminated such
contracts, and demanded that NRG Energy pay the termination fees
set forth in such contracts. GE’s claim amounts to
$120 million and Siemens’ approximately
$45 million in cumulative termination charges. NRG Energy
has recorded a liability for the amounts they believe they owe
under the contracts and termination provisions. NRG Energy
cannot estimate the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes in these
disputes.

Itiquira Energetica, S.A.

NRG Energy’s indirectly controlled Brazilian
project company, Itiquira Energetica S.A., the owner of a
156MW hydro project in Brazil, is currently in arbitration with
the former EPC contractor for the project, Inepar Industria e
Construcoes (Inepar). The dispute was commenced by Itiquira in
September, 2002 and pertains to certain matters arising under
the former EPC contract. Itiquira principally asserts that
Inepar breached the contract and caused damages to Itiquira by
(i) failing to meet milestones for substantial completion;
(ii) failing to provide adequate resources to meet such
milestones; (iii) failing to pay subcontractors amounts
due; and (iv) being insolvent. Itiquira’s arbitration
claim is for approximately US$40 million. Inepar has
asserted in the arbitration that Itiquira breached the contact
and caused damages to Inepar by failing to recognize events of
force majeure as grounds for excused delay and extensions of
scope of services and material under the contract. Inepar’s
damage claim is for approximately US$10 million. On
November 12, 2002, Inepar submitted its affirmative
statement of claim, and Itiquira submitted its response and
statement of counterclaims on December 14, 2002. Inepar
replied to Itiquira’s response and counterclaims on
January 14, 2003. Itiquira is to submit its reply to
Inepar’s January 14 filing on March 14, 2003, and
a hearing was held on March 21, 2003. NRG Energy cannot
estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in this
dispute.

NRG Energy Credit Defaults

NRG Energy and various of its subsidiaries are in
default under various of their credit facilities, financial
instruments, construction agreements and other contracts, which
have given rise to liens, claims and contingencies against them
and may in the future give rise to additional liens, claims and
contingencies against them. In addition, NRG Energy and various
of its subsidiaries have entered into various guarantees, equity
contribution agreements, and other financial support agreements
with respect to the obligations of their affiliates, which have
given rise to liens, claims and contingencies against them and
may in the future give rise to additional liens, claims and
contingencies against the party or parties providing the
financial support. NRG Energy cannot predict the outcome or
financial impact of these matters.

Note 23 — Segment
Reporting

NRG Energy conducts its business within six
segments: Independent Power Generation in North America,
Independent Power Generation outside North America (Europe, Asia
Pacific and Other Americas regions), Alternative Energy and
Thermal projects. NRG Energy’s Revenues from majority owned
operations attributable to Europe and Asia Pacific primarily
relate to operations in the United Kingdom and Australia,
respectively. These segments are distinct components with
separate operating results and management structures in place.

Decommissioning Funds

NRG Energy is required by the State of Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality (“DEQ”) to
rehabilitate NRG Energy’s Big Cajun II ash and
wastewater impoundment areas, subsequent to the Big
Cajun II facilities’ removal from service. On
July 1, 1989, a guarantor trust fund (the “Solid Waste
Disposal Trust Fund”) was established to accumulate the
estimated funds necessary for such purpose. Approximately
$1.1 million was initially deposited in the Solid Waste
Disposal Trust Fund in 1989, and $116,000 has been funded
annually thereafter, based upon an estimated future
rehabilitation cost (in 1989 dollars) of approximately
$3.5 million and the remaining estimated useful life of the
Big Cajun II facilities. Cumulative contributions to the
Solid Waste Disposal Trust Fund and earnings on the investments
therein are accrued as a decommissioning liability. At
December 31, 2002 and 2001, the carrying value of the trust
fund investments and the related accrued decommissioning
liability was approximately $4.6 million and
$4.3 million, respectively. The trust fund investments are
comprised of various debt securities of the United States and
are carried at amortized cost, which approximates their fair
value.

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activity

On January 1, 2001, NRG Energy adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (SFAS No. 133), as amended by
SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138. SFAS
No. 133 requires NRG Energy to record all derivatives on
the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
non-hedge derivatives will be immediately recognized in
earnings. Changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as
hedges will either be recognized in earnings as offsets to the
changes in fair value of related hedged assets, liabilities and
firm commitments or, for forecasted transactions, deferred and
recorded as a component of other accumulated comprehensive
income (OCI) until the hedged transactions occur and are
recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a hedging
derivative instrument’s change in fair value will be
immediately recognized in earnings. NRG Energy also formally
assesses both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter,
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions
are highly effective in offsetting the changes in either the
fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. This assessment
includes all components of each derivative’s gain or loss
unless otherwise noted. When it is determined that a derivative
ceases to be a highly effective hedge, hedge accounting is
discontinued.

SFAS No. 133 applies to NRG
Energy’s long-term power sales contracts, long-term gas
purchase contracts and other energy related commodities
financial instruments used to mitigate variability in earnings
due to fluctuations in spot market prices, hedge fuel
requirements at generation facilities and protect investments in
fuel inventories. SFAS No. 133 also applies to various
interest rate swaps used to mitigate the risks associated with
movements in interest rates and foreign exchange contracts to
reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on foreign
denominated investments and other transactions. At
December 31, 2002, NRG Energy had various commodity
contracts extending through December 2003, and several
fixed-price gas and electricity purchase contracts extending
through 2018.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive
    Income

The following table summarizes the effects of
SFAS No. 133 on NRG Energy’s Other Comprehensive
Income balance as of December 31, 2002:

During the year ended December 31, 2002, NRG
Energy reclassified losses of $18.8 million from OCI to
current-period earnings as a result of the discontinuance of
cash flow hedges because it is probable that the original
forecasted transactions will not occur by the end of the
originally specified time period. Additionally, gains of
$84.5 million were reclassified from OCI to current period
earnings during the year ended December 31, 2002 due to the
unwinding of previously deferred amounts. These amounts are
recorded on the

same line in the statement of operations in which
the hedged items are recorded. Also during the year ended
December 31, 2002, NRG Energy recorded a gain in OCI of
approximately $20.9 million related to changes in the fair
values of derivatives accounted for as hedges. The net balance
in OCI relating to SFAS No. 133 as of
December 31, 2002 was an unrecognized gain of approximately
$26.3 million. NRG Energy expects $1.2 million of
deferred net losses on derivative instruments accumulated in OCI
to be recognized in earnings during the next twelve months.

The following table summarizes the effects of
SFAS No. 133 on NRG Energy’s Other Comprehensive
Income balance as of December 31, 2001:

The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on
January 1, 2001, resulted in an after-tax unrealized loss
of $22.6 million recorded to OCI related to previously
deferred net losses on derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges. During the year ended December 31, 2001, NRG Energy
reclassified gains of $25.3 million from OCI to
current-period earnings. This amount is recorded on the same
line in the statement of operations in which the hedged item is
recorded. Also during the year ended December 31, 2001, NRG
Energy recorded an after-tax gain in OCI of approximately
$119.0 million related to changes in the fair values of
derivatives accounted for as hedges. The net balance in OCI
relating to SFAS No. 133 as of December 31, 2001 was
an unrecognized gain of approximately $71.1 million.

The following tables summarize the effects of
SFAS No. 133 on NRG Energy’s statement of
operations for the period ended December 31, 2001:

Energy related commodities

NRG Energy is exposed to commodity price
variability in electricity, emission allowances and natural gas,
oil and coal used to meet fuel requirements. In order to manage
these commodity price risks, NRG Energy enters into financial
instruments, which may take the form of fixed price, floating
price or indexed sales or purchases, and options, such as puts,
calls, basis transactions and swaps. Certain of these
transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges. NRG
Energy has accounted for these derivatives by recording the
effective portion of the cumulative gain or loss on the
derivative instrument as a component of OCI in
shareholders’ equity. NRG Energy recognizes deferred gains
and losses into earnings in the same period or periods during
which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Such
reclassifications are included on the same line of the statement
of operations in which the hedged item is recorded.

No ineffectiveness was recognized on commodity
cash flow hedges during the periods ended December 31, 2002
and 2001.

NRG Energy’s pre-tax earnings for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were increased by an
unrealized gain of $20.0 million and $14.1 million,
respectively, associated with changes in the fair value of
energy related derivative instruments not accounted for as
hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133.

During the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001, NRG Energy reclassified gains of $96.6 million and
$25.8 million, respectively, from OCI to current-period
earnings and expects to reclassify an additional
$8.9 million of deferred gains to earnings during the next
twelve months on energy related derivative instruments accounted
for as hedges.

Interest Rates

To manage interest rate risk, NRG Energy has
entered into interest-rate swaps that effectively fix the
interest payments of certain floating rate debt instruments.
Interest-rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow
hedges. The effective portion of the cumulative gain or loss on
the derivative instrument is reported as a component of OCI in
shareholders’ equity and recognized into earnings as the
underlying interest expense is incurred. Such reclassifications
are included on the same line of the statement of operations in
which the hedged item is recorded.

No ineffectiveness was recognized on interest
rate cash flow hedges during the periods ended December 31,
2002 and 2001.

NRG Energy’s pre-tax earnings for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were increased by an
unrealized loss of $32.0 million and $0, respectively,
associated with changes in the fair value of interest rate
derivative instruments not accounted for as hedges in accordance
with SFAS No. 133.

losses to earnings during the next twelve months on interest
rate swaps accounted for as hedges.

Foreign Currency Exchange
    Rates

To preserve the U.S. dollar value of
projected foreign currency cash flows, NRG Energy may hedge, or
protect those cash flows if appropriate foreign hedging
instruments are available.

No ineffectiveness was recognized on foreign
currency cash flow hedges during the periods ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001.

NRG Energy’s pre-tax earnings for each of
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were increased
by an unrealized gain of $0.3 million associated with
foreign currency hedging instruments not accounted for as hedges
in accordance with SFAS No. 133.

During the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001, NRG Energy reclassified losses of $2.1 million and
gains of $0.2 million, respectively, from OCI to current
period earnings and expects to reclassify $0.3 million of
deferred losses to earnings during the next twelve months on
foreign currency swaps accounted for as hedges.

Note 27 — Unaudited Quarterly
Financial Data

Subsequent to the issuance of NRG Energy’s
financial statements for the quarter ended September 30,
2002, NRG Energy’s management determined that the
accounting for certain transactions required restatement.

NRG Energy determined that it had misapplied the
provisions of SFAS No. 144 related to asset groupings in
connection with the review for impairment of its long-lived
assets during the quarter ended September 30, 2002. SFAS
No. 144 requires that for purposes of testing
recoverability, assets be grouped at the lowest level for which
identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash
flows of other assets. NRG Energy recalculated the asset
impairment tests in accordance with SFAS No. 144 using the
appropriate asset groupings for independent cash flows for each
generation facility. As a result, NRG Energy concluded that
asset impairments should have been recorded for two projects
known as Bayou Cove Peaking Power LLC and Somerset Power LLC.
Since NRG Energy concluded that the triggering events that led
to the impairment charge were experienced in the third quarter
of 2002, the asset impairments related to these projects should
have been recorded as of September 30, 2002. NRG Energy
calculated the asset impairment charges for Bayou Cove Peaking
Power LLC and Somerset Power LLC to be $126.5 million and
$49.3 million, respectively.

In connection with NRG Energy’s year-end
audit, two additional items were found to be inappropriately
recorded as of September 30, 2002. These items included the
inappropriate treatment of interest rate swap transactions as
cash flow hedges and the decrease in the value of a bond
remarketing option from the original price paid by NRG Energy.
The error correction for the interest rate swaps resulted in the
recording of additional income of $61.6 million as of
September 30, 2002. The recognition of the decrease in the
value of the remarketing option resulted in a charge to income
of $15.9 million as of September 30, 2002.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A summary of the significant effects of the
restatement on our consolidated statements of operations for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2002 is as
follows:

During the fourth quarter of 2002, NRG Energy
determined that it had inadvertently offset its investment in
Jackson County, MS, bonds in the amount of $155.5 million
against long-term debt of the same amount owed to the County.
This resulted in an understatement of the Company’s assets
by $155.5 million and liabilities by $155.5 million as
of September 30, 2002. In addition, the restatement for
Bayou Cove Peaking LLC and Somerset Power LLC impairments
reduced the previously reported net property, plant and
equipment balance by $175.8 million. The restatement for
the interest rate swaps had no impact on total
shareholder’s equity and the restatement for the
remarketing option reduced other assets by $15.9 million.

A summary of the significant effects of the
restatement on our consolidated balance sheet as of
September 30, 2002 is as follows:



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Summarized quarterly unaudited financial data is
as follows:

During the fourth quarter of the year ended
December 31, 2002, NRG Energy recorded $100.3 million
of special charges including additional asset impairments and
other restructuring costs. In addition, NRG Energy recorded
$74.2 million of write downs and losses on sale of equity
investments.

Note 28 — Subsequent
Event

Brazos
Valley

— In January 2003,
the project lenders foreclosed on NRG Energy’s ownership
interests in NRG Brazos Valley GP, LLC, NRG Brazos Valley LP,
LLC, NRG Brazos Valley Technology LP, LLC and NRG Brazos Valley
Energy, LP, and the lenders thereby acquired all of the assets
of the Brazos Valley project, a 633 MW project under
construction near Houston, TX. NRG Energy agreed to the
consensual foreclosure of the companies. NRG Energy received no
cash proceeds upon completion of the foreclosure. As of
December 31, 2002, NRG Energy recorded $24.0 million
for the potential obligation to infuse additional amounts of
capital to fund a debt service reserve account and the potential
obligation to satisfy a contingent equity agreement.
