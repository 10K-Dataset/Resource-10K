PART I

Item 1 —

Business

General

NRG Energy, Inc., NRG, or the Company, is a wholesale power
    generation company with a significant presence in major
    competitive power markets in the United States. NRG is primarily
    engaged in the ownership, development, construction and
    operation of power generation facilities, the transacting in and
    trading of fuel and transportation services, and the trading of
    energy, capacity and related products in the United States and
    internationally. As of December 31, 2006, NRG had a total
    global portfolio of 223 active operating generation units at 51
    power generation plants, with an aggregate generation capacity
    of approximately 24,175 MW. Within the United States, the
    Company has one of the largest and most diversified power
    generation portfolios in terms of geography, fuel-type and
    dispatch levels, with approximately 22,940 MW of generation
    capacity in 207 active generating units at 45 plants. These
    power generation facilities are primarily located in Texas
    (approximately 10,760 MW), and the Northeast (approximately
    7,240 MW), South Central (approximately 2,850 MW), and
    the West (approximately 1,965 MW) regions of the United
    States, with approximately 125 MW from the Company’s
    thermal assets. NRG’s principal domestic power plants
    consist of a diversified mix of natural gas-, coal-, oil-fired
    and nuclear facilities, representing approximately 45%, 34%, 16%
    and 5% of the Company’s total domestic generation capacity,
    respectively. In addition, 15% of NRG’s domestic generating
    facilities have dual or multiple fuel capacity, which allows
    plants to dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option, and consist
    primarily of baseload, intermediate and peaking power generation
    facilities, which are referred to as the merit order, and also
    include thermal energy production plants. The sale of capacity
    and power from baseload generation facilities accounts for the
    majority of the Company’s revenues and provides a stable
    source of cash flow. In addition, NRG’s diverse generation
    portfolio provides the Company with opportunities to capture
    additional revenues by selling power during periods of peak
    demand, offering capacity or similar products to retail electric
    providers and others, and providing ancillary services to
    support system reliability. In addition, NRG is pursuing
    opportunities to repower existing facilities and develop new
    generation capacity in markets in which NRG currently owns
    assets in an initiative referred to as

Repowering NRG.

In
    connection with NRG’s acquisition of Padoma Wind Power LLC,
    the Company has and will continue to actively evaluate and
    potentially develop or construct domestic terrestrial wind
    projects as part of the

Repowering NRG

program.

Business
    Strategy

NRG’s strategy is to optimize the value of the
    Company’s generation assets while using its asset base as a
    platform for growth and enhanced financial performance which can
    be sustained and expanded upon in the years to come. NRG plans
    to maintain and enhance the Company’s position as a leading
    wholesale power generation company in the United States in a
    cost-effective and risk-mitigating manner in order to serve the
    bulk power requirements of NRG’s existing customer base and
    other entities that offer load or otherwise consume wholesale
    electricity products and services in bulk. NRG’s strategy
    includes the following elements:

Pursue additional growth opportunities at existing
    sites

— NRG is favorably positioned to pursue
    growth opportunities through expansion of its existing
    generating capacity and development of new generating capacity
    at its existing facilities. NRG intends to invest in its
    existing assets through plant improvements, repowerings,
    brownfield development and site expansions to meet anticipated
    requirements for additional capacity in NRG’s core markets.
    In furtherance of this goal, NRG has initiated a company-wide
    program, known as

Repowering NRG

, to develop, construct
    and operate new and enhanced power generation facilities at its
    existing sites, with an emphasis on new baseload capacity that
    is supported by long-term power sales agreements and financed
    with limited or non-recourse project financing. NRG expects that
    these efforts will provide one or more of the following
    benefits: improved heat rates; lower delivered costs; expanded
    electricity production capability; an improved ability to
    dispatch economically across the merit order; increased
    technological and fuel diversity; and reduced environmental
    impacts, including facilities that either have near zero
    greenhouse gas emissions or can be equipped to capture and
    sequester greenhouse gas emissions.



Increase value from existing assets

— NRG has a
    highly diversified portfolio of power generation assets in terms
    of region, fuel-type and dispatch levels. NRG will continue to
    focus on extracting value from its portfolio by improving plant
    performance, reducing costs and harnessing the Company’s
    advantages of scale in the procurement of fuels and other
    commodities, parts and services, and in doing so improve the
    Company’s return on invested capital, or ROIC — a
    strategy that NRG has branded

FORNRG,

or Focus on
    ROIC@NRG.

Maintain financial strength and flexibility

—
    NRG remains focused on cash flow and maintaining appropriate
    levels of liquidity, debt and equity in order to ensure
    continued access to capital for investment, to enhance
    risk-adjusted returns and to provide flexibility in executing
    NRG’s business strategy. NRG will continue to focus on
    maintaining operational and financial controls designed to
    ensure that the Company’s financial position remains
    strong. At the same time, NRG expects to continue its practice
    of returning excess cash flows to its debt and equity investors
    on a regular basis.

Reduce the volatility of the Company’s cash flows
    through asset-based commodity hedging activities

—
    NRG will continue to execute asset-based risk management,
    hedging, marketing and trading strategies within well defined
    risk and liquidity guidelines in order to manage the value of
    the Company’s physical and contractual assets. The
    Company’s marketing and hedging philosophy is centered on
    generating stable returns from its portfolio of baseload power
    generation assets while preserving an ability to capitalize on
    strong spot market conditions and to capture the extrinsic value
    of the Company’s intermediate and peaking facilities and
    portions of its baseload fleet. NRG believes that it can
    successfully execute this strategy by leveraging its expertise
    in marketing power and ancillary services, its knowledge of
    markets, its balanced financial structure and its diverse
    portfolio of power generation assets.

Pursue strategic acquisitions and divestures

—
    NRG will continue to pursue selective acquisitions, joint
    ventures and divestitures to enhance its asset mix and
    competitive position in the Company’s core regions. NRG
    intends to concentrate on opportunities that present attractive
    risk-adjusted returns. NRG will also opportunistically pursue
    other strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions or
    divestitures.

Competition
    and Competitive Strengths

Competition

— Wholesale power generation is a
    capital-intensive, commodity-driven business with numerous
    industry participants. NRG competes on the basis of the location
    of its plants and owning multiple plants in its regions, which
    increases the stability and reliability of its energy supply.
    Wholesale power generation is basically a local business that is
    currently highly fragmented relative to other commodity
    industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such,
    there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities,
    resources, nature and identity of the companies NRG competes
    against depending on the market.

Scale and diversity of assets

— NRG has one of
    the largest and most diversified power generation portfolios in
    the United States, with approximately 22,940 MW of
    generation capacity in 207 active generating units at 45 plants
    as of December 31, 2006. The Company’s power
    generation assets are diversified by fuel-type, dispatch level
    and region, which help mitigate the risks associated with fuel
    price volatility and market demand cycles. NRG’s
    U.S. baseload facilities, which consist of approximately
    8,745 MW of generation capacity measured as of
    December 31, 2006, provide the Company with a significant
    source of stable cash flow, while its intermediate and peaking
    facilities, with approximately 14,195 MW of generation
    capacity as of December 31, 2006, provide NRG with
    opportunities to capture the significant upside potential that
    can arise from time to time during periods of high demand. In
    addition, approximately 15% of the Company’s domestic
    generation facilities have dual or multiple fuel capability,
    which allows most of these plants to dispatch with the lowest
    cost fuel option.



The following chart demonstrates the diversification of
    NRG’s domestic power generation assets as of
    December 31, 2006:

Reliability of future cash flows

— NRG has sold
    forward or otherwise hedged a significant portion of its
    expected baseload generation capacity through 2012. The Company
    has the capacity and intent to enter into additional hedges in
    later years when market conditions are favorable. In addition,
    as of December 31, 2006, the Company has purchased forward
    under fixed price contracts (with contractually-specified price
    escalators) to provide fuel for approximately 73% of its
    expected baseload coal generation output from 2007 to 2012.
    These forward positions provide a stable and reliable source of
    future cash flow for NRG’s investors, while preserving a
    portion of its generation portfolio for opportunistic sales to
    take advantage of market dynamics.

Favorable market dynamics for baseload power
    plants

— In 2006, approximately 83% of the
    Company’s domestic generation was fueled by coal or nuclear
    fuel. In many of the competitive markets where NRG operates, the
    price of power is typically set by the marginal costs of natural
    gas-fired and oil-fired power plants that currently have
    substantially higher variable costs than solid fuel baseload
    power plants. As a result of NRG’s lower marginal cost for
    baseload coal and nuclear generation assets, the Company expects
    these ERCOT assets to generate power nearly 100% of the time
    they are available.

Locational advantages

— Many of NRG’s
    generation assets are located within densely populated areas
    that are characterized by significant constraints on the
    transmission of power from generators outside the region.
    Consequently, these assets are able to benefit from the higher
    prices that prevail for energy in these markets during periods
    of transmission constraints. NRG has generation assets located
    within New York City, southwestern Connecticut, Houston and the
    Los Angeles and San Diego load basins; all areas with
    constraints on the transmission of electricity. This gives the
    Company the opportunity to capture additional revenues through
    offering capacity to retail electric providers and others,
    selling power at prevailing market prices during periods of peak
    demand and providing ancillary services in support of system
    reliability. These facilities are often ideally situated for
    repowering or the addition of new capacity, as well, because
    their location and existing infrastructure give them significant
    advantages over newly developed sites in their regions.

In understanding NRG’s business, the Company believes that
    certain performance metrics are particularly important. These
    are industry statistics defined by the North American Electric
    Reliability Council and are more fully described below:

Annual Equivalent Availability Factor, or
    EAF:

The percentage of time in one year that a
    generating unit is able to produce electricity, adjusted to take
    into account times when the unit is unavailable and able to
    produce its full rated output.

Gross heat rate:

NRG calculates the gross heat
    rate for the Company’s fossil-fired power plants by
    dividing the average amount of fuel in BTUs that it takes to
    generate one kWh of electricity by the generator output.

Net Capacity Factor:

The net amount of
    electricity that a generating unit produces over a period of
    time divided by the net amount of electricity it could have
    produced if it had run at full power over that time period. The
    net amount of electricity produced is the total amount of
    electricity generated minus the amount of electricity used
    during generation.



The tables below present the North American power generation
    performance metrics for the Company’s power plants
    discussed above for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005:

Generation
    Asset Overview

NRG has a significant power generation presence in major
    competitive power markets of the United States as set forth in
    the map below:



As of December 31, 2006, the Company’s power
    generation assets consisted of approximately 10,470 MW of
    gas-fired; 7,815 MW coal-fired; 3,555 MW of oil-fired
    and 1,100 MW of nuclear generating capacity in the United
    States. In addition, NRG also owns approximately 1,230 MW
    of thermal capacity as well as 1,235 MW of power generation
    capacity overseas. The Company’s North American power
    generation portfolio by dispatch level is comprised of
    approximately 39% baseload, 37% intermediate and 24% of peaking
    units. NRG uses hedging strategies which may include power and
    natural gas forward sales contracts to manage the commodity
    price risk associated with the Company’s generation assets,
    and are primarily around the Company’s baseload generation
    assets. In addition, these hedging strategies also provide for
    stable cash flow and earnings predictability.

The following table summarizes NRG’s North American
    baseload capacity and the corresponding revenues resulting from
    baseload hedge agreements extending beyond December 31,
    2006 through 2012:

The following is a discussion of NRG’s generation assets by
    segment for the year ended December 31, 2006. This
    discussion reflects the realignment of the Company’s new
    segment structure as discussed in Item 15 —
    Note 17,

Segment Reporting,

to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in this

Form 10-K.

Texas Region

— As of December 31,
    2006, NRG’s generation assets in the Texas region consisted
    of approximately 5,280 MW of baseload generation assets and
    approximately 5,480 MW of intermediate and peaking natural
    gas-fired assets. NRG realizes a substantial portion of its
    revenue and cash flow from the sale of power from the
    Company’s three baseload power plants located in the ERCOT
    market that use solid fuel: W. A. Parish which uses coal,
    Limestone which uses lignite and coal, and an undivided 44%
    interest in two nuclear generating units at STP which uses
    nuclear fuel. Power plants are generally dispatched in order of
    lowest operating cost and as of December 31, 2006,
    approximately 72% of the net generation capacity in the ERCOT
    market was natural gas-fired. In the current natural gas price
    environment, NRG’s three baseload facilities have
    significantly lower operating costs than gas plants. NRG expects
    these three facilities to operate nearly 100% of the time,
    subject to planned and forced outages.



Northeast Region

— As of
    December 31, 2006, NRG generation assets in the Northeast
    region of the United States consisted of approximately
    7,240 MW generation capacity from the Company’s power
    plants within the control areas of the New York Independent
    System Operator, or NYISO, the Independent System
    Operator — New England, or ISO-NE, and the PJM
    Interconnection LLC, or PJM. Certain of these assets are located
    in transmission constrained areas, including approximately
    1,415 MW of in-city New York City generation capacity and
    approximately 535 MW of southwest Connecticut generation
    capacity. As of December 31, 2006, NRG’s generation
    assets in the Northeast region consisted of approximately
    1,960 MW of baseload generation assets and approximately
    5,280 MW of intermediate and peaking assets.

South Central Region

— As of
    December 31, 2006, NRG generation assets in the South
    Central region of the United States consisted of approximately
    2,850 MW of generation capacity, making NRG the third
    largest generator in the Southeastern Electric Reliability
    Council/Entergy, or SERC-Entergy, region. The Company’s
    generation assets in the South Central region consists of its
    primary asset, Big Cajun II, a coal-fired plant located
    near Baton Rouge, Louisiana which has approximately
    1,490 MW of baseload generation assets and 1,360 MW of
    intermediate and peaking assets. An annual average of
    1,164 MW of baseload generation capacity has been
    contracted through eleven cooperatives within the region through
    2025.

West Region

— On March 31, 2006,
    NRG acquired Dynegy, Inc.’s 50% ownership interest in WCP
    Holdings to become sole owner of power plants with generation
    capacity of approximately 1,825 MW in the West region of
    the United States. These assets, combined with approximately
    140 MW of existing wholly owned capacity in the Western
    Electricity Coordinating Council, brings NRG’s total
    generation to approximately 1,965 MW in the West region as
    of December 31, 2006. On January 3, 2007, NRG
    completed the sale of the Red Bluff and Chowchilla II power
    plants with a combined generation capacity of approximately
    95 MW to an entity controlled by Wayzata Investment
    Partners LLC. Excluding these two plants, total generation for
    the West region was 1,870 MW.

International Region

— As of
    December 31, 2006, NRG had net ownership in approximately
    1,235 MW of power generating capacity outside the United
    States in Australia, Brazil, and Germany. In addition to
    traditional power generation facilities, NRG also owned equity
    interests in certain coal mines in Germany.

Thermal

— NRG owns thermal and chilled
    water businesses that generate approximately 1,230 MW
    thermal equivalents. In addition, NRG’s thermal segment
    owns certain power plants with approximately 125 MW of
    power generating capacity located in Delaware and in
    Pennsylvania.

Dispositions
    of Non-Strategic Assets

During 2006, NRG continued its efforts to divest the
    Company’s interests in non-core assets. As of
    December 31, 2006, NRG had sold a number of consolidated
    businesses and equity investments in an effort to reduce the
    Company’s debt, improve liquidity and rationalize
    NRG’s investments.

Dispositions completed during 2006 are summarized in the

Repowering
    NRG

Program

NRG has announced a comprehensive portfolio redevelopment
    program, referred to as

Repowering NRG

, which involves
    the development, financing, construction and operation of new
    multi-fuel, multi-technology generation capacity at NRG’s
    existing domestic sites to meet the growing demand in the
    Company’s core markets. Through the

Repowering NRG

program, the Company anticipates retiring certain existing
    units and adding up to approximately 10,350 MW of new
    generation, with an emphasis on new baseload capacity that is
    supported by long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, and
    financed with limited or non-recourse project financing. NRG
    expects that these repowering investments will provide one or
    more of the following benefits: improved heat rates; lower
    delivered costs; expanded electricity production capability; an
    improved ability to dispatch economically across the merit
    order; increased technological and fuel diversity; and reduced
    environmental impacts. The Company expects that the

Repowering NRG

program will also result in indirect
    benefits, including the continuation of operations and retention
    of key personnel at its existing facilities.

A critical aspect of the

Repowering NRG

program is the
    extent to which the Company seeks to reduce the carbon intensity
    of the Company’s generation fleet by developing generating
    facilities with zero
    CO


and low
    CO


emissions, as well as facilities that can be equipped for
    CO


separation and sequestration. As a result, the

Repowering
    NRG

program is important not only to NRG but also to the
    power industry in general. The American power industry is the
    primary emitter of
    CO


in the largest
    CO


emitting market on earth. As the power industry takes steps to
    develop the next wave of power generation infrastructure,
    technology and capital allocation decisions will be made which
    could impact GHG from power generation by either making the
    situation significantly worse or significantly better in terms
    of
    CO


intensity. Although there is no current technological solution
    to retro-fit existing fossil-fueled technology to capture GHG
    from power plant flues, there are commercially available large
    scale technologies for new plants that can generate power with
    much lower GHG emissions than traditional coal-fired generation.
    Given that new generation units have useful lives of up to
    50 years, NRG will give full consideration to
    CO


and other emissions that contribute to GHG when making its
    long-term investment decisions.

As part of the

Repowering NRG

program, NRG is pursuing a
    five-pronged GHG emissions strategy as follows:

1.

Nuclear development

— a known, reliable
    source of electricity with zero emissions.

2.

IGCC development

— coal-fueled baseload
    generation designed to reduce the intensity of
    CO


emissions.

3.

Wind development

— renewable energy for
    the future with zero emissions.

4.

Public outreach

— NRG will work with
    government, industry and public interest groups to formulate and
    implement an economically and environmentally responsible GHG
    policy.

5.

Bridge the technology gap

— The Company
    has launched a number of initiatives to improve technology
    through R&D particularly post-combustion carbon capture,
    developing underground sequestration, and finding offsets that
    will mitigate
    CO


production.

NRG estimates that the

Repowering NRG

program, if fully
    implemented as currently proposed, could have a total capital
    cost of approximately $16 billion. While NRG believes it is
    extremely unlikely that the program will be fully implemented as
    currently proposed, the Company nonetheless expects the overall
    capital expenditures in connection with the program will be
    substantial. NRG expects to mitigate the capital cost of the
    program through equity partnerships and public-private
    partnerships, as well as through development fees for certain
    projects. To mitigate the investment risks, NRG anticipates
    entering into long-term PPAs and engineering, procurement and
    construction, or EPC, contracts. The Company currently expects
    its share of cash contributions for the projects included in the

Repowering NRG

program to range between $500 million
    and $2.0 billion over the next decade. However, the
    proposed increase in generation capacity and capital costs
    resulting from

Repowering NRG

could change as proposed
    projects are included or removed from the program due to a
    number of factors, including successfully obtaining required
    permits and long term PPAs, availability of financing on
    favorable terms, and



achieving targeted project returns. The projects that have been
    identified as part of the

Repowering NRG

program are
    subject to change as NRG refines the program to take into
    account the success rate for completion of projects, changes in
    the targeted minimum return thresholds, and evolving market
    dynamics.

Commercial
    Operations Overview

NRG seeks to maximize profitability and manage cash flow
    volatility through the marketing, trading and sale of energy,
    capacity and ancillary services into spot, intermediate and
    long-term markets and through the active management and trading
    of emissions allowances, fuel supplies and
    transportation-related services. The Company’s principal
    objectives are the realization of the full market value of its
    asset base, including the capture of its extrinsic value, the
    management and mitigation of commodity market risk and the
    reduction of cash flow volatility over time.

NRG enters into power sales and hedging arrangements via a wide
    range of products and contracts, including power purchase
    agreements, fuel supply contracts, capacity auctions, natural
    gas swap agreements and other financial instruments. The power
    purchase agreements that NRG enters into require the Company to
    deliver MWh of power to its counterparties. Natural gas swap
    agreements and other financial instruments hedge the price NRG
    will receive for power to be delivered in the future.

Fuel
    Supply and Transportation

NRG’s fuel requirements consist primarily of nuclear fuel
    and various forms of fossil fuel including oil, natural gas and
    coal, including lignite. The prices of oil, natural gas and coal
    are subject to macro- and micro-economic forces that can change
    dramatically in both the short- and long-term. The Company
    obtains its oil, natural gas and coal from multiple suppliers
    and transportation sources. Although availability is generally
    not an issue, localized shortages, transportation availability
    and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur. Issues
    related to the sources and availability of raw materials is
    fairly uniform across the Company’s business segments.

Coal

— The Company is largely hedged for
    its domestic coal consumption over the next few years. Coal
    hedging is dynamic based on forecasted generation and market
    volatility. As of December 31, 2006, NRG has purchased
    forward under contracts to provide fuel for approximately 73% on
    average of the Company’s requirement from 2007 through
    2012; 111% in 2007 (includes inventory build in excess of the
    Company’s forecasted coal burn requirements), 89% in 2008,
    81% in 2009, 56% in 2010, 51% in 2011 and 50% in years 2012 and
    beyond. NRG arranges for the purchase, transportation and
    delivery of coal for the Company’s baseload coal plants via
    a variety of coal purchase agreements, rail transportation
    agreements and rail car lease arrangements. The Company
    purchased approximately 35 million tons of coal in 2006,
    which would rank NRG as one of the largest coal purchasers in
    the United States.

As of December 31, 2006, NRG had approximately 7,600
    privately leased or owned rail cars in the Company’s
    transportation fleet. In addition, the Company intends to enter
    into contracts for delivery of additional 1,100 rail cars within
    the next year of which approximately 1,000 will replace a
    portion of the Company’s existing rail car fleet. NRG has
    entered into rail transportation agreements with varying tenures
    that provide for substantially all of the Company’s rail
    transportation requirements through the end of the decade.

Natural Gas

— NRG operates a fleet of
    natural gas plants in the Texas, Northeast, South Central and
    West regions which are comprised of primarily peaking assets
    that run in times of high power demand. Due to the



uncertainty of their dispatch, the fuel needs are managed on a
    spot basis as it is not prudent to forward purchase fixed price
    gas on units that may not run. The Company contracts for gas
    storage services as well as gas transportation services to
    ensure delivery of gas when needed.

Nuclear Fuel

— STP’s owners satisfy
    STP’s fuel supply requirements by (1) acquiring
    uranium concentrates and contracting for conversion of the
    uranium concentrates into uranium hexafluoride,
    (2) contracting for enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and
    (3) contracting for fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies.
    NRG is party to a number of long-term forward purchase contracts
    with many of the world’s largest suppliers covering STP
    requirements for uranium and conversion services for the next
    five years, and with substantial portions of STP’s
    requirements procured through the end of the next decade. NRG is
    party to long term contracts to procure STP’s requirements
    for enrichment services and fuel fabrication for the life of the
    operating license.

Seasonality
    and Price Volatility

Annual and quarterly operating results can be significantly
    affected by weather and energy commodity price volatility.
    Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas,
    interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels
    of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power
    price volatility. NRG derives a majority of its annual revenues
    in the months of May through September, when demand for
    electricity is the highest in its core domestic markets.
    Further, power price volatility is generally higher in the
    summer months, traditionally NRG’s most important season.
    The Company’s second most important season is the winter
    months of December through March when volatility and price
    spikes in underlying fuel prices have tended to drive seasonal
    electricity prices. Issues related to seasonality and price
    volatility are fairly uniform across the Company’s business
    segments.

Plant
    Operations Overview

NRG provides support services to the Company’s generation
    facilities to ensure that high-level performance goals are
    developed, best practices are shared and resources are
    appropriately balanced and allocated to get the best results for
    the Company. Performance goals are set for equivalent forced
    outage rates, or EFOR, availability, procurement costs,
    operating costs and safety.

Support services include safety, security, and systems. These
    services also include operations strategic planning and the
    development and dissemination of consistent policies and
    practices relating to plant operations.

To support the

Repowering NRG

program, the Company has
    organized its project execution process into one centralized
    group consisting of engineering, procurement and construction.
    This group has regional engineering functions combined with
    corporate project engineering, project management, procurement
    and construction functions to provide a consistent and
    standardized approach to the way repowering work is executed.
    This has enabled NRG to leverage both the procurement of major
    equipment as well as outside engineering resources through
    standardized work processes and work packaging. This process has
    led to identifying commonality in major equipment that can be
    procured from Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, as well
    as design processes. As a result, NRG expects to achieve cost
    savings by minimizing the number of outside engineering and
    construction resources, which provide detailed design and
    construction services required to complete projects, in addition
    to and by ensuring a consistent engineering and construction
    approach across all projects.

Performance
    Improvement, Cost and Process Control Initiatives

In 2005, NRG introduced a comprehensive, company-wide cost and
    revenue enhancement program with the goal of increasing its
    return on invested capital, or ROIC. This effort has been
    branded as

FORNRG,

or Focus on ROIC@NRG. Projects are
    focused on improving plant performance, reducing purchasing and
    other costs and streamlining processes. A large number of
    initiatives are currently under way at NRG’s major baseload
    facilities, including forced outage reductions, achieving full
    load, station service reductions, and heat rate improvements.
    Qualifying projects are also underway at the Princeton
    headquarters, which have reduced paperwork burdens as well as
    tax and insurance costs.

During the second quarter 2006, NRG expanded the program to
    include the Texas Genco assets and extended the term of the
    program to 2009, with anticipated annual savings in excess of
    $200 million to be achieved through



continued benefits from operational performance, cost synergies
    and purchasing-related initiatives, plus $50 million in
    cash savings. For 2006, the program has demonstrated benefits of
    over $140 million from operational performance, cost
    synergies and purchasing-related initiatives, plus
    $61 million in cash savings, putting the Company on track
    to meet its 2009 target.

Environmental
    Capital Expenditures

Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated
    that approximately $1.28 billion of environmental capital
    expenditures will be incurred during the period 2007 through
    2012, primarily related to installation of particulate,
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury controls to comply with the Clean Air Interstate
    Rule and Clean Air Mercury rules or alternative State regimes,
    to the extent more stringent than the USEPA rules, as well as
    installation of BTA under the Phase II 316(b) Rule. Changes
    to regulations or market conditions could result in changes to
    installed equipment timing or associated costs.

NRG is working to reduce a portion of the above environmental
    capital expenditures. First, NRG has the ability to monetize a
    portion of the Company’s excess allowances over the

2007-2012

timeframe and still hold sufficient allowances to operate the
    fleet with proposed controls through at least 2020. Second,
    NRG’s current contracts with the Company’s rural
    electrical customers in the South Central region allow for
    recovery of a significant portion of the costs, along with a
    capital return incurred by complying with new laws, including
    interest over the asset life of the required expenditures.
    Actual recoveries will depend, among other things, on the
    duration of the contracts and the treatment of these
    expenditures.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, NRG had 3,217 employees,
    approximately 1,622 of whom were covered by U.S. bargaining
    agreements. During 2006, the Company did not experience any
    significant labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of its
    facilities.

Regional
    Business Descriptions

NRG is organized into business units as described below, with
    each of the Company’s core regions operating as a separate
    business segment. As of December 31, 2006, NRG realigned
    the Company’s segment structure. For a further discussion
    on the realignment of the Company’s operating segments and
    for financial information on NRG’s operations by segment,
    see Item 15 — Note 17,

    Reporting

, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

TEXAS

NRG’s largest business unit is located in Texas and is
    comprised of investments in generation facilities located in the
    physical control areas of the ERCOT market. These assets were
    acquired on February 2, 2006 as part of the acquisition of
    Texas Genco LLC.



Operating
    Strategy

The Company’s business in Texas is comprised of two sets of
    assets: a regionally diverse set of three large solid-fuel
    baseload plants and a set of gas-fired plants located in and
    around Houston. NRG’s operating strategy to maximize value
    and opportunity across these assets is to (1) ensure the
    availability of the baseload plants to fulfill their commercial
    obligations under long-term forward sales contracts already in
    place, (2) manage the gas assets for profitability while
    ensuring the reliability and flexibility of power supply to the
    Houston market, (3) take advantage of the skill sets and
    market/regulatory knowledge to grow the business through
    incremental capacity uprates and repowering development of
    solid-fuel baseload and gas-fired units, and (4) play a
    leading role in the development of the ERCOT market by active
    membership and participation in market and regulatory issues.

NRG’s strategy is to sell forward a majority of its
    solid-fuel baseload capacity in the ERCOT market under long-term
    contracts or to enter into hedges by using natural gas as a
    proxy for power prices. Accordingly, the Company’s primary
    focus will be to keep these solid-fuel baseload units running
    efficiently. With respect to gas-fired assets, NRG will continue
    a dual path of contracting forward a significant portion of
    gas-fired capacity one to two years out while holding a portion
    for

back-up

in case there is an operational issue with one of the baseload
    units. For the gas-fired capacity sold forward, the Company will
    offer a range of products including where the customer has the
    right to dispatch capacity as the customer needs. For the
    gas-fired capacity that NRG will continue to sell commercially
    into the market, the Company will focus on making this capacity
    available to the market whenever it is economic to run.

The following is a description of NRG’s most significant
    revenue generating plants in the Texas region:

W.A. Parish

— NRG’s W.A. Parish plant is
    one of the largest fossil-fired plants in the United States
    based on total MWs of generation capacity. This plant’s
    power generation units include four coal-fired steam generation
    units with an aggregate generation capacity of 2,480 MW as
    of December 31, 2006. Two of these units are 650 MW
    steam units that were placed in commercial service in December
    1977 and December 1978, respectively. The other two units are
    570 MW and 610 MW steam units that were placed in
    commercial service in June 1980 and December 1982, respectively.
    All four units are serviced by two competing railroads that
    diversify NRG’s coal transportation options at competitive
    prices. Each of the four coal-fired units have
    low-NO

x

burners and SCR, installed to reduce
    NO

x

emissions and baghouses to reduce particulates. In addition,
    W.A. Parish Unit 8 has a scrubber installed to reduce
    SO


emissions. Plant uprate projects completed in 2006 uprated the
    net generation capacity of W.A. Parish by 17 MW.

Limestone

— NRG’s Limestone plant is a
    lignite and coal-fired plant located approximately
    140 miles northwest of Houston. This plant includes two
    steam generation units with an aggregate generation capacity of
    1,700 MW as of December 31, 2006. The first unit is an
    835 MW steam unit that was placed in commercial service in
    December 1985. The second unit is an 865 MW steam unit that
    was placed in commercial service in December 1986. Limestone
    primarily burns lignite from an

on-site

mine, but also burns low sulfur coal and petroleum coke. This
    serves to lower average fuel costs by eliminating fuel
    transportation costs, which can represent up to two-thirds of
    delivered fuel costs for plants of this type. NRG owns the
    mining equipment and facilities and a portion of the lignite
    reserves located at the mine. Mining operations are conducted by
    Texas Westmoreland Coal Co., a single purpose, wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Westmoreland Coal Company and the owner of a
    substantial portion of the



remaining lignite reserves. Both units have installed
    low-NO

x

burners to reduce
    NO

x

emissions and scrubbers to reduce
    SO


emissions. In the second quarter of 2006, NRG replaced the high
    pressure and intermediate pressure turbines, rewound the
    generator and replaced the main generator

step-up

transformer of Limestone Unit 2. These upgrades increased the
    generation capacity by 86 MW.

South Texas Project Electric Generating Station, or
    STP

— STP is one of the newest and largest
    nuclear-powered generation plants in the United States based on
    total megawatts of generation capacity. This plant is located
    approximately 90 miles south of downtown Houston, near Bay
    City, Texas and consists of two generation units each
    representing approximately 1,250 MW of generation capacity.
    STP’s two generation units commenced operations in August
    1988 and June 1989, respectively. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, STP had a zero percent forced outage
    rate and a 97% net capacity factor.

STP is currently owned as a tenancy in common between NRG and
    two other co-owners. NRG owns a 44%, approximately
    1,100 MW, interest in STP, the City of San Antonio
    owns a 40% interest and the City of Austin owns the remaining
    16% interest. Each co-owner retains its undivided ownership
    interest in the two nuclear-fueled generation units and the
    electrical output from those units. Except for certain plant
    shutdown and decommissioning costs and NRC licensing
    liabilities, NRG is severally liable, but not jointly liable,
    for the expenses and liabilities of STP. The four original
    co-owners of STP organized South Texas Project Nuclear Operating
    Company, or STPNOC, to operate and maintain STP. STPNOC is
    managed by a board of directors composed of one director
    appointed by each of the three co-owners, along with the chief
    executive officer of STPNOC. STPNOC is the NRC-licensed operator
    of STP. No single owner controls STPNOC and all decisions must
    be approved by two or more owners who collectively control more
    than 60% of the interests.

The two STP generation units operate under licenses granted by
    the NRC that expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively. These
    licenses may be extended for additional

20-year

terms if the project satisfies NRC requirements. Adequate
    provisions exist for long-term

on-site

storage of spent nuclear fuel throughout the remaining life of
    the existing STP plant licenses.

Repowering
    NRG —

Texas

As part of the Company’s

Repowering NRG

program, NRG
    has identified a number of proposed projects in Texas that could
    add important generation capacity to the State. These include,
    at present, one or more Houston gas-fired generation projects
    and wind projects, a large baseload coal project, and two new
    nuclear units. These projects are designed to meet the growing
    electrical needs of the State of Texas in a pragmatic and
    environmentally responsible way. Using a balanced portfolio of
    fuels and technologies, these projects would provide Texas with
    both new baseload generation, as well as intermediate and
    peaking generation units that will follow load and provide
    ancillary services.

The following table summarizes the proposed projects currently
    included in the

Repowering NRG

program in Texas:

Cedar Bayou

— In November 2006, NRG filed for a
    permit with the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality, or
    TCEQ, to repower single and combined cycle gas units consisting
    of up to 900 MW at NRG’s Cedar Bayou facility. The
    Company expects to receive permits and interconnection studies
    during the second half of 2007.

Limestone

— NRG is proposing to repower an
    800 MW pulverized baseload coal unit at the Company’s
    Limestone facility in central Texas, referred to as Limestone-3.
    Limestone-3 would be fueled primarily by PRB coal.

STP

— NRG is proposing the addition of two
    nuclear reactors (Units 3 and 4) at the STP nuclear
    project. Commercial operations are proposed for late 2014 for
    Unit 3 and late 2015 for Unit 4. NRG has begun licensing



efforts and the Company anticipates filing a Combined Operating
    License Application with the NRC during the second half of 2007.
    NRG is proposing to use General Electric’s Advanced Boiling
    Water Reactor, or ABWR, technology, which is rated at
    approximately 1,350 MW per reactor.

Wind

— The Company has

100-300 MW

of wind projects under active development in Texas.

Market
    Framework

The ERCOT market is one of the nation’s largest and fastest
    growing power markets. It represents approximately 85% of the
    demand for power in Texas and covers the whole state, with the
    exception of the far west (El Paso), a large part of the
    Texas Panhandle and two small areas in the eastern part of the
    state. From 1994 through 2006, peak hourly demand in the ERCOT
    market grew at a compound annual rate of 3.0%, compared to a
    compound annual rate of growth of 2.1% in the United States for
    the same period. For 2006, hourly demand ranged from a low of
    20,276 MW to a high of 63,056 MW. ERCOT has limited
    interconnections compared to other markets in the United
    States — currently limited to 856 MW of
    generation capacity, and wholesale transactions within the ERCOT
    market are not subject to regulation by the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Any wholesale producer of power
    that qualifies as a power generation company under the Texas
    electric restructuring law and that can access the ERCOT
    electric power grid is allowed to sell power in the ERCOT market
    at unregulated rates.

The ERCOT market has experienced significant construction of new
    generation plants in recent years, with over 20,000 MW of
    mostly natural gas-fired combined cycle generation capacity
    added to the market in the first half of this decade. As of
    December 31, 2006, aggregate net generation capacity of
    approximately 76,964 MW existed in the ERCOT market, of
    which 72.1% was natural gas-fired. Approximately 20,616 MW,
    or 26.7%, was lower marginal cost generation capacity such as
    coal, lignite and nuclear plants. NRG’s coal and nuclear
    fuel baseload plants represent approximately 5,280 MW, or
    26%, of the total solid fuel baseload net generation capacity in
    the ERCOT market. ERCOT has established a target equilibrium
    reserve margin level of approximately 12.5%; the reserve margin
    at December 31, 2006, was 16.4%, forecast to drop to 11.4%
    for 2008 per ERCOT’s latest Capacity Demand and
    Reserve Report. With the exception of wind generation units,
    there has been very little generation that has come online since
    2004, and the Company expects reserve margins to decrease
    through 2010 primarily due to load growth. Many new projects
    have been announced that if materialized would begin to increase
    the reserve margin after 2010.

In the ERCOT market, buyers and sellers enter into bilateral
    wholesale capacity, power and ancillary services contracts or
    may participate in the centralized ancillary services market,
    including balancing energy, which ERCOT administers. An
    October 1, 2005

“Report on Existing and Potential
    Electric System Constraints and Needs”

found that
    natural gas-fired power plants set the market price of power
    more than 90% of the time in the ERCOT market. As a result of
    NRG’s lower marginal cost for baseload coal and nuclear
    generation assets, the Company expects these ERCOT assets to
    generate power nearly 100% of the time they are available.

The ERCOT market is currently divided into four regions or
    congestion zones, namely: North, Houston, South and West, which
    reflect transmission constraints that are commercially
    significant and which have limits as to the amount of power that
    can flow across zones. NRG’s W. A. Parish plant and all its
    natural gas-fired plants are located in the Houston zone.
    NRG’s Limestone plant is located in the North zone with STP
    located in the South zone.

The ERCOT market operates under the reliability standards set by
    the North American Electric Reliability Council, or NERC. The
    PUCT has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure
    the adequacy and reliability of power supply across Texas’s
    main interconnected power transmission grid. ERCOT is
    responsible for facilitating reliable operations of the bulk
    electric power supply system in the ERCOT market. Its
    responsibilities include ensuring that power production and
    delivery are accurately accounted for among the generation
    resources and wholesale buyers and sellers. Unlike power pools
    with independent operators in other regions of the country, the
    ERCOT market is not a centrally dispatched power pool and ERCOT
    does not procure power on behalf of its members other than to
    maintain the reliable operations of the transmission system.
    ERCOT also serves as an agent for procuring ancillary services
    for those who elect not to provide their own ancillary services.

Power sales or purchases from one location to another may be
    constrained by the power transfer capability between locations.
    Under current ERCOT protocol, the commercially significant
    constraints and the transfer



capabilities along these paths are reassessed every year and
    congestion costs are directly assigned to those parties causing
    the congestion. This has the potential to increase power
    generators’ exposure to the congestion costs associated
    with transferring power between zones.

The PUCT has adopted a rule directing ERCOT to develop and
    implement a wholesale market design that, among other things,
    includes a day ahead energy market and replaces the existing
    zonal wholesale market design with a nodal market design that is
    based on locational marginal prices for power. See also,

Regional Regulatory Developments — Texas
    Region.

One of the stated purposes of the proposed market
    restructuring is to reduce local (intra-zonal) transmission
    congestion costs. The market redesign project is expected to
    take effect in late 2008. NRG expects that implementation of any
    new market design will require modifications to its existing
    procedures and systems. Although NRG does not expect the
    Company’s competitive position in the ERCOT market to be
    materially adversely affected by the proposed market
    restructuring, the Company does not know for certain how the
    planned market restructuring will affect its revenues, and some
    of NRG’s plants in ERCOT may experience adverse pricing
    effects due to their location on the transmission grid.

NORTHEAST

NRG’s second largest asset base is located in the Northeast
    region of the United States and is comprised of investments in
    generation facilities primarily located in the physical control
    areas of NYISO, the ISO-NE and PJM.

Operating
    Strategy

The Northeast region’s strategy is focused on optimizing
    the value of NRG’s broad and varied generation portfolio in
    the three interconnected and actively traded competitive
    markets: the NYISO, the ISO-NE and the PJM. In the Northeast
    markets, load-serving entities generally lack their own
    generation capacity, with much of the generation base aging and
    the current ownership of the generation highly disaggregated.
    Thus, commodity prices are more volatile on an as-delivered
    basis than in other NRG regions due to the distance and
    occasional physical constraints that impact the delivery of fuel
    into the region. In this environment, NRG seeks both to enhance
    its ability to be the low cost wholesale generator capable of
    delivering wholesale power to load centers within the region
    from multiple locations using multiple fuel sources, and to be
    properly compensated for delivering such wholesale power and
    related services. The generation performance by fuel-type for
    the recent three-year period is as shown below:

NRG is focused on capturing the locational value of its plants
    that are located in or near load centers and inside chronic
    transmission constraints, in order to improve the economic
    rationale for repowering of those sites. NRG does this primarily
    through the advocacy of capacity market reforms. The Company has
    seen some success in these efforts with the start of the
    Locational Forward Reserve Markets, or LFRM, in the New England
    Power Pool, or NEPOOL, which, were effective October 1,
    2006, and, in addition, with the start of transition capacity
    payments which were effective December 1, 2006, together
    acting as a prelude to the full implementation of the Forward
    Capacity Market, or FCM, which begins June 1, 2010.
    Further, on December 22, 2006, FERC approved a settlement
    regarding PJM’s reliability pricing model, or RPM,
    effective June 1, 2007.

RMR Agreements

— Several of the Northeast
    region’s Connecticut assets are located in
    transmission-constrained load pockets and have been designated
    as required to be available to ISO-NE to ensure reliability.
    These assets are subject to reliability must-run, or RMR,
    agreements, which are contracts under which NRG agrees to
    maintain its facilities to be available to run when needed, and
    are paid to provide these capability services based on the
    Company’s costs. During 2006, Middletown, Montville and
    Devon were covered by an RMR agreement.



Effective January 1, 2007, the region’s Devon plant is
    no longer covered by an RMR agreement but operates now on a
    merchant basis. On January 12, 2007, FERC approved the
    ISO-NE request to eliminate Peaking Unit Safe Harbor, or PUSH,
    bidding effective June 19, 2007. This decision adversely
    impacts the value of generation from the Norwalk Harbor plant.
    NRG anticipates that it will file for an RMR agreement for this
    plant to be effective upon the elimination of PUSH bidding. To
    that end, NRG has received a determination letter from ISO-NE
    that this plant is needed for reliability service.

Generation
    Facilities

As of December 31, 2006, NRG’s generation facilities
    in the Northeast region consisted of approximately 7,240 MW
    of generation capacity, including assets located in transmission
    constrained areas, such as in-city New York
    City — 1,415 MW and southwest
    Connecticut — 535 MW.

The following is a description of NRG’s most significant
    revenue generating plants in the Northeast region:

Arthur Kill

— NRG’s Arthur Kill plant is a
    natural gas-fired power plant consisting of three units and is
    located on the west side of Staten Island, New York. The plant
    produces an aggregate generation capacity of 865 MW from
    two intermediate load units (Units 20 and 30) and one peak
    load unit (Unit GT-1). Unit 20 produces an aggregate generation
    capacity of 350 MW and was installed in 1959. Unit 30
    produces an aggregate generation capacity of 500 MW and was
    installed in 1969. Both Unit 20 and Unit 30 were converted from
    coal-fired to natural gas-fired facilities in the early 1990s.
    Unit GT-1 produces an aggregate generation capacity of
    15 MW and is activated when ConEd issues a maximum
    generation alarm on hot days and during thunderstorms.

Astoria Gas Turbine

— Located in Astoria,
    Queens, New York, the NRG Astoria Gas Turbine facility occupies
    approximately 15 acres within the greater Astoria
    Generating complex which includes several competing generating
    facilities. NRG’s Astoria Gas Turbine facility has an
    aggregate generation capacity of approximately 550 MW from
    19 operational combustion turbine generators classified into
    three types of turbines. The first group consists of 12
    gas-fired Pratt & Whitney GG-4 Twin Packs in
    Buildings 2, 3 and 4, which have a net generating
    capacity of 145 MW per building. The second group consists
    of Westinghouse Industrial Combustion



Turbines #191A in Buildings 5, 7 and 8 that fire on
    liquid distillate with a net generating capacity of
    approximately 12 MW per building. The third group consists
    of Westinghouse Industrial Gas Turbines #251GG located in
    Buildings 10, 11, 12 and 13 and fired on liquid distillate
    with a net generation capacity of 20 MW per building. The
    Astoria units also supply Black Start Service to the NYISO. The
    site also contains tankage for distillate fuel with a capacity
    of 86,000 barrels.

Dunkirk

— The Dunkirk plant is a coal-fired
    plant located on Lake Erie in Dunkirk, New York. This plant
    produces an aggregate generation capacity of 585 MW from
    four baseload units. Units 1 and 2 produce up to 95 MW each
    and were put in service in 1950, and Units 3 and 4 produce
    approximately 195 MW each and were put in service in 1959
    and 1960, respectively. In the spring of 2006, the plant
    completed changes to switch from eastern bituminous coal to low
    sulfur PRB coal in order to comply with various federal and
    state emissions standards, as well as the New York Department of
    Environmental Conservation, or NYSDEC, settlement referred to in
    the following paragraph.

Huntley

— The Huntley plant is a coal-fired
    plant consisting of six units and is located in Tonawanda, New
    York, approximately three miles north of Buffalo. The plant has
    a generation capacity of 550 MW from two intermediate load
    units (Units 65 and 66) and two baseload units (Units 67
    and 68). Units 67 and 68 generate a net capacity of
    approximately 190 MW each, and were put in service in 1957
    and 1958, respectively. Units 65 and 66 generate a net capacity
    of 85 MW each and were put in service between 1942 and
    1954. Units 63 and 64 are inactive and were officially retired
    in May 2006. On November 30, 2006, NRG gave notice to the
    New York Department of Public Service of the Company’s
    intent to retire Units 65 and 66 effective June 3, 2007
    pursuant to a settlement agreement reached with NYSDEC in
    January 2005. Per that agreement, NRG will reduce
    NO

x

and
    SO


emissions from the Company’s Huntley and Dunkirk plants
    through 2013 in the aggregate by over 8,090 lbs and 8,690 lbs,
    respectively. A large portion of these reductions will be
    achieved by switching to low sulfur western coal and related
    projects for which NRG has already expended or committed
    significant capital.

Indian River

— The Indian River Power plant is
    a coal-fired plant located in southern Delaware on a
    1,170 acre site. The plant consists of four coal-fired
    steam electric units, Units 1 through 4 and one 15 MW
    combustion turbine, bringing total plant capacity to
    approximately 780 MW. Units 1 and 2 are each 80 MW of
    capacity and were placed in service in 1957 and 1959,
    respectively. Unit 3 is 165 MW of capacity and was placed
    in service in 1970, while Unit 4 is 440 MW of capacity
    and was placed in service in 1980. Units 3 and 4 are equipped
    with SNCR systems, for the reduction of
    NO

x

emissions. All four units are equipped with electrostatic
    precipitators to remove fly ash from the flue gases as well as
    low
    NO

x

burners with over fired air to control
    NO

x

emissions. Units 1, 2 and 3 combust eastern bituminous
    coal, while Unit 4 is fueled with low sulfur compliance coal.

Repowering
    NRG —

Northeast
    Region

The

Repowering NRG

program in the Northeast is focused on
    developing the region’s existing facilities, including
    using IGCC technology and coal in New York and Delaware, in
    addition to using combined cycle gas turbines and gas peakers
    (some with dual fuel capability on oil) in the region.

Huntley

— In December 2006, NRG won a
    conditional award in a competitive bid process with the New York
    Power Authority, or NYPA, to build a 600 MW IGCC plant at
    the Company’s Huntley facility. The bid included selling
    capacity and energy to NYPA under a long term PPA. As part of
    the conditional award, NYPA entered into a strategic alliance
    with NRG to pursue support from federal, state and local
    programs in order to close the perceived pricing gap between
    NRG’s proposal and NYPA’s requirements, while
    preserving the material benefits of NRG’s



proposal relating to innovative clean coal power generation,
    including
    CO


capture and geologic sequestration plans.

Indian River

— NRG also submitted a bid in
    December 2006 for the development of a similar IGCC plant at the
    Company’s Indian River facility in response to a Request
    for Proposals, or RFP, issued by Delmarva Power and Light.
    NRG’s bid proposed a 400 MW long term PPA for energy
    and capacity from the IGCC facility. The bid is currently under
    review and a formal award decision is scheduled to occur in the
    second quarter of 2007. If the bid is accepted, NRG expects to
    negotiate the terms of the PPA and obtain regulatory approval by
    the middle of 2007.

Connecticut

— In December 2006, NRG submitted
    bids to repower a number of its existing facilities in
    Connecticut, in response to the State of Connecticut’s RFP
    process. The bids included separate proposals offering a total
    of approximately 1,000 MW of new capacity. The largest
    proposal includes a 630 MW combined cycle unit at the
    Company’s Montville site. The project covered by this
    proposal, if accepted, could be converted to an IGCC plant at a
    later date in response to any state energy and environmental
    policy objectives requiring baseload capacity that utilizes a
    plentiful domestic fuel source, such as coal. In addition, this
    conversion has the potential to bring material environmental
    benefits to the State of Connecticut, including the ability to
    capture and potentially sequester
    CO


.
    NRG has also submitted bids for a new gas-fired peaking capacity
    at the Company’s Middletown and Devon sites.

Market
    Framework

Although each of the three Northeast ISOs and their respective
    energy markets are functionally, administratively and
    operationally independent, they all follow, to a certain extent,
    similar market designs. Each ISO dispatches power plants to meet
    system energy and reliability needs, and settles physical power
    deliveries at Locational Marginal Prices, or LMPs, which reflect
    the value of energy at a specific location at the specific time
    it is delivered. This value is determined by an ISO-administered
    auction process, which evaluates and selects the least costly
    supplier offers or bids to create a reliable and least-cost
    dispatch. The ISO-sponsored LMP energy markets consist of two
    separate and characteristically distinct settlement time frames.
    The first is a security-constrained, financially firm, day-ahead
    unit commitment market. The second is a security-constrained,
    financially settled, real-time dispatch and balancing market.
    Prices paid in these LMP energy markets, however, are affected
    by, among other things, market mitigation measures, which can
    result in lower prices associated with certain generating units
    that are mitigated because they are deemed to have locational
    market power, and by $1,000/MWh energy market price caps that
    are in place in all three northeast ISOs.

In addition to energy delivery, the ISOs manage secondary
    markets for installed capacity, ancillary services and financial
    transmission rights. All of the three Northeast ISOs have
    realized, however, that they are not capable of supporting
    needed investment in new generation without well designed
    capacity and ancillary service markets. NYISO’s capacity
    market was the first to receive approval of its proposed demand
    curve and locational capacity reforms (which are intended to
    better reflect locational values of capacity resources). ISO-NE
    and PJM are in the process of implementing their respective
    versions of reformed capacity markets, namely, a forward
    capacity market, or FCM, in ISO-NE, and a reliability pricing
    model, or RPM, proposal in PJM. ISO-NE has instituted a
    transitional payment for capacity starting December 1,
    2006, which starts at a price of

$3.05/kW-month

and gradually rises to

$4.10/kW-month

through June 1, 2010, when the FCM market takes effect. In
    addition, ISO-NE instituted its LFRM market effective
    October 1, 2006 which provides a capacity payment for
    qualifying quick start units. NRG bid and was awarded
    292 MW of LFRM capacity in the first auction which cleared
    at the capped rate of

$14/kW-month.

As indicated above, FERC approved a settlement of the PJM RPM
    market which will be effective June 1, 2007. For a further
    discussion, see Item 15 — Note 22

    Statements.

SOUTH
    CENTRAL

As of December 31, 2006, NRG owned approximately
    2,850 MW of generating capacity in the South Central region
    of the United States. The region lacks a regional transmission
    organization or ISO and, therefore, remains a bilateral market,
    making it less efficient than a region with an ISO-administered
    energy market using large scale economic dispatch, such as the
    Northeast region. NRG operates the LaGen Control Area which
    encompasses the generating facilities and the Company’s
    cooperative load. As a result, the LaGen control area is capable
    of



providing control area services, in addition to wholesale power,
    that allows NRG to provide full requirement services to
    load-serving entities, thus making the LaGen Control Area a
    competitive alternative to the integrated utilities operating in
    the region.

Operating
    Strategy

NRG’s South Central region seeks to capitalize on two
    factors: (1) its position as a significant coal-fired
    generator in a market that is highly dependent on natural gas
    for power generation, and (2) its long-term contractual and
    historical service relationship with eleven rural cooperatives
    around Louisiana. NRG’s South Central region works with its
    cooperative customers to improve contract administration, to
    expand their and the Company’s customer bases on terms
    advantageous to all parties and, in some cases, to modify the
    terms of the Company’s contracts with respect to its
    current or new customers.

Big Cajun II

— NRG’s Big
    Cajun II plant is a coal-fired,

sub-critical

baseload plant located along the banks of the Mississippi River,
    near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. This plant includes three
    coal-fired generation units (Units 1, 2 and 3) with an
    aggregate generation capacity of 1,730 MW as of
    December 31, 2006, and generation capacity per unit of
    580 MW, 575 MW and 575 MW, respectively. The
    plant uses coal supplied from the Powder River Basin and was
    commissioned between 1981 and 1983. NRG owns 100% of Units 1 and
    2 and a 58% undivided interest in Unit 3 for an aggregate
    owned capacity of 1,490 MW of the plant. All three units
    have been upgraded with low
    NO

x

burners and overfire air. The Unit 1 generator has recently been
    rewound and was optimized with a modern turbine/exciter control
    system. Units 2 and 3 are planned for generator rewinds,
    turbine/exciter control replacements and



additional neural net systems in future years. These efficiency
    improvements are expected to cost approximately $30 million.

Repowering
    NRG

—
    South Central Region

The region’s

Repowering NRG

strategy is focused on
    expanding generation capacity at the Company’s Big Cajun
    facilities, using coal and petcoke as fuel for the plants under
    best available control technology.

— Unit 4 — The
    Company continues the development of a new 775 MW super
    critical coal-fired generating unit at its Big Cajun II
    facility. On April 28, 2006, NRG filed an application with
    the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, or LADEQ, to
    modify the existing permit to allow the Big Cajun II Unit 4
    to utilize bituminous, in addition to

sub-bituminous,

coal. NRG has also entered into project development agreements
    with potential equity partners for certain ownership interests
    in Unit 4. However, NRG cannot predict the outcome of its
    application for the issuance of the modified permit at this time.

Big Cajun I

— On May 26, 2006, NRG filed
    with LADEQ a request for an air permit for the addition of a
    230 MW facility at the Company’s Big Cajun I facility.
    This proposed facility will have the ability to utilize
    petroleum coke, coal, or biomass as its fuel source.

Market
    Framework

NRG’s assets in the South Central region are located within
    the franchise territories of vertically integrated utilities,
    primarily Entergy Corp., or Entergy. Entergy performs the
    scheduling, reserve and reliability functions that are
    administered by the ISOs in certain other regions of the United
    States and Canada. Although the reliability functions performed
    are essentially the same, the primary differences between these
    markets lie in the physical delivery and price discovery
    mechanisms. In the South Central region, all power sales and
    purchases are consummated bilaterally between individual
    counterparties. Transacting counterparties are required to
    reserve and purchase transmission services from the relevant
    transmission owners at their FERC-approved tariff rates.
    Included with these transmission services are the reserve and
    ancillary costs.

As of December 31, 2006, NRG had long-term all-requirements
    contracts with eleven Louisiana distribution cooperatives with
    initial terms ranging from five to twenty-five years. The region
    had seven contracts that expire in 2025, with the remaining four
    contracts expiring between 2009 and 2014. In addition, NRG also
    has certain long-term contracts with the Municipal Energy
    Authority of Mississippi, South Mississippi Electric Power
    Association, and Southwestern Electric Power Company, which
    collectively comprise an additional 13% of region’s
    contract load requirement.

During peak demand periods, NRG’s Big Cajun II assets
    are insufficient to serve the requirements of the customers
    under these contracts, and at such times NRG typically purchases
    power from other power producers in the region, frequently at
    higher prices than can be recovered under the Company’s
    contracts. As the loads of the region’s customers grow, the
    Company can expect this imbalance to worsen, unless NRG is
    successful in renegotiating the terms of these long-term
    contracts. NRG has been successful in negotiating contract
    modifications with several of the region’s long-term
    cooperative customers, which has prevented the addition of large
    industrial or municipal loads at the contract rates. Also, to
    minimize this risk during the peak summer and winter seasons,
    the Company has been successful in entering into tolling
    agreements, which effectively reduce the need for spot market
    purchases.



WEST

NRG’s portfolio in the West region currently consists of
    the El Segundo Generating Station, the Encina Generating Station
    and 13 combustion turbines with total generation capacity of
    approximately 1,965 MW. On March 31, 2006, NRG
    purchased Dynegy Inc’s 50% ownership interest in WCP and
    became the sole owner of the WCP assets. In addition, NRG owns a
    50% interest in the Saguaro power plant located in Nevada. On
    January 3, 2007, NRG sold the Red Bluff and the
    Chowchilla II power plants to Wayzata Investment Partners
    LLC.

Operating
    Strategy

NRG’s West region strategy is focused on maximizing the
    cash flow and value associated with its generating plants while
    protecting and potentially realizing the commercial value of the
    underlying real estate. There are three principal components to
    this strategy: (1) responding to expected market demand,
    initially in load serving entity RFOs and eventually into a
    capacity market, and (2) using existing emission credits to
    permit new more efficient generating units at existing sites or
    siting plants at less valuable property and optimizing the value
    of the region’s coastal property for other purposes.

The Company’s Encina Station has sold all energy and
    capacity, 965 MW, in the aggregate, to SDG&E through
    2009, on a tolling basis, and recovers its operating costs plus
    a capacity payment. The El Segundo Station has sold all energy
    and capacity, 670 MW, in the aggregate, to a load-serving
    entity through April 30, 2008, on a tolling basis, and
    recovers its operating costs plus a capacity payment. The
    San Diego Combustion Turbines, 190 MW, in the
    aggregate, are subject to an RMR agreement with the CAISO
    through calendar year 2007, on a tolling basis, and recover
    their costs plus a return of investment.

The Saguaro power plant is located in Henderson, Nevada, and is
    contracted to Nevada Power and two steam hosts. The Saguaro
    plant is contracted to Nevada Power through 2022, one steam
    host, referred to as Pioneer, whose contract expires in 2007,
    with a negotiated renewal, and a steam off taker, Ocean Spray,
    whose contract runs through 2015. Saguaro Power Company, LP, the
    project company, procures fuel in the open market. NRG manages
    its share of any fuel price risk through NRG’s commodity
    price risk strategy.

Encina

— The Encina Station is located in
    Carlsbad, California and has a combined generating capacity of
    965 MW from five fossil-fuel steam-electric generating
    units and one combustion turbine. The five fossil-fuel
    steam-electric units provide intermediate load services and
    primarily use natural gas but also maintain dual fuel
    capability. Dual fuel capability allows the units to use oil for
    emergency reliability backup only under a gas supply force
    majeure conditions. Also located at the Encina Station is a
    combustion turbine that provides peaking services



of 15 MW. Units 1, 2 and 3 each have a generation
    capacity of approximately 107 MW and were installed in
    1954, 1956 and 1958, respectively. Units 4 and 5 have a
    generation capacity of approximately 300 MW and 330 MW
    respectively, and were installed in 1973 and 1978. The
    combustion turbine was installed in 1966. Units 1, 2 and 3
    are projected to be retired after 2010. Low
    NO

x

burner modifications and SCR equipment has been installed on
    Units 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

El Segundo

— The El Segundo plant is located in
    El Segundo, California and produces an aggregate generation
    capacity of 670 MW from two gas-fired intermediate load
    units (Units 3 and 4). These units, which have a generation
    capacity of 335 MW each, were installed in 1964 and 1965,
    respectively. SCR equipment has been installed on Units 3 and 4.

Repowering
    NRG —

West

strategy is focused on
    the construction of new capacity to meet increasing local
    requirements using natural gas at the Company’s existing
    facilities, as well as the development of potential wind
    projects through the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
    Padoma Wind Power, LLC.

    Beach, California. The PPA term commences August 1, 2007
    and continues for ten years.

El Segundo 1& 2 Repower Project

— NRG has
    permits from the California Energy Commission and Air District
    to construct a new gas-fired combined cycle plant at the
    Company’s El Segundo facility to replace the retired units
    at the site. NRG anticipates seeking amendments to these permits
    to substitute equipment that will not require the use of
    once-through sea water cooling. The reconfigured project is
    included in a load-serving entity’s RFO process which is
    scheduled to announce PPA contract awards for new capacity in
    early 2008.

In addition, the Company has submitted bids to one of the
    load-serving entities for two more projects in the West region.
    The Company expects to know the outcome of these bids sometime
    during the second half of 2007.

Market
    Framework

NRG’s assets in the West region consist primarily of older,
    higher heat rate, gas-fired plants in southern California. These
    plants, while older and less efficient than newer combined cycle
    plants, are under tolling agreements for 2007. CAISO has
    designated all of the units comprising El Segundo, Encina and
    Cabrillo II to be capacity that meets the local capacity
    procurement requirements of the local load-serving entities. At
    times, all of the plants have been designated as RMR, which
    entitles designated plants to certain fixed-cost payments from
    the CAISO for the right to dispatch those units during periods
    of locational constraints. Currently, the El Segundo unit does
    not have an RMR agreement with CAISO, but has been designated as
    a local capacity resource in the Western Los Angeles area and
    has a tolling agreement for its full capacity with a local major
    utility for the period May 1, 2006 through April 30,
    2008. All units at Encina and Cabrillo II have been
    designated as local capacity resources for the San Diego
    load pocket and were designated as RMR units for 2007. Per the
    RMR agreement, CAISO has an option to renew those units for RMR
    service into 2008. Encina has a tolling agreement for its full
    capacity with SDG&E for the period January 1, 2007
    through December 31, 2009.



INTERNATIONAL

As of December 31, 2006, NRG, through certain foreign
    subsidiaries, had investments in power generation projects
    located in Australia, Germany and Brazil with approximately
    1,235 MW of total generating capacity. In addition, NRG
    owns interests in coal mines located in Germany. The
    Company’s strategy is to maximize its return on investment
    and therefore concentrates on contract management; monitoring of
    its facility operators to ensure safe, profitable and
    sustainable operations; management of cash flow and finances;
    and growth of its businesses through investments in projects
    related to current businesses.

— On June 8, 2006, NRG announced
    the sale of the Company’s 37.5% equity interest in the
    Gladstone power station, or Gladstone, and its associated 100%
    owned NRG Gladstone Operating Services to Transfield Services,
    an Australia-based provider of operations, maintenance,
    ownership and asset management services for a purchase price of
    approximately $189 million (AU$239 million) subject to
    customary purchase price adjustments, plus assumption of
    NRG’s share of Gladstone’s unconsolidated debt and
    cash of approximately $61 million (AU$77 million) and
    approximately $28 million (AU$35 million),
    respectively. After-tax cash proceeds are expected to be in
    excess of $185 million (AU$234 million). The sale is
    pending until NRG satisfies certain conditions, particularly the
    securing of certain consents and waivers from the other owners
    of the project, or agrees to complete the sale on alternative
    terms. NRG is seeking to close the transaction in 2007.

Germany

— NRG’s interests in Germany
    include a 50% equity interest in MIBRAG, which mines
    approximately 20 million metric tons of lignite per year
    and owns 150 MW of electric generation capacity, and a
    41.9% equity interest in Schkopau, a 900 MW generating
    plant fueled with lignite from MIBRAG. NRG does not have direct
    operational control of either of these facilities.

Approximately 89% of MIBRAG’s revenues are generated from
    lignite sales. MIBRAG’s generation capacity comprises three
    plants, 40% of whose output is used to power MIBRAG’s
    mining operations and the balance sold under contract to EnviaM,
    the local distribution utility. NRG, through its wholly-owned
    subsidiary Saale Energie Gesellschaft, or SEG, owns 400 MW
    of the Schkopau plant’s electric capacity which is sold
    under a long term contract to Vattenfall Europe Generation.

Brazil

— NRG owns a 155 MW hydro-electric
    power plant located in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. NRG
    currently has a 99.2% interest in the plant.

THERMAL

Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NRG Thermal LLC, or NRG
    Thermal, the Company owns thermal and chilled water businesses
    that have a steam and chilled water capacity of approximately
    1,230 megawatt thermal equivalents, or MWt. As of
    December 31, 2006, NRG Thermal provided steam heating to
    approximately 550 customers and chilled water to 95
    customers in five different cities in the United States. The
    Company’s thermal businesses in Pittsburgh, Harrisburg and
    San Francisco are regulated by their respective state
    Public Utility Commission. The other thermal businesses are
    subject to the terms of the contract with the off-takers. In
    addition, NRG Thermal owns and operates three thermal projects
    that serve industrial and government customers with
    high-pressure steam and hot water. NRG Thermal also owns a
    90 MW combustion turbine peaking generation facility and a
    12 MW coal-fired cogeneration facility in Dover, Delaware
    as well as a 16 MW gas-fired project in



Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Approximately 40% of NRG
    Thermal’s revenues are derived from its district heating
    and chilled water business in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Regulatory
    Matters

As operators of power plants and participants in wholesale
    energy markets, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation
    by various federal and state government agencies. These include
    CFTC, FERC, NRC, PUCT and other public utility commissions in
    certain states where NRG’s generating assets are located.
    In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures, and
    protocols of the various ISO markets in which it participates.

The operations of, and wholesale electric sales from, NRG’s
    Texas region are not subject to regulation by FERC, as they are
    deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in
    interstate commerce. As discussed below, these operations are
    subject to regulation by PUCT, as well as to regulation by the
    NRC with respect to the Company’s ownership interest in STP.

Commodities
    Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC

CFTC, among other things, has regulatory oversight authority
    over the trading of electricity and gas commodities, including
    financial products and derivatives, under the Commodity Exchange
    Act, or CEA. Specifically, under existing statutory authority,
    CFTC has the authority to commence enforcement actions and seek
    injunctive relief against any person, whenever that person
    appears to be engaged in the communication of false or
    misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market
    information or conditions that affected or tended to affect the
    price of natural gas, a commodity in interstate commerce, or
    actions intended to or attempting to manipulate commodity
    markets. CFTC also has the authority to seek civil monetary
    penalties, as well as the ability to make referrals to the
    Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, in connection
    with any conduct that violates the CEA. Proposals are pending in
    Congress to expand CFTC oversight of the

over-the-counter

markets and bilateral financial transactions.

Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission

FERC, among other things, regulates the transmission and the
    wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the
    authority of the Federal Power Act, or FPA. In addition, under
    existing regulations, FERC determines whether an entity owning a
    generation facility is an Exempt Wholesale Generator, or EWG, as
    defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, or
    PUHCA of 2005. FERC also determines whether a generation
    facility meets the ownership and technical criteria of a
    Qualifying Facility, or QF, under Public Utility Regulatory
    Policies Act of 1978, or PURPA. Each of NRG’s
    U.S. generating facilities has either been determined by
    FERC to qualify as a QF, or the subsidiary owning the facility
    has been determined to be a EWG.

Federal Power Act

— The FPA gives FERC
    exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over the wholesale sale of
    electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate
    commerce. Under the FPA, FERC, with certain exceptions,
    regulates the owners of facilities used for the wholesale sale
    of electricity or transmission in interstate commerce as public
    utilities. The FPA also gives FERC jurisdiction to review
    certain transactions and numerous other activities of public
    utilities. NRG’s QFs are currently exempt from the
    FERC’s rate regulation under Sections 205 and 206 of
    the FPA to the extent that sales are made pursuant to a state
    regulatory authority’s implementation of PURPA.

Public utilities under the FPA are required to obtain
    FERC’s acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA,
    of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity.
    All of NRG’s non-QF generating and power marketing
    companies in the United States make sales of electricity
    pursuant to market-based rates authorized by FERC. FERC’s
    orders that grant NRG’s generating and power marketing
    companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to
    revoke or revise that authority if FERC subsequently determines
    that NRG can exercise market power, create barriers to entry, or
    engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition,
    NRG’s market-based sales are subject to certain market
    behavior rules and, if any of its generating or power marketing
    companies were deemed to have violated any one of those rules,
    they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits
    associated with the violation

and/or

suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority,
    as well as criminal and civil penalties. As a condition to the
    orders granting NRG market-based rate authority, every three
    years NRG is required to file a market update to demonstrate
    that it continues to meet FERC’s standards with respect to
    generating market



power and other criteria used to evaluate whether entities
    qualify for market-based rates. NRG is also required to report
    to FERC any material changes in status that would reflect a
    departure from the characteristics that FERC relied upon when
    granting NRG’s various generating and power marketing
    companies’ market-based rates. If NRG’s generating and
    power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate
    authority, such companies would be required to obtain
    FERC’s acceptance of a

cost-of-service

rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting,
    record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on
    utilities with cost-based rate schedules.

Section 203 of the FPA requires FERC’s prior approval
    for the transfer of control of assets subject to FERC’s
    jurisdiction. Section 204 of the FPA gives FERC
    jurisdiction over a public utility’s issuance of securities
    or assumption of liabilities. However, FERC typically grants
    blanket approval for future securities issuances and the
    assumption of liabilities to entities with market-based rate
    authority. In the event that one of NRG’s generating and
    power marketing companies were to lose its market-based rate
    authority, such company’s future securities issuances or
    assumption of liabilities could require prior approval from FERC.

In compliance with Section 215 of the Energy Policy Act of
    2005, or EPAct of 2005, FERC has approved the North American
    Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, as the national
    Energy Reliability Organization, or ERO. As the ERO, NERC will
    be responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory
    reliability standards for the wholesale electric power system.
    NRG is responsible for complying with the standards in the
    regions in which it operates. The ERO will have the ability to
    assess financial penalties for non-compliance beginning in June
    2007.

Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005

—
    PUHCA of 2005 provides FERC with certain authority over and
    access to books and records of public utility holding companies
    not otherwise exempt by virtue of their ownership of EWGs, QFs,
    and Foreign Utility Companies, or FUCOs. NRG is a public utility
    holding company, but because all of the Company’s
    generating facilities have QF status or are owned through EWGs
    or FUCOs, it is exempt from the accounting, record retention,
    and reporting requirements of PUHCA.

Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act

— PURPA
    was passed in 1978 in large part to promote increased energy
    efficiency and development of independent power producers. PURPA
    created QFs to further both goals, and FERC is primarily charged
    with administering PURPA as it applies to QFs. As discussed
    above, under current law, some categories of QFs may be exempt
    from regulation under the FPA as public utilities. PURPA
    incentives also initially included a requirement that utilities
    must buy and sell power to QFs. Among other things, EPAct of
    2005 provides for the elimination of the obligation imposed on
    certain utilities to purchase power from QFs at an avoided cost
    rate under certain conditions. However, the purchase obligation
    is only eliminated if FERC first finds that a QF has
    non-discriminatory access to wholesale energy markets having
    certain characteristics, including nondiscriminatory
    transmission and interconnection services provided by a regional
    transmission entity in certain circumstances. Existing contracts
    entered into under PURPA are not expected to be impacted;
    however, certain of NRG’s QFs currently interconnect into
    markets that may meet the qualifications for elimination of the
    PURPA purchase requirement. If the obligation to purchase from
    some or all of NRG’s QFs is terminated, NRG will need to
    find alternative purchasers for the output of these QFs once
    their current contracts expire. Such alternative purchases will
    be at prevailing market rates, which may not be as favorable as
    the terms of NRG’s PURPA sales arrangements under existing
    contracts and thus may diminish the value of the Company’s
    QFs. In addition, under FERC regulations for implementing EPAct
    of 2005, QFs not making sales pursuant to state-approved avoided
    cost rates will become subject to FERC’s ratemaking
    authority under the FPA and be required to obtain market rate
    authority in order to be allowed to sell power at market-based
    rates.

Nuclear
    Regulatory Commission, or NRC

The NRC is authorized under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
    amended, or the AEA, among other things, to grant licenses for,
    and regulate the operation of, commercial nuclear power
    reactors. As a holder of an ownership interest in STP, NRG is an
    NRC licensee and is subject to NRC regulation. The NRC license
    gives the Company the right to only possess an interest in STP
    but not to operate it. Operating authority under the NRC
    operating license for STP is held by STPNOC. NRC regulation
    involves licensing, inspection, enforcement, testing,
    evaluation, and modification of all aspects of plant design and
    operation including the right to order a plant shutdown,
    technical and financial qualifications, and decommissioning
    funding assurance in light of NRC safety and environmental



requirements. In addition, NRC’s written approval is
    required prior to a licensee transferring an interest in its
    license, either directly or indirectly. As a possession-only
    licensee, i.e., non-operating co-owner, the NRC’s
    regulation of NRG is primarily focused on the Company’s
    ability to meet its financial and decommissioning funding
    assurance obligations. In connection with the NRC license, the
    Company and its subsidiaries have a support agreement to provide
    up to $120 million to support operations at STP.

Decommissioning Trusts

— Upon expiration of the
    operating terms of the operation licenses for the two generating
    units at STP, currently scheduled for 2027 and 2028, the
    co-owners of STP are required under federal law to decontaminate
    and decommission the STP facility. Under NRC regulations, a
    power reactor licensee generally must pre-fund the full amount
    of its estimated NRC decommissioning obligations unless it is a
    rate-regulated utility, or a state or municipal entity that sets
    its own rates, or has the benefit of a state-mandated
    non-bypassable charge available to periodically fund the
    decommissioning trust such that the trust, plus allowable
    earnings, will equal the estimated decommissioning obligations
    by the time the decommissioning is expected to begin.

As a result of the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, NRG through
    its 44% ownership interest has become the beneficiary of
    decommissioning trusts that have been established to provide
    funding for decontamination and decommissioning of STP.
    CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, or CenterPoint, and
    American Electric Power, or AEP, collect, through rates or other
    authorized charges to their electric utility customers, amounts
    designated for funding NRG’s portion of the decommissioning
    of the facility.

In the event that the funds from the trusts are ultimately
    determined to be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities,
    the original owners of the Company’s STP interests,
    CenterPoint and AEP, each will be required to collect, through
    their PUCT-authorized non-bypassable rates or other charges to
    customers, additional amounts required to fund NRG’s
    obligations relating to the decommissioning of the facility.
    Following the completion of the decommissioning, if surplus
    funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, any excess will be
    refunded to the respective rate payers of CenterPoint or AEP, or
    their successors.

Public
    Utility Commission of Texas, or PUCT

NRG’s Texas generation subsidiaries are registered as power
    generation companies with PUCT. PUCT also has jurisdiction over
    power generation companies with regard to the administration of
    nuclear decommissioning trusts, PUCT state-mandated capacity
    auctions, and the implementation of measures to mitigate undue
    market power that a power generation company may have and to
    remedy market power abuses in the ERCOT market and, indirectly,
    through oversight of ERCOT. PMI is registered as a power
    marketer with the PUCT and thus is also subject to the
    jurisdiction of the PUCT with respect to its sales in ERCOT.

Regional
    Regulatory Developments

In New England, New York, the Mid-Atlantic region, the Midwest
    and California, FERC has approved regional transmission
    organizations, also commonly referred to as independent system
    operators, or ISOs. Most of these ISOs administer a wholesale
    centralized bid-based spot market in their regions pursuant to
    tariffs approved by FERC and associated ISO market rules. These
    tariffs/market rules dictate how the capacity and energy markets
    operate, how market participants may make bilateral sales with
    one another, and how entities with market-based rates are
    compensated within those markets. The ISOs in these regions also
    control access to and the operation of the transmission grid
    within their regions. In Texas, pursuant to a 1999 restructuring
    statute, the PUCT has granted similar responsibilities to ERCOT.

NRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO
    regions. The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power
    markets have in the past imposed, and may in the future continue
    to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms to address
    market power or volatility in these markets. These types of
    price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may adversely
    affect the profitability of NRG’s generation facilities
    that sell capacity and energy into the wholesale power markets.
    In addition, new approaches to the sale of electric power have
    been proposed, and it is not yet clear how they will operate in
    times of market stress or whether they will provide adequate
    compensation to generators over the long term.



Texas
    Region

ERCOT has adopted “Texas Nodal Protocols” that will
    revise the wholesale market design to incorporate locational
    marginal pricing (in place of the current ERCOT zonal market).
    Major elements of the Texas Nodal Protocols include the
    continued capability for bilateral contracting of energy and
    ancillary schedules, a financially binding day-ahead market,

resource-specific

energy and ancillary service bid curves, the direct assignment
    of all congestion rents, nodal energy prices for resources,
    aggregation of nodal to zonal energy prices for loads,
    congestion revenue rights (including pre-assignment for public
    power entities), and pricing safeguards. The PUCT approved the
    Texas Nodal Protocols on April 5, 2006, and full
    implementation of the new market design is expected in December
    2008. In other rulemakings, the PUCT has expanded its
    enforcement policy, increased market oversight, and established
    market and generator-specific data disclosure requirements
    designed to increase market transparency. Certain entity
    specific data disclosure provisions have been stayed by order of
    a Texas appellate court.

Northeast
    Region

New England

— NRG’s Middletown and
    Montville facilities continue to be operated pursuant to RMR
    agreements that were accepted by the Commission on
    February 1, 2006 (effective January 1, 2006). Unless
    terminated earlier, the Middletown and Montville RMR agreements
    are expected to terminate upon the commencement of the Forward
    Capacity Market, as discussed below. The Devon RMR Agreement
    terminated on December 31, 2006.

On March 7, 2006, a broad group of New England market
    participants filed a settlement that provides for interim
    capacity transition payments for all generators in New England
    for the period starting December 1, 2006 through
    May 31, 2010, and the establishment of FCM, commencing
    June 1, 2010. The FCM established by the settlement will
    operate an annual descending clock forward capacity auction,
    normally three years in advance, and will serve as the principal
    mechanism by which

ISO-NE

will
    obtain its installed capacity requirement. For the
    Company’s Connecticut units subject to RMR agreements, any
    transition payment will be credited against the monthly
    availability payment for those units, resulting in no additional
    revenues for those units. NRG’s other New England
    generation units are eligible for the transition payments. On
    June 16, 2006, FERC issued an order accepting the
    settlement, which was reaffirmed on rehearing by order dated
    October 31, 2006. On December 28, 2006, the Attorneys
    General of the State of Connecticut and Commonwealth of
    Massachusetts filed an appeal of the FERC orders accepting the
    settlement with U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
    Interim capacity transition payments provided for under the FCM
    settlement commenced December 1, 2006, as scheduled.

On May 12, 2006, FERC issued an order accepting
    ISO-NE’s Ancillary Service Market Phase II package
    that includes a LFRM. This order was reaffirmed on rehearing on
    October 25, 2006. NRG’s quick-start units are
    well-suited to provide this service. For the eight-month winter
    period beginning October 1, 2006, the LFRM market for
    Connecticut cleared at the cap of

$14/kW-month.

NRG sold 292 MW in the LFRM auction and expects its
    participation in this market to positively contribute to
    revenues from the region.

On January 12, 2007, FERC accepted proposed amendments to
    ISO-NE’s market rules that eliminate the PUSH bidding
    mechanism effective June 19, 2007. The elimination of PUSH
    bidding will impact the Company’s Norwalk Harbor facility,
    and the Company anticipates seeking an RMR agreement for Norwalk
    Harbor Units 1 and 2.

New York

— On December 22, 2006, the NYISO
    filed proposed tariff revisions that impose additional market
    power mitigation on the current owners of its divested
    generation units in New York City, including NRG’s
    Arthur Kill and Astoria facilities. The proposed mitigation
    effectively lowers the bid cap currently set forth in the NYISO
    tariff from

$105/kW-year

to $82/kW-year. This proposal could adversely impact capacity
    revenues from these units and NRG is contesting this filing
    before FERC.

On January 5, 2007, the Executive Committee of the
    New York State Reliability Council voted to change the
    Installed Reserve Margin, or IRM, from 18% to 16.5%. This
    change, which must be approved by FERC, will become effective
    for the May 2007 through April 2008 capacity year and will
    reduce the amount of capacity that must be purchased by
    load-serving entities.



PJM

— On December 22, 2006, FERC issued an
    order approving the settlement agreement filed
    September 29, 2006, in the Reliability Pricing Model, or
    RPM, proceeding. The settlement agreement proposes to implement
    RPM, the key components of which include the determination of
    capacity prices through use of a downward-sloping demand curve,
    locational pricing, and a forward capacity market. PJM
    anticipates conducting its first auction for the

2007-08

delivery years in April 2007 and implementing the RPM capacity
    market on June 1, 2007. The RPM settlement effectively
    accepts PJM’s August 31, 2006 filing with a number of
    revisions, as set forth in the settlement and December 22,
    2006 order. NRG considers these market reforms to be a positive
    development for its assets in the region.

South
    Central Region

Entergy has begun to implement its Independent Coordinator of
    Transmission, or ICT, proposal that will provide
    (i) independent oversight over the operations of the
    Entergy transmission system, including the processing of
    interconnection and transmission requests; (ii) a new
    process and standard for assigning cost responsibility for
    transmission upgrades; and (iii) a new weekly procurement
    process that will allow both Entergy and NRG, as a purchaser of
    power, to more efficiently utilize the transmission system. The
    Southwest Power Pool has been selected as the ICT and began
    performing its responsibilities in November 2006.

Entergy’s ICT proposal will impact both the region’s
    existing operations by improving transmission access and
    competitive opportunities and the region’s development
    opportunities by administering the interconnection process.
    Certain issues regarding (i) the development of the base
    transmission plan; (ii) control over Entergy’s
    transmission models; and (iii) Entergy’s proposal to
    implement participant funding, are still being contested.

West
    Region

On December 1, 2006, NRG filed with FERC an extension of
    the existing RMR agreements for NRG’s Cabrillo
    Power I, LLC’s Encina facility, and Cabrillo
    Power II, LLC’s San Diego Jets facility for 2007,
    and to continue the existing rate effective January 1,
    2007. On January 24, 2007, FERC accepted the
    Cabrillo I filing. On January 30, 2007, FERC accepted
    the Cabrillo II filing, subject to refund, in response to
    protests filed by the CPUC and CAISO, and established settlement
    procedures. NRG has negotiated a three-year bilateral
    arrangement with SDG&E for Encina that insulates Encina from
    any revenue impact associated with the RMR agreement.

On September 21, 2006, FERC conditionally accepted the
    CAISO’s Market Redesign and Technology Upgrade, or MRTU,
    proposal which is currently scheduled to go in effect in
    January 31, 2008. Significant components of the MRTU
    include (i) locational marginal pricing of energy;
    (ii) a more effective congestion management system;
    (iii) a day-ahead market; and (iv) an increase to the
    existing bid caps. NRG considers these market reforms to be a
    positive development for its assets in the region. Several
    parties have requested rehearing, which remains pending.

On July 20, 2006, the CPUC issued its order towards
    establishing a standard Resource Adequacy Capacity Product that
    followed its decision to impose local capacity requirements,
    which took effect January 1, 2007. On the same date, the
    CPUC issued its order on long-term resource procurement that
    requires SCE to procure at least 1,500 MW.

In November 2006, NRG was awarded a 260 MW PPA by Southern
    California Edison to repower

Units 1-4

at the Company’s Long Beach Generating Station in
    Long Beach, California. On February 22, 2007, an
    intervener sought rehearing of the CPUC approval of the
    agreement and is contesting the PPA at FERC.

Regulatory
    Matters,

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    further discussion.

Environmental
    Matters

NRG is subject to a wide range of environmental regulations
    across a broad number of jurisdictions in the development,
    ownership, construction and operation of domestic and
    international projects. These laws and regulations generally
    require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained
    before construction and during operation of power plants.
    Environmental laws have become increasingly stringent in recent
    years, especially



around the regulation of air emissions from power generators.
    Such laws generally require regular capital expenditures for
    power plant upgrades, modifications and the installation of
    certain pollution control equipment. In general, future laws and
    regulations are expected to require the addition of emissions
    control or other environmental quality equipment or the
    imposition of certain restrictions on the operations of the
    Company’s facilities. NRG expects that future liability
    under, or compliance with, environmental requirements could have
    a material effect on the Company’s operations or
    competitive position.

Federal
    Environmental Initiatives

Air

— On May 18, 2005, the
    US Environmental Protection Authority, or USEPA, published
    the Clean Air Mercury Rule, or CAMR, to permanently cap and
    reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. CAMR
    imposes limits on mercury emissions from new and existing
    coal-fired plants and creates a market-based

cap-and-trade

program that will reduce nationwide utility emissions of mercury
    in two phases, 2010 and 2018. Texas and Louisiana will adopt the
    CAMR federal implementation plan, or FIP, when it is finalized
    by USEPA. Certain states in which NRG operates coal plants in
    NRG’s Northeast region such as Delaware, Massachusetts and
    New York have proposed or adopted state implementation plans in
    lieu of the CAMR FIP. Provisions for mercury monitoring and
    mitigation technologies are included in the budget and
    environmental capital expenditures for NRG’s coal plants.

On May 12, 2005, the USEPA published the Clean Air
    Interstate Rule, or CAIR. This rule applies to 28 eastern
    states and the District of Columbia and caps
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions from power plants in two phases; 2010 and 2015 for
    SO


and 2009 and 2015 for
    NO

x

.
    CAIR will apply to some of the Company’s power plants in
    New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana,
    Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Texas. On August 24,
    2005, the USEPA published a proposed FIP to ensure that
    generators affected by CAIR reduce emissions on schedule. In
    parallel: (i) on December 20, 2005, the USEPA signed
    proposed revisions to address attainment for fine particulates,
    or NAAQS for PM2.5, which will require affected states to
    implement further rules to address
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions; and (ii) on November 9, 2005, the USEPA
    proposed the second phase of the

8-hour

ozone
    NAAQS rule relating to
    NO

x

emissions. A number of environmental groups, states and industry
    organizations challenged aspects of the CAIR. The challenges
    were consolidated into

South Coast Air Quality Management
    District v. EPA.

In a ruling on December 22, 2006,
    the D.C. Circuit overturned portions of USEPA’s
    Phase I implementation rule for the new

8-hour

ozone
    standard. Specifically, the court ruled that USEPA could revoke
    the

1-hour

standard as long as there was no backsliding from more stringent
    control measures. This ruling could result in the imposition of
    fees under Section 185 of the Clean Air Act, or the CAA, on
    volatile organic carbon, or VOC, and
    NO

x

emissions in severe non-attainment areas. The fees could be as
    high as $7,700/ton for emissions above 80% of baseline emissions
    levels. Depending on the determination of baseline emission
    levels, this could materially impact NRG’s operations in
    California, New York City and Texas.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule was published by the USEPA on
    July 6, 2005. The rule requires regional haze controls by
    targeting
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions from sources including power plants of a certain
    vintage through the installation of Best Available Retrofit
    Technology, or BART, in certain cases. States must develop
    implementation plans by December 2007. Most of the
    Company’s facilities will likely be able to satisfy their
    obligations under the BART rule through compliance with the more
    stringent CAIR. Accordingly, no material additional expenditures
    are anticipated beyond those required by CAIR.

Increased public concern and mounting political pressure may
    result in federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects
    of GHG. NRG’s generating portfolio includes coal-, oil- and
    gas-fired plants, which emit
    CO


,
    a GHG, and will likely be subject to proposed regulation which
    could affect NRG’s costs of operation. NRG is taking steps
    now to mitigate any potential adverse impacts, including
    investments in non-fossil generation and investments in
    generation technologies that will more easily allow the company
    to manage and control
    CO


emissions.

In the 1990s, the USEPA commenced an industry-wide investigation
    of coal-fired electric generators to determine compliance with
    environmental requirements under the CAA associated with
    repairs, maintenance, modifications and operational changes made
    to facilities over the years. As a result, the USEPA and several
    states filed suits against a number of coal-fired power plants
    in mid-western and southern states alleging violations of the
    CAA New Source Review, or NSR, Prevention of Significant
    Deterioration, or PSD, requirements. EPA has issued



an NOV against NRG’s Big Cajun II plant alleging that
    NRG’s predecessors had undertaken projects that triggered
    requirements under the PSD program, including the installation
    of emission controls. NRG has evaluated the claims and believes
    they have no merit. Nonetheless, NRG has had discussions with
    EPA about resolving the claims. See the South Central regional
    below for a further discussion.

Water

— In July 2004, USEPA published
    rules governing cooling water intake structures at existing
    power facilities commonly referred to as the Phase II
    316(b) rules. The rules specify standards for cooling water
    intake structures at existing power plants using the largest
    amounts of cooling water. These rules will require
    implementation of the Best Technology Available, or BTA, for
    minimizing adverse environmental impacts unless a facility shows
    that such standards would result in very high costs or little
    environmental benefit. On January 25, 2007, the

2nd Circuit Court of Appeals

made its decision in
    the

Riverkeeper vs. US EPA

appeal over the Phase II
    316(b) regulation. Riverkeeper prevailed on nearly all
    issues and the decision essentially remands all of the important
    aspects of the rule back to EPA for reconsideration and
    restricted EPA’s ability to allow generators to substitute
    mitigation for aquatic species losses through habitat
    restoration or other measures. The Phase II 316(b)
    regulation affects a number of NRG’s plants, specifically
    those with once-through cooling systems. While NRG has conducted
    a number of the requisite studies, until all the needed studies
    throughout the Company’s fleet have been completed,
    consultations on the results have occurred with USEPA or its
    delegated state or regional agencies, and EPA concludes its
    reconsideration of the 316(b) rules, it is not possible to
    estimate with certainty the capital costs that will be required
    for compliance with the Phase II 316(b) rules.

Nuclear Waste

— Under the
    U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the federal
    government must remove and ultimately dispose of spent nuclear
    fuel and high-level radioactive waste from nuclear plants such
    as STP. Consistent with the Act, owners of nuclear plants,
    including NRG and the other owners of STP, entered into
    contracts setting out the obligations of the owners and the
    U.S. Department of Energy, or DOE, including the fees being
    paid by the owners for DOE’s services. Since 1998, the DOE
    has been in default on its obligations to begin removing spent
    nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from reactors. On
    January 28, 2004, Texas Genco LP and the other owners of
    STP filed a breach of contract suit against the DOE in order to
    protect against the running of a statute of limitations.

Under the federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of
    1980, as amended, the State of Texas is required to provide,
    either on its own or jointly with other states in a compact, for
    the disposal of all low-level radioactive waste generated within
    the State. The State of Texas has agreed to a compact with the
    state of Vermont for a disposal facility that would be located
    in Texas. That compact was ratified by Congress and signed by
    President Clinton in 1998. In 2003, the State of Texas enacted
    legislation allowing a private entity to be licensed to accept
    low-level radioactive waste for disposal. NRG intends to
    continue to ship low-level waste material from STP offsite for
    as long as an alternative disposal site is available. Should
    existing off-site disposal become unavailable, the low-level
    waste material will then be stored

on-site.

STP’s

on-site

storage capacity is expected to be adequate for STP’s needs
    until other off-site facilities become available.

Regional
    U.S. Environmental Initiatives

Northeast
    Region

NRG’s facilities in the eastern US are subject to a

cap-and-trade

program governing
    NO

x

emissions during the ozone season, typically from May 1
    through September 30. These rules essentially require that
    one
    NO

x

allowance be held for each ton of
    NO

x

emitted. Each of NRG’s facilities that are subject to these
    rules has been allocated
    NO

x

emission allowances. NRG currently estimates that the portfolio
    total is currently sufficient to generally cover operations at
    these facilities through 2009, reflecting the fact that
    NO

x

allowances are allocated on a three-year, look-back basis.
    However, if at any point emission allowances are insufficient
    for the anticipated operation of each of these facilities, NRG
    must purchase
    NO

x

allowances. Any obligation to purchase a substantial number of
    additional
    NO

x

allowances could have a material adverse effect on NRG’s
    operations.

The Ozone Transport Commission, or OTC, was established by
    Congress and governs ozone and the
    NO

x

budget program in certain eastern states, including
    Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and Delaware. The OTC
    proposes to implement a regional plan containing emission
    reduction targets for power plants that exceed those under CAIR.
    The OTC targets and timelines have slipped although additional
    SO


and
    NO

x

reductions are still in



discussion. Current attention is focused on
    NO

x

emissions from units run primarily on High Energy Demand Days,
    or HEDD, of which NRG owns facilities in Connecticut, Delaware
    and New York. NRG continues to be actively engaged in the
    OTC stakeholder process including providing technical expertise
    to improve policy decision making. While it is not possible to
    predict the outcome of this regional effort, to the extent that
    the OTC is successful in implementing emission requirements that
    are more stringent than existing regimes, NRG could be
    materially impacted.

On December 20, 2005, seven northeastern states entered
    into a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU, to create a Regional
    Greenhouse Gas initiative to establish a

cap-and-trade

greenhouse gas program for electric generators, referred to as
    RGGI. Maryland and Massachusetts have since announced their
    intent to join. In August 2006, the states participating in RGGI
    released a model rule which addresses program elements including
    timelines, monitoring, the use of offsets, and allowance
    trading. The program begins in 2009. Individual states in which
    NRG operates including Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts and
    New York must promulgate state rules, which can be based on the
    model rule, and in addition, address allowance
    allocations/auctions, treatment of unallocated allowances and
    leakage. New York issued a pre-proposal version in December
    2006 which, among other things, proposes to increase MOU
    suggested set aside of allowances from 25% to 100% and that
    these allowances be auctioned. New York is accepting
    comments on the pre-proposal and expects to have a final rule
    later in 2007. Connecticut, Delaware and Massachusetts plan to
    develop rules in 2007. NRG has proposed clean coal IGCC projects
    that are carbon capture ready to meet future generation demands
    in both New York and Delaware and also, potentially,
    Connecticut. NRG continues to actively participate in state and
    regional RGGI proceedings.

New England

— Massachusetts air regulations
    prescribe schedules under which six existing coal-fired power
    plants in-state are required to meet stringent emission limits
    for
    NO

x

,
    SO


,
    mercury, and
    CO


.
    NRG’s Somerset plant is subject to these regulations. NRG
    has installed natural gas reburn technology to meet the
    NO

x

and
    SO


limits. On June 4, 2004, the Massachusetts Department of
    Environmental Protection, or MADEP, issued its regulation on the
    control of mercury emissions. The effect of this regulation is
    that starting October 1, 2006, Somerset will be capped at
    13.1 lbs/year of mercury as of January 1, 2008 and
    must achieve a reduction in its mercury

inlet-to-outlet

concentration of 85%. NRG plans to meet the requirements through
    the management of our fuels and the use of early and off-site
    reduction credits. Additionally, NRG has entered into an
    agreement with MADEP to retire or repower the Somerset station
    by the end of 2009. A permit for repowering the facility was
    submitted to the MADEP in December 2006.

The Massachusetts carbon regulation 310 CMR 7.29 Emissions
    Standards for Power Plants requires coal-fired generation
    located within the state to comply with
    CO


emissions restrictions. A carbon emissions cap applies from
    January 1, 2006, while a rate requirement will apply in
    2008. It is expected that Somerset will meet the cap from 2006
    through 2007 and purchase offsets after that period.
    Massachusetts announced in January 2006 that they will join the
    other Northeast states in RGGI.

New York

— Huntley Power LLC, Dunkirk Power LLC
    and Oswego Power LLC entered into a Consent Order with the New
    York State Department of Environmental Conservation, or NYSDEC,
    effective March 31, 2004, regarding certain alleged opacity
    exceedances. The Order stipulates penalties for future
    violations of opacity requirements and a compliance schedule. In
    2006, NRG accrued amounts payable to NYSDEC of $0.2 million
    to cover the stipulated penalty payments.

Delaware

— In November 2006, the Delaware
    Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, or
    DNREC, promulgated Regulation No. 1146, or
    Reg 1146, Electric Generating Unit Multi-Pollutant
    Regulation and Section 111(d) of the State Plan for the
    Control of Mercury Emissions from Coal-Fired Electric Steam
    Generating Units. These regulations govern the control of
    SO


,
    NO

x

and mercury emissions from electric generating units. NRG’s
    current plan to install controls at the Company’s Indian
    River facility, while on an accelerated basis, is unable to meet
    certain deadlines for
    SO


and
    NO

x

controls in Phase 1, taking into account the time required,
    as a practical matter, to design, install and commission the
    necessary equipment. NRG and the owners of all other subject
    facilities in the state filed a challenge to Reg 1146 with
    the Environmental Appeals Board on December 6, 2006. In
    addition, NRG also filed a protective appeal with the Delaware
    Superior Court on December 29, 2006. NRG is unable to
    predict the outcome of the proceedings at this time, but failure
    to obtain relief may result in a material impact to the
    Company’s Indian River facility.



On January 5, 2005, DNREC initiated a rule making to
    incorporate USEPA’s NSR reforms within Delaware’s
    Regulation 25. Delaware was required to revise the
    state’s current rules and demonstrate such revisions are
    equivalent to, or more stringent than, the USEPA’s revised
    rules by January 2006, which Delaware did not meet. The state is
    considering a facility emissions limit that would cap all NSR
    applicable pollutants. The results of the rule making, expected
    in 2007, will impact Indian River and Dover facilities.

West
    Region

NRG’s El Segundo Generating Station is regulated by the
    South Coast Air Quality Management District, or SCAQMD. Before
    the station’s retirement as of January 1, 2005, the
    Long Beach Generating Station was also regulated by SCAQMD.
    SCAQMD approved amendments to its Regional Clean Air Incentives
    Market, or RECLAIM,
    NO

x

regulations on January 7, 2005. RECLAIM is a regional
    emission-trading program targeting
    NO

x

reductions to achieve state and federal ambient air quality
    standards for ozone. Among other changes, the amendments reduce
    the
    NO

x

RECLAIM Trading Credit, or RTC, holdings of El Segundo
    Power, LLC and Long Beach Generation LLC facilities by
    certain amounts. Notwithstanding these amendments, retained RTCs
    are expected to be sufficient to operate El Segundo
    Units 3 and 4 as high as 100% capacity factor for the life
    of those units.

On September 27, 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger
    signed Assembly Bill 32 — California Global
    Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and Senate Bill 1368 —
    Electricity: Emissions of Greenhouse Gases. Assembly
    Bill 32, or AB 32, requires the California Air
    Resources Board, or CARB, to develop a greenhouse gas reduction
    program to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, a reduction
    of approximately 25%. The reductions will be phased in beginning
    2012 pursuant to regulations to be adopted by 2011. The
    financial impact to NRG will depend on final regulations. In
    addition, the governor also signed Senate Bill 1368, or
    SB 1368, which prohibits utilities from entering into
    contracts of five years or more for any baseload generation
    exceeding a 60% capacity factor unless the contracting facility
    complies with a greenhouse gas performance standard no higher
    than the rate of GHG emissions for a combined cycle natural gas
    baseload power plant. NRG’s plants and development projects
    in California are unaffected by SB 1368 because they either
    meet the combined cycle standard or they do not exceed the 60%
    capacity factor

and/or

five
    year contract term thresholds.

Nuclear
    Insurance

STPNOC purchases insurance coverage on behalf of NRG and the
    other owners of STP. STP maintains property, decontamination
    liability and nuclear hazard liability insurance coverage as
    required by law and periodically review available limits and
    coverage for additional protection. Currently, STP has a
    $2.75 billion limit in property and decontamination
    liability insurance coverage, which is above the legally
    required minimum of $1.06 billion. The $2.75 billion
    includes $1 billion excess blanket coverage that is shared
    with two other nuclear power plants, namely Diablo Canyon and
    DC Cook. The deductible for property damage is
    $2.5 million. STP also carries a primary accidental outage
    policy, which allows for six weeks of indemnity at
    $3.5 million per week after a 17 week deductible is
    met. The $3.5 million weekly indemnity would be allocated
    between the three owners of STP according to their ownership
    percentages. NRG has purchased additional accidental outage
    coverage for its 44% ownership stake in STP. This policy
    provides coverage after the six week indemnity period has been
    paid under the primary policy, and will provide NRG
    $1.98 million weekly indemnity per unit for 52 weeks
    and $1.58 million per week for the next 71 weeks. If
    both units at STP are affected by an outage arising out of the
    same accident, weekly indemnity per unit is limited to 80% of
    the single unit recovery. There is no coverage for partial
    outages, and the outage must be the result of a property damage
    caused by a sudden and fortuitous event.

The Price-Anderson Act, as amended through 2025 by the Energy
    Policy Act of 2005, requires owners of nuclear power plants in
    the U.S. to purchase the maximum amount of insurance
    available (currently $300 million) in the insurance market
    for liability claims that arise in the event of a nuclear
    accident. In addition, the Act provides a secondary layer of
    protection of up to $10.5 billion. Under this provision,
    each licensed reactor company is obliged to contribute up to
    approximately $101 million per unit per accident in
    retrospective premiums for any single incident at any nuclear
    power plant. Annual installments per reactor cannot exceed
    $15 million. STP is a two reactor facility but NRG’s
    liability would be capped at 44% due to the Company’s
    ownership interest in STP. The Price-Anderson Act only covers
    nuclear liability associated with an accident in the course of
    operation of the nuclear



reactor, transportation of nuclear fuel to the reactor site,
    storage of nuclear fuel and waste at the reactor site and the
    transportation of the spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste from
    the nuclear reactor. Any substantial retrospective premiums
    imposed under the Price-Anderson Act or losses not covered by
    insurance could have a materially adverse effect on NRG’s
    financial condition, the results of operations and statement of
    cash flows.

Domestic
    Site Remediation Matters

Under certain federal, state and local environmental laws and
    regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of any
    facility, including an electric generating facility, may be
    required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened
    releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products
    at the facility. NRG may also be held liable to a governmental
    entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury
    and investigation and remediation costs incurred by a party in
    connection with hazardous material releases or threatened
    releases. These laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, as
    amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of
    1986, or SARA, impose liability without regard to whether the
    owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous
    substances, and the courts have interpreted liability under such
    laws to be strict (without fault) and joint and several. Cleanup
    obligations can often be triggered during the closure or
    decommissioning of a facility, in addition to spills or other
    occurrences during its operations.

In January 2006, NRG Indian River Operations, Inc. received a
    letter of informal notification from DNREC stating that it may
    be a potentially responsible party with respect to a historic
    captive landfill. NRG is working with the DNREC, through the
    Voluntary

Clean-up

Program to investigate the site. The Company is unable to
    predict the exact impact at this time.

Further details regarding our Domestic Site Remediation
    obligations can be found at Item 15 —
    Note 22,

Regulatory Matters

, to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

International
    Environmental Matters

Most of the foreign countries in which NRG owns or may acquire
    or develop independent power projects have environmental and
    safety laws or regulations relating to the ownership or
    operation of electric power generation facilities. These laws
    and regulations, like those in the U.S., are constantly evolving
    and have a significant impact on international wholesale power
    producers. In particular, NRG’s international power
    generation facilities will likely be affected by emissions
    limitations and operational requirements imposed by the Kyoto
    Protocol, which is an international treaty related to greenhouse
    gas emissions enacted on February 16, 2005, and
    country-based restrictions pertaining to global climate change
    concerns.

NRG retains appropriate advisors in foreign countries and seeks
    to design its international asset management strategy to comply
    with each country’s environmental and safety laws and
    regulations. There can be no assurance that changes in such laws
    or regulations will not adversely effect the Company’s
    international operations.

MIBRAG/Schkopau, Germany

    CO


emissions trading began in Germany in 2005, pursuant to European
    Union obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. Trading rules and
    emissions allocations for the second emissions trading period
    (2008 through 2012) have not yet been established by the
    regulators, therefore the impact of the new rules on NRG’s
    German business cannot be predicted at this time. Changes to the
    German Emission Control Directive have specified lower
    NO

x

emission limits for plants firing conventional fuels and
    co-firing waste products. The new regulations required the
    Mumsdorf and Deuben Power stations to install additional
    controls to reduce
    NO

x

emissions in 2006. These plant modifications have been
    successfully completed. The regulations of the revised European
    Union’s Groundwater Directive and Mine Wastewater
    Management Directive are now in effect and MIBRAG sees no
    negative effects on its mining operations or economics.

Item 1A —

Risk Factors Related to NRG Energy, Inc.

Many
    of NRG’s power generation facilities operate, wholly or
    partially, without long-term power sale
    agreements.

Many of NRG’s facilities operate as “merchant”
    facilities without long-term power sales agreements for some or
    all of their generating capacity and output, and therefore are
    exposed to market fluctuations. Without the benefit of long-term
    power sales agreements for these assets, NRG cannot be sure that
    we will be able to sell any or all of the power generated by
    these facilities at commercially attractive rates or that these
    facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead
    to future impairments of the Company’s property, plant and
    equipment or to the closing of certain of its facilities,
    resulting in economic losses and liabilities, which could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations, financial condition or cash flows.

NRG’s
    financial performance may be impacted by changing natural gas
    prices, significant and unpredictable price fluctuations in the
    wholesale power markets and other market factors that are beyond
    the Company’s control.

A significant percentage of the company’s domestic revenues
    are derived from baseload power plants that are fueled by coal.
    In many of the competitive markets where NRG operates, the price
    of power typically is set by marginal cost natural gas-fired
    power plants that currently have substantially higher variable
    costs than NRG’s coal-fired baseload power plants. The
    current pricing and cost environment allows the Company’s
    baseload coal generation assets to earn attractive operating
    margins compared to plants fueled by natural gas. A decrease in
    natural gas prices could result in a corresponding decrease in
    the market price of power but would generally not affect the
    cost of the coal that the plants use. This could significantly
    reduce the operating margins of the Company’s baseload
    generation assets and materially and adversely impact its
    financial performance.

In addition, because changes in power prices in the markets
    where NRG operates are generally correlated with changes in
    natural gas prices, NRG’s hedging portfolio includes
    natural gas derivative instruments to hedge power prices for its
    baseload generation. If this correlation between power prices
    and natural gas prices is not maintained and a change in gas
    prices is not proportionately offset by a change in power
    prices, the Company’s natural gas hedges may not fully
    cover this differential. This could have a materially adverse
    impact on the Company’s cash flow and financial position.

Market prices for power, generation capacity and ancillary
    services tend to fluctuate substantially. Unlike most other
    commodities, electric power can only be stored on a very limited
    basis and generally must be produced concurrently with its use.
    As a result, power prices are subject to significant volatility
    from supply and demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead
    and spot markets. Long- and short-term power prices may also
    fluctuate substantially due to other factors outside of the
    Company’s control, including:

•

increases and decreases in generation capacity in the
    Company’s markets, including the addition of new supplies
    of power from existing competitors or new market entrants as a
    result of the development of new generation plants, expansion of
    existing plants or additional transmission capacity;

•

changes in power transmission or fuel transportation capacity
    constraints or inefficiencies;

•

electric supply disruptions, including plant outages and
    transmission disruptions;

•

heat rate risk;

•

weather conditions;

•

changes in the demand for power or in patterns of power usage,
    including the potential development of demand-side management
    tools and practices;

•

development of new fuels and new technologies for the production
    of power;

•

regulations and actions of the ISOs; and

•

federal and state power market and environmental regulation and
    legislation.



These factors have caused the Company’s operating results
    to fluctuate in the past and will continue to cause them to do
    so in the future.

NRG’s
    costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows
    could be adversely impacted by disruption of its fuel
    supplies.

NRG relies on coal, oil and natural gas to fuel a majority of
    its power generation facilities. Delivery of these fuels to the
    facilities is dependent upon the continuing financial viability
    of contractual counterparties as well as upon the infrastructure
    (including rail lines, rail cars, barge facilities, roadways,
    and natural gas pipelines) available to serve each generation
    facility. As a result, the Company is subject to the risks of
    disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at its
    generation facilities if a counterparty fails to perform or if
    there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.

NRG has sold forward a substantial portion of its baseload power
    in order to lock in long-term prices that it deemed to be
    favorable at the time it entered into the forward sale
    contracts. In order to hedge its obligations under these forward
    power sales contracts, the Company has entered into long-term
    and short-term contracts for the purchase and delivery of fuel.
    Many of the forward power sales contracts do not allow the
    Company to pass through changes in fuel costs or discharge the
    power sale obligations in the case of a disruption in fuel
    supply due to force majeure events or the default of a fuel
    supplier or transporter. Disruptions in the Company’s fuel
    supplies may therefore require it to find alternative fuel
    sources at higher costs, to find other sources of power to
    deliver to counterparties at a higher cost, or to pay damages to
    counterparties for failure to deliver power as contracted. Any
    such event could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial performance.

NRG also buys significant quantities of fuel on a short-term or
    spot market basis. Prices for all of the Company’s fuels
    fluctuate, sometimes rising or falling significantly over a
    relatively short period of time. The price NRG can obtain for
    the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate, or may not
    rise at all, to match a rise in fuel or delivery costs. This may
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    performance. Changes in market prices for natural gas, coal and
    oil may result from the following:

•

weather conditions;

•

seasonality;

•

demand for energy commodities and general economic conditions;

•

disruption or other constraints or inefficiencies of
    electricity, gas or coal transmission or transportation;

•

additional generating capacity;

•

availability and levels of storage and inventory for fuel stocks;

•

natural gas, crude oil, refined products and coal production
    levels;

•

changes in market liquidity;

•

federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and
    legislation; and

•

the creditworthiness and liquidity and willingness of fuel
    suppliers/transporters to do business with the Company.

NRG’s plant operating characteristics and equipment,
    particularly at its coal-fired plants, often dictate the
    specific fuel quality to be combusted. The availability and
    price of specific fuel qualities may vary due to supplier
    financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions
    and force majeure. At times, coal of specific quality may not be
    available at any price, or the Company may not be able to
    transport such coal to its facilities on a timely basis. In this
    case, the Company may not be able to run the coal facility even
    if it would be profitable. Operating a coal facility with
    different quality coal can lead to emission or operating
    problems. If the Company had sold forward the power from such a
    coal facility, it could be required to supply or purchase power
    from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. This could have a
    material adverse impact on the financial results of specific
    plants and on the Company’s results of operations.



There
    may be periods when NRG will not be able to meet its commitments
    under forward sale obligations at a reasonable cost or at
    all.

A substantial portion of the output from NRG’s baseload
    facilities has been sold forward under fixed price power sales
    contracts through 2012, and the Company also sells forward the
    output from its intermediate and peaking facilities when its
    deems it commercially advantageous to do so. Because the
    obligations under most of these agreements are not contingent on
    a unit being available to generate power, NRG is generally
    required to deliver power to the buyer, even in the event of a
    plant outage, fuel supply disruption or a reduction in the
    available capacity of the unit. To the extent that the Company
    does not have sufficient lower cost capacity to meet its
    commitments under its forward sale obligations, the Company
    would be required to supply replacement power either by running
    its other, higher cost power plants or by obtaining power from
    third-party sources at market prices that could substantially
    exceed the contract price. If NRG fails to deliver the
    contracted power, it would be required to pay the difference
    between the market price at the delivery point and the contract
    price, and the amount of such payments could be substantial.

In NRG’s South Central region, NRG has long-term contracts
    with rural cooperatives that require it to serve all of the
    cooperatives’ requirements at prices that generally reflect
    the costs of coal-fired generation. At times, the output from
    NRG’s coal-fired Big Cajun II facility has been and
    will continue to be inadequate to serve these obligations, and
    when that happens the Company has typically purchased power from
    other power producers, often at a loss. NRG’s financial
    returns from its South Central region are likely to deteriorate
    over time as the rural cooperatives grow their customer base,
    unless the Company is able to amend or renegotiate its contracts
    with the cooperatives or add generating capacity.

NRG’s
    trading operations and the use of hedging agreements could
    result in financial losses that negatively impact its results of
    operations.

The Company typically enters into hedging agreements, including
    contracts to purchase or sell commodities at future dates and at
    fixed prices, in order to manage the commodity price risks
    inherent in its power generation operations. These activities,
    although intended to mitigate price volatility, expose the
    Company to other risks. When the Company sells power forward, it
    gives up the opportunity to sell power at higher prices in the
    future, which not only may result in lost opportunity costs but
    also may require the Company to post significant amounts of cash
    collateral or other credit support to its counterparties.
    Further, if the values of the financial contracts change in a
    manner that the Company does not anticipate, or if a
    counterparty fails to perform under a contract, it could harm
    the Company’s business, operating results or financial
    position.

NRG does not typically hedge the entire exposure of its
    operations against commodity price volatility. To the extent it
    does not hedge against commodity price volatility, the
    Company’s results of operations and financial position may
    be improved or diminished based upon movement in commodity
    prices.

NRG may engage in trading activities, including the trading of
    power, fuel and emissions allowances that are not directly
    related to the operation of the Company’s generation
    facilities or the management of related risks. These trading
    activities take place in volatile markets and some of these
    trades could be characterized as speculative. The Company would
    expect to settle these trades financially rather than through
    the production of power or the delivery of fuel. This trading
    activity may expose the Company to the risk of significant
    financial losses which could have a material adverse effect on
    its business and financial condition.

NRG
    may not have sufficient liquidity to hedge market risks
    effectively.

The Company is exposed to market risks through its power
    marketing business, which involves the sale of energy, capacity
    and related products and the purchase and sale of fuel,
    transmission services and emission allowances. These market
    risks include, among other risks, volatility arising from
    location and timing differences that may be associated with
    buying and transporting fuel, converting fuel into energy and
    delivering the energy to a buyer.

NRG undertakes these marketing activities through agreements
    with various counterparties. Many of the Company’s
    agreements with counterparties include provisions that require
    the Company to provide guarantees,



offset of netting arrangements, letters of credit, a second lien
    on assets

and/or

cash
    collateral to protect the counterparties against the risk of the
    Company’s default or insolvency. The amount of such credit
    support that must be provided typically is based on the
    difference between the price of the commodity in a given
    contract and the market price of the commodity. Significant
    movements in market prices can result in the Company being
    required to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in
    very large amounts. The effectiveness of the Company’s
    strategy may be dependent on the amount of collateral available
    to enter into or maintain these contracts, and liquidity
    requirements may be greater than the Company anticipates or will
    be able to meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital
    to post as collateral in support of performance guarantees or as
    a cash margin, the Company may not be able to manage price
    volatility effectively or to implement its strategy. An increase
    in the amount of letters of credit or cash collateral required
    to be provided to the Company’s counterparties may
    negatively affect the Company’s liquidity and financial
    condition.

Further, if any of NRG’s facilities experience unplanned
    outages, the Company may be required to procure replacement
    power at spot market prices in order to fulfill contractual
    commitments. Without adequate liquidity to meet margin and
    collateral requirements, the Company may be exposed to
    significant losses, may miss significant opportunities, and may
    have increased exposure to the volatility of spot markets.

The
    accounting for NRG’s hedging activities may increase the
    volatility in the Company’s quarterly and annual financial
    results.

NRG engages in commodity-related marketing and price-risk
    management activities in order to financially hedge its exposure
    to market risk with respect to electricity sales from its
    generation assets, fuel utilized by those assets, and emission
    allowances.

NRG generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical and
    financial purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract
    volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations
    through the use of financial and physical derivative contracts.
    These derivatives are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS 133, as amended, which requires the Company to record
    all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with changes
    in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in the underlying
    commodity prices immediately recognized in earnings, unless the
    derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment.
    Whether a derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting
    treatment depends upon it meeting specific criteria used to
    determine if the cash flow hedge is and will remain appropriate
    for the term of the derivative. Economic hedges will not
    necessarily qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. As
    a result, the Company may be unable to accurately predict the
    impact that its risk management decisions may have on its
    quarterly and annual operating results.

Competition
    in wholesale power markets may have a material adverse effect on
    NRG’s results of operations, cash flows and the market
    value of its assets.

NRG has numerous competitors in all aspects of its business, and
    additional competitors may enter the industry. Because many of
    the Company’s facilities are old, newer plants owned by the
    Company’s competitors are often more efficient than
    NRG’s aging plants, which may put some of these plants at a
    competitive disadvantage to the extent the Company’s
    competitors are able to consume the same or less fuel as the
    Company’s plants consume. Over time, the Company’s
    plants may be squeezed out of their markets, or may be unable to
    compete with these more efficient plants.

In NRG’s power marketing and commercial operations, it
    competes on the basis of its relative skills, financial position
    and access to capital with other providers of electric energy in
    the procurement of fuel and transportation services, and the
    sale of capacity, energy and related products. In order to
    compete successfully, the Company seeks to aggregate fuel
    supplies at competitive prices from different sources and
    locations and to efficiently utilize transportation services
    from third-party pipelines, railways and other fuel transporters
    and transmission services from electric utilities.

Other companies with which NRG competes with may have greater
    liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial
    resources, lower cost structures, more effective risk management
    policies and procedures, greater ability to incur losses,
    longer-standing relationships with customers, greater potential
    for profitability from ancillary services or greater flexibility
    in the timing of their sale of generation capacity and ancillary
    services than NRG does.



NRG’s competitors may be able to respond more quickly to
    new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote
    greater resources to the construction, expansion or
    refurbishment of their power generation facilities than NRG can.
    In addition, current and potential competitors may make
    strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships
    among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is
    possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new
    competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market
    share. There can be no assurance that NRG will be able to
    compete successfully against current and future competitors, and
    any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flow.

Operation
    of power generation facilities involves significant risks and
    hazards customary to the power industry that could have a
    material adverse effect on NRG’s revenues and results of
    operations. NRG may not have adequate insurance to cover these
    risks and hazards.

The ongoing operation of NRG’s facilities involves risks
    that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes,
    performance below expected levels of output or efficiency and
    the inability to transport the Company’s product to its
    customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission
    capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including
    extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or
    other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk
    of the Company’s business. Unplanned outages typically
    increase the Company’s operation and maintenance expenses
    and may reduce the Company’s revenues as a result of
    selling fewer MWh or require NRG to incur significant costs as a
    result of running one of its higher cost units or obtaining
    replacement power from third parties in the open market to
    satisfy the Company’s forward power sales obligations.
    NRG’s inability to operate the Company’s plants
    efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs, and generate
    earnings and cash flow from the Company’s asset-based
    businesses could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations, financial condition or
    cash flows. While NRG maintains insurance, obtains warranties
    from vendors and obligates contractors to meet certain
    performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties
    or performance guarantees may not be adequate to cover the
    Company’s lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated
    damages payments should the Company experience equipment
    breakdown or non-performance by contractors or vendors.

Power generation involves hazardous activities, including
    acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large
    pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to
    transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural
    risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind,
    other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and
    machinery failure are inherent risks in the Company’s
    operations. These and other hazards can cause significant
    personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and
    destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of,
    or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The
    occurrence of any one of these events may result in NRG being
    named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for
    substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs,
    personal injury and property damage and fines

and/or

penalties. NRG maintains an amount of insurance protection that
    it considers adequate, but the Company cannot provide any
    assurance that its insurance will be sufficient or effective
    under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities
    to which it may be subject. A successful claim for which the
    Company is not fully insured could hurt its financial results
    and materially harm NRG’s financial condition. Further, due
    to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets,
    NRG cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage
    will continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms
    similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by
    insurance could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Maintenance,
    expansion and refurbishment of power generation facilities
    involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power
    outages or reduced output and could have a material adverse
    effect on NRG’s results of operations, cash flow and
    financial condition.

Many of NRG’s facilities are old and require periodic
    upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including
    failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any
    unanticipated capital expenditures could result in reduced
    profitability.

NRG cannot be certain of the level of capital expenditures that
    will be required due to changing environmental and safety laws
    and regulations (including changes in the interpretation or
    enforcement thereof), needed facility



repairs and unexpected events (such as natural disasters or
    terrorist attacks). The unexpected requirement of large capital
    expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s liquidity and financial condition.

If NRG makes any major modifications to its power generation
    facilities, the Company may be required to install the best
    available control technology or to achieve the lowest achievable
    emissions rates, as such terms are defined under the new source
    review provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Any such
    modifications would likely result in substantial additional
    capital expenditures.

The
    Company’s Repowering NRG program is subject to financing,
    construction, and operational risks that could adversely impact
    NRG’s financial performance

While NRG currently intends to develop and finance the more
    capital intensive, solid fuel-fired projects included in the

Repowering NRG

program on a non-recourse or limited
    recourse basis through separate project financed entities, and
    intends to seek additional investments in most of these projects
    from third parties, NRG anticipates that it will need to make
    significant equity investments in these projects. NRG may also
    decide to develop and finance some of the projects, such as
    smaller gas-fired and renewable projects, using corporate
    financial resources rather than non-recourse debt, which could
    subject NRG to significant capital expenditure requirements and
    to risks inherent in the development and construction of new
    generation facilities. In addition to providing some or all of
    the equity required to develop and build the proposed projects,
    NRG’s ability to finance these projects on a non-recourse
    basis is contingent upon a number of factors, including the
    terms of the engineering, procurement and construction
    contracts, construction costs, power purchase agreements and
    fuel procurement contracts, capital markets conditions, the
    availability of tax credits and other government incentives for
    certain new technologies. To the extent NRG is not able to
    obtain non-recourse financing for any projects or should the
    credit rating agencies attribute a material amount of the
    project finance debt to NRG’s credit, the financing of the

Repowering NRG

projects could have a negative impact on
    the credit ratings of NRG. In addition, there are risks inherent
    in the development and construction of new generation
    facilities. Further, certain of the

Repowerng NRG

projects incorporate advanced equipment and technologies
    with only a modest amount of operating history in the proposed
    configurations. There also exists the possibility of cost
    overruns, schedule delays and performance risks during the
    construction phase, as well as the possibility of operational
    and contractual issues during the commercial operational life of
    these new generation facilities that could adversely impact
    NRG’s financial performance.

As part of the

Repowering NRG

program, NRG may also
    choose to undertake the repowering, refurbishment or upgrade of
    current facilities based on the Company’s assessment that
    such activity will provide adequate financial returns. Such
    projects often require several years of development and capital
    expenditures before commencement of commercial operations, and
    key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an
    investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding
    construction costs, timing, available financing and future fuel
    and power prices. The construction, expansion, modification and
    refurbishment of power generation facilities involve many
    additional risks, including:

•

delays in obtaining necessary permits and licenses;

•

environmental remediation of soil or groundwater at contaminated
    sites;

•

interruptions to dispatch at the Company’s facilities;

•

supply interruptions;

•

work stoppages;

•

labor disputes;

•

weather interferences;

•

unforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems;

•

unanticipated cost overruns; and

•

performance risks.



Any of these risks could cause NRG’s financial returns on
    new investments to be lower than expected, or could cause the
    Company to operate below expected capacity or availability
    levels, which could result in lost revenues, increased expenses,
    higher maintenance costs and penalties.

Supplier

and/or

customer concentration at certain of NRG’s facilities may
    expose the Company to significant financial credit or
    performance risks.

NRG often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small
    number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of
    fuel and other services required for the operation of certain of
    its facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, the Company
    utilizes the marketplace to provide these services. There can be
    no assurance that the marketplace can provide these services as,
    when and where required.

At times, NRG relies on a single customer or a few customers to
    purchase all or a significant portion of a facility’s
    output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account
    for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a
    given facility. The Company has also hedged a portion of its
    exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price
    power sales and natural gas price swap agreements.
    Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable
    to perform their obligations. NRG may not be able to enter into
    replacement agreements on terms as favorable as its existing
    agreements, or at all. If the Company was unable to enter into
    replacement PPA’s, the Company would sell its plants’
    power at market prices. If the Company is unable to enter into
    replacement fuel or fuel transportation purchase agreements, NRG
    would seek to purchase the Company’s fuel requirements at
    market prices, exposing the Company to market price volatility
    and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available
    during certain periods at any price.

The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its
    contractual obligations to NRG could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial results. Consequently,
    the financial performance of the Company’s facilities is
    dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance
    by, suppliers and customers.

NRG
    relies on power transmission facilities that the Company does
    not own or control and that are subject to transmission
    constraints within a number of the Company’s core regions.
    If these facilities fail to provide NRG with adequate
    transmission capacity, the Company may be restricted in its
    ability to deliver wholesale electric power to its customers and
    the Company may either incur additional costs or forego
    revenues. Conversely, improvements to certain transmission
    systems could also reduce revenues.

NRG depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by
    others to deliver the wholesale power it sells from the
    Company’s power generation plants to its customers. If
    transmission is disrupted, or if the transmission capacity
    infrastructure is inadequate, NRG’s ability to sell and
    deliver wholesale power may be adversely impacted. If a
    region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate,
    the Company’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may
    be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is
    imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient
    incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.
    The Company cannot also predict whether transmission facilities
    will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive
    access to those markets.

In addition, in certain of the markets in which NRG operates,
    energy transmission congestion may occur and the Company may be
    deemed responsible for congestion costs if it schedules delivery
    of power between congestion zones during times when congestion
    occurs between the zones. If NRG were liable for such congestion
    costs, the Company’s financial results could be adversely
    affected.

In the California ISO, New York ISO and New England ISO markets,
    the Company has a significant amount of generation located in
    load pockets, making that generation valuable, particularly with
    respect to maintaining the reliability of the transmission grid.
    Expansion of transmission systems to reduce or eliminate these
    load pockets could negatively impact the value or profitability
    of our existing facilities in these areas.

Because
    NRG owns less than a majority of some of its project
    investments, the Company cannot exercise complete control over
    their operations.

NRG has limited control over the operation of some project
    investments and joint ventures because the Company’s
    investments are in projects where it beneficially owns less than
    a majority of the ownership interests.



NRG seeks to exert a degree of influence with respect to the
    management and operation of projects in which it owns less than
    a majority of the ownership interests by negotiating to obtain
    positions on management committees or to receive certain limited
    governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions.
    However, the Company may not always succeed in such
    negotiations. NRG may be dependent on its co-venturers to
    operate such projects. The Company’s co-venturers may not
    have the level of experience, technical expertise, human
    resources management and other attributes necessary to operate
    these projects optimally. The approval of co-venturers also may
    be required for NRG to receive distributions of funds from
    projects or to transfer the Company’s interest in projects.

Future
    acquisition activities may have adverse effects.

NRG may seek to acquire additional companies or assets in the
    Company’s industry. The acquisition of power generation
    companies and assets is subject to substantial risks, including
    the failure to identify material problems during due diligence,
    the risk of over-paying for assets and the inability to arrange
    financing for an acquisition as may be required or desired.
    Further, the integration and consolidation of acquisitions
    requires substantial human, financial and other resources and,
    ultimately, the Company’s acquisitions may not be
    successfully integrated. There can be no assurances that any
    future acquisitions will perform as expected or that the returns
    from such acquisitions will support the indebtedness incurred to
    acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them.

NRG’s
    business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and
    may be adversely affected by legislative or regulatory changes,
    as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply
    with, existing or future regulations or
    requirements.

NRG’s business is subject to extensive foreign, and
    U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulation.
    Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory
    regimes may cause the Company to incur significant additional
    costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result
    in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of
    liens, fines,

and/or

civil
    or criminal liability.

Public utilities under the Federal Power Act, or FPA, are
    required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for
    wholesale sales of electricity. All of NRG’s non-qualifying
    facility generating companies and power marketing affiliates in
    the United States make sales of electricity in interstate
    commerce and are public utilities for purposes of the FPA. FERC
    has granted each of NRG’s generating and power marketing
    companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based
    rates. The FERC’s orders that grant NRG’s generating
    and power marketing companies market-based rate authority
    reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if FERC
    subsequently determines that NRG can exercise market power in
    transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage
    in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, NRG’s
    market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules,
    and if any of NRG’s generating and power marketing
    companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they
    are subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with
    the violation

and/or

suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority.
    If NRG’s generating and power marketing companies were to
    lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be
    required to obtain FERC’s acceptance of a

cost-of-service

rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting,
    record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on
    utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an
    adverse effect on the rates NRG charges for power from its
    facilities.

NRG is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as
    well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost
    allocations, and bidding rules that occur in the existing ISOs.
    The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets
    impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation,
    including price limitations, offer caps, and other mechanisms to
    address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of
    market power in these markets. These types of price limitations
    and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on
    the profitability of NRG’s generation facilities that sell
    energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets.

The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power
    industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several
    years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state
    and federal levels. These changes are ongoing and the Company
    cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets
    or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment
    will have on NRG’s business. In addition, in some of these
    markets, interested parties have proposed material market design
    changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price



mechanism, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets or
    require divestiture by generating companies to reduce their
    market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and
    legislative or other attention to the electric power market
    restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation
    process. If competitive restructuring of the electric power
    markets is reversed, discontinued, or delayed, our business
    prospects and financial results could be negatively impacted.

NRG’s
    ownership interest in a nuclear power facility subjects the
    Company to regulations, costs and liabilities uniquely
    associated with these types of facilities.

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or AEA,
    operation of STP, of which NRG indirectly own a 44.0% interest,
    is subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
    or NRC. Such regulation includes licensing, inspection,
    enforcement, testing, evaluation and modification of all aspects
    of nuclear reactor power plant design and operation,
    environmental and safety performance, technical and financial
    qualifications, decommissioning funding assurance and transfer
    and foreign ownership restrictions. NRG’s 44% share of the
    output of STP represents approximately 1,100 MW of
    generation capacity.

There are unique risks to owning and operating a nuclear power
    facility. These include liabilities related to the handling,
    treatment, storage, disposal, transport, release and use of
    radioactive materials, particularly with respect to spent
    nuclear fuel, and uncertainties regarding the ultimate, and
    potential exposure to, technical and financial risks associated
    with modifying or decommissioning a nuclear facility. The NRC
    could require the shutdown of the plant for safety reasons or
    refuse to permit restart of the unit after unplanned or planned
    outages. New or amended NRC safety and regulatory requirements
    may give rise to additional operation and maintenance costs and
    capital expenditures. STP may be obligated to continue storing
    spent nuclear fuel if the Department of Energy continues to fail
    to meet its contractual obligations to STP made pursuant to the
    U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept and dispose
    of STP’s spent nuclear fuel. See also

“Environmental Matters — U.S. Federal
    Environmental Initiatives — Nuclear Waste”

in
    Item 1. Costs associated with these risks could be
    substantial and have a material adverse effect on NRG’s
    results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. In
    addition, to the extent that all or a part of STP is required by
    the NRC to permanently or temporarily shut down or modify its
    operations, or is otherwise subject to a forced outage, NRG may
    incur additional costs to the extent it is obligated to provide
    power from more expensive alternative sources — either
    NRG’s own plants, third party generators or the
    ERCOT — to cover the Company’s then existing
    forward sale obligations. Such shutdown or modification could
    also lead to substantial costs related to the storage and
    disposal of radioactive materials and spent nuclear fuel.

NRG and the other owners of STP maintain nuclear property and
    nuclear liability insurance coverage as required by law. The
    Price-Anderson Act, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005,
    requires owners of nuclear power plants in the United States to
    be collectively responsible for retrospective secondary
    insurance premiums for liability to the public arising from
    nuclear incidents resulting in claims in excess of the required
    primary insurance coverage amount of $300 million per
    reactor. The Price-Anderson Act only covers nuclear liability
    associated with any accident in the course of operation of the
    nuclear reactor, transportation of nuclear fuel to the reactor
    site, in the storage of nuclear fuel and waste at the reactor
    site and the transportation of the spent nuclear fuel and
    nuclear waste from the nuclear reactor. All other non-nuclear
    liabilities are not covered. Any substantial retrospective
    premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act or losses not
    covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on
    NRG’s financial condition, results of operations or cash
    flows.

NRG is
    subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose
    extensive and increasingly stringent requirements on the
    Company’s ongoing operations, as well as potentially
    substantial liabilities arising out of environmental
    contamination. These environmental requirements and liabilities
    could adversely impact NRG’s results of operations,
    financial condition and cash flows.

NRG’s business is subject to the environmental laws and
    regulations of foreign, federal, state and local authorities.
    The Company must comply with numerous environmental laws and
    regulations and obtain numerous governmental permits and
    approvals to operate our plants. If NRG fails to comply with any
    environmental requirements that apply to its operations, the
    Company could be subject to administrative, civil

and/or

criminal liability and fines, and regulatory agencies could take
    other actions seeking to curtail the Company’s operations.
    In addition, when new requirements take effect or when existing
    environmental requirements are revised, reinterpreted



or subject to changing enforcement policies, NRG’s
    business, results of operations, financial condition and cash
    flows could be adversely affected.

Environmental laws and regulations have generally become more
    stringent over time, and the Company expects this trend to
    continue. In particular, several states in which NRG operates
    have proposed or are in the process of proposing requirements to
    control emissions of NOx,
    SO


,
    and mercury from electric generating units that are more
    stringent than federal regulations. In Delaware, NRG and others
    have appealed portions of such a regulation for the control of
    multiple pollutants to both the Environmental Appeals Board and
    Delaware Superior Court, based not on the required level of
    emissions reductions, but on the timing for achievement of those
    reductions by 2009. We are unable to predict the outcome of
    these appeals.

There is a growing consensus in the U.S. and globally that
    greenhouse gases, or GHG, emissions are linked to global climate
    change. States in the Northeast under RGGI and California under
    AB32 are expected to propose rules to stabilize and reduce GHG
    in the near future. Increased public concern and mounting
    political pressure may result in more regional

and/or

federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG.
    NRG’s U.S. generating portfolio includes coal-, oil-
    and gas-fired plants that are projected to emit approximately
    70 million tons of
    CO


,
    a GHG, for 2007. The Company’s facilities in New York and
    California will be subject to regulation under RGGI and AB32,
    respectively. It is likely that the Company’s
    U.S. plants would also be subject to regulation under any
    new GHG legislation introduced at the state, regional or
    national level. While NRG plans to address the risks of such GHG
    regulations through
    CO


offsets, by supporting
    CO


mitigation research, and by pursuing
    CO


sequestration capable facilities, technologies such as nuclear
    and wind that do not emit GHG, and highly efficient fossil fuel
    projects, the costs of complying with potential GHG regulations
    may be substantial and may have a significant impact on
    NRG’s operations, cash flow and financial position. The
    actual impact of any state, regional or federal GHG regulations
    on NRG will depend on a number of factors including whether GHG
    sources in multiple sectors of the economy are regulated, the
    overall GHG emissions cap level, the degree to which GHG offsets
    are allowed, the degree to which the forward market prices on
    the cost of GHG regulation, the allocation of emission
    allowances to specific sources and the indirect impact of carbon
    regulation on natural gas prices.

A recent court ruling on the appeal of the USEPA Phase II
    316(b) regulation has created uncertainty for power plants that
    use once-through cooling water. Specifically, the ruling
    remanded certain provisions back to the USEPA for
    reconsideration and prohibits certain mitigation technologies,
    including restoration. In light of this ruling, NRG anticipates
    that it will not be able to rely on restoration and cost-benefit
    adjustment at some of its facilities in the West region. In
    addition, the ruling has created some uncertainty with respect
    to approximately 17% of the Company’s other generating
    units that do not have cooling towers. NRG continues to complete
    and analyze fish studies and design solutions which will meet
    the Phase II 316(b) regulation when finalized for all of
    its facilities that use once-through cooling. NRG is closely
    following progress on the final rule, although it is not
    possible to quantify the impact of the revisions at this time.

Certain environmental laws impose strict, joint and several
    liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where
    hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released.
    The Company is generally responsible for all liabilities
    associated with the environmental condition of the
    Company’s power generation plants, including any soil or
    groundwater contamination that may be present, regardless of
    when the liabilities arose and whether the liabilities are known
    or unknown, or arose from the activities of predecessors or
    third parties.

NRG’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by its unionized
    employees.

As of December 31, 2006, approximately 55% of NRG’s
    employees at its U.S. generation plants would have been
    covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event that
    the Company’s union employees strike, participate in a work
    stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strife or
    disruption, NRG would be responsible for procuring replacement
    labor or the Company could experience reduced power generation
    or outages. NRG’s ability to procure such labor is
    uncertain. Strikes, work stoppages or the inability to negotiate
    future collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms could
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.



Changes
    in technology may impair the value of NRG’s power
    plants.

Research and development activities are ongoing to provide
    alternative and more efficient technologies to produce power,
    including fuel cells, clean coal and coal gasification,
    micro-turbines, photovoltaic (solar) cells and improvements in
    traditional technologies and equipment, such as more efficient
    gas turbines. Advances in these or other technologies could
    reduce the costs of power production to a level below what the
    Company has currently forecasted, which could adversely affect
    its cash flow, results of operations or competitive position.

Acts
    of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on NRG’s
    financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

NRG’s generation facilities and the facilities of third
    parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist
    activities, as well as events occurring in response to or in
    connection with them, that could cause environmental
    repercussions

and/or

result in full or partial disruption of the facilities ability
    to generate, transmit, transport or distribute electricity or
    natural gas. Strategic targets, such as energy-related
    facilities, may be at greater risk of future terrorist
    activities than other domestic targets. Any such environmental
    repercussions or disruption could result in a significant
    decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or
    remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flow.

NRG’s
    international investments are subject to additional risks that
    its U.S. investments do not have.

NRG has investments in power projects in Australia, Germany and
    Brazil. International investments are subject to risks and
    uncertainties relating to the political, social and economic
    structures of the countries in which it invests. Risks
    specifically related to our investments in international
    projects may include:

•

fluctuations in currency valuation;

•

currency inconvertibility;

•

expropriation and confiscatory taxation;

•

restrictions on the repatriation of capital; and

•

approval requirements and governmental policies limiting returns
    to foreign investors.

NRG’s
    level of indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to
    raise additional capital to fund its operations, expose it to
    the risk of increased interest rates and limit its ability to
    react to changes in the economy or its industry.

NRG’s substantial debt could have important consequences,
    including:

•

increasing NRG’s vulnerability to general economic and
    industry conditions;

•

requiring a substantial portion of NRG’s cash flow from
    operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and
    interest on its indebtedness, therefore reducing NRG’s
    ability to pay dividends to holders of its preferred or common
    stock or to use its cash flow to fund its operations, capital
    expenditures and future business opportunities;

•

limiting NRG’s ability to enter into long-term power sales
    or fuel purchases which require credit support;

•

exposing NRG to the risk of increased interest rates because
    certain of its borrowings, including borrowings under its new
    senior secured credit facility are at variable rates of interest;

•

limiting NRG’s ability to obtain additional financing for
    working capital including collateral postings, capital
    expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and
    general corporate or other purposes; and

•

limiting NRG’s ability to adjust to changing market
    conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared
    to its competitors who have less debt.

The indentures for NRG’s notes and senior secured credit
    facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants that
    may limit the Company’s ability to engage in activities
    that may be in its long-term best interests.



NRG’s failure to comply with those covenants could result
    in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could
    result in the acceleration of all of the Company’s
    indebtedness.

In addition, NRG’s ability to arrange financing, either at
    the corporate level or at a non-recourse project-level
    subsidiary, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on
    numerous factors, including:

•

general economic and capital market conditions;

•

credit availability from banks and other financial institutions;

•

investor confidence in NRG, its partners and the regional
    wholesale power markets;

•

NRG’s financial performance and the financial performance
    of its subsidiaries;

•

NRG’s level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants
    in debt agreements;

•

maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;

•

cash flow; and

•

provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising
    capital.

NRG may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for
    these or other reasons. The failure to obtain additional capital
    from time to time may have a material adverse effect on its
    business and operations.

Because
    the historical financial information may not be representative
    of the results of operation as a combined company or capital
    structure after the Acquisition, and NRG’s and Texas Genco
    LLC’s historical financial information are not comparable
    to their current financial information, you have limited
    financial information on which to evaluate the combined company,
    NRG and Texas Genco LLC.

Texas Genco LLC did not exist prior to July 19, 2004, and
    Texas Genco LLC and its subsidiaries had no operations and no
    material activities until December 15, 2004 when Texas
    Genco LLC acquired its gas- and coal-fired assets. Consequently,
    Texas Genco LLC’s historical financial information is not
    comparable to the Texas region’s current financial
    information.

NRG and Texas Genco LLC had been operating as separate companies
    prior to February 2, 2006. NRG and Texas Genco LLC had no
    prior history as a combined company, nor have they been
    previously managed on a combined basis. The historical financial
    statements may not reflect what the combined company’s
    results of operations, financial position and cash flows would
    have been had both companies operated on a combined basis and
    may not be indicative of what the combined company’s
    results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be
    in the future.

Goodwill

and/or

other
    intangible assets not subject to amortization that NRG has
    recorded in connection with its acquisitions are subject to
    mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result, the
    Company could be required to write off some or all of this
    goodwill and other intangible assets, which may adversely affect
    the Company’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standard No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, goodwill is not
    amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for
    impairment and other intangibles are also reviewed at least
    annually or more frequently, if certain conditions exist, and
    may be amortized. Any reduction in or impairment of the value of
    goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge
    against earnings which could materially adversely affect
    NRG’s reported results of operations and financial position
    in future periods.

NRG was dismissed from the JCCP 4204 proceeding on July 22,
    2005. On May 17, 2006, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for
    the Southern District of New York granted NRG’s motion to
    disallow all pre-petition claims filed against NRG related to
    the California energy crisis in 2000 and 2001. Plaintiffs did
    not appeal this decision. Several of WCP’s operating
    subsidiaries remain defendants in cases that are part of the
    JCCP 4204 proceeding. The cases in the proceeding allege unfair
    competition, market manipulation and price fixing and all seek
    treble damages, restitution and injunctive relief. The
    defendants, including the WCP subsidiaries, filed a motion to
    dismiss based on the filed rate doctrine and federal preemption
    which was granted on October 3, 2005, and a judgment of
    dismissal with prejudice was entered on October 5, 2005.
    Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on December 2, 2005,
    with the California Court of Appeals — Fourth District
    and on February 26, 2007, the court affirmed the lower
    court’s judgment of dismissal relying on the filed rate
    doctrine and federal preemption. Where WCP or its subsidiaries
    are named, Dynegy is defending them pursuant to an
    indemnification agreement.

    alleges that defendants conspired to manipulate the spot price
    and basis differential of natural gas with respect to the
    California market. The complaint seeks unspecified amounts of
    damages, including a trebling of plaintiff’s and the
    putative class’s actual damages. On April 18, 2005,

(filed November 22, 2005).

The defendants in all of the above referenced cases include WCP
    and various Dynegy entities. NRG is not a defendant. The
    Complaints allege that defendants attempted to manipulate
    natural gas prices in California, and allege violations of
    California’s antitrust law, conspiracy, and unjust
    enrichment. The relief sought in all of these cases includes
    treble damages, restitution and injunctive relief. The
    Complaints assert that WCP is a joint venture between Dynegy and
    NRG, but that Dynegy Marketing and Trade handled all of the
    administrative services and commodity related concerns of WCP.
    Defendants’ motion to dismiss was denied by the Court on
    June 22, 2005, and the cases are in discovery. Dynegy
    entered into a settlement agreement with Plaintiffs on behalf of
    itself and WCP in the

Older

case and the court
    approved the settlement on December 11, 2006. WCP paid no
    defense costs or



settlement funds, as Dynegy owed and provided a complete defense
    and indemnification. In the other cases in this proceedings,
    Dynegy is defending WCP pursuant to an indemnification agreement.

The
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed FERC
    and remanded the case to FERC for further proceedings consistent
    with the decision. This matter concerns, among other contracts
    and other defendants, the California Department of Water
    Resources, or CDWR, and its wholesale power contract with
    subsidiaries of WCP. The case originated with a February 2002
    complaint filed by the State of California alleging that many
    parties, including WCP subsidiaries, overcharged the State. For
    WCP, the alleged overcharges totaled approximately
    $940 million for 2001 and 2002. With respect to WCP, the
    complaint demanded that FERC abrogate the CDWR contract and
    sought refunds associated with revenues collected under the
    contract. In 2003, FERC rejected this demand, denied rehearing,
    and the case was appealed to the Ninth Circuit where oral
    argument was held December 8, 2004. The Ninth Circuit held
    that in FERC’s review of the contracts at issue, FERC could
    not rely on the Mobile-Sierra standard presumption of just and
    reasonable rates, as such contracts were not reviewed by FERC
    with full knowledge of the then-existing market conditions. None
    of the dependents sought rehearing by the Ninth Circuit within
    the requested time period. Because an extension of time will be
    filed shortly, WCP and the other defendants will have until
    April 18, 2007, to seek review by the U.S. Supreme
    Court or they can instead wait for the case to be remanded back
    to FERC. If review before the U.S. Supreme Court is sought,
    the Court will decide in 2007 whether it will accept the appeal.
    At this time, while NRG cannot predict with certainty whether
    WCP will be required to make refunds for rates collected under
    the CDWR contract or estimate the range of any such possible
    refunds, a reconsideration of the CDWR contract by FERC with a
    resulting order mandating significant refunds could have a
    material adverse impact on NRG’s financial condition,
    results of operations, and statement of cash flows. As part of
    the 2006 acquisition of Dynegy’s share of the WCP assets,
    WCP and NRG assumed responsibility for any risk of loss arising
    from this case unless any such loss is deemed to have resulted
    from certain acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct on
    the part of Dynegy, in which case any such loss would be shared
    equally by WCP and Dynegy.

No. 3:01-CV-2373

(AWT), U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut

(filed on November 28, 2001)

—

Connecticut Light & Power Company, or CL&P,
    sought recovery of amounts it claimed it was owed for congestion
    charges under the terms of an October 29, 1999, contract
    between the parties. CL&P withheld approximately
    $30 million from amounts owed to NRG Power Marketing, Inc.,
    or PMI, and PMI counterclaimed. CL&P filed its motion for
    summary judgment to which PMI filed a response on March 21,
    2003. By reason of the stay issued by the bankruptcy court, the
    court has not ruled on the pending motion. On November 6,
    2003, the parties filed a joint stipulation for relief from the
    stay in order to allow the proceeding to go forward, which was
    promptly granted. PMI cannot estimate at this time the overall
    exposure for congestion charges for the full term of the
    contract.

Connecticut Light & Power Company v. NRG

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Docket

Service Dispute

(filed October 9, 2002);

Binding Arbitration —

On July 1,
    1999, Connecticut Light & Power Company, or CL&P,
    and the Company agreed that we would purchase certain CL&P
    generating facilities. The transaction closed on
    December 14, 1999, whereupon NRG took ownership of the
    facilities. CL&P began billing NRG for station service power
    and delivery services provided to the facilities and NRG refused
    to pay, asserting that the facilities self-supplied their
    station service needs. On October 9, 2002, Northeast
    Utilities Services Company, on behalf of itself and CL&P,
    filed a complaint at FERC seeking an order requiring NRG Energy
    to pay for station service and delivery services. On
    December 20, 2002, FERC issued an Order finding that at
    times when NRG is not able to self-supply its station power
    needs, there is a sale of station power from a third-party and
    retail charges apply. CL&P renewed its demand for payment
    which was again refused by NRG. In August 2003, the parties
    agreed to submit the dispute to binding arbitration. In July and
    August 2006,



the parties submitted their respective statements to the three
    member arbitration panel. A discovery and briefing schedule was
    issued and a hearing is set for September 2007.

03-27-000 —

This is the companion action to the above referenced action
    filed by NiMo at FERC asserting the same claims and legal
    theories. On November 19, 2004, FERC denied NiMo’s
    petition and ruled that the Huntley, Dunkirk and Oswego plants
    could net their service station obligations over a 30 calendar
    day period from the day NRG Energy acquired the facilities. In
    addition, FERC ruled that neither NiMo nor the New York Public
    Service Commission could impose a retail delivery charge on the
    NRG facilities because they are interconnected to transmission
    and not to distribution. On April 22, 2005, FERC denied
    NiMo’s motion for rehearing and on October 23, 2006,
    the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied
    rehearing. On January 22, 2007, NiMo filed a petition for
    certiorari seeking review before the U.S. Supreme Court.

CFTC Trading Litigation —

On
    July 1, 2004, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission,
    or CFTC, filed a civil complaint against us in Minnesota federal
    district court, alleging false reporting of natural gas trades
    from August 2001 to May 2002, and seeking an injunction against
    future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. On
    March 16, 2005, the federal district court in Minnesota
    dismissed the case. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals in
    August 2006 reversed the district court’s dismissal. The
    parties have agreed to a settlement in which NRG agreed to give
    the CFTC a $2 million allowed class 5 claim in
    NRG’s bankruptcy proceeding. The settlement agreement was
    approved by the Court on February 13, 2007.

Additional Litigation —

In addition to
    the foregoing, NRG is party to other litigation or legal
    proceedings. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to
    the legal proceedings and investigations described above and
    intends to defend them vigorously. However, litigation is
    inherently subject to many uncertainties. There can be no
    assurance that additional litigation will not be filed against
    the Company or its subsidiaries in the future asserting similar
    or different legal theories and seeking similar or different
    types of damages and relief. Unless specified above, the Company
    is unable to predict the outcome these legal proceedings and
    investigations may have or reasonably estimate the scope or
    amount of any associated costs and potential liabilities. An
    unfavorable outcome in one or more of these proceedings could
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The
    Company also has indemnity rights for some of these proceedings
    to reimburse the Company for certain legal expenses and to
    offset certain amounts deemed to be owed in the event of an
    unfavorable litigation outcome.

Disputed Claims Reserve —

As part of
    NRG’s plan of reorganization, NRG funded a disputed claims
    reserve for the satisfaction of certain general unsecured claims
    that were disputed claims as of the effective date of the plan.
    Under the terms of the plan, as such claims are resolved; the
    claimants are paid from the reserve on the same basis as if they
    had been paid out in the bankruptcy. To the extent the aggregate
    amount required to be paid on the disputed claims exceeds the
    amount remaining in the funded claims reserve, NRG will be
    obligated to provide additional cash and common stock to satisfy
    the claims. Any excess funds in the disputed claims reserve will
    be reallocated to the creditor pool for the pro rata benefit of
    all allowed claims. The contributed common stock and cash in the
    reserves is held by an escrow agent to complete the distribution
    and settlement process. Since NRG has surrendered control over
    the common stock and cash provided to the disputed claims
    reserve, NRG recognized the issuance of the common stock as of
    December 6, 2003 and removed the cash amounts from the
    balance sheet. Similarly, NRG removed the obligations relevant
    to the claims from the balance sheet when the common stock was
    issued and cash contributed.

On April 3, 2006, the Company made a supplemental
    distribution to creditors under the Company’s
    Chapter 11 plan totaling $25 million in cash and
    2,541,000 shares of common stock. As of January 24,
    2007, the reserve held



approximately $9.9 million in cash and approximately
    691,700 shares of common stock. NRG believes the cash and
    stock together represent sufficient funds to satisfy all
    remaining disputed claims.

During the third quarter 2006, as part of the Company’s
    Capital Allocation Program, NRG repurchased approximately
    $750 million of the Company’s common stock in two
    phases. Phase I was a $500 million stock repurchase
    program, which was completed on October 13, 2006, with
    total common stock repurchased of 10,587,700 shares.

Phase II, as originally announced, was to be an additional
    $250 million common stock buyback. This amount was
    subsequently increased to $500 million and Phase II
    commenced during the fourth quarter 2006, bringing the
    Company’s total announced share buyback to $1 billion.
    On November 24, 2006, NRG repurchased 4,212,881 shares
    of NRG common stock from affiliates of the Blackstone Group at a
    price of $55.00 per share as part of Phase II.
    Following this repurchase, the four largest previous
    shareholders of Texas Genco LLC have concluded the sale of all
    of their NRG common stock received pursuant to the Acquisition.
    We expect to complete Phase II during the first half of
    2007.

NRG Energy, Inc.’s Long-Term
    Incentive Plan, or the LTIP, became effective upon the
    Company’s emergence from bankruptcy. The LTIP was
    subsequently approved by the Company’s stockholders on
    August 4, 2004 and was amended on April 28, 2006 to
    increase the number of shares available for issuance to
    8,000,000 and again on December 8, 2006 to make technical
    and administrative changes. The LTIP provides for grants of
    stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
    performance units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalent
    rights.



NRG’s directors, officers and
    employees, as well as other individuals performing services for,
    or to whom an offer of employment has been extended by the
    Company, are eligible to receive grants under the LTIP. The
    purpose of the LTIP is to promote the Company’s long-term
    growth and profitability by providing these individuals with
    incentives to maximize stockholder value and otherwise
    contribute to the Company’s success and to enable the
    Company to attract, retain and reward the best available persons
    for positions of responsibility. The Compensation Committee of
    the Board of Directors administers the LTIP. There were
    4,301,489 and 1,355,193 shares of common stock remaining
    available for grants of awards under NRG’s LTIP as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Energy revenue consists of revenues received from third parties
    for sales in the day-ahead and real-time markets, as well as
    bilateral sales. Beginning in 2006, energy revenues also
    included revenues from the settlement of financial instruments
    that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment.

Capacity revenue consists of revenues received from a third
    party at either the market or negotiated contract rates for
    making installed generation capacity available in order to
    satisfy system integrity and reliability



requirements. In addition, capacity revenue includes revenue
    received under tolling arrangements, which entitle third parties
    to dispatch NRG’s facilities and assume title to the
    electrical generation produced from that facility.

Risk management activities are comprised of fair value changes
    of financial instruments that have yet to be settled as well as
    ineffectiveness on financial transactions accorded cash flow
    hedge accounting treatment. It also includes the settlement of
    all derivative transactions that do not qualify for cash flow
    hedge accounting treatment. Prior to 2006, risk management
    activities included the settlement of financial instruments that
    qualified for cash flow hedge accounting treatment.

Thermal revenue consists of revenues received from the sale of
    steam, hot and chilled water generally produced at a central
    district energy plant and sold to commercial, governmental and
    residential buildings for space heating, domestic hot water
    heating and air conditioning. It also includes the sale of
    high-pressure steam produced and delivered to industrial
    customers that is used as part of an industrial process.

Contract amortization revenues consists of acquired power
    contracts, gas swaps, and certain power sales agreements assumed
    at Fresh Start related to the sale of electric capacity and
    energy in future periods, which are amortized into revenue over
    the term of the underlying contracts based on actual generation
    or contracted volumes.

Hedge Reset is the impact from the net settlement of long-term
    power contracts and gas swaps by negotiating prices to current
    market. This transaction was completed in November 2006.

Other revenue primarily consists of operations and maintenance
    fees, O&M fees, sale of natural gas and emission allowances,
    and revenue from ancillary services. O&M fees consist of
    revenues received from providing certain unconsolidated
    affiliates with services under long-term operating agreements.
    Ancillary services are comprised of the sale of energy-related
    products associated with the generation of electrical energy
    such as spinning reserves, reactive power and other similar
    products.

Executive
    Summary

Overview

NRG Energy, Inc., NRG, or the Company, is a wholesale power
    generation company with a significant presence in major
    competitive power markets in the United States. NRG is primarily
    engaged in the ownership, development, construction and
    operation of power generation facilities, the transacting in and
    trading of fuel and transportation services, and the trading of
    energy, capacity and related products in the United States and
    internationally. As of December 31, 2006, NRG had a total
    global portfolio of 223 active operating generation units at 51
    power generation plants, with an aggregate generation capacity
    of approximately 24,175 MW. Within the United States, the
    Company has one of the largest and most diversified power
    generation portfolios in terms of geography, fuel-type and
    dispatch levels, with approximately 22,940 MW of generation
    capacity in 207 active generating units at 45 plants. These
    power generation facilities are primarily located in Texas,
    (approximately 10,760 MW), and the Northeast (approximately
    7,240 MW), South Central (approximately 2,850 MW) and
    the West (approximately 1,965 MW) regions of the United
    States, with approximately 125 MW from the Company’s
    thermal assets. NRG’s principal domestic power plants
    consist of a diversified mix of natural gas-, coal-, oil-fired
    and nuclear facilities, representing approximately 45%, 34%, 16%
    and 5% of the Company’s total domestic generation capacity,
    respectively. In addition, 15% of NRG’s domestic generating
    facilities have dual or multiple fuel capacity, which allows
    plants to dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option, and consist
    primarily of baseload,



intermediate and peaking power generation facilities, which are
    referred to as the merit order, and also include thermal energy
    production plants. The sale of capacity and power from baseload
    generation facilities accounts for the majority of the
    Company’s revenues and provides a stable source of cash
    flow. In addition, NRG’s diverse generation portfolio
    provides the Company with opportunities to capture additional
    revenues by selling power during periods of peak demand,
    offering capacity or similar products to retail electric
    providers and others, and providing ancillary services to
    support system reliability. In addition, NRG is pursuing
    opportunities to repower existing facilities and develop new
    generation capacity in markets in which NRG currently owns
    assets in an initiative referred to as

Repowering NRG.

In
    connection with NRG’s acquisition of Padoma Wind Power LLC,
    the Company has and will continue to actively evaluate and
    potentially develop or construct domestic terrestrial wind
    projects as part of the

Repowering NRG

program.

Business
    Strategy

NRG’s strategy is to optimize the value of the
    Company’s generation assets while using that asset base as
    a platform for growth and enhanced financial performance which
    can be sustained and expanded upon in the years to come. NRG
    plans to maintain and enhance the Company’s position as a
    leading wholesale power generation company in the United States
    in a cost-effective and risk-mitigating manner in order to serve
    the bulk power requirements of NRG’s existing customer base
    and other entities that offer load or otherwise consume
    wholesale electricity products and services in bulk. NRG’s
    strategy includes the following elements:

Pursue additional growth opportunities at existing
    sites

— NRG is favorably positioned to pursue
    growth opportunities through expansion of its existing
    generating capacity and development of new generating capacity
    at its existing facilities. NRG intends to invest in the
    Company’s existing assets through plant improvements,
    repowerings, brownfield development and site expansions to meet
    anticipated requirements for additional capacity in NRG’s
    core markets. In furtherance of this goal, NRG has initiated a
    company-wide program, known as

Repowering NRG

, to
    develop, construct and operate new and enhanced power generation
    facilities at its existing sites, with an emphasis on new
    baseload capacity that is supported by long-term power sales
    agreements and financed with limited or non-recourse project
    financing. NRG expects that these efforts will provide one or
    more of the following benefits: improved heat rates; lower
    delivered costs; expanded electricity production capability; an
    improved ability to dispatch economically across the merit
    order; increased technological and fuel diversity; and reduced
    environmental impacts, including facilities that either have
    zero greenhouse gas emissions or can be equipped to capture and,
    eventually, sequester greenhouse gas emissions.

Increase value from existing assets

— NRG has a
    highly diversified portfolio of power generation assets in terms
    of region, fuel-type and dispatch levels. NRG will continue to
    focus on extracting value from its portfolio by improving plant
    performance, reducing costs and harnessing the Company’s
    advantages of scale in the procurement of fuels and other
    commodities, parts and services, and in doing so improve the
    Company’s return on invested capital, or ROIC — a
    strategy that NRG has branded

FORNRG,

or Focus on
    ROIC@NRG.

Maintain financial strength and flexibility

—
    NRG remains focused on cash flow and maintaining appropriate
    levels of liquidity, debt and equity in order to ensure
    continued access to capital for investment, to enhance
    risk-adjusted returns and to provide flexibility in executing
    NRG’s business strategy. NRG will continue to focus on
    maintaining operational and financial controls designed to
    ensure that the Company’s financial position remains
    strong. At the same time, NRG expects to continue its practice
    of returning excess cash flows to its debt and equity investors
    on a regular basis.

Reduce the volatility of the Company’s cash flows
    through asset-based commodity hedging activities

—
    NRG will continue to execute asset-based risk management,
    hedging, marketing and trading strategies within well defined
    risk and liquidity guidelines in order to manage the value of
    the Company’s physical and contractual assets. The
    Company’s marketing and hedging philosophy is centered on
    generating stable returns from its portfolio of baseload power
    generation assets while preserving an ability to capitalize on
    strong spot market conditions and to capture the extrinsic value
    of the Company’s intermediate and peaking facilities and
    portions of its baseload fleet. NRG believes that it can
    successfully execute this strategy by leveraging its expertise
    in marketing power and ancillary services, its knowledge of
    markets, its balanced financial structure and its diverse
    portfolio of power generation assets.



Pursue strategic acquisitions and divestures

—
    NRG will continue to pursue selective acquisitions, joint
    ventures and divestitures to enhance its asset mix and
    competitive position in the Company’s core regions to meet
    the fuel and dispatch requirements in these regions. NRG intends
    to concentrate on opportunities that present attractive
    risk-adjusted returns. NRG will also opportunistically pursue
    other strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions or
    divestitures.

Business
    Environment

General Industry

— 2006 was yet another year of
    progress and transition for the power generation industry. The
    industry dynamics and external influences that are most likely
    to significantly affect the Company and the power generation
    industry in 2007 include:

Emissions

— Environmental compliance policies
    on a federal and state level continue to accelerate in a variety
    of ways, presenting challenges to the industry as a result of
    various uncertainties. In the case of
    SO


and NOx, the regulatory regime is well-settled but the
    tightening standards taking effect in 2010 and 2014 have caused
    a need to add capital intensive “back end” controls.
    This remediation requirement has led to dramatic increases in,
    and uncertainty with respect to, the ultimate cost to comply
    with the stricter regulations. In the case of mercury (Hg),
    there is greater regulatory and technical uncertainty as various
    states have imposed, or are intending to impose, tougher
    standards than currently provided for under federal law and the
    technological solutions to comply with such standards are less
    certain both with respect to efficacy and cost. Finally, the
    move towards federal carbon regulation to combat global warming
    is gaining momentum but the timing, shape and ultimate
    disposition of that legislation and the impact it will have are
    unknown.

Consolidation

— Two “mega-utility”
    combinations (FPL Group Inc./Constellation Energy Group and
    Exelon Corp./PSEG) failed due to state regulatory opposition in
    2006. While there are still likely to be some regulated utility
    mergers in the future, mergers and acquisitions activity in the
    power generation sector for the time being are likely to involve
    utility-merchant or merchant-merchant combinations and
    acquisitions by private equity funds or consortia of power
    generation assets, portfolios or entire companies. There may
    also be interest by foreign power companies, particularly
    European utilities, in the American power generation sector.

Infrastructure Development

— In response to
    record peak demand, tightening reserve margins, persistently
    high and volatile natural gas prices and ever increasing
    environmental sensitivity, the power generation industry has
    announced significant expansion plans for both transmission and
    generation. In stark contrast to the previous wave of new power
    generation in the United States, which was almost exclusively
    natural gas-fired, much of the new generation announced around
    the nation has focused on non-gas fuel sources, including coal,
    nuclear and renewable sources.

Capacity Markets

— Considerable progress was
    made in ISO-NE and PJM towards approval and implementation of
    locational capacity markets. The CPUC also took steps towards
    establishing locational capacity requirements, thus a bilateral
    market for capacity. The objective of such market structures is
    to provide timely and accurate market signals to encourage new
    investment in transmission and new generation in the locations
    where the new investment is needed.

Commodity Prices and Volatility

— Commodity
    prices have abated after hitting record highs during 2005. The
    single biggest driver on a national level for the downtrend in
    prices has been driven primarily by mild weather conditions
    resulting in excess gas storage due to below normal withdrawals.
    However, volatility continues to predominate the commodities
    market with many financial and hedge fund players seeking to
    participate and build up their trading positions in the energy
    sector.

Skills Scarcity

— After more than a decade long
    contraction of the power generation industry’s workforce,
    the industry finds itself poised for expansion, but hampered by
    an aging workforce, with current and projected shortages of
    experienced engineers, skilled operators, and maintenance
    workers. This skills deficit also has the potential to hamper
    the power generation industry’s ability to design and
    construct the next wave of power generation infrastructure
    needed in this country.



Competition

Competition

— Wholesale power generation is a
    capital-intensive, commodity-driven business with numerous
    industry participants. NRG competes on the basis of the location
    of its plants and owning multiple plants in its regions, which
    increases the stability and reliability of its energy supply.
    Wholesale power generation is basically a local business that is
    currently highly fragmented relative to other commodity
    industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such,
    there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities,
    resources, nature and identity of the companies NRG competes
    against depending on the market.

Regulatory

As an operator of power plants and a participant in the
    wholesale markets, NRG is subject to regulation by various
    federal and state government agencies. These include CFTC, FERC,
    NRC, PUCT and other public utility commissions in certain states
    where NRG’s generating assets are located. In addition, NRG
    is also subject to the market rules, procedures, and protocols
    of the various ISO markets in which NRG participates. These
    wholesale power markets are subject to ongoing legislative and
    regulatory changes. The Company cannot predict the future design
    of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the
    changing regulatory environment will have on NRG’s
    business. NRG supports the efficient operation of the wholesale
    markets; however, opposition to wholesale power markets has
    increased. Support for the mitigation of sellers has increased
    in order to reduce prices. In some of NRG’s regions,
    interested parties have advocated for material market design
    changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price
    mechanism, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets or
    require divestiture by generating companies to reduce their
    market share.

Weather

Weather conditions in the different regions of the United States
    influence the financial results of NRG’s businesses.
    Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for
    electricity and fuels. Changes in energy supply and demand may
    impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot
    and forward markets, which may affect the Company’s results
    in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of
    electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when
    temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of
    natural gas and oil are higher in the winter. However, all
    regions of North America typically do not experience extreme
    weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG is typically not
    exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its
    business at once.

Other
    Factors

A number of other factors significantly influence the level and
    volatility of prices for energy commodities and related
    derivative products for NRG’s business. These factors
    include:

•

seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand;

•

extreme peak demands;

•

available supply resources;

•

transportation and transmission availability and reliability
    within and between regions;

•

location of NRG’s generating facilities relative to the
    location of its load-serving opportunities;

•

procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical
    electricity system during extreme conditions; and

•

changes in the nature and extent of federal and state
    regulations.

These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices
    in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may
    vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences
    in:

•

weather conditions;

•

market liquidity;



•

capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas
    systems;

•

local transportation systems; and

•

the nature and extent of electricity deregulation.

Impact
    of inflation on NRG’s results

Unless discussed specifically in the relevant segment, for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the impact of
    inflation and changing prices (due to changes in exchange rates)
    on NRG’s revenues and income from continuing operations was
    immaterial.

Capital
    Allocation Strategy

NRG’s capital allocation philosophy includes reinvestment
    in its core facilities, maintenance of prudent debt levels and
    interest coverage, the regular return of capital to shareholders
    and investment in repowering opportunities. Each of these
    components is described further as follows:

•

Reinvestment in Existing Assets — Opportunities to
    invest in the existing business, including maintenance and
    environmental capital expenditures that improve operational
    performance, ensure compliance with environmental laws and
    regulations, and expansion projects.

•

Management of Debt Levels — The Company uses several
    metrics to measure the efficiency of its capital structure and
    debt balances. Generally, the Company’s targeted net debt
    to total capital ratio range is 45% to 60%. The Company intends
    in the normal course of business to continue to manage its debt
    levels towards the lower end of the range and may, from time to
    time, pay down its debt balances for a variety of reasons.

•

Return of Capital to Shareholders — The Company’s
    debt instruments include restrictions on the amount of capital
    that can be returned to shareholders. The Company has in the
    past returned capital to shareholders while maintaining
    compliance with existing debt agreements and indentures. The
    Company expects to regularly return capital either through
    dividends or share repurchases to shareholders.

•

Repowering Opportunities — The Company intends to
    pursue repowering initiatives that enhance and diversify its
    portfolio and provide a targeted economic return to the Company.

Known
    Trends and Uncertainties

•

Initiation of a portfolio repowering effort to add approximately
    10,350 MW of new multi-fuel, multi-technology generation
    capacity at NRG’s existing domestic sites to meet growing
    demand in all of the Company’s core domestic markets.

•

Continued share repurchases through the Company’s Capital
    Allocation Program.

•

Increasing the baseload hedge profile to 59% in 2010, 65% in
    2011 and 24% in 2012, to provide certainty around the
    Company’s future cash flows.

Operating
    Revenues

Total operating revenues were $5,623 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared to $2,430 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of
    $3,193 million. Energy revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 increased $1,323 million from
    $1,870 million to $3,193 million, with 51% contracted
    compared to 2005 when 14% was contracted. The current
    year’s results were favorably impacted by the acquisition
    of Texas Genco LLC, now referred to as the Company’s Texas
    region, which contributed $3,088 million to operating
    revenues including $1,726 million of energy revenues,
    $849 million of capacity revenues and $609 million of
    contract amortization revenues. In addition, the acquisition of
    Dynegy’s 50% interest in WCP contributed $141 million
    to total operating revenues. Excluding the Company’s Texas
    region, the Hedge Reset transaction and WCP, total operating
    revenues for the current year decreased by $36 million.
    Energy revenues, excluding the Texas region and WCP, declined by
    $475 million, or 25%, as generation demand for the
    Northeast region’s intermediate and peaking plants declined
    by 54%, accompanied by a 19% to 23% year over year decline in
    power prices in the Northeast region’s three major markets.
    Reduced revenues due to lower generation were partially offset
    by $446 million in gains from risk management results as
    such activities swung from last year’s loss of
    $292 million to a gain of $154 million, primarily due
    to the decline in settled and forward prices of electricity and
    natural gas.

Capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were
    $1,516 million compared to $563 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $953 million.
    Of this increase, $849 million was related to the
    Company’s Texas region, primarily from auction sales. In
    addition, capacity revenues increased $64 million in the
    West region due to the acquisition of WCP. Increased capacity
    revenues, reflective of higher capacity prices for the New York
    Rest of State market, led to a $30 million increase in the
    Northeast region’s 2006 yearly capacity revenue. The
    South Central region’s capacity revenues also grew by
    $9 million as pricing increased due to increased peak
    demand.

Risk management activities that do not qualify for hedge
    accounting treatment resulted in a total derivative gain of
    approximately $124 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to a $292 million loss for
    the year ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, these losses were comprised of
    $171 million in settled financial revenue losses and
    $295 million of

mark-to-market

gains. The $171 million loss in financial revenues
    represents the settled value for financial instruments that do
    not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and were primarily
    related to $152 million in losses of gas swaps acquired
    with the purchase of Texas Genco LLC. Of the $295 million
    in

mark-to-market

gains, $172 million represents the change in the fair value
    of forward sales of electricity and fuel, including
    $28 million of hedge accounting ineffectiveness related to
    hedge contracts in the Company’s Texas region due to a
    decline in the correlation between natural gas and power prices.
    In addition, $90 million of the $295 million

mark-to-market

gains represents the reversal of

mark-to-market

losses, which ultimately settled as financial revenues. NRG also
    recognized a $33 million gain associated with the
    Company’s trading activity.

Since NRG’s risk management activities are intended to
    mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on revenues and
    cost of energy sold, the changes in these results should not be
    viewed in isolation, but rather taken together with the effects
    of pricing and cost changes on energy revenues (which are
    recorded net of financial instrument hedges that qualify for
    hedge accounting treatment) and costs of energy. In late 2005
    and in 2006, NRG hedged a portion of the Company’s 2006 and
    2007 Northeast region’s generation. Since that time, the
    settled and forward prices of electricity have decreased,
    resulting in the recognition of

mark-to-market

forward sales and the settlement of such positions at reduced
    losses.

Hedge
    Reset

In November 2006, NRG executed a series of transactions designed
    to both extend and strengthen the Company’s baseload
    hedging positions and to enable further optimization of the
    Company’s ongoing Capital Allocation Program. It involved
    net settling legacy Texas region long-term power contracts and
    gas swaps by negotiating prices to current market levels with
    certain counterparties. This resulted in the accelerated
    amortization of approximately $1,073 million of

out-of-market

power contracts and $145 million of gas swaps derivative
    liability offset by a payment of approximately
    $1,347 million to the counterparties, for a net reduction
    of approximately $129 million in the Company’s total
    operating revenues. In addition, as part of NRG’s Hedge
    Reset transactions, the Company recorded $6 million of
    costs related to the transaction.



Cost
    of Operations

Cost of operations includes cost of energy, operating and
    maintenance expenses, and non-income tax expenses. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, cost of operations was
    $3,276 million or 58% of total operating revenues compared
    to $1,838 million, or 76%, of total operating revenues for
    2005, an increase of $1,438 million. This increase in
    absolute terms, but decrease in relative percentage terms, was
    primarily due to the acquisition of the Company’s Texas
    region which incurred costs of $1,669 million. Cost of
    energy which includes fuels, purchased power, and cost contract
    amortization increased from $1,431 million for 2005 to
    $2,460 million in 2006. The increase of $1,029 million
    was primarily due to the Company’s Texas region, which
    incurred $1,276 million in cost of energy and WCP, which
    incurred $79 million of energy cost this year, partially
    offset by lower cost of energy in the Company’s Northeast
    region. Excluding NRG Texas and WCP, cost of energy decreased by
    $326 million. This decrease was driven by $254 million
    in lower cost of energy in the Northeast region, primarily due
    to $143 million lower oil costs and $101 million in
    lower gas fuel costs related to lower generation from oil- and
    gas-fired assets of approximately 70% and 45%, respectively. The
    South Central region’s cost of energy was $66 million
    lower in 2006, as higher coal plant availability and increased
    utilization of the region’s tolling agreements reduced the
    need to purchase energy to support contract load requirements.

Other operating costs increased in 2006 by $410 million to
    $816 million, $393 million related to the acquisition
    of NRG Texas and $33 million for WCP. Excluding the impact
    of NRG Texas and WCP, other operating costs were
    $16 million lower than last year primarily due to lower
    operating and maintenance costs, which benefited in the second
    quarter 2006 from an accrual reversal of $18 million
    related to a favorable court decision in a station service
    dispute at NRG’s Western New York plants. In addition, as
    part of NRG’s Hedge Reset transactions, the Company
    recorded $6 million of costs related to the transaction.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

NRG’s annual depreciation and amortization expense for 2006
    and 2005 was $593 million and $162 million,
    respectively. The Texas region’s depreciation and
    amortization comprised $413 million of the
    $431 million

year-over-year

increase.

General,
    Administrative and Development, or G&A

NRG’s G&A costs for 2006 were $316 million
    compared to $181 million in the previous year. Corporate
    costs represented $143 million, or 3% of 2006 total
    operating revenues and $112 million, or 5% of the
    Company’s 2005 total operating revenues. G&A costs were
    adversely impacted by $6 million of costs associated with
    the unsolicited acquisition offer by Mirant Corporation and
    approximately $14 million of NRG Texas integration costs.
    The balance of the corporate increase was mainly comprised of
    increased staffing and administrative costs after the
    acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. Total G&A costs, excluding
    WCP and the Company’s Texas region remained flat at
    $181 million. NRG also incurred approximately
    $36 million in development expenses in 2006 to support its
    recently announced

Repowering NRG

program.

Equity
    in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates

Equity earnings from NRG’s investments in unconsolidated
    affiliates were $60 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to $104 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005, a decline of approximately
    42%. The decline in earnings was primarily due to the sale of
    certain non-core assets that were completed during 2006 as well
    as the Company’s purchase of WCP. NRG’s purchase of
    the remaining 50% interest in WCP accounted for $21 million
    of the decline, as the results of WCP were fully consolidated as
    of March 31, 2006. As part of that transaction, NRG sold
    its 50% interest in the Rocky Road investment, which accounted
    for $7 million of the decline in total equity earnings. In
    addition, NRG’s Enfield investment, which was sold on
    April 1, 2005, earned $16 million during 2005. Sales
    of other equity investments in 2006 included James River,
    Cadillac and certain Latin American power funds. Declines in
    equity earnings as a result of these sales were partially offset
    by a $4 million improvement in equity income from the
    Company’s MIBRAG investment. MIBRAG experienced improved
    results compared to 2005 as a result of fewer customer outages.



Write
    Downs and Gains/(Losses) on Sales of Equity Method
    Investments

During 2006, NRG continued to divest of its non-core assets by
    selling the Company’s interests in James River and
    Cadillac, as well as interests in certain Latin American power
    funds for a pre-tax loss of $6 million, a pre-tax gain of
    $11 million and a pre-tax gain of $3 million,
    respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, NRG recorded a
    $31 million loss due to the sale and impairment of certain
    equity investments. On April 1, 2005, NRG sold its 25%
    interest in Enfield, resulting in net pre-tax proceeds of
    $65 million and a pre-tax gain of $12 million. In
    2005, NRG also sold its interest in Kendall and recorded a
    pre-tax gain of approximately $4 million. These gains on
    sales were offset by approximately $47 million in
    impairment charges recorded last year. In December 2005, NRG
    executed an agreement with Dynegy to sell the Company’s 50%
    interest in Rocky Road LLC in conjunction with NRG’s
    purchase of Dynegy’s 50% interest in WCP. Based on the
    terms of the transaction which valued the Company’s
    investment in Rocky Road at $45 million, NRG impaired its
    interest in Rocky Road by writing down the value of the
    investment by approximately $20 million. The sale of Rocky
    Road closed on March 31, 2006. In 2005, NRG also recorded
    an impairment of $27 million on its investment in the
    Saguaro power plant. With the expiration of the plant’s
    long-term gas supply contract, the Saguaro power plant became
    exposed to the risk of fluctuating natural gas prices beginning
    in the second half of 2005, triggering a permanent write down of
    NRG’s investment value in Saguaro.

Other
    Income, Net

Other income increased by $102 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 to $160 million compared to the same
    period in 2005. Other income in 2006 was favorably impacted by
    $67 million of income associated with a non-cash settlement
    with an equipment manufacturer related to turbine purchase
    agreements entered into in 1999 and 2001, a $13 million
    non-cash gain associated with the discharge of liabilities upon
    dissolution of an inactive legal entity, and $5 million
    from the favorable settlement with respect to post closing
    adjustments on the acquisition of the Company’s western New
    York plants in 1998 and 1999. In 2005, NRG recorded an
    $11 million gain from the settlement related to the
    Company’s TermoRio project in Brazil and a contingent gain
    of $4 million related to the sale of a former project, the
    Crockett Cogeneration Facility, which was sold in 2002. Other
    income was also favorably impacted in 2006 by $25 million
    of higher interest income related to higher levels of cash and
    more efficient management of cash balances.

Refinancing
    Expenses

Refinancing expenses incurred in 2006 and 2005 were
    $187 million and $65 million, respectively. In the
    first quarter 2006, NRG partially financed the acquisition of
    Texas Genco LLC through borrowings under new debt facilities and
    repaid and terminated previous debt facilities. As a result of
    this financing, the Company incurred $178 million of
    refinancing expenses: $127 million was related to the
    premium paid to NRG’s previous debt holders,
    $34 million for the amortization of the remaining balance
    of a bridge loan commitment entered into on September 30,
    2005, and $31 million related to write-offs of deferred
    financing costs associated with NRG’s previous debt, and a
    credit of $14 million related to a debt premium write-off.
    In 2005, NRG redeemed and purchased a total of approximately
    $645 million of the Company’s second priority notes.
    As a result of the redemption and purchases, NRG incurred
    approximately $54 million in premiums and write-offs of
    deferred financing costs. NRG also incurred an additional
    $11 million in refinancing fees during the fourth quarter
    of 2005 related to the amortization of a bridge loan commitment
    fee that the Company paid related to acquisition financing.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
    $599 million compared to $184 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005. The increase in interest expense
    was primarily due to interest on new debt issued to finance the
    acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. See Item 15 —
    Note 3,

Business Acquisitions and Dispositions

, and
    Note 11,

Debt and Capital Leases

, to the
    consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of
    the acquisition and the related financing. As part of the
    refinancing, NRG replaced its previous senior secured term loan
    with a new $3.575 billion senior secured term loan. In
    addition, NRG retired $1.1 billion of its 8% second
    priority notes and issued $3.6 billion in senior unsecured
    notes with a weighted average interest rate of 7.33%.



In the first quarter 2006, NRG entered into interest rate swaps
    with the objective of fixing the interest rate on a portion of
    the Company’s new Senior Credit Facility. These swaps were
    designated as cash flow hedges under FAS 133, and any
    impact associated with ineffectiveness was immaterial to
    NRG’s financial results. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, NRG had deferred gains of $16 million in
    other comprehensive income associated with these swaps. Also See
    Item 15 — Note 11,

Debt and Capital
    Leases

, to the consolidated financial statements for a
    further discussion on these interest rate swaps. In addition,
    NRG designated an existing

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap, previously as a hedge of NRG’s 8%
    second priority notes, into a fair value hedge of the Senior
    Notes, which NRG closed on February 2, 2006.

Income
    Tax Expense

Income tax expense was approximately $325 million and
    approximately $47 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The overall
    effective tax rate was approximately 36.9% and 39.5% for the
    years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31,
    2006 and 2005 differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35%
    due to a basis difference relating to disbursements from the
    Company’s disputed claims reserve, a change in the
    Company’s state effective income tax rate due to the
    acquisition of the Company’s Texas region, and the
    Company’s earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are
    taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate.

The Company’s effective income tax rate may vary from
    period to period depending on, among other factors, the
    Company’s geographic and business mix of earnings and
    losses and the Company’s adjustment of valuation allowance
    in accordance with SFAS 109. These factors and others,
    including the Company’s history of pre-tax earnings and
    losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to
    realize the Company’s deferred tax assets. The
    Company’s valuation allowance has been reduced in 2006 due
    to earnings generated from business operations and due to the
    acquisition of the Company’s Texas region.

Income
    from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax
    Expense

NRG classifies as discontinued operations the income from
    operations and gains/losses recognized on the sale of projects
    that were sold or were deemed to have met the required criteria
    for such classification pending final disposition. For the years
    ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, NRG recorded income from
    discontinued operations, net of income tax expense of
    $66 million and $12 million, respectively.
    Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,
    2006 were comprised of the results of Flinders, Audrain and
    Resource Recovery. Discontinued operations for 2005 consisted of
    the results of the Flinders, Audrain, Resource Recovery,
    Northbrook New York LLC, Northbrook Energy LLC and NRG McClain
    LLC. NRG closed on the sale of Flinders during the third quarter
    2006 and recognized an after-tax gain of approximately
    $60 million from the sale. Discontinued operations for the



full year 2005 included an $11 million gain on the
    disposition of NRG’s Northbrook New York and Northbrook
    Energy operations.

Total
    Operating Revenues

Total operating revenues were $2,430 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 compared to $2,104 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of
    $326 million. Energy revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 increased $665 million from
    $1,205 million to $1,870 million. Of the
    $1,870 million, 86% was merchant as compared to 66% for the
    year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in energy
    revenue was driven by both increased prices and increased
    merchant generation from the Company’s Northeast assets.
    Energy revenues from NRG’s domestic coal assets increased
    by $314 million, primarily due to increased power prices,
    as generation from the Company’s domestic coal-fired assets
    decreased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared
    to the same period in 2004. This decrease in generation was due
    to both planned and unplanned outages at the Company’s
    Huntley, Indian River, and Big Cajun II plants during the
    second and fourth quarters of 2005. Energy revenues from
    NRG’s gas-fired assets in New York City increased by
    $176 million, which included $23 million in NYISO
    final settlement payments. Of the remaining $153 million
    increase, price and generation contributed equally. Energy
    revenues from NRG’s oil-fired assets rose by
    $209 million, 86% due to higher volumes following an
    increase in summer demand as the generation from these assets
    increased by 122% for the year ended December 31, 2005,
    compared to the same period in 2004. In addition, a one-time
    payment of $39 million from the Connecticut Light and Power
    settlement contributed to energy revenue during the second
    quarter of 2004.

Capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 were
    $563 million compared to $612 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2004, a reduction of $49 million.
    The decrease in capacity revenues compared to the prior year was
    primarily due to a loss of $56 million in capacity revenues
    from the Company’s Kendall facility, which was sold in the
    fourth quarter of 2004, and the expiration of the South Central
    region’s Rockford tolling agreement, which expired in May
    2005 and reduced capacity revenues by $23 million. Capacity
    revenues from the Company’s western New York plants
    decreased by $10 million due to the addition of new
    generation and increased imports in New York, which depressed
    capacity prices for the Company’s assets in the western New
    York market during the first half of 2005. This loss was offset
    by a $44 million increase in capacity revenues from the
    Company’s Connecticut assets, of which $24 million was
    related to the Connecticut RMR settlement agreement.

Thermal revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
    2004 were $124 million and $112 million, respectively.
    Increased generation due to the warmer weather during the summer
    of 2005 and an increase in contract rates from the
    Company’s thermal operations positively contributed to the
    improved results.

Other revenues include emission allowance sales, natural gas
    sales, and expense recovery revenues. For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, other revenues totaled
    $165 million, compared to $114 million for the same
    period in 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher
    emission allowance revenues and higher physical gas sales, which
    were partially offset by lower expense recovery revenues. The
    increase in gas sales of approximately $32 million was
    primarily related to a new gas sale agreement entered into in
    the third quarter of 2005 by the South Central region, where
    revenues from gas sales increased by $23 million. NRG
    entered into this agreement in conjunction with power purchase
    agreements to minimize market purchases by the region during
    peak months. Finally, expense recovery revenues in 2005 were
    $29 million lower compared to 2004. Expense recovery
    revenues associated with the Company’s Connecticut RMR
    agreements reached its maximum payment during the first quarter
    2005.

Risk Management Activity

— The total derivative
    loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 was approximately
    $292 million, comprised of $138 million in settled
    financial revenue losses and $154 million of

mark-to-market

losses. The $138 million loss in financial revenues
    represents the settled value for the year 2005 of financial
    instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
    Of the $154 million of

mark-to-market

losses, $122 million represented the change in fair value
    of forward sales of electricity and fuel, and $59 million
    represented the reversal of

mark-to-market

gains which ultimately settled as financial revenues. These
    activities primarily supported the Company’s Northeast
    assets.

Since NRG’s economic hedging activities are intended to
    mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on revenues and
    cost of energy sold, the changes in such results should not be
    viewed in isolation, but rather taken together with the effects
    of pricing and cost changes on energy revenues and costs of
    energy. In the fourth quarter of 2004 and during the course of
    2005, NRG hedged much of its calendar year 2005 and 2006
    Northeast generation. Since that time, the settled and forward
    prices of electricity have risen, driven by the extreme weather
    conditions in the summer of 2005. While this increase in
    electricity prices benefited NRG’s generation portfolio
    compared to 2004 with higher energy revenues, it is also the
    reason for the

mark-to-market

recognition of the forward sales and the settlement of positions
    as losses.

Cost
    of Operations

Cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
    $1,838 million. Cost of operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2004 was $1,290 million, or 61% of total
    operating revenues. The increase was primarily related to higher
    cost of energy, which increased by $506 million to
    $1,431 million, or 59% of revenues, for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, from $925 million, or 44% of
    revenues for the same period, in 2004. The increase in cost of
    energy as a percentage of revenues was driven by both higher
    prices and generation in the Company’s Northeast region and
    higher purchased energy and gas sales in the Company’s
    South Central region. Total gas costs increased by
    $162 million, with $124 million attributable to the
    Company’s New York City assets, of which approximately
    $15 million was due to increased gas purchases for resale
    and approximately $67 million was due to increased
    generation. The South Central region’s gas costs also
    increased by $31 million due to physical gas purchases
    related to a new gas sale agreement entered into in the third
    quarter of 2005 to support certain tolling arrangements. Total
    oil costs for the Company increased by $164 million, 65%
    due to increased generation from the Company’s oil-fired
    assets, with the remainder due to an increase in price. Total
    coal costs increased by $71 million as a result of higher
    coal prices for the Company’s domestic coal-fired assets,
    as overall generation from the Company’s coal-fired assets
    decreased for the year ended December 31, 2005 by 5%,
    compared to the same period in 2004, due to both planned and
    forced outages at the Company’s Huntley, Indian River and
    Big Cajun II facilities. The increase in coal prices was
    related to new low-sulfur coal and rail contracts, which became
    effective in April 2005. In addition, NRG’s Indian River
    plant, which uses a higher portion of eastern coal, experienced
    a significant cost increase in 2005. The Company has increased
    its percentage blend of low-sulfur coal over the year as
    compared to the same period last year. This had the effect of
    mitigating the increase in coal and coal transportation costs,
    as low sulfur coal prices have not increased as much as regular
    coal prices. Total purchased energy increased by
    $102 million due to increases at the Company’s South
    Central region. Higher long-term contract load demand due to the
    extreme weather, a

100-MW

around-the-clock

sale to Entergy, a tolling agreement, and the forced outages
    during the second quarter 2005, required South Central to
    purchase energy to meet its contract load obligations.

Other operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2005
    totaled $406 million compared to $365 million in the
    comparable period of 2004, an increase of $41 million. This
    increase was driven by a $34 million increase in normal and
    maintenance costs as a result of more major maintenance projects
    and extensive outages in 2005



compared to 2004. The low-sulfur coal conversions and turbine
    overhauls of the Company’s western New York plants and
    Indian River plant was a main focus for many of the major
    maintenance and outages in 2005. The South Central region also
    went through a significant outage to install a
    low-NO

x

burner on one of its units and an additional outage was
    completed in the fall of 2005 to address reliability issues
    experienced at the Big Cajun II unit earlier in the year.
    In 2004, a settlement with a third party vendor regarding
    auxiliary power charges reduced 2004 operating and maintenance
    expenses by $7 million.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 was approximately
    $162 million and $179 million, respectively. The
    decrease in depreciation and amortization from 2005 to 2004 was
    primarily due to the 2004 sale of the Company’s Kendall
    plant, which contributed approximately $14 million in
    depreciation and amortization expense during 2004.

General,
    Administrative and Development, or G&A

G&A costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 were
    $181 million, compared to $197 million for the same
    period in 2004, a decrease of $16 million. Corporate costs
    represented $108 million, or 4% of revenues and
    $132 million, or 6% of revenues, for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. G&A costs
    were favorably impacted by approximately $11 million in
    reduced bad debt expense associated with notes receivable from
    third parties. In addition, external consulting expenses
    decreased in 2005 as compared to 2004 by approximately
    $12 million, primarily related to reduced tax and legal
    consulting. These favorable impacts were offset by a
    $5 million increase in information technology related
    expenses, primarily associated with increased compliance costs
    related to Sarbanes Oxley and the relocation of the
    Company’s corporate headquarters from Minneapolis.

Corporate
    Relocation Charges

For the year ended December 31, 2005, charges related to
    the company’s corporate relocation activities were
    approximately $6 million, as compared to $16 million
    in 2004. Included in 2005’s charges was approximately
    $3 million related to lease abandonment charges associated
    with the Company’s former Minneapolis office, with the
    remainder related to relocation, recruitment and transition
    costs. In 2004, NRG recorded $16 million primarily related
    to employee severance and termination benefits and
    employee-related transition costs. NRG completed the physical
    move of the Company’s corporate headquarters in 2004 when
    the majority of costs were incurred.

Equity
    in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates

For the year ended December 31, 2005, equity earnings from
    the Company’s investments in unconsolidated affiliates were
    $104 million compared to $160 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $56 million.
    NRG’s earnings in WCP accounted for $22 million and
    $69 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. The decrease in WCP’s equity earnings
    was due to the expiration of the CDWR contract in December 2004.
    The equity earnings of the Company’s Enfield investment
    were $13 million lower for the year ended December 31,
    2005 as compared to the same period in 2004, which was sold on
    April 1, 2005. In addition, for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the results of the Company’s
    Enfield investment included approximately $12 million of
    unrealized gains associated with

mark-to-market

increases in the fair value of energy-related derivative
    instruments, compared to $23 million of unrealized gains
    for the same period in 2004.

Other equity investments included in the Company’s 2005
    results included MIBRAG and Gladstone, which comprised
    $26 million and $24 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, respectively. For the comparable period
    in 2004, MIBRAG and Gladstone earned $21 million and
    $18 million, respectively. MIBRAG’s equity earnings
    for 2004 were negatively impacted by an outage at the
    Company’s Schkopau plant; in addition, MIBRAG recorded a
    lower asset retirement obligation in 2005 as compared to 2004.
    Gladstone’s earnings in 2005 were greater than 2004 due to
    lower major maintenance expense.



Write
    Downs and Gains/(Losses) on Sales of Equity Method
    Investments

For the year ended December 31, 2005, NRG recorded a
    $31 million loss due to the sale and impairment of certain
    equity investments as the Company continued the divestiture of
    its non-core assets. On April 1, 2005, NRG sold its 25%
    interest in Enfield, resulting in net pre-tax proceeds of
    $65 million and a pre-tax gain of $12 million,
    including post-closing working capital adjustments. In 2005, NRG
    also sold its interest in Kendall for $5 million in pre-tax
    proceeds and a pre-tax gain of approximately $4 million.
    These gains on sales were offset by approximately
    $47 million in impairment charges recorded during the year.

In December 2005, NRG executed an agreement with Dynegy to sell
    the Company’s 50% interest in Rocky Road LLC in conjunction
    with NRG’s purchase of Dynegy’s 50% interest in WCP.
    Based on the terms of the transaction, which valued the
    Company’s investment in Rocky Road at $45 million, NRG
    impaired its interest in Rocky Road by writing down the value of
    the investment by approximately $20 million. NRG also
    recorded an impairment of $27 million on its investment in
    Saguaro. With the expiration of its gas supply contract, Saguaro
    began recording operating losses during the second half of 2005,
    triggering a permanent write down to NRG’s investment value
    in Saguaro.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, NRG sold its Loy Yang
    investment, which resulted in a $1 million loss, the
    Company’s interest in Commonwealth Atlantic Limited
    Partnership for a $5 million loss, and several NEO
    investments for a $4 million loss. These losses were offset
    by a $1 million gain associated with the sale of Calpine
    Cogeneration. Also during 2004, NRG recorded a $7 million
    impairment charge on its investment in James River LLC based on
    an estimated sale value from a prospective buyer.

Other
    Income, Net

For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company’s
    other income increased by $36 million as compared to the
    same period in 2004, to $58 million. Other income in 2005
    was favorably impacted by a $14 million gain from the
    settlement related to the Company’s TermoRio project in
    Brazil and a gain of approximately $4 million related to
    the resolution of a contingency from the sale of a former
    project, the Crockett Cogeneration Facility, which was sold in
    2002. Other income in 2005 was also favorably impacted by
    $14 million of higher interest income related to more
    efficient management of the Company’s cash balances. These
    favorable results were offset by a $3 million reserve
    relating to the ongoing TermoRio litigation.

Refinancing
    Expenses

Refinancing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005
    and 2004 were $65 million and $72 million,
    respectively. During 2005, as part of the Company’s
    continuing effort to manage its capital structure, NRG redeemed
    and purchased a total of $645 million of its second
    priority notes. As a result of the redemption and purchases, the
    Company incurred $55 million in premiums and write-offs of
    deferred financing costs. NRG also incurred an additional
    $11 million in refinancing fees during 2005 related to the
    amortization of a bridge loan commitment fee that the Company
    paid related to the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC.

As part of the Company’s financing in connection with the
    acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, NRG paid a bridge loan
    commitment fee of approximately $45 million to ensure that
    the Company would have the proper financing in place for the
    acquisition. This amount was amortized over time, and during
    2005 NRG amortized approximately $11 million to refinancing
    expense. The remaining balance of this amount was expensed
    during the first quarter of 2006 as the Company finalized the
    financing related to the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, NRG refinanced
    certain amounts of the Company’s term loans with additional
    corporate level debt on better terms, which resulted in
    $15 million of prepayment penalties and a $15 million
    write-off of deferred financing costs. Additionally, NRG
    refinanced its Senior Credit Facility in December 2004 and
    recorded $14 million of prepayment penalties and a
    $27 million of write-off related to the Company’s
    deferred financing costs.



Interest
    Expense

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
    $184 million as compared to $255 million for the same
    period in 2004, a reduction of $71 million. Interest
    expense was favorably impacted by the sale of the Kendall
    facility, which incurred $25 million of interest expense
    for the year ended December 31, 2004. Additionally, the
    refinancing of the Company’s Senior Credit Facility on
    December 23, 2004, lowered the interest related to the
    Facility by 212.5 basis points. In addition, the redemption and
    purchases of $645 million of the Company’s second
    priority notes during 2005 reduced interest expense on the
    Company’s corporate debt by approximately $50 million.

Income
    Tax Expense

Income tax expense was approximately $47 million and
    $74 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. The overall effective tax rate was 39.5% and
    32.3% for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 differ from the
    U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to the Company’s
    earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are taxed at rates
    lower than the U.S. statutory rate. NRG’s 2005
    domestic effective income tax increased due to the gain on the
    sale of the Company’s Enfield investment and the taxable
    dividend received pursuant to the American Job Creation Act of
    2004.

The Company’s effective income tax rate may vary from
    period to period depending on, among other factors, the
    Company’s geographic and business mix of earnings and
    losses and the adjustment of valuation allowances in accordance
    with SFAS 109. These factors and others, including the
    Company’s history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken
    into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax
    assets.

Income
    from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax
    Expense

For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, NRG
    recorded income from discontinued operations, net of income
    taxes of approximately $12 million and $31 million,
    respectively, as the Company continued to divest certain
    non-core assets. Discontinued operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 consist of Flinders, Audrain, Resource
    Recovery, the Northbrook New York and Northbrook Energy assets
    and various expenses related to the final settlements of
    McClain. For the year ended December 31, 2004, discontinued
    operations consisted of the results of Flinders, Audrain,
    Resource Recovery, the two Northbrook entities, McClain,
    Penobscot Energy Recovery Company, or PERC, Compania Boliviana
    De Energia Electrica S.A. Bolivian Power Company Limited, or
    Cobee, Hsin Yu, LSP Energy (Batesville) and four NEO Corporation
    projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO Prima
    Deshecha and NEO Tajiguas LLC). With the exception of Flinders,
    Audrain, Resource Recovery, Northbrook New York and Northbrook
    Energy, all discontinued operations were sold prior to
    December 31, 2004.

Operating
    Income

For the year ended December 31, 2006, operating income for
    the Texas region was $881 million. A strong operating
    performance from the region’s fleet contributed to these
    results, with the region’s generating capacity operating at
    90.7% availability, including baseload availability of 91.6%.
    Total generation for the year was approximately 45 million
    MWh, of which 74% were sold under long-term agreements, with
    total generation sold of approximately 46 million MWh. The
    difference between MWh sold and MWh generated represents MWh
    purchased from the marketplace. In August 2006, ERCOT set a new
    record for peak demand of 63,056 MWh on August 17, which
    the region’s baseload and gas assets met. The strong
    operating performance was partially offset by approximately
    $135 million in losses associated with the Company’s
    Hedge Reset transaction.



Operating
    Revenues

Total operating revenues from the Texas region for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 were approximately
    $3,088 million. Operating revenues included
    $1,726 million in energy revenues, of which 73% were
    contracted. Capacity revenues totaled $849 million, of
    which $343 million was related to capacity sales from the
    Company’s investment in the STP nuclear generation
    facility. In addition, the region recorded $609 million of
    contract amortization revenues. For a further discussion on
    NRG’s Hedge Reset transaction, see the

    Results of Operations

and Item 15 —
    Note 6,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities.

Risk Management Activity

— The total derivative
    loss for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
    $30 million, which was comprised of $152 million in
    losses associated with the settled positions of gas swaps, which
    were offset by $28 million in gains related to hedge
    accounting ineffectiveness due to a change in the correlation
    between natural gas and power prices, as well as
    $94 million in gains representing the change in the fair
    value of forward sales of electricity.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy for the Texas region was approximately
    $1,276 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    Coal and lignite costs were $473 million for the year, gas
    fuel costs were $545 million and nuclear fuel-related
    expenses were $56 million. These costs directly relate to
    the generation from the Texas region’s coal-fired,
    gas-fired and nuclear-fired units. Coal costs included
    $113 million of lignite coal used at the region’s
    Limestone coal plant. Also included in cost of energy was an
    emissions allowance expense of $39 million, purchased power
    of $69 million, and $85 million in cost contract
    amortization.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses for the Texas region for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 were $518 million, or 17% of the
    region’s total operating revenues. These costs include
    $335 million of operating and maintenance expenses of which
    53% represents normal and major maintenance expenses. The
    $177 million of normal and major maintenance expenses was
    comprised of $80 million related to spring and fall planned
    outages at the region’s W.A. Parish and Limestone plants.
    Due to these outages, both plants gained capacity via uprates.
    The region’s gas plants also incurred approximately
    $31 million in maintenance costs related to outages, while
    STP incurred approximately $66 million in maintenance
    costs, primarily related to refueling outages. The Texas region
    also recorded approximately $57 million in property tax
    expense. In addition, the Texas region incurred
    $125 million of G&A expense, of which $50 million
    was related to corporate allocations and $14 million
    related to development cost in support of the region’s

Repowering NRG

program.

Operating
    Income

For the year ended December 31, 2006, operating income for
    the Northeast region was $461 million, compared to
    $218 million for the same period in 2005, an increase of
    $243 million. This increase was due to $144 million in

mark-to-market

gains from risk management activities, compared to a
    $285 million loss for the year ended December 31,
    2005. The favorable gain from risk management activities was
    largely due to weak forward power prices, which resulted in
    substantial unrealized gains in the region’s forward
    positions for the year ended December 31, 2006. Power
    prices were weaker in 2006 relative to 2005, driven by gas price
    volatility following Hurricanes Rita and Katrina in 2005, and a
    mild winter in January, February and December. The mild weather
    reduced demand for natural gas, with average prices falling as
    much as 22% year over year. Falling natural gas prices reduced
    annual average power prices in the New York, NEPOOL and PJM
    markets by 23%, 20% and 19%, respectively. The mild weather also
    led to an 18% decline in power generation for the Company’s
    Northeast region to 13.3 million MWh in 2006, compared to
    16.2 million MWh in 2005. Declines in generation from the
    region’s oil-fired assets declined by nearly 2 million
    MWh, representing 66% of the overall Northeast region’s
    generation



decrease. Half of this decline was attributable to the
    region’s Western New York plants, which had more run
    time in 2005 due to that year’s cold January winter.

Total
    Operating Revenues

Total operating revenues from NRG’s Northeast region
    totaled $1,543 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006, compared to $1,554 million for the same period in
    2005, a decrease of $11 million. Revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 included $966 million in
    energy revenues, compared to $1,444 million for the same
    period in 2005, a decrease of $478 million. Of this
    $478 million decrease, $318 million can be attributed
    to the region’s New York assets, which reflect lower
    generation from the region’s Oswego plant and lower
    realized price from generation from the region’s baseload
    coal plants. In addition, the region had $23 million of
    adjustments in 2005 relating to prior year NYISO settlements and
    a $6 million reversal of a reserve due to a favorable court
    decision regarding spinning reserve payments.

Capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were
    $321 million, compared to $291 million for the same
    period in 2005. Of this increase, $28 million was due to
    higher capacity revenues in the New York State market. New York
    capacity revenues outside of New York City drove the increase in
    2006, as increased demand for capacity, coupled with a decline
    in imports of capacity into the market, pushed clearing prices
    higher. Capacity prices were also favorably impacted in the
    region’s New England market by $16 million due to the
    new LFRM market and the new transition capacity market. The
    Northeast region also earned $9 million more in RMR
    payments in 2006 with the approval of new RMR agreements. These
    were partially offset by $23 million of reserve reversals
    in 2005 following the settlement of prior year RMR agreements.

Other revenues which include emission allowance sales, natural
    gas sales, and expense recovery revenues, totaled
    $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to $104 million in the same period in 2005, an
    increase of $8 million. This increase was primarily related
    to $17 million in higher emission allowance sales as the
    Company sold emission allowances in lieu of generation during
    the first quarter 2006. Higher emission allowance revenues were
    partially offset by lower gas sales of $2 million, lower
    ancillary revenues of $3 million and lack of cost recovery
    revenues of $5 million related to the 2005 RMR agreements.

Risk Management Activity

— The total derivative
    gain for the year was $144 million, comprised of
    $10 million in financial revenue losses and
    $154 million of unrealized

mark-to-market

gains. The $10 million loss of financial revenues
    represents the settled value for the year of all financial
    instruments, including financial swaps and options on power. Of
    the $154 million of

mark-to-market

gains, $50 million represented the fair value of forward
    sales of electricity and fuel transactions to support the
    region’s physical asset position, with $14 million of

mark-to-market

losses related to trading activity. In addition,
    $90 million represented the reversal of

mark-to-market

losses, which ultimately settled as financial revenues. In 2005,
    the total derivative loss was $285 million comprised of
    $132 million in financial revenue losses and
    $153 million

mark-to-market

losses.

Hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk of
    commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy sold.
    The changes in such results should not be viewed in isolation,
    but rather taken together with the effects of pricing and cost
    changes on energy revenues and cost of energy. Thus, while the
    2006 decrease in electricity prices adversely impacted the
    region’s generation portfolio compared to the prior year,
    it was also favorably impacted by positive

mark-to-market

gains on the region’s forward sales and the settlement of
    positions as smaller losses as compared with the prior year.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy was $615 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. This was a decrease of $254 million
    compared to the same period in 2005. The decrease was primarily
    attributable to an 18% decline in generation from the
    region’s generation assets. Oil fuel costs in the Northeast
    region decreased by $143 million, as the decline in
    oil-fired generation accounted for 66% of the total decline in
    generation volume. Gas fuel costs for the Northeast region
    decreased by $101 million. Coal costs increased by
    $11 million, despite slightly lower generation, primarily
    due to higher rail transportation costs. Emission allowance
    amortization costs declined in 2006 by $18 million,
    primarily due to lower generation, which resulted in lower
    consumption of emission allowances.



Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses for the Northeast region were
    $378 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a
    decrease of $15 million compared to the same period in
    2005. Maintenance expense increased by $15 million in 2006
    primarily due to more extensive boiler tube work at the
    region’s Dunkirk and Arthur Kill plants to reduced forced
    outage hours and additional turbine maintenance and oil tank
    repair costs at the region’s Oswego facility. Offsetting
    higher maintenance cost, was a decrease in plant utilities by
    $20 million. This was primarily due to a favorable court
    decision in the second quarter 2006 that allowed the Northeast
    region to reverse into earnings $18 million of previously
    accrued station power expense. General and administrative costs
    decreased by $10 million in 2006, primarily due to
    increased personnel and external consulting costs incurred to
    advance the region’s

Repowering NRG

program. During
    2006, the Northeast region incurred $8 million in
    expenditures to advance its regional redevelopment efforts. This
    increase was offset by $8 million in lower insurance costs
    and $14 million in lower corporate allocation.

    compared to 2004

Operating
    Income

For the year ended December 31, 2005, operating income for
    the Northeast region was $218 million, compared to
    $318 million for the same period in 2004, a decrease of
    $100 million. This decrease was primarily due to
    $121 million net

mark-to-market

losses reported by the Northeast associated with forward sales
    of electricity, compared to a $59 million net

mark-to-market

gain recorded in 2004. Excluding

mark-to-market

losses, the Northeast region’s operating income increased
    by $21 million. This increase was largely due to increased
    power prices, wider dark spread margins, and increased
    generation from the region’s gas- and oil-fired assets.
    With higher than average temperatures in the summer of 2005,
    on-peak electricity prices increased 43% to 52% compared to
    2004, while gas and oil prices increased 50% and 49%. Spark
    spreads on the region’s gas and coal margins widened, while
    oil margins were compressed compared to the same period in 2004.
    The Northeast region’s New York City assets benefited from
    increased spark spreads and with increased generation output, by
    53% compared to 2004, from 1.1 million MWh to
    1.7 million MWh, due to increased summer demand. Generation
    from the Northeast region’s oil-fired assets increased by
    120%, but oil margins decreased by 25% compared to 2004, as cost
    per MWh increased by 29% in comparison to the same period in
    2004, due to an offsetting increase in oil prices.

Total
    Operating Revenues

Total operating revenues from the Northeast region totaled
    $1,554 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    compared to $1,251 million for the same period in 2004, an
    increase of $303 million. Revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 included $1,444 million in energy
    revenues compared to $853 million for the same period in
    2004. Of this $591 million increase, $183 million can
    be attributed to the region’s New York City assets. Due to
    outages of local competitors and extreme summer heat, generation
    from the region’s New York City assets increased by 53% for
    the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year
    ended December 31, 2004. Excluding $23 million of
    final NYISO settlement payments, increased generation accounted
    for 49% of the increase in New York City energy revenues. The
    region’s oil-fired assets earned $211 million more in
    energy revenues due to increased generation by 120% during 2005
    compared to 2004; 86% of the increase in energy revenues was due
    to increased generation. The region’s coal assets recorded
    higher energy revenues of $99 million, primarily due to
    higher power prices as generation from the region’s coal
    assets had a minimal decrease for the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

Capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 were
    $291 million, compared to $265 million for the same
    period in 2004. Capacity revenues were favorable compared to the
    previous year due to $24 million of additional capacity
    revenues recorded during the second quarter of 2005 in
    connection with the region’s Connecticut RMR settlement
    agreement approved by FERC on January 22, 2005. These
    settlement revenues were offset, however, by lower capacity
    revenues from the region’s western New York plants.
    Capacity prices in western New York were negatively impacted by
    the addition of new capacity supply and increased imports into
    the state.

Other revenues which include emission allowance sales, natural
    gas sales and expense recovery revenues, totaled
    $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    compared to $81 million for the year ended 2004, an
    increase of $23 million. This increase was related to
    $43 million in emission allowance sales and $6 million
    in higher gas sales. These increases were partially offset by
    $29 million in lower expense recovery revenues related to
    the Connecticut RMR agreement. The region reached its maximum
    payment under that agreement during the first quarter of 2005.

Risk Management Activity

— The total derivative
    loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 was approximately
    $285 million, comprised of $132 million in financial
    revenue losses and $153 million of

mark-to-market

losses. The $132 million loss in financial revenues
    represented the settled value for the year of financial
    instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
    Of the $153 million of

mark-to-market

losses, $121 million represented the change in fair value
    of forward sales of electricity and fuel, $59 million
    represented the reversal of

mark-to-market

gains, which ultimately settled as financial revenues, and
    $27 million in gains were associated with trading
    activities.

Since hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk of
    commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy sold,
    the changes in such results should not be viewed in isolation,
    but rather taken together with the effects of pricing and cost
    changes on energy revenues and costs of energy. In the fourth
    quarter of 2004 and over the



course of 2005, NRG hedged much of its calendar year 2005 and
    2006 Northeast region’s generation. Since that time and
    during the third quarter 2005 in particular, the settled and
    forward prices of electricity rose, driven by the extreme
    weather conditions this summer. While this increase in
    electricity prices benefited the region’s generation
    portfolio compared to the prior year with higher energy
    revenues, it was also the reason for the

mark-to-market

recognition of the forward sales and the settlement of positions
    as losses.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy increased by $348 million for the Northeast
    region for the year ended December 31, 2005 to
    $869 million, compared to the same period in 2004. Oil fuel
    costs in the region increased by $162 million, where 65% of
    the increase was due to increased generation with the
    region’s gas fuel costs increasing by $129 million.
    Higher gas sales from the region’s New York City assets
    drove $15 million of the increase, with $109 million
    of the increase related to higher prices and demand for the
    region’s New York City assets. Coal costs increased by
    $61 million, due to increased prices, although the
    region’s coal-fired generation had a minimal decrease
    during 2005 compared to 2004, specifically due to scheduled and
    unplanned outages at the region’s western New York and
    Indian River facilities during the second and fourth quarters
    2005. Of the $61 million increase in coal cost, 71% was due
    to increases at the region’s Indian River plant. The
    region’s Indian River plant used a higher portion of
    eastern coal, whose price experienced a significant increase
    during 2005.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses for the Northeast region increased by
    $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    compared to the same period in 2004. This increase was driven by
    operating and maintenance costs, led by higher major maintenance
    costs. The low-sulfur conversion projects continued at the
    region’s western New York plants and began at its Indian
    River plant this year, and major outages related to turbine
    overhauls also took place at the region’s western New York
    and Indian River plants. The increased number and scope of the
    outages contributed to the $14 million increase in major
    maintenance expense this year. Additionally, in 2004, a
    settlement with a third party vendor regarding auxiliary power
    charges reduced 2004 operating and maintenance expenses by
    $7 million.

Other operating expenses for the Northeast region included
    administrative regional office costs, other non-income tax
    expense, insurance and corporate allocations. These costs
    increased by $30 million in 2005 compared to 2004,
    $14 million of which was due to non-income tax expense, as
    the region recognized property tax credits in 2004. The
    remainder of the increase was primarily due to regional office
    and corporate allocations.

    region. The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by
    adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period.

Operating
    Income

The South Central region realized operating income of
    $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to operating income of $8 million for the same
    period in 2005, an increase of $97 million. The increase in
    operating income was primarily driven by better plant
    availability due to lower planned and forced outages in 2006,
    which resulted in 11% higher coal generation in 2006 than 2005.
    The Big Cajun II facility achieved an EFOR of 3.13% in 2006
    compared to 6.56% in 2005, resulting in 907 fewer forced outage
    hours in 2006. In addition, the Big Cajun II coal units
    experienced 826 less planned outage hours in 2006 than in 2005.
    The forced outages in 2005 occurred primarily during the peak
    summer months when contract load is highest, requiring increased
    energy purchases than in 2006. These fewer planned outages in
    2006 also resulted in $12 million of lower major
    maintenance expense, which benefited operating income. Favorable
    price spreads in 2006 allowed for resale of power received from
    the region’s tolling agreements, providing additional
    margins.



Total
    Operating Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $10 million in 2006
    compared to 2005. Increased sales to the region’s contract
    customers were offset by lower sales in the merchant market.
    Capacity revenues were $9 million higher for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 than in the same period for 2005, as the
    peak of 2011 MW set by the region’s cooperative
    customers in August 2006 impacted capacity revenue in the latter
    half of 2006. The South Central region also recognized
    $13 million from risk management activities in 2006.
    Contract amortization increased by $10 million due to
    increased megawatt hour sales to contract customers and the
    expiration of the Rockford contract in 2005. Other revenues
    declined by $19 million from 2005 levels, primarily due to
    $23 million in lower gas sales relating to the
    region’s tolling agreements.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy for the South Central region was
    $308 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to $374 million for the same period in 2005, a
    decrease of $66 million. Coal costs for the region
    increased by $25 million, reflecting contractual increases
    in coal commodity costs and higher plant availability in 2006.
    As a result of improved plant availability, energy purchased by
    the South Central region to support load contracts dropped 16%.
    The cost of purchased power, including the costs of the
    region’s tolling agreements, was $74 million in 2006,
    a decrease of $71 million from 2005. This decrease was
    primarily due to fewer forced outages at the region’s
    baseload coal plants in 2006 and the impact of netting energy
    purchases and resale. A drop in average purchased power prices
    by $9/MWh from 2005 to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in
    purchased power costs. The South Central region increased its
    use of generation from tolled facilities in 2006; tolled
    combined cycle plants contributed 1,451,758 MWh to the
    region’s energy resources in 2006 compared to
    474,386 MWh in 2005. The tolling agreements further
    contributed to the region’s results as the spread between
    gas costs and energy costs widened in the summer of 2006.
    Transmission costs increased by $7 million due to a
    combination of contractual increases in network transmission
    rates and higher peaks in 2006.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses for the South Central region for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 was $89 million, a
    reduction of $22 million compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2005. The reduction was primarily due to lower
    major maintenance costs, which dropped by $12 million due
    to fewer planned outages at the region’s coal plant in 2006
    and lower insurance costs, which were $3 million less in
    2006 due to lower premiums.

Operating
    Income

For the year ended December 31, 2005, the South Central
    region realized operating income of $8 million, compared to
    $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.
    During 2005, the region’s Big Cajun II facility
    experienced several forced outages during the summer months, at
    which time contract demand and replacement power costs were at
    their highest. Generation for 2005 decreased by 3% from
    10.3 million MWh to 10 million MWh compared to the
    same period in 2004, with 0.2 million MWh lost due to
    forced outages. These outages contributed to the purchase of
    $114 million in additional purchased energy required to
    meet contract load- following obligations in the merchant market
    at costs higher than the region’s coal-based generation
    assets. In addition, during 2005, South Central had three
    planned outages compared to one major planned outage during
    2004, which increased major maintenance by $20 million, as
    compared to the year ended December 31, 2004.

Total
    Operating Revenues

Total operating revenues from the South Central region were
    $560 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    compared to $434 million for the same period in 2004, an
    increase of $126 million. Revenues for the year



ended December 31, 2005 included $339 million in
    energy revenues, of which 61% was contracted. This compares to
    $221 million of energy revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2004, 73% of which was contracted. The
    increase of $118 million in energy revenues and the lower
    percentage contracted was due to increased merchant energy sales
    following higher power prices, favorable weather, and nuclear
    plant outages in the region. Also, a

round-the-clock 100 MW

sale to Entergy and a tolling agreement, which at times provided
    power that could be resold at a higher price, helped to increase
    merchant revenues. Other revenues primarily include physical gas
    sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, other revenues
    totaled $24 million compared to $2 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2004, with the increase due to
    $23 million in physical gas sales related to a new gas sale
    agreement entered into in July 2005. NRG entered into this
    agreement in conjunction with power purchase agreements to
    minimize the South Central region’s market purchases during
    peak months.

Cost
    of Energy

The South Central region’s cost of energy increased by
    $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2005,
    compared to the same period in 2004. Of this amount,
    $114 million was due to higher purchased energy costs.
    During 2005, the region’s Big Cajun II facility
    experienced a number of forced outages, encountered high demand
    from the region’s long-term contracts, and entered into

100-MW

around-the-clock

sale to Entergy, and a tolling agreement, all of which required
    the purchase of energy to meet contract load obligations.
    Purchased energy per MWh increased by 365% versus the same
    period in 2004. In addition, due to the extreme weather
    conditions and increased gas prices, the average purchased
    energy price increased $19 per MWh for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses increased by $31 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period
    in 2004, with $20 million of the increase primarily related
    to major maintenance due to increased planned and unplanned
    outages at the region’s Big Cajun II facility, and
    $12 million related to the regional office expenses and
    corporate allocations.

Operating
    Income

For the year ended December 31, 2006, operating income for
    the West region was approximately $8 million, compared to a
    loss of $6 million for the year ended December 31,
    2005. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the West region
    recorded an operating loss of $8 million primarily due to
    higher cost of energy and other operating expenses. The 2006
    gain in operating income was primarily due to NRG’s
    acquisition of Dynegy’s 50% interest of WCP. The California
    high-voltage power grid handled an all time record peak demand
    on July 24, 2006 at 50,270 MW, with the previous
    record peak demand of 45,431 MW set on July 20, 2005.

Total
    Operating Revenues

Total operating revenues for the year ended December 31,
    2006 were $146 million, comprised of $75 million in
    energy revenues, of which 39% were contracted, and
    $68 million in capacity revenues. This compares to
    $4 million in operating revenues, comprised of
    $1 million in energy revenues and $3 million in other
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. For the year
    ended December 31, 2004, total operating revenues for the
    West region was $7 million, primarily comprised of energy
    revenues.



Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy for the year ended December 31, 2006, was
    approximately $80 million, consisting primarily of gas
    costs. For the year ended December 31, 2005, cost of energy
    for the West region was $1 million and $5 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2004.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for the West region for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 were $55 million, or 38% of the
    region’s total operating revenues. These costs included
    $32 million in operating and maintenance costs, of which
    $10 million was related to normal maintenance expenses
    associated with outage work. The region also incurred
    approximately $19 million in G&A expenses, of which
    $4 million was related to development costs associated with
    the Company’s

Repowering NRG

program and
    approximately $3 million in corporate allocations. The
    increase was primarily due to the consolidation of WCP,
    development spending, and NRG cost allocations. This compares to
    $8 million and $9 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Credit
    Ratings

Credit-rating agencies rate the Company’s public debt
    securities. These ratings are utilized by the debt markets in
    evaluating a firm’s credit risk. Ratings influence the
    price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the
    market NRG’s ability to pay principal, interest, and
    preferred dividends. Rating agencies evaluate a firm’s
    industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and hedge profile,
    among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firm’s
    credit risk.

The following table summarizes the credit ratings for NRG

    Notes due 2017. In addition, NRG amended the Company’s
    existing Senior Credit Facility, which resulted in an increase
    of the synthetic letter of credit facility by $500 million
    to $1.5 billion. The amendment revised certain terms within
    the existing credit agreement to provide greater financial
    flexibility to the Company, including increasing NRG’s
    restricted payment basket, which effectively governs the
    Company’s ability to return capital to shareholders. As
    part of the amendment of the Company’s Senior Credit
    Facility, NRG inserted a provision that results in an increased
    level of mandatory first lien debt repayment



each year. Beginning in 2008, NRG must offer a portion of its
    excess cash flow, an amount that approximates the Company’s
    free cash flow for the prior year, to its first lien lenders.
    The percentage of the excess cash flow offered to these lenders
    is dependent upon the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio
    at the end of the preceding year. Of the amount offered, the
    first lien lenders must accept 50%, while the remaining 50% may
    either be accepted or rejected at the lenders’ option.

Capital Allocation Program

— In connection with
    NRG’s share repurchase program, the company issued notes
    and preferred interest in the aggregate amount of
    $249 million and $84 million, respectively, to Credit
    Suisse through two wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiaries of NRG.

Asset
    Sales

Red Bluff and Chowchilla

— On January 3,
    2007, NRG completed the sale of the Red Bluff and
    Chowchilla II power plants to an entity controlled by
    Wayzata Investment Partners LLC. These power plants, located in
    California, are fueled by natural gas with generating capacity
    of 45 MW and 50 MW, respectively.

Resource Recovery

— On November 8, 2006,
    NRG completed the sale of the Company’s Newport and Elk
    River Resource Recovery facilities, Becker Ash Disposal
    facility, as well as the Company’s ownership interest in
    NRG Processing Solutions LLC, to Resource Recovery Technologies,
    LLC for total proceeds of approximately $22 million.

Australia

— On August 30, 2006, NRG
    announced the completion of the sale of its 100% owned Flinders
    power station and related assets or Flinders, located near Port
    Augusta, Australia, to Babcock & Brown Power Pty, a
    subsidiary of Babcock & Brown, a global investment and
    advisory firm. Proceeds from the sale were approximately
    $242 million (AU$317 million). The sale resulted in
    the elimination of approximately $370 million
    (AU$485 million) of consolidated liabilities, including
    approximately $183 million (AU$240 million) of
    non-recourse debt obligations and approximately $92 million
    (AU$121 million) in non-current liabilities related to the
    obligations for the purchase of electricity and the supply of
    fuel to the Osborne power station that were guaranteed by NRG.
    NRG recognized an after-tax gain of approximately
    $60 million from the sale.

Rocky Road

— On March 31, 2006, in
    conjunction with NRG’s purchase of Dynegy’s 50%
    interest in WCP, NRG sold the Company’s 50% interest in
    Rocky Road to Dynegy as part of the Company’s purchase and
    sale agreement with Dynegy for a sale price of $45 million.
    There was no gain or loss on the sale due to the fact that in
    2005, NRG recorded an impairment charge of approximately
    $20 million to write down the value of NRG’s 50%
    interest in Rocky Road to its fair value of $45 million.

Audrain

— On March 29, 2006, NRG completed
    the sale of Audrain generating station, a gas-fired peaking
    facility in Vandalia, Missouri, to AmerenUE, a subsidiary of
    Ameren Corporation. The proceeds from the sale were
    $115 million, plus AmerenUE’s assumption of
    $240 million of non-recourse capital lease obligations and
    assignment of a $240 million note receivable. NRG recorded
    a pre-tax gain of $15 million.

USES
    OF FUNDS

The Company’s requirements for liquidity and capital
    resources, other than for operating its facilities, can
    generally be categorized by the following:
    (1) Acquisitions; (2) Commercial Operations
    activities; (3) capital expenditures; (4) corporate
    financial transactions such as share repurchases; and
    (5) debt service obligations.

Acquisitions

Texas Genco LLC

— On February 2, 2006, NRG
    acquired Texas Genco LLC, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement
    dated September 30, 2005. The purchase price of
    approximately $6.2 billion consisted of approximately
    $4.4 billion in cash, the issuance of approximately
    35.4 million shares of NRG’s common stock valued at
    approximately $1.7 billion and acquisition costs of
    approximately $0.1 billion. The value of NRG’s common
    stock issued to the Sellers was based on the Company’s
    average stock price immediately before and after the closing
    date of February 2, 2006. The acquisition also included the
    assumption of approximately $2.7 billion of Texas Genco LLC
    debt. In connection with the acquisition, NRG substantially
    revised its financial structure.



West Coast Power Holdings, Inc.

On
    March 31, 2006, NRG completed purchase and sale agreements
    for projects co-owned with Dynegy, Inc., or Dynegy. Under the
    agreements, NRG acquired Dynegy’s 50% ownership interest in
    WCP (Generation) Holdings, LLC, or WCP, for $205 million
    and NRG became the sole owner of WCP’s 1,825 MW of
    generation capacity in Southern California. In addition, NRG
    sold to Dynegy its 50% ownership interest in Rocky Road Power
    LLC, or Rocky Road, a 330 MW gas-fueled, simple cycle
    peaking plant located in Dundee, Illinois. NRG sold Rocky Road
    for a fair value sale price of $45 million, thus paying
    Dynegy a net purchase price of $160 million at closing.

Commercial
    Operations

Commercial Operations activities require a significant amount of
    liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements
    are primarily driven by: (1) margin and collateral posted
    with counter-parties; (2) initial collateral required to
    establish trading relationships; (3) timing of
    disbursements and receipts (i.e., buying fuel before receiving
    energy revenues); and (4) initial collateral for large
    structured transactions. As of December 31, 2006,
    Commercial Operations had total cash collateral outstanding of
    $27 million, and $967 million outstanding in letters
    of credit to third parties primarily to support its economic
    hedging activities.

Future liquidity requirements may change based on the
    Company’s hedging activities and structures, fuel
    purchases, and future market conditions, including forward
    prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition,
    liquidity requirements are dependent on NRG’s credit
    ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.

Collateral

— In connection with the
    Company’s power generation business, NRG manages the
    commodity price risk associated with the Company’s supply
    activities and electric generation facilities. This includes
    forward power sales, fuel and energy purchases and emission
    allowances. In order to manage these risks, NRG enters into
    financial instruments to hedge the variability in future cash
    flows from forecasted sales of electricity and purchases of fuel
    and energy. NRG utilizes a variety of instruments, including
    forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps and options. Certain
    contract counterparties require NRG to post margin collateral.
    As of February 21, 2007, NRG had posted $81 million in
    collateral to support these contracts.

Capital
    Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $221 million, $106 million
    and $119 million for the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006, approximately half
    of the $221 million in capital spending was in NRG Texas.
    Expenditures of $63 million are attributed to South Texas
    Project, mainly for nuclear fuel purchases and a turbine
    replacement, which resulted in an increase in capacity. The
    balance of the Texas spending was for major projects at the
    fossil plants, including environmental and uprate projects at
    Limestone, another major uprate project at W.A. Parish,
    combustion system work at San Jacinto and T.H. Wharton, and
    work at Jewett mine. Northeast capital spending of
    $50 million was mostly due to additional work at Huntley
    and Dunkirk related to the plants coal handling facilities,
    including $18 million largely for PRB coal conversion and
    reheater replacements at Indian River. A reliability improvement
    project at Big Cajun II and a transmission expansion
    project account for the majority of South Central expenditures
    of $11 million. In 2005, capital expenditures were related
    to PRB coal conversions, and associated conveyor track and
    emissions compliance upgrades at the Company’s western New
    York plants and Indian River facility. Capital expenditures in
    2004 also related primarily to the conversion of NRG western New
    York plants to PRB coal.

Environmental capital expenditures for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005 were approximately
    $11 million and $18 million, respectively. Based on
    current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated that
    approximately $1.28 billion of environmental capital
    expenditures will be incurred during the period 2007 through
    2012, primarily related to installation of particulate,
    SO


,
    NOx, and mercury controls to comply with the CAIR and Clean Air
    Mercury rules, as well as installation of BTA under the
    Phase II 316(b) Rule. NRG currently updates its estimates
    for environmental capital expenditures annually, and these
    estimates can be expected to change over time, in some cases
    materially. These plans are based on current regulatory
    requirements and best engineering practices. Changes to
    regulations or market conditions could result in changes to
    installed equipment timing or associated costs.

    capital expenditures for the referenced period, by region and by
    year:

NRG is working to reduce a portion of the above environmental
    capital expenditures through the Company’s ability to
    monetize a portion of its excess allowances over the

2007-2012

timeframe and still hold sufficient allowances to operate the
    fleet with proposed controls through at least 2020. In addition,
    NRG’s current contracts with the Company’s rural
    electrical customers in the South Central region allow for
    recovery of a significant portion of the costs incurred by
    complying with new laws along with a capital return, including
    interest over the asset life of the required expenditures.
    Actual recoveries will depend, among other things, on the
    duration of the contracts and the treatment of these
    expenditures.

Corporate
    Financial Transactions

Hedge Reset and Extension

— On
    November 21, 2006, NRG announced the completion of the
    Company’s Hedge Reset transaction, which included
    (1) the net settlement of existing

out-of-the-money

hedges for the years 2006 through 2011 to market,
    (2) substantial new baseload hedges for the years 2010
    through 2012 and, possibly, later years, (3) the issuance
    of $1.1 billion of new high yield notes, and
    (4) amendments to NRG’s existing Senior Credit
    Facility, including the increase of the synthetic letter of
    credit facility by $500 million.

As part of the Hedge Reset transaction, NRG net settled certain
    existing hedge agreements for the years 2006 through 2010,
    including hedge agreements with J. Aron & Company.
    These hedges were gas swaps and power contracts that were
    acquired as part of the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, which
    closed on February 2, 2006. These contracts were entered
    into by Texas Genco LLC at a time when power and natural gas
    prices were lower than they were at the time of the Hedge Reset,
    and as a result, the previous hedges obligated NRG to sell power
    or natural gas at prices significantly below current market
    prices. Under the amended agreements, NRG negotiated the pricing
    of these hedges to reflect prevailing market prices, and paid
    cash to the hedge counterparties in amounts that reflect a
    negotiated present value of the difference between the original
    prices in the hedges and the amended prices. The total amount
    paid to the counterparties was approximately $1.35 billion.

The Hedge Reset provided the Company’s shareholders with a
    number of benefits. First, the Company has increased its cash
    flows that will be available to shareholders between 2007 and
    2010 by approximately $1.5 billion. Second, it has afforded
    NRG the flexibility, through the Company’s second lien
    structure, to expand the Company’s hedges on baseload
    generation for the

2010-2012

periods, thus reducing the volatility in earnings and cash flow.
    Third, the Company obtained amendments of its Senior Credit
    Facility that has provided the Company the ability to return
    more capital to shareholders, as well as greater flexibility in
    the Company’s

Repowering NRG

program.

Capital Allocation Program

— During the third
    quarter 2006, NRG initiated a plan, known as the Capital
    Allocation Program, to repurchase approximately
    $750 million of its common stock. Phase I was a
    $500 million stock repurchase program, which was completed
    on October 13, 2006.

To implement Phase I, the Company formed two wholly-owned
    unrestricted subsidiaries to repurchase shares of NRG’s
    common stock in the public markets or in privately negotiated
    transactions. These subsidiaries were funded with a combination
    of approximately $167 million in cash from NRG, together
    with the proceeds from the issuance of approximately
    $249 million in notes and approximately $84 million in
    preferred stock to Credit Suisse,



for a total amount of approximately $500 million. Both the
    notes and the preferred interests will mature in two tranches:
    $137 million in notes and $53 million in preferred
    interests will mature in October 2008, and $112 million in
    notes and $31 million in preferred interests will mature in
    October 2009.

On October 13, 2006, NRG completed Phase I of the
    program, with total common stock repurchased of 10,587,700
    common shares at an average price of $47.22 for approximately
    $500 million.

On November 24, 2006, NRG, as part of Phase II of the
    Company’s Capital Allocation Program, announced an
    agreement to repurchase 4,212,881 shares of NRG common
    stock from affiliates of the Blackstone Group at a price of
    $55.00 per share. The Blackstone Group received these shares as
    part of the consideration that NRG paid for the acquisition of
    Texas Genco LLC. Following this repurchase, the four largest
    previous shareholders of Texas Genco LLC have concluded the sale
    of all of their NRG common stock received pursuant to the
    Acquisition.

On December 29, 2006, NRG repaid $400 million of the
    Company’s term loan facility, completing the debt reduction
    portion of the Company’s Capital Allocation Program. NRG
    used cash on hand to fund the repayment.

As of December 31, 2006 and February 28, 2007, there
    were approximately $268 million of shares to be repurchased
    in Phase II of the Company’s Capital Allocation
    Program. We expect to complete Phase II during the first
    half of 2007.

Acquisition-Related Financing

— On
    January 31, 2006, NRG used proceeds from the issuance of
    common stock and cash on hand to repay the $446 million
    outstanding principal balance of the Company’s senior
    secured term loan facility and terminated the facility. On
    February 2, 2006, NRG used proceeds from new debt financing
    related to the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC to pay accrued but
    unpaid fees on the Company’s revolving credit facility and
    funded letter of credit facility, and terminated those
    facilities. Those facilities were replaced by a new term loan,
    letter of credit and revolving financing facilities as of
    February 2, 2006.

NRG’s previously outstanding 8% second priority notes of
    approximately $1.1 billion were extinguished by NRG on
    February 2, 2006, and previously outstanding Texas Genco
    notes of approximately $1.1 billion were purchased by NRG
    on February 3, 2006, with proceeds from the issuance of new
    unsecured high yield notes.

Second Lien Structure

— NRG has granted second
    priority liens to certain counterparties on substantially all of
    the Company’s assets in the United States in order to
    secure obligations, which are primarily long-term in nature
    under certain power sale agreements and related contracts. NRG
    uses the second lien structure to reduce the amount of cash
    collateral and letters of credit that it may otherwise be
    required to post from time to time to support its obligations
    under these agreements. Within the second lien structure, the
    Company can hedge up to 80% of its baseload capacity and 10% of
    its non-baseload assets with these counterparties. As of
    February 21, 2007, the net discounted exposure on the
    agreements and hedges that were subject to the second lien
    structure was approximately $182 million.

The following table summarizes the amount of MWs hedged against
    the Company’s baseload assets and as a percentage relative
    to the Company’s forecasted baseload capacity under the
    second lien structure as of February 21, 2007:

Collateral

— In March 2004, NRG entered into
    two interest rate swap agreements, one of which matured on
    March 31, 2006. The remaining swap agreement matures in
    2011. Depending on market interest rates, NRG or the swap
    counterparty may be required to post collateral on a daily basis
    in support of this swap, to the benefit of the other party. On
    December 31, 2006 and February 21, 2007, NRG had
    posted approximately $10 million in collateral.



Preferred Stock Dividend Payments

— For the
    year ended December 31, 2006, NRG paid approximately
    $9.1 million, $16.8 million and $25.0 million in
    dividend payments to holders of the Company’s 5.75%, 4% and
    3.625% Preferred Stock.

Debt
    Service Obligations

Project Finance Obligations

— NRG is a holding
    company and conducts its operations primarily through
    subsidiaries. Consistent with NRG’s strategy, it may seek,
    where available on commercially reasonable terms, project-level
    debt in connection with the assets or businesses of its
    affiliates, including the Company’s repowering program, or
    the Company may develop, construct or acquire new projects in
    partnership with others. Project-level borrowings are
    substantially non-recourse to other subsidiaries, affiliates and
    the Company, and are generally secured by the capital stock,
    physical assets, contracts and cash flow of the related project
    subsidiary or affiliate being financed. Some of these project
    financings may require the Company to post collateral in the
    form of cash or an acceptable letter of credit.

As of December 31, 2006, NRG had approximately
    $4.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured
    high yield notes or Senior Notes and approximately
    $3.1 billion in principal amount outstanding under the term
    loan and had issued $967 million of letters of credit under
    the Company’s $1.5 billion letter of credit facility,
    leaving $533 million available for future issuances. Under
    the Company’s $1.0 billion revolving facility, as of
    December 31, 2006, NRG had issued $145 million in
    letters of credit, leaving $855 million available for
    borrowings, of which approximately $155 million could be
    used to issue additional letters of credit. As of
    February 21, 2007, $551 million of undrawn letters of
    credit remain available under the funded letter of credit
    facility, $141 million of undrawn letters of credit remain
    available under the revolving credit facility, and NRG had no
    borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facility.

Principal payments on debt and capital leases as of
    December 31, 2006 are due in the following periods:

Cash
    Flow Discussion

NRG obtains cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of
    certain assets and the proceeds from the issuance of notes and
    preferred stock. NRG uses these funds to finance operations,
    make interest payments, repurchase its common stock, service
    debt obligations, finance capital expenditures, and meet other
    cash and liquidity needs.

The following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the
    comparative years; all cash flow categories include the cash
    flows from both continuing operations and discontinued
    operations:

Net Cash
    Provided By Operating Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by
    operating activities increased by $340 million compared to
    the year ended December 31, 2005. This was primarily due to
    the following reasons:

•

Due to expiration of the underlying contracts and the downward
    shift of the forward price curves, NRG’s cash collateral
    deposits in support of derivative contracts decreased by
    $454 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to an increase of $405 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, a difference of $859 million. As of
    December 31, 2006, NRG had cash collateral deposits of
    $27 million;

•

Due to the redemption of NRG’s previous senior notes, a
    premium of $126 million was paid to NRG’s former debt
    holders;

•

NRG’s activity for the year ended December 31, 2006
    resulted in an increase of $197 million in working capital
    compared to a decrease in working capital for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 of $7 million, a difference of
    $204 million;

•

Due to redemption of NRG’s 8% second priority notes, for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, NRG wrote off
    $61 million of deferred financing costs less debt premium
    of $14 million for a net write-off of $47 million,
    compared to a write-off of debt premiums of $8 million
    during the same period in 2005, a difference of
    $55 million; and

•

A gain on the sale of emission allowances adjusted net income by
    $64 million to reflect the activity as investing. Due to
    price conditions, it was economically beneficial to sell
    emissions rather than operate certain plants.

Net Cash
    Provided/(Used) By Investing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in
    investing activities was approximately $4.3 billion more
    than for the year ended December 31, 2005. NRG’s use
    of cash was due to the following mix of investment activities:

•

During the first quarter 2006, NRG acquired Texas Genco LLC for
    approximately $6.2 billion (net of assumed debt), which
    included the issuance of stock at a value of $1.7 billion
    and a net cash payment of approximately $4.3 billion (net
    of cash on hand at Texas region of $238 million);

•

NRG acquired Dynegy’s 50% ownership interest in WCP for
    $25 million (net of cash on hand at WCP of
    $180 million). Prior to the purchase, NRG had an existing
    investment in WCP accounted for as an unconsolidated equity
    method investment;

•

During 2006, NRG divested a number of the Company’s equity
    investments for total proceeds of approximately
    $86 million; in addition, NRG received approximately
    $260 million in proceeds from sale of assets classified as
    discontinued operations; and



•

NRG’s capital expenditures were $115 million more for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 than for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, with the increase primarily related to
    capital expenditures at Texas and the Northeast regions.

Net Cash
    Provided/(Used) in Financing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by
    financing activities increased by approximately
    $4.9 billion, compared to the year ended December 31,
    2005. The increase was primarily due to the financing activities
    related to the purchase of Texas Genco LLC:

•

In conjunction with the purchase of Texas Genco LLC, NRG
    refinanced the Company’s outstanding debt as well as Texas
    Genco LLC’s outstanding debt as NRG:

    after deducting expenses;

•

Entered into a new senior secured credit facility providing for
    an aggregate amount up to $5.575 billion, consisting of a
    $3.575 billion Term Loan Facility, a $1.0 billion
    Revolving Credit Facility, and a $1.0 billion Letter of
    Credit Facility; and

•

Issued (i) $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of
    7.25% Senior Notes, and (ii) $2.4 billion aggregate
    principal amount of 7.375% Senior Notes.

•

In accordance with FAS 133, as amended, payments of
    $296 million for the settlement of derivatives that were

    to make cash payments to hedge counterparties of approximately
    $1.35 billion.

•

During Phase I of the Company’s Capital Allocation
    Program, NRG through two wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiaries
    issued approximately $249 million in notes and
    $84 million in preferred interests to partially fund the
    purchase of approximately $500 million of NRG’s common
    stock for the year ended December 31, 2006.

•

Phase II of the Company’s Capital Allocation Program
    has resulted in the repurchase of an additional
    $232 million of the Company’s common stock with cash
    on hand as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the company
    repaid $400 million in debt.

NOL’s,
    Deferred Tax Assets and FIN 48 Implications

As of December 31, 2006, NRG had U.S. domestic net
    operating loss carryforwards of $72 million, which will
    expire in 2026.

NRG believes that it is more likely than not that a benefit will
    not be realized on the deferred tax assets relating to capital
    loss carryforwards. This assessment included consideration of
    positive and negative factors, including NRG’s current
    financial position, projected future earnings and capital gains,
    and available tax planning strategies.



As of December 31, 2006, a valuation allowance totaling
    $581 million was recorded against deferred tax assets
    relating to U.S. domestic capital loss carryforwards and
    foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The valuation
    allowance was reduced from $836 million to
    $581 million due to earnings generated during 2006 by
    business operations as well as to the acquisition of the Texas
    region, which resulted in an overall reduction in the
    Company’s valuation allowance.

The Company has completed its initial evaluation of the impact
    of the January 1, 2007, adoption of FIN 48 and
    determined that such adoption is not expected to have a material
    impact on the Company’s financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows.

Discussion
    of Known Trends

Repowering
    NRG Program

NRG has announced a comprehensive portfolio redevelopment
    program, referred to as

Repowering NRG

, which involves
    the development, financing, construction and operation of new
    multi-fuel, multi-technology generation capacity at NRG’s
    existing domestic sites to meet the growing demand in the
    Company’s core markets. Through the

Repowering NRG

program, the Company anticipates retiring certain existing
    units and adding up to approximately 10,350 MW of new
    generation, with an emphasis on new baseload capacity that is
    supported by long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, and
    financed with limited or non-recourse project financing. NRG
    expects that these repowering investments will provide one or
    more of the following benefits: improved heat rates; lower
    delivered costs; expanded electricity production capability; an
    improved ability to dispatch economically across the merit
    order; increased technological and fuel diversity; and reduced
    environmental impacts. The Company expects that the

Repowering NRG

program will also result in indirect
    benefits, including the continuation of operations and retention
    of key personnel at its existing facilities.

A critical aspect of the

Repowering NRG

program is the
    extent to which the Company seeks to reduce the carbon intensity
    of the Company’s generation fleet by developing generating
    facilities with zero
    CO


and low
    CO


emissions, as well as facilities that can be equipped for
    CO


separation and sequestration. As a result, the

Repowering
    NRG

program is important not only to NRG but also to the
    power industry in general. The American power industry is the
    primary emitter of
    CO


in the largest
    CO


emitting market on earth. As the power industry takes steps to
    develop the next wave of power generation infrastructure,
    technology and capital allocation decisions will be made which
    could impact GHG from power generation by either making the
    situation significantly worse or significantly better in terms
    of
    CO


intensity. Although there is no current technological solution
    to retro-fit existing fossil-fueled technology to capture GHG
    from power plant flues, there are commercially available large
    scale technologies for new plants that can generate power with
    much lower GHG emissions than traditional coal-fired generation.
    Given that new generation units have useful lives of up to
    50 years, NRG will give full consideration to
    CO


and other emissions that contribute to GHG when making its
    long-term investment decisions.

As part of the

Repowering NRG

program, NRG is pursuing a
    five-pronged GHG emissions strategy as follows:

1.

Nuclear development

— a known, reliable
    source of electricity with zero emissions.

2.

IGCC development

— coal-fueled baseload
    generation designed to reduce the intensity of
    CO


emissions.

3.

Wind development

— renewable energy for
    the future with zero emissions.

4.

Public outreach

— NRG will work with
    government, industry and public interest groups to formulate and
    implement an economically and environmentally responsible GHG
    policy.

5.

Bridge the technology gap

— The Company
    has launched a number of initiatives to improve technology
    through R&D particularly post-combustion carbon capture,
    developing underground sequestration, and finding offsets that
    will mitigate
    CO


production.

NRG estimates that the

Repowering NRG

program, if fully
    implemented as currently proposed, could have a total capital
    cost of approximately $16 billion. While NRG believes it is
    extremely unlikely that the program will be fully implemented as
    currently proposed, the Company nonetheless expects the overall
    capital expenditures in



connection with the program will be substantial. NRG expects to
    mitigate the capital cost of the program through equity
    partnerships and public-private partnerships, as well as through
    development fees for certain projects. To mitigate the
    investment risks, NRG anticipates entering into long-term PPAs
    and engineering, procurement and construction, or EPC,
    contracts. The Company currently expects its share of cash
    contributions for the projects included in the

Repowering NRG

program to range between $500 million and
    $2.0 billion over the next decade. However, the proposed
    increase in generation capacity and capital costs resulting from

Repowering NRG

could change as proposed projects are
    included or removed from the program due to a number of factors,
    including successfully obtaining required permits and long term
    PPAs, availability of financing on favorable terms, and
    achieving targeted project returns. The projects that have been
    identified as part of the

Repowering NRG

program are
    subject to change as NRG refines the program to take into
    account the success rate for completion of projects, changes in
    the targeted minimum return thresholds, and evolving market
    dynamics.

    the

Capital
    Allocation Program

As of December 31, 2006, NRG had repurchased 14,800,581
    shares of Common Stock, at a cost of approximately
    $732 million through the Company’s Capital Allocation
    Program, which commenced during the third quarter 2006. The
    program as previously announced was in two phases. Phase I
    was a $500 million share buyback program with
    Phase II, originally announced as a $250 million share
    repurchase. During the fourth quarter 2006, NRG increased
    Phase II of the share repurchase to $500 million.

On October 13, 2006, NRG completed Phase I of
    NRG’s Capital Allocation Program with the repurchase of
    10,587,700 of the Company’s common stock for approximately
    $500 million. At maturity, should NRG’s stock price
    exceed a compound annual growth rate of 20% beyond a
    volume-weighted average share price determined at the time of
    repurchase, referred to as the Reference Price, NRG will pay to
    Credit Suisse the market value of NRG’s stock price over
    the Reference Price in either cash or stock. This difference
    will be recorded as an increase to the cost of the treasury
    shares repurchased.

On November 24, 2006, as part of Phase II of
    NRG’s Capital Allocation Program, NRG repurchased
    4,212,881 shares of NRG common stock from affiliates of the
    Blackstone Group at a price of $55.00 per share for a total
    of approximately $232 million. The Blackstone Group
    affiliates acquired the shares in a private placement as part of
    the consideration that NRG paid for the acquisition of Texas
    Genco LLC.

In addition, on December 29, 2006, NRG completed a
    $400 million debt repayment in connection with the
    Company’s Capital Allocation Program.

As of February 28, 2007, the Company had approximately
    $268 million of shares to be repurchased in Phase II
    of the Capital Allocation Program. We expect to complete
    Phase II during the first half of 2007.

Resetting
    of Existing Hedges, or Hedge Reset

In November 2006, NRG net settled certain existing hedge
    agreements for the years 2006 through 2010. These hedges were
    entered into by Texas Genco LLC at a time when power and natural
    gas prices were lower than they were at the time of the Hedge
    Reset, and as a result, the previous hedges obligated NRG to
    sell power or natural gas at prices significantly below
    prevailing market prices. Under the amended agreements, NRG
    reset the pricing of these hedges to reflect prevailing market
    prices, and paid cash to the hedge counterparties in amounts
    that reflect a



negotiated present value of the difference between the original
    prices in the hedges and the amended prices. The total amount
    paid to the counterparties was approximately $1.35 billion.

The Hedge Reset provided the Company’s shareholders with a
    number of benefits. First, the Company has increased its cash
    flows that will be available to shareholders between 2007 and
    2010 by approximately $1.5 billion. Second, it has afforded
    NRG the flexibility, through the Company’s second lien
    structure, to expand the Company’s hedges on baseload
    generation for the

2010-2012

periods, thus reducing the volatility in earnings and cash flow.
    Third, the Company obtained amendments of its Senior Credit
    Facility, which has provided the Company the ability to return
    more capital to shareholders, as well as greater flexibility in
    the Company’s

Repowering NRG

program.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Instruments and Other Contractual Arrangements

Obligations
    under Certain Guarantee Contracts

NRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee
    arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate
    commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements
    include financial and performance



guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety
    bonds and indemnifications. See Note 25

, Guarantees,

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further
    discussion of these guarantee arrangements.

Retained
    or Contingent Interests

NRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests
    in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.

Derivative
    Instrument Obligations

On August 11, 2005, NRG issued the 3.625% Preferred Stock,
    which includes a conversion feature that is considered a
    derivative per FAS 133. Although it is considered a
    derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting, as it is
    excluded from the scope pursuant to paragraph 11(a) of
    SFA 133. Despite this exclusion, per the guidance of EITF

Topic D-98,

the conversion feature must be

marked-to-market.

Currently, the conversion feature is valued at $0,  as our stock
    price is outside the conversion range. See Note 13,

Capital Structure,

to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for a further discussion.

Obligations
    Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated
    Entity

Variable interest in Equity investments

— As of
    December 31, 2006, NRG has not entered into any financing
    structure that is designed to be off-balance sheet that would
    create liquidity, financing, or incremental market risk or
    credit risk to the Company. However, NRG has numerous
    investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less
    in energy and energy related entities that are accounted for
    under the equity method of accounting. NRG’s pro-rata share
    of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was
    approximately $153 million and $174 million as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This indebtedness
    may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue
    dividends or distributions to NRG. In the normal course of
    business, the Company may be asked to loan funds to
    unconsolidated affiliates on both a long and short-term basis.
    Such transactions are generally accounted for as accounts
    payable and receivable to/from affiliates and notes
    payable/receivable to/from affiliates and, if appropriate, bear
    market-based interest rates.

Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility and Revolver
    Facility

— Under NRG’s Amended Senior Credit
    Facility NRG entered into on November 21, 2006, the Company
    has a $1.5 billion synthetic Letter of Credit Facility that
    is unfunded by NRG, and a $1 billion senior Revolving
    Credit Facility. The synthetic Letter of Credit Facility is
    secured by a $1.5 billion cash collateral deposit, held by
    Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as the Issuing
    Bank. Under the synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, NRG is
    allowed to issue letters of credit to support the Company’s
    obligations under commodity hedging or power purchase
    arrangements. In addition, NRG can issue up to $300 million
    in unfunded letters of credit under the Company’s Revolving
    Credit Facility for ongoing working capital requirements and for
    general corporate purposes, including acquisitions that are
    permitted under the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, NRG is
    permitted to issue additional letters of credit up to
    $700 million under the Senior Credit Facility through
    another financial institution.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had issued
    $967 million in letters of credit under the Letter of
    Credit Facility. Of this amount, a portion was issued to support
    obligations under terminated NRG letter of credit facilities. As
    of December 31, 2006, the Company had issued
    $145 million in revolver letters of credit, a portion of
    which supports non-commercial letter of credit obligations under
    letter of credit facilities terminated as of February 2,
    2006.

Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments

NRG has a variety of contractual obligations and other
    commercial commitments that represent prospective cash
    requirements in addition to the Company’s capital
    expenditure programs. With the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC,
    the Company’s contractual obligations have increased
    significantly from the prior year. In addition, the financing
    related to the acquisition, as well as the sale of non-core
    assets during 2006, has also contributed to an increase in the
    Company’s outstanding guarantees.



The following tables summarize NRG’s contractual
    obligations and guarantees. For an additional discussion, see

NRG has a variety of contractual obligations and other
    commercial commitments that represent prospective cash
    requirements in addition to the Company’s capital
    expenditure programs. See Item 15 — Note 21,

Commitments and Contingencies

, to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a discussion of commitments and
    contingencies that also include contractual obligations and
    commercial commitments that occurred during 2006.

Derivative
    Instruments

NRG may enter into long-term power sales contracts, fuel
    purchase contracts and other energy-related financial
    instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to
    fluctuations in spot market prices, to hedge fuel requirements
    at generation facilities and protect fuel inventories. In
    addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated
    with the issuance of the Company’s variable rate and fixed
    rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements.

NRG’s trading activities include contracts entered into to
    profit from market price changes as opposed to hedging an
    exposure, and are subject to limits in accordance with the
    Company’s risk management policy. These contracts are
    recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the
    fair value of these derivative financial instruments are
    recognized in earnings. These trading activities are a
    complement to NRG’s energy marketing portfolio.

The tables below disclose the activities that include
    non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value.
    Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized
    changes in fair value; identify changes in fair value
    attributable to changes in valuation techniques; disaggregate
    estimated fair values at December 31, 2006, based on

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

NRG’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition
    and results of operations are based upon the consolidated
    financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. The preparation of these financial statements
    and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, or GAAP, requires the application of
    appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as
    the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
    related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The
    application of these policies necessarily involves judgments
    regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of
    particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges. These
    judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the
    financial statements and disclosures based on varying
    assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the
    financial and operating environment may also have a significant
    effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the
    results reported through the application of accounting measures
    used in preparing the financial statements and related
    disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have
    not changed.

On an ongoing basis, NRG evaluates these estimates, utilizing
    historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods
    the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results
    may differ substantially from the Company’s estimates. Any
    effects on the Company’s business, financial position or
    results of operations resulting from revisions to these
    estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that
    give rise to the revision become known.

NRG’s significant accounting policies are summarized in
    Item 15 — Note 2,

Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

, to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting
    policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to
    the portrayal of the Company’s financial position and
    results of operations, and that require the most difficult,
    subjective

and/or

complex judgments by management regarding estimates about
    matters that are inherently uncertain.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company follows the guidance of SFAS 133, as amended,
    to account for derivative financial instruments. SFAS 133
    requires the Company to

mark-to-market

all derivative instruments on the balance sheet, and recognize
    changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments
    immediately in earnings. In certain cases, NRG may apply hedge
    accounting to the Company’s derivative instruments. The
    criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is
    appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an
    underlying exposure, (ii) whether the overall risk is being
    reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the
    fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying
    hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    instruments accounted for as hedges are



either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the
    fair value of the related hedged item, or deferred and recorded
    as a component of OCI, and subsequently recognized in earnings
    when the hedged transactions occur.

For purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative
    instruments, NRG uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes.
    When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models
    to determine the fair value. These internal models include
    assumptions of the future prices of energy based on the specific
    market in which the energy is being sold, using externally
    available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible
    under the pricing model. In order to qualify derivatives
    instruments for hedged transactions, NRG estimates the
    forecasted generation occurring within a specified time period.
    Judgments related to the probability of forecasted generation
    occurring are based on available baseload capacity, internal
    forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical
    delivery on similar contracts. The probability that hedged
    forecasted generation will occur by the end of a specified time
    period could change the results of operations by requiring
    amounts currently classified in OCI to be reclassified into
    earnings, creating increased variability in our earnings. These
    estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.

Certain derivative financial instruments that meet the criteria
    for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope
    exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered
    Normal Purchase and Normal Sales, or NPNS. The availability of
    this exception is based upon the assumption that NRG has the
    ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the
    underlying item. These assumptions are based on available
    baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation,
    and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that
    are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting
    treatment, and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it
    is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer
    meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the
    related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
    value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.

Income
    Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax
    Assets

As of December 31, 2006, NRG had a valuation allowance of
    approximately $581 million related to the Company’s
    U.S. domestic capital loss carryforwards of approximately
    $506 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards
    of approximately $75 million. In assessing the
    recoverability of NRG’s deferred tax assets, the Company
    considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
    or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate
    realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon projected
    capital gains and available tax planning strategies.

As of December 31, 2006, NRG had approximately
    $72 million of U.S. federal and state net operating
    loss, or NOL, carryforwards for financial reporting purposes.
    The utilization of the Company’s NOLs depends on several
    factors, such as NRG’s ability to utilize tax benefits
    through carryforwards to future periods, the application of tax
    statutes and regulations to transactions.

NRG continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing
    authorities in other jurisdictions. Considerable judgment is
    required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item
    that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. A tax
    liability has been recorded for certain tax filing positions
    where the Company cannot sustain the tax return position at a
    should level of certainty. Such liabilities are based on
    management’s judgment, which considers the best estimate of
    the amount and probable outcome of the tax position, and it can
    take several years between the time when a liability is recorded
    and when the related filing position is resolved with the taxing
    authority. Management periodically reviews these matters and
    adjusts the liabilities recorded on the financial statements as
    appropriate.

Evaluation
    of Assets for Impairment and Other Than Temporary Decline in
    Value

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, or SFAS 144,
    NRG evaluates property, plant and equipment and intangible
    assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.
    Examples of such indicators or events are:

•

Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;

•

Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used
    or its physical condition;



•

Adverse business climate;

•

Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
    originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an
    asset,

•

Current-period loss combined with a history of losses or the
    projection of future losses; and

•

Change in the Company’s intent about an asset from an
    intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset
    will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously
    estimated useful life.

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
    comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future
    net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through
    considering project specific assumptions for long-term power
    pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and
    expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be
    impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
    amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
    fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability
    weighting of different courses of action available to the
    Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using
    valuation techniques such as the present value of expected
    future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these
    evaluations and considers various factors, including forward
    price curves for energy, fuel costs, and operating costs.
    However, actual future market prices and project costs could
    vary from the assumptions used in the Company’s estimates,
    and the impact of such variations could be material.

For assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that
    the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the
    carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to
    determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets

held-for-sale

are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value
    less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value under
    SFAS 144, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held
    and used or with an asset

held-for-sale,

and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature,
    subjective. NRG considers quoted market prices in active markets
    to the extent they are available. In the absence of such
    information, the Company may consider prices of similar assets,
    consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. NRG
    will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated
    with the asset using a single interest rate representative of
    the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected
    present value method that probability-weights a range of
    possible outcomes. The use of these methods involves the same
    inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously
    discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future
    market prices and project costs could vary from those used in
    the Company’s estimates, and the impact of such variations
    could be material.

NRG is also required to evaluate its equity-method and
    cost-method investments to determine whether or not they are
    impaired. Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18,

The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common
    Stock

, or APB18, provides the accounting requirements for
    these investments. The standard for determining whether an
    impairment must be recorded under APB 18 is whether the
    value is considered an “other than a temporary”
    decline in value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments
    under APB 18 involves the same uncertainties as described
    for long-lived assets that the Company owns directly and
    accounts for in accordance with SFAS 144. Similarly, the
    estimates that NRG makes with respect to its equity and
    cost-method investments are subjective, and the impact of
    variations in these estimates could be material. Additionally,
    if the projects in which the Company hold these investments
    recognize an impairment under the provisions of SFAS 144,
    NRG would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss
    and would evaluate its investment for an other than temporary
    decline in value under APB 18.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, there was no
    reduction in income from continuing operation due to investment
    impairment. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    income from continuing operations was reduced by $6 million
    and $45 million, respectively, due to investment
    impairments.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

As part of the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, NRG recorded
    intangible assets and goodwill. The Company applied
    SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations,

or
    SFAS 141, and SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

, or SFAS 142, to account for these
    intangibles. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all
    finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated
    weighted-average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite
    life and is not amortized. However, goodwill and all intangible
    assets not subject to amortization will be tested for



impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates that an
    impairment may have occurred, or at a minimum, on an annual
    basis. Where necessary, the Company’s goodwill

and/or

intangible asset will be impaired at that time.

In connection with the Texas Genco acquisition, the Company
    recognized the estimated fair value of certain power sale
    contracts and fuel contracts acquired. NRG estimated their fair
    value using forward pricing curves as of the closing date of the
    acquisition over the life of each contract. These contracts had
    negative fair values at the closing date of the acquisition and
    will be reflected as assumed contracts in the combined balance
    sheet. Assumed contracts are amortized to revenues and fuel
    expense as applicable based on the estimated realization of the
    fair value established on the closing date over the contractual
    lives.

Contingencies

NRG records a loss contingency when management determines it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until management determines it is certain that the
    future event will become or does become a reality. Such
    determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts
    and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of
    the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail
    its contingencies in Item 15 — Note 21,

Commitments and Contingencies,

to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

    Accounting Developments

Item 7A —

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
    Risk

NRG is exposed to several market risks in the Company’s
    normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss
    that may result from market changes associated with the
    Company’s merchant power generation or with an existing or
    forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of
    market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk,
    interest rate risk and currency exchange risk. In order to
    manage these risks, the Company utilizes various fixed-price
    forward purchase and sales contracts, futures and option
    contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps
    and options traded in the

over-the-counter

financial markets to:

•

Manage and hedge fixed-price purchase and sales commitments;

•

Manage and hedge exposure to variable rate debt obligations;

•

Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices; and

•

Hedge fuel requirements for the Company’s generating
    facilities.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot
    prices, forward prices, volatility in commodities, and
    correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas,
    electricity, coal and oil. A number of factors influence the
    level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and
    related derivative products. These factors include:

•

Seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;

•

Extreme peak demands due to weather conditions;

•

Available supply resources;

•

Transportation availability and reliability within and between
    regions; and

•

Changes in the nature and extent of federal and state
    regulations.

As part of NRG’s overall portfolio, NRG manages the
    commodity price risk of the Company’s merchant generation
    operations by entering into various derivative or non-derivative
    instruments to hedge the variability in



future cash flows from forecasted sales of electricity and
    purchases of fuel. These instruments include forward purchase
    and sale contracts, futures and option contracts traded on the
    New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps and options traded in
    the

over-the-counter

financial markets. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged
    may vary based upon management’s assessment of market,
    weather, operational, and other factors.

While some of the contracts the Company uses to manage risk
    represent commodities or instruments for which prices are
    available from external sources, other commodities and certain
    contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other
    pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected
    future market prices, contract quantities, or both. NRG uses the
    Company’s best estimates to determine the fair value of
    commodity and derivative contracts held and sold. These
    estimates consider various factors, including closing exchange
    and

over-the-counter

price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit
    exposure. However, it is likely that future market prices could
    vary from those used in recording

mark-to-market

derivative instrument valuation, and such variations could be
    material.

NRG measures the sensitivity of the Company’s portfolio to
    potential changes in market prices using Value at Risk, or VAR.
    VAR is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss
    based on market price volatility. Currently, the company
    estimates VAR using a Monte Carlo simulation based methodology.
    Prior to November 2006, NRG used a Variance/Covariance based VAR
    methodology. NRG’s total portfolio includes

mark-to-market

and non

mark-to-market

energy assets and liabilities.

NRG utilizes a diversified VAR model to calculate an estimate of
    the potential loss in the fair value of the Company’s
    energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets,
    load obligations, and bilateral physical and financial
    transactions. The key assumptions for the Company’s
    diversified model include: (1) a lognormal distribution of
    price returns,

(2) one-day

holding period, (3) a 95% confidence interval, (4) a
    rolling

24-month

forward looking period, and (5) market implied price
    volatilities and historical price correlations.

As of December 31, 2006, the VAR for NRG’s commodity
    portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and
    bilateral physical and financial transactions calculated using
    the diversified VAR model was $18 million.

The following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VAR
    for NRG for the year ended December 31, 2006:

Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as
    VAR, the relative immaturity of the competitive markets for
    electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of
    changes in market prices, the VAR calculation may not capture
    the full extent of commodity price exposure. As a result, actual
    changes in the fair value of

mark-to-market

energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated
    VAR, and such changes could have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial results.

In order to provide additional information for comparative
    purposes to NRG’s peers, the Company also utilizes VAR to
    estimate of the potential loss of financial derivative
    instruments that are subject to mark-to-market accounting. These
    derivative instruments include transactions that were entered
    into for both asset management and trading purposes.



The VAR for the financial derivative instruments calculated
    using the diversified VAR model as of December 31, 2006 for
    the entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset
    management and trading was approximately $32 million.

Interest
    Rate Risk

NRG is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through the
    Company’s issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt.
    Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by
    entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate
    swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts
    reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in
    primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account
    the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate
    derivative instrument. NRG’s risk management policies allow
    the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate
    debt obligations.

In January 2006, the Company entered into a series of new
    interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps became effective
    on February 15, 2006, and are intended to hedge the risk
    associated with floating interest rates. For each of the
    interest rate swaps, NRG pays its counterparty the equivalent of
    a fixed interest payment on a predetermined notional value, and
    NRG receives the equivalent of a floating interest payment based
    on a

3-month

LIBOR rate calculated on the same notional value. All interest
    rate swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made
    quarterly, and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each
    interest period. While the notional value of each of the swaps
    does not vary over time, the swaps are designed to mature
    sequentially. The total notional amount of these swaps as of
    December 31, 2006 was $2.15 billion.

The notional amounts and maturities of each tranche of these
    swaps are as follows:

March 31, 2011

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had various interest
    rate swap agreements, including those listed above, with
    notional amounts totaling approximately $2.8 billion. If
    the swaps had been discontinued on December 31, 2006, the
    Company would have owed the counter-parties approximately
    $10 million. Based on the investment grade rating of the
    counter-parties, NRG believes its exposure to credit risk due to
    nonperformance by counterparties to its hedge contracts to be
    insignificant.

NRG has both long and short-term debt instruments that subject
    the Company to the risk of loss associated with movements in
    market interest rates. As of December 31, 2006, a
    100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a
    $15.1 million change in interest expense on a rolling
    twelve month basis.

As of December 31, 2006, the fair value and the carrying
    amount of the Company’s long-term debt was
    $8.8 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market
    interest rates would have increased the fair value of the
    Company’s long-term debt by $549 million.

Liquidity
    Risk

Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of
    NRG’s activities and in the management of the
    Company’s assets and liabilities. NRG’s liquidity
    management framework is intended to maximize liquidity access
    and minimize funding costs. Through active liquidity management,
    the Company seeks to preserve stable, reliable and
    cost-effective sources of funding. This enables the Company to
    replace maturing obligations when due and fund assets at
    appropriate maturities and rates. To accomplish this task,
    management uses a variety of liquidity risk measures that take
    into consideration market conditions, prevailing interest rates,
    liquidity needs, and the desired maturity profile of liabilities.



Based on a sensitivity analysis, a $1 per MWh increase or
    decrease in electricity prices across the term of the marginable
    contracts would cause a change in margin collateral outstanding
    of approximately $40 million as of December 31, 2006.
    This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated
    based on portfolio composition and margin-related contract
    provisions as of December 31, 2006.

Credit
    Risk

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from
    non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the
    terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and
    manages the credit risk of NRG and its subsidiaries through
    credit policies that include (i) an established credit
    approval process, (ii) a daily monitoring of counter-party
    credit limits, (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures
    such as margin, collateral, credit derivatives or prepayment
    arrangements, (iv) the use of payment netting agreements,
    and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for
    the netting of positive and negative exposures of various
    contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks
    surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately
    impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company
    has credit protection within various agreements to call on
    additional collateral support if and when necessary. As of
    December 31, 2006, NRG held collateral support of
    approximately $681 million from counterparties.

A portion of NRG’s credit risk is related to transactions
    that are recorded in the Company’s consolidated Balance
    Sheets. These transactions primarily consist of open positions
    from the Company’s marketing and risk management operation
    that are accounted for using

mark-to-market

accounting, as well as amounts owed by counterparties for
    transactions that settled but have not yet been paid.

The following table highlights the credit quality and their
    balance sheet settlement exposures related to these activities
    as of December 31, 2006:

Additionally, the Company has concentrations of suppliers and
    customers among coal suppliers, electric utilities, energy
    marketing and trading companies, and regional transmission
    operators. These concentrations of counterparties may impact
    NRG’s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or
    negatively, in that counterparties may be similarly affected by
    changes in economic, regulatory and other conditions.

NRG’s exposure to significant counterparties greater than
    10% of the net exposure of approximately $1.6 billion was
    approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2006.
    NRG does not anticipate any material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations as a
    result of nonperformance by any of NRG’s counterparties.

Currency
    Exchange Risk

NRG is exposed to foreign currency risks associated with
    foreign-denominated distributions from the Company’s
    international investments. In the normal course of business, NRG
    may receive distributions denominated in the Euro, Australian
    Dollar and the Brazilian Real. Occasionally, NRG engages in a
    strategy of hedging foreign denominated cash flows for these
    related currency inflows, and to the extent required, fixes the
    U.S. Dollar equivalent of net foreign denominated
    distributions with currency forward and swaps agreements with
    highly credit worthy financial institutions.



As of December 31, 2006, a 10% devaluation in the currency
    of all of the Company’s exposure currencies would result in
    an immaterial impact to NRG’s consolidated statements of
    operations. However, NRG’s consolidated financial position
    would also have been negatively affected by approximately
    $60 million, due to currency translation adjustments
    recorded in OCI.

Controls and Procedures

Conclusion
    Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of NRG’s
    management, including its principal executive officer, principal
    financial officer and principal accounting officer, NRG
    conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and
    procedures, as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

or

15d-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s
    principal executive officer, principal financial officer and
    principal accounting officer concluded that the disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
    period covered by this annual report on

Form 10-K.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

With the completion and associated integration of the
    acquisition of Texas Genco LLC and WCP, there have been no
    changes in the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the year ended December 31,
    2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations Over Internal Controls

NRG’s internal control over financial reporting is designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that:

1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of our assets;

2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
    management and directors; and

3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of our assets that could have a material effect on the
    consolidated financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
    absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
    because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility
    of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of
    controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system
    may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely
    basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
    future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

NRG Energy Inc.’s management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company’s management, including its principal executive
    officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting
    officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the
    Company’s evaluation under the framework in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework, the Company’s
    management concluded that its internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.

NRG Energy, Inc.’s management assessment of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been
    audited by KPMG LLP, the Company’s independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is
    included in this

Form 10-K.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

NRG Energy, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting, that NRG Energy, Inc. maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). NRG Energy, Inc.’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that NRG Energy,
    Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
    material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    Also, in our opinion, NRG Energy, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of NRG Energy, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income/(loss), and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, and
    our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

NRG Energy, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006
    and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income/(loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2006. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
    financial statement schedule “Schedule II. Valuation
    and Qualifying Accounts.” These consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
    our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force

No. 04-6,

“Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production
    in the Mining Industry,” and Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), “Share Based
    Payments,” and related interpretations on January 1,
    2006. As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company also adopted the disclosure requirements
    of SFAS No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106 and 132(R)” effective December 31, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of NRG Energy, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
    February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of,
    internal control over financial reporting.

Note 2 —

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include NRG’s
    accounts and operations and those of its subsidiaries in which
    the Company has a controlling interest. All significant
    intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
    consolidation. The usual condition for a controlling financial
    interest is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of
    an entity. However, a controlling financial interest may also
    exist in entities, such as a variable interest entity, through
    arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests.

As such, NRG applies the guidance of FASB Interpretation
    No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

or FIN 46R, to consolidate variable interest entities,
    or VIEs, for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
    FIN 46R requires a variable interest holder to consolidate
    a VIE if that party will absorb a majority of the expected
    losses of the VIE, receive the majority of the expected residual
    returns of the VIE, or both. This party is considered the
    primary beneficiary. Conversely, NRG will not consolidate a VIE
    in which it has a majority ownership interest when the Company
    is not considered the primary beneficiary. In determining the
    primary beneficiary, NRG thoroughly evaluates the VIEs design,
    capital structure, and relationships among variable interest
    holders. If a primary beneficiary cannot be determined by a
    qualitative analysis, a quantitative analysis of allocating the
    expected cash flows among the variable interest holders is used
    in the determination.

Accounting policies for all of NRG’s operations are in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. As discussed in Note 14,

Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method

, NRG also
    has investments in partnerships, joint ventures and projects.

Fresh
    Start Reporting

In accordance with Statement of

Position 90-7,

Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the
    Bankruptcy Code,

or

SOP 90-7,

certain companies qualify for fresh start reporting in
    connection with their emergence from bankruptcy. Fresh start
    reporting is appropriate on the emergence from chapter 11
    bankruptcy if the reorganization value of the assets of the
    emerging entity immediately before the date of confirmation is
    less than the total of all post-petition liabilities and allowed
    claims, and if the holders of existing voting shares immediately



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

before confirmation receive less than 50 percent of the
    voting shares of the emerging entity. NRG met these requirements
    and adopted Fresh Start reporting upon the Company’s
    emergence from bankruptcy on December 5, 2003.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments,
    primarily commercial paper and money market accounts, with an
    original maturity of three months or less at the time of
    purchase.

Restricted
    Cash

Restricted cash consists primarily of funds held to satisfy the
    requirements of certain debt agreements and funds held within
    the Company’s projects that are restricted in their use.
    These funds are used to pay for current operating expenses and
    current debt service payments, per the restrictions of the debt
    agreements.

Inventory

Inventory is valued at the lower of weighted average cost or
    market and consists principally of fuel oil, coal and raw
    materials used to generate steam. Spare parts inventory are
    valued at a weighted average cost, since the Company expects to
    recover these costs in the ordinary course of business. Sales of
    inventory are classified as an operating activity in the
    consolidated statements of cash flows.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost however
    impairment adjustments are recorded whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be
    recoverable. NRG also classifies nuclear fuel related to the
    Company’s 44% ownership interest in STP as part of the
    Company’s property, plant, and equipment. Significant
    additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized,
    while repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the
    life of the respective asset are charged to expense as incurred.
    Depreciation other than nuclear fuel is computed using the
    straight-line method, while nuclear fuel is amortized based on
    units of production over the estimated useful lives. Certain
    assets and their related accumulated depreciation amounts are
    adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with the resulting
    gain or loss included in other income/(expense) in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

Asset
    Impairments

Long-lived assets that are held and used are reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    carrying values may not be recoverable. Such reviews are
    performed in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets,

or SFAS 144. An impairment loss is recognized
    if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected
    from an asset are less than its carrying value. An impairment
    charge is measured by the difference between an asset’s
    carrying amount and fair value with the difference recorded in
    operating costs and expenses in the statements of operations.
    Fair values are determined by a variety of valuation methods,
    including appraisals, sales prices of similar assets and present
    value techniques.

Investments accounted for by the equity method are reviewed for
    impairment in accordance with APB No. 18,

The Equity
    Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

, or
    APB 18, which requires that a loss in value of an
    investment that is other than a temporary decline should be
    recognized. The Company identifies and measures losses in the
    value of equity method investments based upon a comparison of
    fair value to carrying value.

Discontinued
    Operations

Long-lived assets are classified as discontinued operations when
    all of the required criteria specified in SFAS 144 are met.
    These criteria include, among others, existence of a qualified
    plan to dispose of an asset, an assessment that completion of a
    sale within one year is probable and approval of the appropriate
    level of management. Discontinued operations are reported at the
    lower of the asset’s carrying amount or fair value less
    cost to sell.

Project
    Development Costs and Capitalized Interest

Development costs are expensed in the preliminary stages of a
    project and capitalized when the project is deemed to be
    commercially viable. Commercial viability is determined by one
    or a series of actions including among others, Board of Director
    approval pursuant to a formal project plan that subjects the
    Company to significant future obligations that can only be
    discharged by the use of a Company asset. When a project is
    available for operations, previously capitalized project costs
    are reclassified to property, plant and equipment and amortized
    on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the
    project’s related assets. Capitalized costs are charged to
    expense if a project is abandoned or management otherwise
    determines the costs to be unrecoverable.

Interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance capital projects
    is capitalized if material. Capitalization of interest is
    discontinued when the asset under construction is ready for its
    intended use or when a project is terminated or construction
    ceases.

Debt
    Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest
    expense on a basis which approximates the effective interest
    method over the term of the related debt.

Intangible
    Assets

Intangible assets represent contractual rights held by NRG. The
    Company recognizes specifically identifiable intangible assets
    including emission allowances, power and fuel contracts when
    specific rights and contracts are acquired. In addition, NRG
    also established values for emission allowances and power
    contracts upon adoption of Fresh Start reporting. These
    intangible assets are amortized on either contracted volumes,
    straight line or units of production basis.



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not
    amortized, but rather are tested for impairment at least
    annually or more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that such acquired intangible assets have
    been determined to have finite lives and should now be amortized
    over their useful lives. NRG had no intangible assets with
    indefinite lives recorded as of December 31, 2006.

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

, the Company recognizes goodwill for the
    excess cost of an acquired entity over the net value assigned to
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

NRG performs goodwill impairment tests annually typically during
    the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
    Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process:

Step one —

Identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a
    reporting unit to the book value, including goodwill. If the
    fair value exceeds book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is
    not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value,
    proceed to step two.

Step two —

Compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill to the book value of the reporting unit goodwill. If
    the book value of goodwill exceeds fair value, an impairment
    charge is recognized for the sum of such excess.

Income
    Taxes

NRG accounts for income taxes using the liability method in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes

, or FAS 109, which requires that the Company use
    the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income
    taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant
    temporary differences.

NRG has two categories of income tax expense or
    benefit — current and deferred, as follows:

•

Current income tax expense or benefit consists solely of regular
    tax less applicable tax credits, and

•

Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the change in the net
    deferred income tax asset or liability, excluding amounts
    charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income.

NRG reports some of the Company’s revenues and expenses
    differently for financial statement purposes than for income tax
    return purposes resulting in temporary and permanent differences
    between the Company’s financial statements and income tax
    returns. The tax effects of such temporary differences are
    recorded as either deferred income tax assets or deferred income
    tax liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets. NRG measures the Company’s deferred income tax
    assets and deferred income tax liabilities using income tax
    rates that are currently in effect. A valuation allowance is
    recorded to reduce the Company’s net deferred tax
    liabilities to an amount that is more likely than not to be
    realized.

Revenue
    Recognition

NRG is primarily a power generation company, operating a
    portfolio of majority-owned electric generating plants and
    certain plants in which the Company’s ownership interest is
    50% or less, which are accounted for under the equity method of
    accounting. NRG also produces thermal energy for sale to
    customers, principally through steam and chilled water
    facilities.

Energy

— Both physical and financial
    transactions are entered into to optimize the financial
    performance of NRG’s generating facilities. Electric energy
    revenue is recognized upon transmission to the customer.
    Physical transactions, or the sale of generated electricity to
    meet supply and demand, are recorded on a gross basis in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Financial
    transactions, or the buying and selling of energy for trading
    purposes, are recorded net within operating revenues in the
    consolidated statements of operations in



NRG

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

accordance with

EITF 02-3,

Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held
    for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading
    and Risk Management Activities.

Capacity —

Capacity revenues are recognized
    when contractually earned, and consists of revenues received
    from a third party at either the market or a negotiated contract
    price for making installed generation capacity available in
    order to satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements.

Sale of Emission Allowances —

NRG records the
    Company’s bank of emission allowances as part of the
    Company’s intangible assets. From time to time, management
    may authorize the transfer from the Company’s emission bank
    to intangible assets

held-for-sale

as part of the Company’s asset optimization strategy. NRG
    records the sale of emission allowances on a net basis within
    other income in the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations.

Contract Amortization —

Liabilities recognized
    from power sales agreements assumed at Fresh Start and through
    acquisitions related to the sale of electric capacity and energy
    in future periods for which the fair value has been determined
    to be significantly less than market is amortized as an increase
    to revenue over the term of each underlying contract based on
    actual generation and/or contracted volumes.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

NRG accounts for derivative financial instruments under
    SFAS 133, as amended. SFAS 133 requires the Company to
    record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value unless
    they qualify for a Normal Purchase or Normal Sale, or NPNS,
    exception. Changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivatives
    are immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair
    value of derivatives accounted for as hedges are either:

•

Recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair
    value of the related hedged assets, liabilities and firm
    commitments; or

•

Deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income, or OCI, until the hedged transactions
    occur and are recognized in earnings for forecasted transactions.

NRG’s primary derivative instruments are power sales
    contracts, fuels purchase contracts, other energy related
    commodities, and interest rate instruments used to mitigate
    variability in earnings due to fluctuations in market prices and
    interest rates. On an ongoing basis, NRG assesses the
    effectiveness of all derivatives that are designated as hedges
    for accounting purposes in order to determine that each
    derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting
    changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Internal
    analyses that measure the statistical correlation between the
    derivative and the associated hedged item determine the
    effectiveness of such an energy contract designated as a hedge.
    If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly
    effective as a hedge, hedge accounting will be discontinued
    prospectively. Hedge accounting will also be discontinued on
    contracts related to commodity price risk previously accounted
    for as cash flow hedges when it is probable that delivery will
    not be made against these contracts. If the derivative
    instrument is terminated, the effective portion of this
    derivative in OCI will be frozen until the underlying hedged
    item is delivered.

Revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify for the NPNS
    exception are recognized when the underlying physical
    transaction is completed. While these contracts are considered
    derivative financial instruments under SFAS 133, they are
    not recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of
    accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as
    NPNS no longer meets the scope exception, the fair value of the
    related contract is recorded on the balance sheet and
    immediately recognized through earnings.

NRG’s trading activities include contracts entered into to
    profit from market price changes as opposed to hedging an
    exposure, and are subject to limits in accordance with the
    Company’s risk management policy. These contracts are
    recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the
    fair value of these derivative financial instruments are
    recognized in earnings. These trading activities are a
    complement to NRG’s energy marketing portfolio.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and
    Losses

The local currencies are generally the functional currency of
    NRG’s foreign operations. Foreign currency denominated
    assets and liabilities are translated at

end-of-period

rates of exchange. Revenues, expenses, and cash flows are
    translated at the weighted-average rates of exchange for the
    period. The resulting currency translation adjustments are
    accumulated and reported as a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity and are not included in the
    determination of the Company’s statements of operations.
    Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are reported within
    other income/(expense) in the Company’s statements of
    operations. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
    2004, amounts recognized as foreign currency transaction
    gains/losses were immaterial.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, which potentially subject NRG to
    concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, trust
    funds, accounts receivable, notes receivable, and investments in
    debt securities. Cash accounts and trust funds are generally
    held in federally insured banks. Accounts receivable, notes
    receivable, and derivative instruments are concentrated within
    entities engaged in the energy industry. These industry
    concentrations may impact the Company’s overall exposure to
    credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the
    customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic,
    industry or other conditions. Receivables are generally not
    collateralized; however, NRG believes that the credit risk posed
    by industry concentration is offset by the diversification and
    creditworthiness of the Company’s customer base.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trust funds,
    receivables, accounts payables, and accrued liabilities
    approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of
    these instruments. The carrying amounts of long-term receivables
    usually approximate fair value, as the effective rates for these
    instruments are comparable to market rates at year-end,
    including current portions. Any differences are disclosed in
    Note 5,

Financial Instruments.

The fair
    value of long-term debt is estimated based on quoted market
    prices for those instruments that are publicly traded or on a
    present value method using current interest rates for similar
    instruments with equivalent credit quality.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

NRG has adopted SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations

, or SFAS 143, which requires an
    entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset
    retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred.
    Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement
    obligation, an entity shall capitalize an asset retirement cost
    by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived
    asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time, the
    liability is accreted to its present value each period, while
    the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the
    related asset. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived
    assets included within the scope of SFAS 143 are those for
    which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws, statutes,
    written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under
    the doctrine of promissory estoppel. In addition, NRG has also
    identified conditional asset retirement obligations for asbestos
    removal and disposal, which are specific to certain power
    generation operations. Under FIN 47, a conditional asset
    retirement obligation is reasonably estimable if (a) it is
    evident that the fair value of the obligation is embodied in the
    acquisition price of the asset, (b) an active market exists
    for the transfer of the obligation, or (c) sufficient
    information exists to apply an expected present value technique.

These asset retirement obligations are primarily related to the
    future dismantlement of equipment on leased property and
    environment obligations related to nuclear decommissioning, ash
    disposal site closures, and fuel storage facilities. See
    Note 22,

Regulatory Matters,

Pensions

NRG offers pension benefits through either a defined benefit
    pension plan or a cash balance plan. In addition, the Company
    provides postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain
    groups of employees. Effective December 31, 2006, NRG
    accounts for pension and other postretirement benefits in
    accordance with SFAS No. 158

Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106 and 132 (R)

, or SFAS 158. NRG recognizes the
    funded status of the Company’s defined benefit plans in the
    statement of financial position and records an offset to other
    comprehensive income. In addition, NRG also recognizes on an
    after tax basis, as a component of other comprehensive income,
    gains and losses as well as all prior service costs that have
    not been included as part of the Company’s net periodic
    benefit cost. The determination of NRG’s obligation and
    expenses for pension benefits is dependent on the selection of
    certain assumptions. These assumptions determined by management
    include the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan
    assets and the rate of future compensation increases. NRG’s
    actuarial consultants use assumptions for such items as
    retirement age. The assumptions used may differ materially from
    actual results, which may result in a significant impact to the
    amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by the Company.

Stock
    Based Compensation

On January 1, 2006, NRG transitioned from
    SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

, or SFAS 123, and adopted
    SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004),

Share-Based
    Payment

, or SFAS 123(R), using the modified prospective
    method. Under the modified prospective method, NRG applied the
    provisions of SFAS 123(R) to new awards of stock-based
    compensation and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled
    after the required effective date. SFAS 123(R) requires
    that NRG apply a forfeiture rate to existing awards and apply
    the standard’s fair value recognition provisions. The fair
    value of the Company’s non-qualified stock options and
    performance units are estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the Monte Carlo valuation
    model, respectively. NRG uses the Company’s common stock
    price on the date of grant as the fair value of the
    Company’s restricted stock units and deferred stock units.
    The Company recognizes compensation expense for both graded and
    cliff vesting awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period for the entire award. Upon the adoption of
    SFAS 123(R), NRG applied a forfeiture rate to the
    Company’s existing awards and recognized in the
    Company’s statement of operations approximately
    $1.9 million, or $1.1 million, net of tax, as a
    reduction to compensation expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Investments
    Accounted for by the Equity Method

NRG has investments in various international and domestic energy
    projects. The equity method of accounting is applied to such
    investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and
    partnerships, because the ownership structure prevents NRG from
    exercising a controlling influence over the operating and
    financial policies of the projects. Under this method, equity in
    pre-tax income or losses of domestic partnerships and,
    generally, in the net income or losses of international
    projects, are reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated
    affiliates.

EITF 05-5

provides guidance on the accounting for early retirement or
    post-employment programs with specific features, and
    specifically the terms of Altersteilzeit early retirement
    arrangements. The Altersteilzeit, or ATZ, arrangement is a
    voluntary early retirement program in Germany designed to create
    an incentive for employees, within a certain age group, to
    transition from employment into retirement before their legal
    retirement age. If certain criteria are met by the employer, the
    German government provides to the employer a subsidy for bonuses
    paid to the employee and the additional contributions paid by
    the employer into the German government pension plan under an
    ATZ arrangement for a maximum of six years. Upon adoption of

EITF 05-5

on January 1, 2006, NRG recognized additional equity in
    earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of approximately
    $2 million, after-tax, from the Company’s MIBRAG
    interest. This amount reflects the cumulative effect of the
    adoption of

EITF 05-5,

and did not materially affect NRG’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or statement of cash flows for
    the year ended December 31, 2006.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
    the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
    estimates.

In recording transactions and balances resulting from business
    operations, NRG uses estimates based on the best information
    available. Estimates are used for such items as plant
    depreciable lives, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts,
    actuarially determined benefit costs, and the valuation of
    long-term energy commodity contracts, environmental liabilities,
    and legal costs incurred in connection with recorded loss
    contingencies, among others. In addition, estimates are used to
    test long-lived assets for impairment and to determine the fair
    value of impaired assets. As better information becomes
    available or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded
    estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be
    affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified for
    comparative purposes. These reclassifications had no effect on
    the Company’s net income or total stockholders’
    equity, as previously reported.

Recent
    Accounting Developments

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

, or
    FIN 48, which applies to all tax positions related to
    income taxes subject to SFAS 109. FIN 48 requires a
    new evaluation process for all tax positions taken, recognizing
    tax benefits when it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position
    will be sustained upon examination by the authorities. The
    benefit from a position that has surpassed the
    more-likely-than-not threshold is the largest amount



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon
    settlement. Differences between the amounts recognized in the
    statement of financial position prior to the adoption of
    FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption are to be
    accounted for as an adjustment to the beginning balance of
    retained earnings. The Company has completed its evaluation of
    the impact of the January 1, 2007, adoption of FIN 48
    and determined that such adoption will not have a material
    impact on the Company’s financial position, results from
    operations, and cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements,

or SFAS 157. This statement
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    This statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
    periods within those years. Upon implementation, this guidance
    is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, statements of operations, and
    cash flows.

In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
    No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year
    Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
    Financial Statements, or SAB 108,

provides guidance on
    how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year
    uncorrected misstatements should be considered in quantifying a
    current year misstatement. SAB 108 requires entities to
    quantify misstatements using both a roll-over method, which
    focuses on correcting the income statement as of the reporting
    date, and an iron-curtain method, which focuses on correcting
    the balance sheet as of the reporting date. NRG’s adoption
    of SAB 108 on December 31, 2006 had no impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities-including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115,

or SFAS 159. This statement provides
    entities with an option to measure and report selected financial
    assets and liabilities at fair value. This statement requires a
    business entity to report unrealized gains and losses on items
    for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at
    each subsequent reporting date. An entity may decide whether to
    elect the fair value option for each eligible item on its
    election date, subject to certain requirements described in the
    statement. This Statement will be effective for NRG as of
    January 1, 2008. Upon implementation, any remeasurement to
    fair value on the effective date for chosen eligible items shall
    be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. NRG
    is currently assessing the impact that SFAS 159 may have on
    its consolidated financial position.

    Business Acquisitions and Dispositions

Acquisition
    of Texas Genco LLC

On February 2, 2006, NRG acquired Texas Genco LLC, pursuant
    to an Acquisition Agreement dated September 30, 2005. As
    such, the results of Texas Genco LLC have been included in
    NRG’s consolidated financial statements since
    February 2, 2006. The purchase price of approximately
    $6.2 billion consisted of approximately $4.4 billion
    in cash, the issuance of approximately 35.4 million shares
    of NRG’s common stock valued at approximately
    $1.7 billion, and acquisition costs of approximately
    $0.1 billion. The value of NRG’s common stock issued
    to the Sellers was based on NRG’s average stock price
    immediately before and after the closing date of
    February 2, 2006. The acquisition also included the
    assumption of approximately $2.7 billion of Texas Genco LLC
    debt. Texas Genco LLC is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG,
    and is being managed and accounted for as a separate business
    segment referred to as NRG’s Texas region.

The acquisition of Texas Genco LLC was funded at closing with a
    combination of: (i) cash proceeds received upon the
    issuance and sale in a public offering of 20,855,057 shares
    of NRG’s common stock at a price of $48.75 per share;
    (ii) cash proceeds received upon the issuance and sale of
    $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of
    7.25% Senior Notes due 2014 and $2.4 billion aggregate
    principal amount of 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016;
    (iii) cash proceeds received upon the issuance and sale in
    a public offering of 2,000,000 shares of mandatory
    convertible preferred stock at a price of $250 per share;
    (iv) funds borrowed under a new senior secured credit
    facility consisting of a $3.6 billion term loan facility, a
    $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, and a
    $1.0 billion synthetic letter of credit facility; and
    (v) cash on hand.

One of NRG’s principal reasons for making acquisitions is
    to improve the Company’s position in deregulated generation
    markets. NRG believes that the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC
    presented an opportunity for NRG to



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

become a meaningful player in the ERCOT market, a competitive
    market with stable regulation and forecasted demand growth. NRG
    Texas is the second-largest generation company in the ERCOT
    market and the largest owner of power plants in Houston. As of
    December 31, 2006, NRG’s Texas region operated 52
    generating units at nine power generation plants, including an
    undivided 44% interest in two nuclear generation units at STP.
    The aggregate net generation capacity at NRG’s Texas region
    is approximately 10,760 MW, which includes approximately
    5,280 MW of low marginal cost solid fuel and nuclear
    powered baseload plants.

The acquisition of Texas Genco LLC was accounted for using the
    purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the purchase
    price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed based on the estimated fair value of such assets and
    liabilities as of February 2, 2006. The excess of the
    purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
    identified intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.
    The allocation of the purchase price may be adjusted if
    additional information for certain income tax items become
    available.

The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition:

Goodwill

— The acquisition of Texas Genco LLC
    included an element of premium, or goodwill, due to favorable
    market conditions for the acquired solid fuel plants —
    Parish (coal), Limestone (lignite/coal), and STP (nuclear).
    These plants have a substantial fuel cost advantage relative to
    natural gas-fired plants, with current and expected continuation
    of elevated natural gas prices. Power prices in the ERCOT market
    are largely driven by natural gas prices as the marginal market
    power requirements are met by gas-fired plants. It is expected
    that this will continue for the foreseeable future in ERCOT,
    since a substantial portion of power generation is gas-fired and
    the

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company believes that it will require an extended period of time
    to transition to alternative fuels that could have an effect on
    future price expectations. As such, the above-mentioned plants
    will benefit from higher power prices, which are driven by the
    price of natural gas and the relatively low cost of coal and
    nuclear fuel for an extended period of time. These favorable
    market conditions are not considered as separable intangible
    assets and are, therefore, the major contributor to the amount
    of goodwill.

    goodwill during the nine month period ended December 31,

The changes in the fair value for fixed assets, identifiable

    several factors, including the following:

•

Change in assumptions and estimates in the price of electricity,
    coal, gas and emission allowances;

•

The tax basis of the assets and liabilities acquired; and

•

More precise information with respect to identifiable tangible
    and intangible assets.

Acquisition
    of Remaining 50% interest in WCP

On March 31, 2006, NRG completed a purchase and sale
    agreement for projects co-owned with Dynegy, Inc. Under the
    agreements, NRG acquired Dynegy’s 50% ownership interest in
    WCP (Generation) Holdings, Inc., or WCP, for $205 million,
    and NRG became the sole owner of WCP’s 1,825 MW of
    generation capacity in Southern California. In addition, NRG
    sold to Dynegy the Company’s 50% ownership interest in
    Rocky Road Power LLC, or Rocky Road, a 330 MW gas-fueled,
    simple cycle peaking plant located in Dundee, Illinois. NRG sold
    Rocky Road for a fair value sale price of $45 million,
    paying Dynegy a net purchase price of $160 million at
    closing. Prior to the purchase, NRG had an existing investment
    in WCP accounted for as an equity method investment, or Original
    Investment.

One of NRG’s principal reasons for making acquisitions is
    to improve the Company’s position in deregulated generation
    markets. NRG believes that the acquisition of the remaining
    interest in WCP presents an opportunity for NRG to become a
    meaningful player in the CAISO market, a market with stable
    forecasted demand growth. The acquisition of the remaining 50%
    interest in WCP, or New Investment, was accounted for as a step
    acquisition since the Original Investment was transacted in a
    prior period. As a result, the value of the Original Investment
    and the purchase price of the New Investment were determined and
    allocated separately. The value of the Original Investment was
    based on the book value of approximately $159 million as of
    the date of the acquisition of the New Investment.

The value of the New Investment was allocated based on the
    estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    as of March 31, 2006. The purchase price allocation
    reflected an excess of fair value of the net assets acquired
    over the purchase price of the New Investment, resulting in
    negative goodwill of approximately $46 million. The
    negative goodwill was subsequently allocated as a reduction to
    the fair value of WCP’s fixed assets. Once the WCP asset
    appraisals are final, the purchase price allocation may change
    from the amounts included herein based on the results of the
    final appraisal and an analysis of the income tax effect on the
    acquisition.

Gladstone

— On June 8, 2006, NRG announced

    Gladstone power station, or Gladstone, and its associated 100%
    owned NRG Gladstone Operating Services to Transfield Services,
    an Australia-based provider of operations, maintenance,
    ownership and asset management services for a purchase price of
    approximately $189 million (AU$239 million) subject to
    customary purchase price adjustments, plus assumption of
    NRG’s share of Gladstone’s unconsolidated debt and
    cash of approximately $61 million (AU$77 million) and
    approximately $28 million (AU$35 million),
    respectively. After-tax cash proceeds are expected to be in
    excess of $185 million (AU$234 million). The sale is
    pending until NRG satisfies certain conditions, particularly the
    securing of certain consents and waivers from the other owners
    of the project, or agrees to complete the sale on alternative
    terms. NRG is seeking to close the transaction in 2007.

Note 4 —

Discontinued
    Operations

NRG has classified material business operations, and
    gains/losses recognized on sale, as discontinued operations for
    projects that were sold or have met the required criteria for
    such classification. The financial results for the affected
    businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations.
    Accordingly, current period operating results and prior periods
    have been restated to report the operations as discontinued. NRG
    classifies certain assets as

held-for-sale

when management has committed to selling certain long lived
    assets within the next year. This classification does not affect
    prior period operating results.

SFAS 144 requires that discontinued operations be valued on
    an

asset-by-asset

basis at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs
    to sell. In applying the provisions of SFAS 144, the
    Company’s management considered cash flow analyses, bids,
    and offers related to those assets and businesses. In accordance
    with the provisions of SFAS 144, discontinued operations
    and assets

held-for-sale

are not being depreciated commencing with their classification
    as such. The assets and liabilities of the discontinued
    operations are reported in NRG’s balance sheets as
    discontinued operations.

    $3 million was recognized in 2004.

Penobscot Energy Recovery Company (PERC)

— In
    April 2004, NRG completed the sale of its interest in PERC to
    SET PERC Investment LLC. Upon completion of the transaction, NRG
    received net proceeds of $18 million, resulting in a gain
    of approximately $3 million.

Cobee

— During the first quarter of 2004, NRG
    entered into an agreement for the sale of the Company’s
    interest in the Cobee project to Globeleq Holdings Limited,
    which also reached financial close in April 2004. Upon
    completion of the transaction, NRG received net proceeds of
    approximately $50 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of
    approximately $3 million.

LSP Energy, Batesville —

On August 24,
    2004, NRG completed the sale of the Company’s 100% interest
    in an

837-MW

generating plant in Batesville, Mississippi, including the
    assumption of approximately $300 million of outstanding
    project debt. The transaction resulted in the elimination of
    $289 million in consolidated debt from NRG’s balance
    sheets. In exchange for the sale, NRG received cash proceeds of
    $28 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $11 million
    in 2004.

Hsin Yu

— During the second quarter of 2004,
    NRG entered into an agreement for the sale of the Company’s
    interest in the Hsin Yu project to a minority interest
    shareholder, Asia Pacific Energy Development Company Ltd., and
    reached financial closing in May 2004. Completion of the
    transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately
    $10 million, resulting from the Company’s negative
    equity in the project.

NEO Corporation

— During the third quarter of
    2004, NRG completed the sale of four wholly-owned
    entities — NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO
    Prima Deshecha LLC and NEO Tajiguas LLC, as well as the sale of
    several NEO investments — Four Hills LLC, Minnesota
    Methane II LLC, NEO Montauk Genco LLC, and NEO Montauk
    Gasco LLC to Algonquin Power of Canada. NRG received cash
    proceeds of $6 million from the sale of the wholly-owned
    entities, which resulted in a $6 million pre-tax gain
    associated with the four wholly-owned entities sold. In
    addition, NRG received cash proceeds of $6 million for the
    sale of the Company’s equity method investments, which
    resulted in a pre-tax loss of approximately $4 million. The
    sale of the equity method investments does not qualify for
    reporting purposes as discontinued operations.

Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and Hedging Activities,

as amended, or SFAS 133,
    requires NRG to recognize all derivative instruments on the
    balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and to measure
    them at fair value each reporting period unless they qualify for
    a NPNS exception. If certain conditions are met, NRG may be able
    to designate certain derivatives as cash flow hedges and defer
    the effective portion of the change in fair value of the
    derivatives to OCI and subsequently recognize in earnings when
    the hedged transaction occurs. The ineffective portion of a cash
    flow hedge is immediately recognized in earnings.

For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets
    or liabilities, the changes in fair value of both the derivative
    and the hedged transaction are recorded in current earnings. The
    ineffective portion of a hedging derivative instrument’s
    change in fair value is immediately recognized into earnings.

For derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges or
    do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in
    the fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Under
    the guidelines established per SFAS 133, certain derivative
    instruments may qualify for the NPNS exception and are therefore
    exempt from fair value accounting treatment. SFAS 133
    applies to NRG’s energy related commodity contracts,
    interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange contracts.

As the Company engages principally in the trading and marketing
    of its generation assets, most of NRG’s commercial
    activities qualify for hedge accounting under the requirements
    of SFAS 133. In order to so qualify, the physical
    generation and sale of electricity should be highly probable at
    inception of the trade and throughout the period it is held, as
    is the case with the Company’s baseload plants. For this
    reason, trades in support of NRG’s peaking units will
    generally not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, with any
    changes in fair value likely to be reflected on a

mark-to-market

basis in the statement of operations. The majority of trades in
    support of NRG’s baseload units normally qualify for NPNS
    or cash flow hedge accounting treatment, and all of NRG’s
    hedging and trading activities are in accordance with the
    Company’s risk management policy.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Energy-Related
    Commodities

To manage the commodity price risk associated with the
    Company’s competitive supply activities and the price risk
    associated with power sales from the Company’s electric
    generation facilities, NRG may enter into a variety of
    derivative and non-derivative hedging instruments, utilizing the
    following:

•

Forward contracts, which commit NRG to sell energy commodities
    or fuels in the future.

•

Futures contracts, which are exchange-traded standardized
    commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial
    instrument.

•

Swap agreements, which require payments to or from
    counter-parties based upon the differential between two prices
    for a predetermined contractual, or notional, quantity.

•

Option contracts, which convey the right to buy or sell a
    commodity.

The objectives for entering into derivative contracts designated
    as hedges include:

•

Fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity
    sales through the use of various derivative instruments
    including gas collars and swaps at a level that provides an
    acceptable return on the Company’s electric generation
    operations.

•

Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for
    the operation of NRG’s power plants.

•

Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated energy purchases to
    supply NRG’s load-serving customers.

As of December 31, 2006, NRG had hedge and non-hedge
    energy-related derivative financial instruments, and other
    energy-related contracts that did not qualify as derivative
    financial instruments extending through December 2026. As of
    December 31, 2006, NRG’s derivative assets and
    liabilities consisted primarily of the following:

•

Forward and financial contracts for the sale of electricity and
    related products economically hedging NRG’s generation
    assets’ forecasted output through 2012.

•

Forward and financial contracts for the purchase of fuel
    commodities relating to the forecasted usage of NRG’s
    generation assets into 2017.

Also, as of December 31, 2006, NRG had other energy-related
    contracts that qualified for the NPNS exception and were
    therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment under the
    guidelines established by SFAS 133 as follows:

•

Power sales and capacity contracts extending to 2010.

•

Coal purchase contracts extending through 2015 designated as
    normal purchases and disclosed as part of NRG’s contractual
    cash obligations. See Note 21,

Commitments and
    Contingencies

, for further discussion.

Also, as of December 31, 2006, NRG had other energy-related
    contracts that did not qualify as derivatives under the
    guidelines established by SFAS 133 as follows:

•

Load-following forward electric sale contracts extending through
    2026.

•

Natural gas transportation contracts and storage agreements are
    not derivatives and are disclosed as part of NRG’s
    contractual cash obligations. See Note 21,

Commitments
    and Contingencies

, for further discussion.

Interest
    Rate Swaps

NRG is exposed to changes in interest rates through the
    Company’s issuance of variable and fixed rate debt. In
    order to manage the Company’s interest rate risk, NRG
    enters into interest-rate swap agreements. In January 2006,



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in anticipation of the New Senior Credit Facility, NRG entered
    into a series of forward starting interest rate swaps intended
    to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with the debt
    issuance. These transactions were designated as cash flow hedges
    with any gains/losses deferred on the balance sheet in OCI. In
    February 2006, with the completion of the sale of the Senior
    Notes, the Company designated a

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap as a hedge of fair value changes in the
    Senior Notes. This interest rate swap was previously designated
    as a hedge of NRG’s 8% Second Priority Notes, which were
    effectively replaced by the Senior Notes.

As of December 31, 2006, all of NRG’s interest rate
    swap arrangements had been designated as either cash flow or
    fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2006, NRG had
    interest rate derivative instruments extending through June 2019.

Foreign
    Currency-Related Derivative Instruments

To preserve the U.S. dollar value of projected foreign
    currency cash flows, NRG may hedge, or protect those cash flows
    using available foreign currency hedging instruments. On
    August 15, 2006, NRG entered into a forward foreign
    exchange contract to sell AU$300 million in exchange for
    $229 million and designated it as a fair value hedge. Due
    to changes in the exchange rate, NRG recognized a loss of
    approximately $5 million, with an offsetting gain from
    derivative income on the related contract. The contract settled
    in the fourth quarter 2006.

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    NRG’s pre-tax earnings were not materially affected by any
    gain or loss associated with foreign currency hedging
    instruments not accounted for as hedges in accordance with
    SFAS 133.

Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive Income

Gains and losses attributable to hedge derivatives are
    reclassified from OCI to current period earnings due to the
    unwinding of previously deferred amounts. These amounts are
    recorded on the same line in the statement of operations in
    which the hedged transactions are recorded. Changes in the fair
    values of derivatives accounted for as hedges are also recorded
    in OCI.

As of December 31, 2006, the net balance in OCI relating to

    $209 million, which is net of $135 million in income
    taxes. NRG expects $64 million of net deferred gains on
    derivative instruments accumulated in OCI to be recognized in
    earnings during the next twelve months.

With the reclassification of Flinders as a discontinued
    operation in 2006, previously designated cash flow hedges were
    no longer effective beyond the expected date of the sale, and
    thus the deferred gain previously recorded in OCI of
    approximately $11 million was recognized as a derivative
    gain and was included in income from discontinued operations.

Statement
    of Operations

In accordance with SFAS 133, unrealized gains and losses

For the year ended December 31, 2006, the unrealized gain
    associated with changes in the fair value of derivative
    instruments not accounted for as hedge derivatives of
    $295 million is comprised of $172 million of fair
    value increases in forward sales of electricity and fuel,
    $90 million from the reversal of

mark-to-market

losses, which ultimately settled as financial revenues, and
    $33 million of gains associated with our trading activity.
    The $172 million of fair value increases in forward sales
    of electricity and fuel includes approximately $28 million
    due to the ineffectiveness associated with financial forward
    contracted electric and gas sales. NRG’s pre-tax earnings
    were also affected by a $3 million loss due to
    ineffectiveness associated with our

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap designated as a hedge of fair value changes
    in the Senior Notes.

Discontinued Hedge Accounting

— During 2006,
    due to a relatively mild summer season and expected lower power
    generation for the remainder of 2006, NRG discontinued cash flow
    hedge accounting for certain contracts related to commodity
    prices previously accounted for as a cash flow hedge and
    determined forecasted sales were no longer probable. These
    contracts were originally entered into as hedges of forecasted
    sales by baseload plants. The decision not to deliver against
    these contracts was driven by the decline in natural gas and
    associated power prices, making it uneconomical to dispatch the
    units into the marketplace. As a result, approximately
    $5 million of previously deferred revenue in OCI was
    recognized in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006.

    Goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment in
    accordance with SFAS 142 at the

reporting-unit

level. Goodwill is tested annually, typically during the fourth
    quarter, or more often if events or circumstances, such as
    adverse changes in the business climate, indicate there may be
    an impairment. As of December 31, 2006, there was no
    impairment to goodwill. As of



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2006, NRG had approximately $991 million
    of goodwill that is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes
    in future periods.

Negative Goodwill

— As discussed in
    Note 3,

Business Acquisitions and Dispositions,

NRG’s acquisition of Dynegy’s 50% interest in WCP
    reflected an excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired
    over the purchase price, which resulted in negative goodwill of
    approximately $46 million. This negative goodwill was
    subsequently allocated as a reduction to the fair value of
    WCP’s non-current assets.

Intangible Assets

—

NRG acquired
    intangible assets as part of the Company’s acquisition of
    Texas Genco LLC and established intangible assets upon adoption
    of Fresh Start reporting. These intangible assets include
    SO


and
    NO

x

emission allowances and certain in-market power, fuel (coal,
    gas, and nuclear) and water contracts. The emission allowances
    are amortized and recorded as part of the cost of operations,
    with
    NO

x

emission allowances amortized on a straight line basis and
    SO


emission allowances amortized based on units of production. The
    contracts are amortized based on contracted volumes over the
    life of each contract. The power contracts are amortized and
    recorded as part of revenues, while fuel and water contracts are
    amortized and recorded as part of the cost of operations.

NRG actively trades portions of the Company’s emission
    allowances as part of the Company’s asset optimization
    strategy, with their respective costs expensed when sold.
    Emission allowances that the Company designates for such trading
    are reclassified to intangible assets

The weighted average remaining amortization period is
    3.2 years for fuel contracts and one year for water
    contracts. Emission allowances are amortized based on a mix of a
    straight line and actual emissions emitted from the respective
    plants.

Intangible assets held for sale

— NRG records
    the Company’s bank of emission allowances as part of the
    Company’s intangible assets. From time to time, management
    may authorize the transfer from the Company’s emission bank
    to intangible assets

held-for-sale

as part of the Company’s asset optimization strategy. As of
    December 31, 2006, the value of emission allowances

held-for-sale

is $79 million and is managed by the Corporate segment.
    Once transferred to

held-for-sale,

these emission allowances transferred are prohibited from moving
    back to

held-for-use.

Out-of-market

contracts —

Due to Fresh Start accounting, as well
    as the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, NRG acquired certain

out-of-market

contracts. These are primarily power, gas swaps, and certain
    coal contracts and are classified as non-current liabilities on
    NRG’s consolidated balance sheet. Both the gas swap and
    power contracts are amortized to revenues, while the coal
    contracts are amortized to cost of operation. As a result of the
    Company’s Hedge Reset transaction, NRG reset to market
    approximately $1.2 billion of

out-of-market

power and gas swap contracts reflected as a reduction to the
    outstanding balance.

Senior
    Notes Related to the Texas Genco LLC
    Acquisition

On February 2, 2006, NRG completed the sale of
    (i) $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of
    7.25% senior notes due 2014, or 7.25% Senior Notes,
    and (ii) $2.4 billion aggregate principal amount of
    7.375% senior notes due 2016, or 7.375% Senior Notes,
    collectively referred to as the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes
    were issued under an Indenture, dated February 2, 2006, or
    the Indenture, between NRG and Law Debenture Trust Company of
    New York, as trustee, as supplemented by a First Supplemental
    Indenture, dated February 2, 2006, between NRG, the
    Guarantors named therein, and the Trustee, relating to the
    7.25% Senior Notes, and as supplemented by a Second
    Supplemental Indenture, dated February 2, 2006, between
    NRG, the Guarantors named therein, and the Trustee, relating to
    the 7.375% Senior Notes. On March 14, 2006, NRG
    executed a Third Supplemental Indenture and a Fourth
    Supplemental Indenture, whereby the recently acquired Texas
    region subsidiaries were added as Guarantors. On April 28,
    2006, NRG executed a Fifth Supplemental Indenture and a Sixth
    Supplemental Indenture, whereby the recently acquired WCP
    subsidiaries were added as Guarantors. On November 13,
    2006, NRG executed the Seventh and Eighth Supplemental
    Indentures, whereby the recently acquired Padoma subsidiaries
    were added as Guarantors. The Indentures and the form of notes
    provide, among other things, that the Senior Notes will be
    senior unsecured obligations of NRG.

Interest is payable on the Senior Notes on February 1 and
    August 1 of each year beginning on August 1, 2006,
    until their maturity dates — February 1, 2014 for
    the 7.25% Senior Notes and February 1, 2016 for the
    7.375% Senior Notes.

At any time prior to February 1, 2009, NRG may redeem up to
    35% of the aggregate principal amount of the series of Senior
    Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings, at a
    redemption price of 107.25% of the principal amount, in the case
    of the 7.25% Senior Notes, and 107.375% of the principal
    amount, in the case of the 7.375% Senior Notes. In
    addition, NRG may redeem the 7.25% Senior Notes and
    7.375% Senior Notes at the redemption prices expressed as a
    percentage of the principal amount redeemed set forth below,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes redeemed.

Prior to February 1, 2010 for the 7.25% Senior Notes,
    or the First Applicable 7.25% Redemption Date, NRG may
    redeem all or a portion of the 7.25% Senior Notes at a price
    equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a premium and accrued
    interest. The premium is the greater of (i) 1% of the
    principal amount of the note, or (ii) the excess of the
    principal amount of the note over the following: the present
    value of 103.625% of the note, plus

The Indentures provide for customary events of default, which
    include, among others: nonpayment of principal or interest;
    breach of other agreements in the Indentures; defaults in
    failure to pay certain other indebtedness; the rendering of
    judgments to pay certain amounts of money against NRG and its
    subsidiaries; the failure of certain guarantees to be
    enforceable; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.
    Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or the
    Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then
    outstanding series of Senior Notes may declare all of the Senior
    Notes of such series to be due and payable immediately.

The terms of the Indentures, among other things, limit
    NRG’s ability and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability
    to:

•

return of capital to shareholders;

•

grant liens on assets to lenders; and

•

incur additional debt.

Senior
    Notes Related to Hedge Reset Transaction

On November 21, 2006, NRG completed the sale of
    $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of
    7.375% Senior Notes due 2017. The Senior Notes were issued
    under an Indenture, dated February 2, 2006, among NRG and
    Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, as trustee, or the
    Trustee, as supplemented by a Ninth Supplemental Indenture,
    dated November 21, 2006 among NRG, the Guarantors named
    therein, and the Trustee, relating to these 7.375% Senior
    Notes. The Ninth Supplemental Indenture and the form of the
    notes provide, among other things, that these Senior Notes will
    be senior unsecured obligations of NRG.

NRG used the net proceeds from these Senior Notes and cash on
    hand to fund payments to counterparties under certain of the
    Company’s existing long-term hedging agreements pursuant to
    agreements to reset the hedge

    the Senior Notes on January 15 and July 15 of each year
    beginning on July 15, 2007, until their maturity date of
    January 15, 2017.

NRG may redeem up to 35% of the notes issued prior to
    January 15, 2012, with net cash proceeds of certain equity
    offerings at a price of 107.375%, provided at least 65% of the

    2012, NRG may redeem all or a portion of the Senior Notes at a
    price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes
    redeemed, plus a premium and any accrued and unpaid interest. In
    addition, on or after January 15, 2012, NRG may redeem some

ML Note

— As part of the Company’s Hedge
    Reset transactions, NRG negotiated an $11 million note with
    Merrill Lynch. The note is subordinated to NRG’s second
    lien structure. It bears interest at a floating rate equal to
    Libor plus 1.9%. The note matures on November 1, 2013. The
    note does not allow for an optional prepayment; however, Merrill
    Lynch has the option to require prepayment on the first
    anniversary of the closing date of November 1, 2006.

Senior
    Credit Facility

On February 2, 2006, NRG entered into a senior secured
    credit facility, or the Senior Credit Facility, with a syndicate
    of financial institutions, including Morgan Stanley Senior
    Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, Morgan
    Stanley & Co., Inc., as collateral agent, and Morgan
    Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
    as joint lead book-runners, joint lead arrangers, and
    co-documentation agents, providing up to an aggregate amount of
    $5.575 billion. The Senior Credit Facility consisted of a
    $3.575 billion senior first priority secured term loan, or
    the Term Loan Facility, a $1.0 billion senior first
    priority secured revolving credit facility, or the Revolving
    Credit Facility, and a $1.0 billion senior first priority
    secured synthetic letter of credit facility, or the Letter of
    Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility replaced NRG’s
    then existing senior secured credit facility. The Term
    Loan Facility matures on February 1, 2013 and will
    amortize in 27 consecutive equal quarterly installments of 0.25%
    of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility,
    beginning June 30, 2006, with the balance payable on the
    seventh anniversary thereof. The full amount of the Revolving
    Credit Facility will mature on February 2, 2011.

On November 21, 2006, NRG amended this Senior Credit
    Facility, increasing to $1.5 billion the Letter of Credit
    Facility as part of the Company’s Hedge Reset transactions.
    In addition, NRG amended certain terms and provisions within the
    existing credit agreement in order to provide the Company with
    more financial flexibility, and to help support the
    Company’s

Repowering NRG

program and its Capital
    Allocation Program. As part of the amendment, NRG inserted a
    provision, which results in an increased level of mandatory
    first lien debt repayment each year. Beginning 2008, NRG must
    offer a portion of its excess cash flow, an amount which
    approximates the Company’s free cash flow for the prior
    year, to its first lien lenders. The percentage of the excess
    cash flow offered to these lenders is dependent upon the
    Company’s consolidated leverage ratio at the end of the
    preceding year. Of the amount offered, the first lien lenders
    must accept 50%, while the remaining 50% may either be accepted
    or rejected at the lenders’ option.



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Letter of Credit Facility will mature on February 1,
    2013 and no amortization will be required in respect thereof. As
    of December 31, 2006, NRG had approximately
    $3.1 billion outstanding under the Company’s Term Loan
    Facility. As of December 31, 2006, NRG had issued
    $967 million under the Company’s Letter of Credit
    Facility and $145 million in letters of credit under the
    Company’s Revolving Credit Facility.

The Senior Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of
    NRG’s existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries,
    with certain customary or

agreed-upon

exceptions for unrestricted foreign subsidiaries, project
    subsidiaries, and certain other subsidiaries. The capital stock
    of substantially all of NRG’s subsidiaries, with certain
    exceptions for unrestricted subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries,
    and project subsidiaries, has been pledged for the benefit of
    the Senior Credit Facility’s lenders.

The Senior Credit Facility is also secured by first-priority
    perfected security interests in substantially all of the
    property and assets owned or acquired by NRG and its
    subsidiaries, other than certain limited exceptions. These
    exceptions include assets of certain unrestricted subsidiaries,
    equity interests in certain of NRG’s project affiliates
    that have non-recourse debt financing, and voting equity
    interests in excess of 66% of the total outstanding voting
    equity interest of certain of NRG’s foreign subsidiaries.

The Senior Credit Facility contains customary covenants, which,
    among other things, require NRG to meet certain financial tests,
    including minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage
    ratio on a consolidated basis, and limit NRG’s ability to:

•

incur indebtedness and liens and enter into sale and lease-back
    transactions;

•

make investments, loans and advances; and

•

return capital to shareholders.

NRG has the option to prepay the Senior Credit Facility in whole
    or in part at any time.

Interest Rate Swaps

— In anticipation of the
    Senior Credit Facility, in January 2006, NRG entered into a
    series of forward-setting interest rate swaps. These interest
    rate swaps became effective on February 15, 2006 and are
    intended to hedge the risks associated with floating interest
    rates. For each of the interest rate swaps, the Company pays its
    counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a
    predetermined notional value, and NRG receives quarterly the
    equivalent of a floating interest payment based on a

3-month

LIBOR calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate
    swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made quarterly,
    and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period.
    While the notional value of each of the swaps does not vary over
    time, the swaps are designed to mature sequentially. The total
    notional amount of these swaps is approximately
    $2.2 billion.

The notional amounts and maturities of each tranche of these
    swaps as of December 31, 2006 are as follows:

    Related to Capital Allocation Program

During the third quarter 2006, the Company formed two
    wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiaries, NRG Common Stock
    Finance I, LLC, or CSF I, and NRG Common Stock
    Finance II, LLC, or CSF II, that are both

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

consolidated by NRG. Their purpose is to repurchase shares of
    NRG’s common stock in the public markets or in privately
    negotiated transactions in connection with Phase I of the
    Company’s Capital Allocation Program. Phase I was a
    $500 million stock repurchase program, which was completed
    on October 13, 2006, with total common stock repurchased of
    10,587,700 shares. These subsidiaries were funded with a
    combination of cash from NRG and a mix of notes and preferred
    interests issued to Credit Suisse. Both the notes and the
    preferred interests are non-recourse debt to NRG or any of its
    restricted subsidiaries, with the notes collateralized by the
    NRG common stock repurchased by these two wholly-owned
    unrestricted subsidiaries that are consolidated in the
    Company’s statement of financial position. In addition, the
    assets of these two subsidiaries are not available to the
    creditors of NRG and the Company’s other subsidiaries.

Notes

— As of December 31, 2006, CSF I and
    CSF II issued a total of $249 million in notes in
    connection with Phase I of the Capital Allocation Program
    that will mature in two tranches: $137 million in October
    2008, plus accrued interest at an annual rate of 5.45%, and the
    balance of $112 million in October 2009, plus accrued
    interest at an annual rate of 6.11%.

Preferred Interests

— As of December 31,
    2006, total preferred interests issued and outstanding by CSF I
    and CSF II were approximately $84 million to Credit
    Suisse. These preferred interests are classified as a liability
    per SFAS 150, because they embody a fixed unconditional
    obligation that these two unrestricted subsidiaries must settle.
    The preferred interests also mature in two tranches:
    $53 million in October 2008, plus accrued interest at an
    annual rate of 12.65%, and $31 million in October 2009,
    plus accrued interest at an annual rate of 13.23%.

Project
    Financings

The following are descriptions of certain indebtedness of
    NRG’s project subsidiaries that remain outstanding as of
    December 31, 2006. The indebtedness described below is
    non-recourse to NRG, unless otherwise noted.

Peakers

In June 2002, NRG Peaker Financing LLC, or Peakers, an indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $325 million in floating
    rate bonds due June 2019. Peakers subsequently swapped such
    floating rate debt for fixed rate debt at an all-in cost of
    6.67% per annum. Principal, interest, and swap payments are
    guaranteed by XL Capital Assurance, through a financial guaranty
    insurance policy. These notes are also secured by, among other
    things, substantially all of the assets of and membership
    interests in Bayou Cove Peaking Power LLC, Big Cajun I Peaking
    Power LLC, NRG Sterlington Power LLC, NRG Rockford LLC, NRG
    Rockford II LLC, and NRG Rockford Equipment LLC. As of
    December 31, 2006, approximately $290 million in
    principal remained outstanding on these bonds. Upon emergence
    from bankruptcy, NRG issued a $36 million letter of credit
    to the Peakers’ Collateral Agent. The letter of credit may
    be drawn if the project is unable to meet principal or interest
    payments. There are no provisions requiring NRG to replenish the
    letter of credit if it is drawn.

NRG
    Thermal

NRG owns and operates its thermal business through a
    wholly-owned subsidiary holding company, NRG Thermal LLC, or NRG
    Thermal. In August 1993, the predecessor entity to NRG
    Thermal’s largest subsidiary, NRG Energy Center Minneapolis
    LLC, or NRG Thermal Minneapolis, issued $84 million of
    7.31% senior secured notes due June 2013, of which
    approximately $42 million remained outstanding as of
    December 31, 2006. In July 2002, NRG Thermal Minneapolis
    issued an additional $55 million of 7.25% Series A
    notes due August 2017, of which approximately $45 million
    remained outstanding as of December 31, 2006, and
    $20 million of 7.12% Series B notes due August 2017,
    of which approximately $16 million remained outstanding as
    of December 31, 2006. This indebtedness is secured by
    substantially all of the assets of NRG Thermal Minneapolis. NRG
    Thermal has guaranteed the indebtedness, and its guarantee is
    secured by a pledge of the equity interests in all of NRG
    Thermal’s subsidiaries.

    Brazilian Reals term loan maturing in January 2012. The facility
    bears a floating interest rate and amortizes on a schedule that
    is indexed to certain foreign exchange rates. The principal
    obligation as of December 31, 2006 was approximately
    $19 million. Additionally, Eletrobrãs owns preferred
    shares in ITISA, which for U.S. GAAP purposes are reflected
    as debt. The preferred shares accrue cumulative dividends of
    12% per year, payable only at such time ITISA has
    sufficient retained profits or reserves. The balance as of

Capital
    Leases

Saale
    Energie GmbH

Saale Energie GmbH, or SEG, an NRG wholly-owned subsidiary, has
    a 41.9% participation in the Schkopau Power Plant, or Schkopau,
    through NRG’s interest in the Kraftwerke Schkopau GbR, or
    KSGbR, partnership. Under the terms of a Use and Benefit Fee
    Agreement, SEG and the other partner to the project, E.ON
    Kraftwerke GmbH, are required to fund debt service and certain
    other costs resulting from the construction and financing of
    Schkopau. The Use and Benefit Fee Agreement is treated as a
    capital lease under U.S. GAAP. Calls for funds are made to
    the partners based on their participation interest as cash is
    needed. The KSGbR issued debt to fund Schkopau pursuant to
    multiple facilities totaling approximately
    €785 million (approximately $1 billion). As of
    December 31, 2006, approximately €300 million
    (approximately US $396 million) remained outstanding
    at Schkopau. Interests on the individual loans accrue at fixed
    rates averaging 5.47% per annum, with maturities occurring
    between 2007 and 2015. The lenders to the project rely almost
    exclusively on the creditworthiness of E.ON Kraftwerke GmbH. SEG
    remains liable to the lenders as a partner in KSGbR, but there
    is no recourse to NRG. As of December 31, 2006, the capital
    lease obligation at SEG was approximately $199 million.

Debt
    Extinguishment

Cash
    Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation

On December 15, 2005, NRG commenced a cash tender offer and
    consent solicitation for any and all outstanding
    $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of the
    Company’s 8% second priority notes. On that date, NRG also
    commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any
    and all outstanding $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount
    of Texas Genco LLC and Texas Genco Financing Corp.’s 6.875%
    senior notes due 2014, or the Texas Genco Notes. The offers to
    purchase the 8% Second Priority Notes and the Texas Genco Notes
    were part of NRG’s previously announced financing plan in
    connection with the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. As of
    February 2, 2006, NRG had received valid tenders from
    holders in aggregate principal amount of the 8% Second Priority
    Notes, representing approximately 99.96% of the outstanding 8%
    second priority notes, and had received valid tenders from
    holders of the $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of
    the Texas Genco Notes, representing 100% of the outstanding
    Texas Genco Notes. The purchase price for the 8% second priority
    notes of approximately $1.2 billion was paid by NRG on
    February 2, 2006 and included a $0.1 billion
    prepayment penalty, which was recorded in debt refinancing
    expense in NRG’s consolidated statement of operations. The
    purchase price for the Texas Genco Notes of approximately
    $1.2 billion was paid by NRG on February 3, 2006 and
    included a $0.1 billion prepayment penalty, which was
    recorded as part of the acquisition cost for the purchase of
    Texas Genco LLC.

Debt
    Reduction Related to Capital Allocation Program

On December 29, 2006, NRG repaid $400 million of the
    Company’s Term Loan facility, completing the debt reduction
    portion of the Company’s previously announced Capital
    Allocation Program. NRG used cash on hand to fund the repayment.

    Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

Substantially all employees hired prior to December 5, 2003
    were eligible to participate in NRG’s defined benefit
    pension plans. The Company initiated a noncontributory, defined
    benefit pension plan effective January 1,

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2004, with credit for service from December 5, 2003. In
    addition, the Company provides postretirement health and welfare
    benefits for certain groups of employees. Generally, these are
    groups that were acquired prior to 2004 and for whom prior
    benefits are being continued (at least for a certain period of
    time or as required by union contracts). Cost sharing provisions
    vary by acquisition group and terms of any applicable collective
    bargaining agreements. NRG expects to contribute approximately
    $108 million to the Company’s three pension plans in
    2007.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158. This statement
    requires an employer that sponsors one or more single-employer
    defined benefit plans to recognize the funded status of a
    benefit plan in its statement of financial position with an
    offset to other comprehensive income, and recognize as a
    component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains
    or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during
    the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic
    benefit cost. NRG adopted this statement as of the
    Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2006.

As a result of the acquisition of NRG Texas in early 2006, NRG
    assumed responsibility for the assets and liabilities of the
    Texas region’s pension and retiree welfare plans. The
    pension plan is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan
    that provides cash balance benefits based on all years of
    service to employees who were employed prior to January 1,
    2005. In addition, employees who were hired prior to 1999 are
    also eligible for grandfathered benefits under a final average
    pay formula. In most cases, the benefits under the grandfathered
    formula will be frozen by December 31, 2008.

NRG’s Texas region employees are also covered under an
    unfunded postretirement health and welfare plan. Each year,
    employees receive a fixed credit of $750 to their account plus
    interest. Certain grandfathered employees will receive
    additional credits through 2008. At retirement, the employees
    may use their accounts to purchase retiree medical and dental
    benefits from NRG. NRG’s costs are limited to the amounts
    earned in the employee’s account; all other costs are paid
    by the participant. The net periodic pension cost relating to
    the Texas region’s defined benefit plan for the period
    ended December 31, 2006 was $11 million, and
    $2 million for the period ended December 31, 2006 for
    its other postretirement benefit plans. These amounts are
    included in the tables below.

NRG uses December 31 of each respective year as the
    measurement date for the Company’s pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans. The Company sets the discount rate
    assumptions on an annual basis for each of NRG’s retirement
    related benefit plans at their respective measurement date. This
    rate is determined by NRG’s Investment Committee based on
    information provided by the Company’s actuary. The discount
    rate assumptions reflect the current rate at which the
    associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end
    of the year. The discount rate assumptions used to determine
    future pension obligations as of December 31, 2006 were
    based on the Hewitt Yield Curve, or HYC, which was designed by
    Hewitt Associates to provide a means for plan sponsors to value
    the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans. The HYC
    is a hypothetical yield curve represented by a series of
    annualized individual discount rates. Each bond issue underlying
    the HYC is required to have a rating of Aa or better by
    Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. or a rating of AA or better
    by Standard & Poor’s. Prior to using the HYC
    rates, the discount rate assumptions for pension expense in 2006
    and 2005 and the future pension obligations as of
    December 31, 2005 were based on investment yields available
    on AA rated long-term corporate bonds. The discount rates
    determined on the basis described above were 5.92 percent
    as of December 31, 2006 and 5.50 percent as of
    December 31, 2005.

NRG employs a total return investment approach, whereby a mix of
    equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the
    long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
    Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of
    plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial
    condition. The target allocation of plan assets is 60% to 80%
    invested in equity securities, with the remainder invested in
    fixed income securities. The Investment Committee reviews the
    asset mix periodically and as the plan assets increase in future
    years, the Investment Committee may examine other asset classes
    such as real estate or private equity. NRG employs a building
    block approach to determining the long-term rate of return for
    plan assets, with proper consideration given to diversification
    and rebalancing. Historical markets are studied and long-term
    historical relationships between equities and fixed income are
    preserved, consistent with the widely accepted capital market
    principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater
    return over the long run. Current factors such as inflation and
    interest rates

are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are
    determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to
    check for reasonability and appropriateness.

Plan assets are currently invested in a diversified blend of
    equity and fixed-income investments. Furthermore, equity
    investments are diversified across U.S. and

non-U.S. equities,

as well as among growth, value, small and large capitalization
    stocks.

    the 4% Preferred Stock with cash at a redemption price equal to
    100% of the liquidation preference, plus accumulated but unpaid
    dividends, including liquidated damages, if any, to the
    redemption date.

Should NRG be subject to a fundamental change, as defined in the
    Certificate of Designation of the 4% Preferred Stock, each
    holder of shares of the 4% Preferred Stock has the right,
    subject to certain limitations, to require NRG to purchase any
    or all of the Company’s shares of Preferred Stock at a
    purchase price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, plus

    Each holder of the 4% Preferred Stock has one vote for each
    share of the 4% Preferred Stock held by the holder on all
    matters voted upon by the holders of NRG common stock, as well
    as voting rights specifically provided for in NRG’s amended
    and restated certificate of incorporation or as otherwise, from
    time to time, required by law.

On August 11, 2005, NRG issued 250,000 shares of
    3.625% Preferred Stock, which is treated as Redeemable Preferred
    Stock, to Credit Suisse in a private placement. As of
    December 31, 2006, 250,000 shares of the 3.625%
    Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding at a liquidation
    value, net of issuance costs, of $247 million. The 3.625%
    Preferred Stock amount is located after the Liabilities but
    before the Stockholders’ Equity section on the Balance
    Sheet as of December 31, 2005, due to the fact that the
    preferred shares can be redeemed in cash by the shareholder.

The 3.625% Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of
    $1,000 per share. Holders of the 3.625% Preferred Stock are
    entitled to receive, out of legally available funds, cash
    dividends at the rate of 3.625% per annum, or
    $36.25 per share per year, payable in cash quarterly in
    arrears commencing on December 15, 2005. Each share of the
    3.625% Preferred Stock is convertible during the

90-day

period beginning August 11, 2015 at the option of NRG or
    the holder. Holders tendering the 3.625% Preferred Stock for
    conversion shall be entitled to receive, for each share of
    3.625% Preferred Stock converted, $1,000 in cash and a number of
    shares of NRG common stock equal to the product of (a) the
    greater of (i) the difference between the average closing
    share price of NRG common stock on each of the 20 consecutive
    scheduled trading days starting on the date 30 exchange business
    days immediately prior to the conversion date, or the Market
    Price, and $59.085 and (ii) zero, times (b) 25.38715.
    The number of NRG common stock to be delivered under the
    conversion feature is limited to 8,000,000 shares. If upon
    conversion, the Market Price is less than $39.39, then the
    Holder will deliver to NRG cash or a number of shares of NRG
    common stock equal in value to the product of (i) $39.39
    minus the Market Price, times (ii) 25.38715. NRG may elect
    to make a cash payment in lieu of delivering shares of NRG
    common stock in connection with such conversion, and NRG may
    elect to receive cash in lieu of shares of common stock, if any,
    from the Holder in connection with such conversion. If a
    fundamental change occurs, the holders will have the right to
    require NRG to repurchase all or a portion of the 3.625%
    Preferred Stock for a period of time after the fundamental
    change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the liquidation
    preference, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The 3.625%
    Preferred Stock is senior to all classes of common stock, on a
    parity with the Company’s 4% Preferred Stock, and junior to
    all of the Company’s existing and future debt obligations
    and all of NRG subsidiaries’ existing and future
    liabilities and capital stock held by persons other than NRG or
    its subsidiaries.

MIBRAG

— NRG owns a 50% interest in
    MIBRAG.  Located near Leipzig, Germany, MIBRAG owns
    and manages a coal mining operation, three lignite fueled power
    generation facilities and other related businesses.
    Approximately 40% of the power generated by MIBRAG is used to
    support its mining operations, with the remainder sold to a
    German utility company. A portion of the coal from MIBRAG’s
    mining operation is used to fuel the power generation
    facilities, but a majority of the mined coal is sold primarily
    to two major customers, including Schkopau, an affiliate of NRG.
    A significant portion of MIBRAG’s sales are made pursuant
    to long-term coal and energy supply contracts.

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    NRG’s equity earnings from MIBRAG were approximately
    $30 million, $26, million and $21 million,
    respectively.

As discussed in Note 2,

Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

, the Company’s MIBRAG equity
    investment was negatively affected by

EITF 04-6.

As of December 31, 2005, MIBRAG had an asset of
    approximately €157 million, or $185 million,
    representing capitalized stripping costs incurred during
    production. Following adoption of

EITF 04-6

in the first quarter of 2006, NRG’s investment in MIBRAG
    was reduced by 50% of the above mentioned asset, or
    approximately $93 million, with an offsetting charge to
    retained earnings.

Saguaro Power Company

— NRG purchased a
    50% interest in Saguaro in September 2001. Located in Henderson,
    near Las Vegas, Nevada, the Saguaro plant is a cogeneration
    plant with dual-fuel capability, natural gas and oil, and has
    contracted its electricity to Nevada Power through 2022, one
    steam host, referred to as Pioneer, whose contract expires in
    2007, with a negotiated renewal, and a steam off taker, Ocean
    Spray, whose contract runs through 2015.

Saguaro Power Company, LP, the project company, procures fuel in
    the open market. NRG manages its share of any fuel price risk
    through NRG’s commodity price risk strategy. At the end of
    2005, NRG determined that it had a permanent decline in value of
    its 50% interest and recorded a write down of the Company’s
    equity investment in Saguaro by approximately $27 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, NRG’s equity
    earnings from Saguaro was a loss of approximately
    $1 million. NRG had no equity earnings in 2005 but recorded
    $5 million in equity earnings from Saguaro for the year
    ended December 31, 2004.

Gladstone

— NRG owns a 37.5% interest in
    Gladstone, an unincorporated joint venture, or UJV, which
    operates a 1,613 megawatt coal-fueled power generation facility
    in Queensland, Australia. The power generation facility is
    managed by the joint venture participants and the facility is
    operated by NRG. Operating expenses incurred in connection with
    the operation of the facility are funded by each of the
    participants in proportion to their ownership interests. Coal is
    sourced from a mining operation owned and operated by certain
    joint venture partners and other investors under a long-term
    supply agreement. NRG and the joint venture participants receive
    a majority of their respective share of revenues directly from
    customers and are directly responsible and liable for
    project-related debt, all in proportion to the ownership
    interests in the UJV. Power generated by the facility is
    primarily sold to an adjacent aluminum smelter, with excess
    power sold on the national market.

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    NRG’s equity earnings from Gladstone were approximately
    $25 million, $24 million and $18 million,
    respectively.

As discussed in Note 3,

Business Acquisitions and
    Dispositions

, on June 8, 2006, NRG announced the sale
    of the Company’s 37.5% equity interest in the Gladstone
    power station, or Gladstone, and its associated 100% owned NRG
    Gladstone Operating Services to Transfield Services of
    Australia. The sale is pending until NRG satisfies certain
    conditions, particularly the securing of certain consents and
    waivers from the other owners of the project, or agrees to
    complete the sale on alternative terms.

subsidiary of Australia Post. Total proceeds received were
    approximately $23 million and a pre-tax gain of
    approximately $3 million was recognized in the second
    quarter 2006.

James River —

On May 15, 2006, NRG
    completed the sale of Capistrano Cogeneration Company, a
    subsidiary of NRG which owned a 50% interest in James River, to
    Cogentrix. The proceeds from the sale were approximately
    $8 million. As a result of the sale, NRG recorded a pre-tax
    loss of approximately $6 million. In 2004, NRG recorded an
    impairment charge of approximately $7 million to write down
    the value of the Company’s investment in James River to its
    fair value.

Cadillac —

On January 1, 2006, NRG sold
    49.5% of the Company’s 50% interest in a 38MW biomass fuel
    generation facility located in Cadillac, Michigan, along with
    its right to receive Production Tax Credits, or PTCs, through
    2009 to Lakes Renewable LLC. In consideration, NRG received
    approximately $4 million in a note receivable and a
    promissory note equal to the value of the Company’s share
    in future PTCs earned through 2009. The sale was contingent upon
    the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the
    Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and accordingly, all
    consideration was held in escrow. On April 13, 2006, NRG
    sold its remaining 0.5% share in Cadillac along with the
    Company’s interest in the note receivable and promissory
    note to Delta Power for approximately $11 million,
    resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $11 million.

Saguaro

— During the fourth quarter of 2005,
    due to the expiration of the partnership’s long-term gas
    supply contract and higher market prices paid for natural gas,
    NRG determined that a decline in the value of the Company’s
    50% investment in Saguaro was considered to be permanent and
    recorded a write down of the Company’s investment of
    approximately $27 million.

Rocky Road

— In December 2005, NRG entered into
    a purchase and sale agreement with Dynegy, Inc., whereby NRG
    agreed to sell to Dynegy the Company’s 50% ownership
    interest in Rocky Road Power LLC for $45 million in cash.
    As a result of the purchase and sale agreement with Dynegy, NRG
    recorded an impairment charge of approximately $20 million
    to write down the value of the Company’s 50% interest in
    Rocky Road to the investment’s fair value of
    $45 million.

Kendall

— In December 2004, NRG sold its
    interest in Kendall to LS Power Associates, L.P., or LS Power.
    Under the terms of the December 2004 agreement, NRG retained the
    right to acquire a 40% interest in the plant within a

10-year

period for a nominal amount, or the Call Option. Therefore, the
    transaction was treated as a partial sale for accounting
    purposes. On August 8, 2005, NRG executed an agreement with
    LS Power to sell the Call Option for $5 million. A pre-tax
    gain of $4 million was recognized in the third quarter of
    2005.

Enfield

— On April 1, 2005, NRG completed
    the sale of the Company’s 25% interest in Enfield to
    Infrastructure Alliance Limited. Net cash proceeds received from
    the sale were approximately $65 million and a pre-tax gain
    of approximately $12 million was recorded in 2005.

Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership, or CALP

— In June 2004, NRG executed an agreement to sell
    the Company’s 50% interest in CALP. During the third
    quarter of 2004, NRG recorded an impairment charge of
    approximately $4 million to write down the value of the
    Company’s investment in CALP to its fair value. The sale
    closed in November 2004, resulting in net cash proceeds of
    $15 million. Total impairment charges as a result of the
    sale were approximately $5 million.

NEO Corporation

— On September 30, 2004,
    NRG completed the sale of several NEO investments —
    Four Hills LLC, Minnesota Methane II LLC, NEO Montauk Genco
    LLC and NEO Montauk Gasco LLC to Algonquin Power of Canada. The
    sale also included four wholly-owned NEO subsidiaries; see
    Note 4,

Discontinued Operations.

NRG
    received cash proceeds of approximately $6 million for both
    the investments and subsidiaries, resulting in a loss of
    approximately $4 million attributable to the equity
    investment entities sold.

Calpine Cogeneration

— In January 2004, NRG
    executed an agreement to sell the Company’s 20% interest in
    Calpine Cogeneration Corporation to Calpine Power Company. The
    transaction closed in March 2004 and resulted in net cash
    proceeds of $3 million.

Note 16 — Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net
    income less accumulated preferred stock dividends by the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Shares
    issued and treasury shares repurchased during the year are
    weighted for the portion of the year that they were outstanding.
    Diluted earnings per share is computed in a manner consistent
    with that of basic earnings per share while giving effect to all
    potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during
    the period.

Dilutive effect for equity compensation

— The
    outstanding non-qualified stock options, non-vested restricted
    stock units, deferred stock units and performance units are not
    considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings
    per share. However, these instruments are included in the
    denominator for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share
    under the treasury stock method.

Dilutive effect for other equity instruments

— NRG’s outstanding 4% Preferred Stock and
    5.75% Preferred Stock are not considered outstanding for
    purposes of computing basic earnings per share. However, these
    instruments are considered for inclusion in the denominator for
    purposes of computing diluted earnings per share under the
    if-converted method. The Company’s 3.625% Preferred Stock
    includes a conversion feature that, if dilutive, is calculated
    using the if-converted method as well.

The reconciliation of NRG’s basic earnings per common share
    to diluted earnings per share for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is shown in the following

    purchase 137,284, 132,500 and 962,751 shares of common
    stock at an average exercise price of $54.52, $38.80 and
    $23.15 per share, respectively, were not included in the
    computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise
    price of the options was greater than the average market price
    of the common stock for the full year, and therefore the effect
    would have been anti-dilutive.

Performance Units —

For the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, all of the Company’s
    performance units, 205,332 and 44,900, respectively, were not
    included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
    because the average market price of NRG’s common stock was
    less than the target price of the outstanding performance units,
    and therefore the effect would have been anti-dilutive. There
    were no outstanding Performance Units as of December 31,

5.75% Preferred Stock —

For the year ended

    9,357,211 shares of common stock associated with the 5.75%
    Preferred Stock were included in the diluted earnings per share

4% Preferred Stock

— For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, 10,500,000 shares of common stock
    associated with the 4% Preferred Stock were included in the
    diluted earnings per share computation. For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the outstanding 4% Preferred Stock,
    which is convertible into 10,500,000 shares of common stock
    was not included in the diluted earnings per share computation
    because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. However, for
    the year ended December 31, 2004, on a weighted average
    basis, 343,324 shares of common stock associated with the
    4% Preferred Stock were included in the diluted earnings per
    share computation.

3.625% Preferred Stock

— The 3.625% Preferred
    Stocks’ conversion feature allows for additional cash or
    common shares to be issued if the average stock price for a

20-day

period prior to redemption exceeds $59.08 — the market
    price trigger. The Company did not include this conversion
    feature in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as the
    market price trigger was higher than the average market price of
    NRG’s common stock during the year and period ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and therefore the effect would
    have been anti-dilutive.

Note 17 —

Segment
    Reporting

As NRG continues to improve the Company’s position in
    deregulated generation markets and to dispose of non-strategic
    assets, senior management has reorganized the composition of
    NRG’s operating segments for the purpose of making
    operational decisions and assessing performance.

The major changes included the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC
    and the sale of multiple non-strategic assets. This has resulted
    in the creation of a new Texas region wholesale power generation
    segment, and the collapse of the Company’s Other North
    America region.

The new segment structure reflects NRG’s core areas of
    operation which are primarily the geographic regions of the
    Company’s wholesale power generation, thermal and chilled
    water business, and corporate activities. Within NRG’s
    wholesale power generation operations, there are distinct
    components with separate operating results and management
    structures for the following regions: Texas, Northeast, South
    Central, West and International. All prior periods have been
    restated to reflect the current change in the Company’s
    segment structure.

On January 1, 2005, management changed the allocation
    criteria of corporate general and administrative expenses to the
    segments. Prior to 2005, corporate general and administrative
    expenses were allocated based on an analysis of man hours spent
    on work for each segment. As of January 1, 2005, corporate
    general and administrative expenses are allocated based on the
    forecasted revenue to be generated by each segment.

The following table summarizes customers from whom NRG derived
    more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues for
    the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The
    revenues associated with these customers were all recorded
    within the Company’s Northeast region results:

Effective income tax rate

36.9

%

39.5

%

32.3

%

The effective income tax rate for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 differs from the U.S. statutory rate
    of 35% primarily due to a basis difference relating to
    disbursements from the disputed claims reserve, changes in state
    effective income tax rate, and earnings in foreign jurisdictions
    taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, we decreased the
    estimated state effective income tax rate to 7% from the prior
    year state income tax rate of 9%. This decrease was due to the
    acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, which operates in the state of
    Texas where there is no state income tax as of December 31,
    2006. A decrease to the net deferred tax asset balance of
    approximately $24 million, of which $21 million is
    derived from continuing operations and $3 million is from
    discontinued operations, has been recorded for this change. In
    addition, a reduction of $22 million, of which
    $19 million is generated from continuing operations and
    $3 million is from discontinued operations, reflected in
    our domestic valuation allowance, was recorded due to a change
    in our estimated state effective income tax rate during 2006.
    Beginning 2007, our state effective tax rate will increase, as
    the state of Texas has implemented a 1% margin tax for
    transactions beginning on January 1, 2007.

NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Taxes
    payable

During 2006, we recorded a current tax payable of approximately
    $17 million that represents a tax liability due to a
    domestic state tax of approximately $7 million, as well as
    foreign taxes payable of approximately $10 million. In
    addition, NRG has a tax receivable of $15 million, which
    relates to a taxable loss generated by Texas Genco Holdings
    Inc., that will be carried back to a prior year’s return
    for a tax refund.

Deferred
    tax assets, liabilities and valuation allowance

For the year ended December 31, 2006, NRG’s net
    deferred tax asset decreased by $844 million (before
    valuation allowance), resulting in a domestic net deferred tax
    liability of $110. This decrease was primarily due to the
    acquisition of Texas Genco LLC that resulted in a
    $349 million net deferred tax liability and the current
    income from continuing operations before income tax that
    resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets of
    $331 million.

Acquisition of NRG Texas

— NRG established a
    deferred tax asset of $2.868 billion and
    $3.217 billion of deferred tax liabilities in purchase
    accounting as a result of the acquisition of NRG Texas.

NOL carryforwards

— As of December 31,
    2006, the Company had domestic NOL carryforwards available for
    federal and state income tax purposes of $72 million that
    will expire in 2026. NRG also has cumulative foreign NOL
    carryforwards of $270 million, of which $73 million
    will expire in 2015 and of which $197 million does not have
    an expiration date.

Valuation allowance

— Due to an assessment of
    positive and negative evidence, including projected capital
    gains and available tax planning strategies, NRG believes that
    it is more likely than not that a benefit will not be realized
    on $581 million of domestic tax assets. This amount
    reflects deferred tax assets for domestic capital loss
    carryforwards of $506 million expiring through 2011 and
    foreign operating losses of $75 million. A valuation
    allowance for these deferred tax assets remains, resulting in a
    net deferred tax liability of $691 million.

As a result of the reduction in NRG’s net deferred tax
    assets, the Company’s valuation allowance and other
    deferred tax items were reduced. In accordance with

SOP 90-7,

these movements resulted in the reduction of intangibles by
    $241 million, an increase in Additional Paid in Capital of
    $17 million and reduced tax expense by $22 million (of
    which $3 million was reflected in discontinued operations).

APB
    Opinion 23

To the extent that NRG does not provide deferred income taxes
    for unremitted earnings, it is management’s intent to
    permanently reinvest those earnings overseas in accordance with
    APB Opinion No. 23,

Accounting for Income Taxes-Special
    Areas

, or APB 23.

Repatriation
    of foreign funds pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of

Pursuant to the Jobs Act, during 2005, NRG elected to deduct 85%
    of certain eligible dividends received from

non-U.S. subsidiaries

from its taxable income before the end of 2005 as those
    dividends were reinvested in the U.S. for eligible
    purposes. NRG repatriated approximately $298 million of
    accumulated foreign earnings. Only a portion of this amount
    represents the cumulative earnings and profits, which resulted
    in approximately $6 million of tax expense. The remaining
    amounts transferred are considered a return of capital.

Tax
    Holidays

During 2005, the “Amazon Development Agency” granted
    an income tax holiday to our subsidiary ITISA pertaining to the
    local tax liability resulting from ITISA’s operating income
    for Brazilian tax purposes, applicable retroactively to
    January 1, 2005. The tax holiday program reduced the
    effective income tax rate to 15.25% from a statutory income tax
    rate of 34%, resulting in a decrease in tax expense of
    approximately $3 million in 2006. This tax holiday will
    expire on December 31, 2013.



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Note 19 —
    Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), a
    revision to SFAS 123, which required NRG to modify the
    recognition of expense for stock-based compensation in the
    statements of operations. NRG adopted the requirements of
    SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006 using the
    modified prospective method. The provisions of SFAS 123(R)
    did not result in a significant change in NRG’s
    compensation expense because the Company previously recognized
    compensation expense in the statements of operations under
    SFAS 123. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), NRG
    estimated a forfeiture rate for each of the Company’s
    awards based on the number of instruments expected to vest,
    rather than recording the actual forfeitures as they occurred.
    The elimination of equity-based compensation and amounts
    previously recognized in income related to the application of
    the new forfeiture rate to outstanding instruments as of
    January 1, 2006 were immaterial to NRG’s consolidated
    statements of operations.

Long-Term
    Incentive Plan, or LTIP

As of December 31, 2006, a total of 8,000,000 shares
    of NRG common stock were authorized for issuance under the LTIP,
    subject to adjustments in the event of a reorganization,
    recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock
    dividend, and a combination of shares, merger or similar change
    in NRG’s structure or outstanding shares of common stock.
    It is NRG’s policy to issue treasury shares upon exercise
    of a LTIP award. If there are no treasury shares available,
    shares of common stock will be issued. There were
    4,301,489 shares of common stock remaining available for
    grants under NRG’s LTIP as of December 31, 2006.

Non-Qualified
    Stock Options, or NQSO’s

NQSO’s granted under the LTIP typically have a three-year
    graded vesting schedule beginning on the grant date and become
    exercisable at the end of the requisite service period. As
    provided for by SFAS 123(R), for share options with graded
    vesting issued after January 1, 2006, NRG recognizes
    compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period for the entire award. The maximum contractual
    term is ten years for approximately 600,000 of NRG’s
    outstanding NQSO’s, and six years for the remaining
    1.1 million NQSO’s. The aggregate intrinsic value for
    stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2006 was
    approximately $35.5 million. The aggregate intrinsic value
    for stock options exercisable as of December 31, 2006 was
    approximately $26.4 million. The weighted average remaining
    contractual term for stock options outstanding as of
    December 31, 2006 was approximately six years. The weighted
    average remaining contractual term for stock options exercisable
    as of December 31, 2006 was approximately seven years.
    During the year ended December 31, 2006, cash received from
    the exercise of NQSO’s and the intrinsic value of exercised
    NQSO’s was $1.1 million and $1.3 million,
    respectively. There were no NQSO’s exercised as of December
    2005 and 2004.

Typically, NRG uses an expected term of four years for the
    Company’s NQSO’s based on the simple average of the
    contractual term and vesting term. Volatility was calculated
    based on a blended average of NRG and NRG’s industry
    peers’ historical two-year stock price volatility data. A
    forfeiture rate of 8% was calculated for NQSO’s based on an
    analysis of NRG’s historical forfeitures, employment
    turnover, and expected future behavior.

Restricted
    Stock Units, or RSU’s

Typically, RSU’s granted under the Company’s LTIP
    fully vest three years from the date of issuance. Compensation
    expense is based on the fair value of the RSU’s which is
    based on the closing price of NRG common stock on the date of
    grant, multiplied by the number of RSU’s granted. Such
    compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is amortized over the
    requisite service period. In determining NRG’s forfeiture
    rate, two separate forfeiture rates that best represent the
    employment termination behavior related to issued RSU’s
    were used: 8% for senior management; and 25% for all other
    employees. The forfeiture rates were based on an analysis of
    NRG’s historical forfeitures, employment turnover, and
    expected future behavior. The aggregate intrinsic values for non-

The fair value of PU’s is estimated on the date of grant
    using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Volatility is calculated
    based on a blended average of NRG and NRG’s industry
    peers’ two-year historical stock price volatility data. The
    aggregate intrinsic value for PU’s outstanding as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately
    $11.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively.

A forfeiture rate of 8% was calculated for PU’s based on an
    analysis of NRG’s historical forfeitures, employment
    turnover, and expected future behavior. Significant assumptions
    used in the fair value model for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005 with respect to the
    Company’s PU’s are summarized below. There were no

    Commitments and Contingencies

Operating
    Lease Commitments

With the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, NRG’s operating
    lease commitments increased significantly. This increase was
    primarily due to the anticipated commencement of leases for
    2,695 railcars over the next two years. As of December 31,
    2006, approximately 1,813 of the railcars had been delivered and
    were under lease for future commitments of approximately
    $188 million.

NRG leases certain Company facilities and equipment under
    operating leases, some of which include escalation clauses,
    expiring on various dates through 2023. Certain operating lease
    agreements over their lease term include provisions such as
    scheduled rent increases, leasehold incentives, and rent
    concessions. The Company recognizes the effects of these
    scheduled rent increases, leasehold incentives, and rent
    concessions on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless
    another systematic and rational allocation basis is more
    representative of the time pattern in which the leased property
    is physically employed. Rental expense under operating leases
    was approximately $27 million, $9 million and
    $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively.

In September 2005, Texas Genco LLC entered into a contract to
    purchase 2,695 aluminum railcars from FreightCar America, Inc.,
    formerly Johnstown America Corporation, to be used for the
    transportation of low sulfur coal from Wyoming to its coal
    burning generating plants. On February 2, 2006, NRG closed
    on the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. On March 10, 2006,
    NRG entered into a twenty-year operating lease agreement with
    Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, or MetLife, for the lease
    of 945 railcars. Delivery of the railcars from FreightCar
    America under the MetLife lease agreement commenced in March
    2006 and was completed by October 2006. NRG has assigned certain
    of its rights and obligations for the 945 railcars under the
    purchase agreement with FreightCar America to MetLife.
    Accordingly, the railcars that NRG leases from MetLife under the
    arrangement described above, were purchased by MetLife from
    FreightCar America in lieu of the Company’s purchase of
    those railcars. On August 29, 2006, NRG entered into a
    similar seventeen-year operating lease agreement with General
    Electric Capital Corporation, or GE Capital, for the lease of
    the remaining 1,750 railcars. Delivery of the railcars from
    FreightCar America under the GE Capital arrangement commenced in
    October 2006 and is expected to be completed in early 2007. NRG
    has likewise assigned certain of its rights and obligations for
    the 1,750 railcars under the purchase agreement with FreightCar
    America to GE Capital. Accordingly, the railcars that NRG leases
    from MetLife under the arrangement described above were likewise
    purchased by GE Capital from FreightCar America in lieu of the
    Company’s purchase of those railcars.

International
    Commitments

Two of the Company’s wholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries
    are severally responsible for the prorate payments of principal,
    interest and related costs incurred in connection with the
    financing of NRG’s equity investment in the unincorporated
    joint venture Gladstone Power Station. At December 31,
    2006, the Company was obligated for the loan of AUD
    66 million (approximately US $52 million) in
    principal. This loan is scheduled to be fully repaid on
    March 31, 2009.

NRG
    FinCo Resolution

In May 2001, NRG’s wholly-owned subsidiary, NRG Financial
    Company I LLC, or NRG FinCo, entered into a $2 billion
    revolving credit facility. The facility was established to
    finance the acquisition, development and construction of certain
    power generating plants located in the United States, as well as
    to finance the acquisition of turbines for such facilities. The
    facility provided for borrowings of base rate loans and
    Eurocurrency loans and was secured by mortgages and security
    agreements in respect of the assets of the projects financed
    under the facility, pledges of the equity interests in the
    subsidiaries or affiliates of the borrower that own such
    projects, and by guarantees from each subsidiary or affiliate.
    The NRG FinCo secured revolver was initially scheduled to mature
    on May 8, 2006; however, due to defaults hereunder by NRG
    FinCo and applicable guarantors, the lenders accelerated all
    outstanding obligations on November 6, 2002. As of the
    Company’s emergence from bankruptcy, $1.1 billion was
    outstanding under the facility, and there was approximately
    $58 million of accrued but unpaid interest and commitment
    fees. Of this total amount, $842 million was allowed in
    unsecured claims under the NRG plan of reorganization, and was
    settled at the time of the Company’s emergence from
    bankruptcy. The remaining balance is to be satisfied when the
    NRG FinCo lenders exercise their perfected security interests in
    the Nelson, Audrain and Pike projects. During 2004, NRG sold the
    assets of LSP Nelson Energy LLC for approximately
    $20 million and certain assets of the Company’s Pike
    project for $17 million. The proceeds from these sales were
    paid to the lenders of NRG FinCo. On March 29, 2006,
    NRG’s subsidiary NRG Audrain Generating LLC sold the
    Audrain project to AmerenUE, a subsidiary of Ameren Corporation,
    for $115 million, subject to customary purchase price
    adjustments, plus AmerenUE’s assumption of
    $240 million of non-recourse capital lease obligations and
    assignment of a $240 million note receivable. Of the
    $115 million in cash proceeds, approximately
    $20 million was paid to NRG and the balance was paid to the
    NRG FinCo lenders. During 2006, NRG sold the remaining Pike
    equipment and the proceeds from these sales along with the
    remaining Pike cash paid to the lenders of NRG FinCo. As a
    result of the sale of the Nelson, Audrain and Pike assets and
    the payment of the proceeds from these sales to the lenders of
    NRG FinCo, the NRG FinCo lenders have released the sold Audrain,
    Pike and Nelson projects from their respective obligations under
    the NRG FinCo secured revolver. On December 29, 2006, NRG
    dissolved LSP-Pike Energy, LLC and, accordingly,
    $13 million of outstanding liabilities of LSP-Pike Energy,
    LLC are no longer reflected on the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet, and were recorded to other income in the
    Company’s consolidated statement of operations.

Contingencies

Set forth below is a description of the Company’s material
    legal proceedings. Pursuant to the requirements of SFAS 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

and related guidance, NRG
    records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when
    information available indicates that a loss is probable and the
    amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Because litigation
    is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or
    developments could occur, there can be no certainty that NRG may
    not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded
    reserves. A future adverse ruling or unfavorable development
    could result in future charges, which could have a materially
    adverse effect on NRG’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows.

With respect to a number of the items listed below, management
    has determined that a loss is not probable or the amount of the
    loss is not reasonably estimable, or both. In some cases,
    management is not able to predict with any degree of substantial
    certainty the range of possible loss that could be incurred.
    Notwithstanding these facts,



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

management has assessed each of these matters based on current
    information and made a judgment concerning its potential
    outcome, considering the nature of the claim, the amount and
    nature of damages sought, and the probability of success.
    Management’s judgment may, as a result of facts arising
    prior to resolution of these matters, or other factors, prove
    inaccurate and investors should be aware that such judgment is
    made subject to the uncertainty of litigation.

In addition to the legal proceedings noted below, NRG and its
    subsidiaries are party to other litigation or legal proceedings
    arising in the ordinary course of business. In management’s
    opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will
    not materially adversely effect NRG’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

NRG believes that it has valid defenses to the legal proceedings
    and investigations described below and intends to defend them
    vigorously. However, litigation is inherently subject to many
    uncertainties. There can be no assurance that additional
    litigation will not be filed against the Company or its
    subsidiaries in the future, asserting similar or different legal
    theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and
    relief. Unless specified below, the Company is unable to predict
    the outcome of these legal proceedings and investigations may
    have or reasonably estimate the scope or amount of any
    associated costs and potential liabilities. An unfavorable
    outcome in one or more of these proceedings could have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows. NRG also has
    indemnity rights for some of these proceedings to reimburse NRG
    for certain legal expenses and to offset certain amounts deemed
    to be owed in the event of an unfavorable litigation outcome.

California
    Electricity and Related Litigation

NRG, WCP, WCP’s four operating subsidiaries, Dynegy, Inc.,
    and numerous other unrelated parties are the subject of numerous
    lawsuits that arose based on events that occurred in the
    California power market in 2000 and 2001. The complaints
    primarily allege that the defendants engaged in unfair business
    practices, price fixing, antitrust violations, and other market
    gaming activities. Certain of these lawsuits originally
    commenced in 2000 and 2001, which seek unspecified treble
    damages and injunctive relief, were consolidated and made a part
    of a Multi-District Litigation proceeding before the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
    California. The consolidated cases moved between state and
    federal court several times. On May 5, 2005, the case was
    remanded to California state court, and under a scheduling
    order, defendants filed their objections to the pleadings. On
    July 22, 2005, based upon the filed rate doctrine and
    federal preemption, the court dismissed NRG Energy, Inc. without
    prejudice, leaving only subsidiaries of WCP remaining in the
    case. On October 3, 2005, the court sustained
    defendants’ demurrer, dismissing the case against all
    remaining defendants. On December 2, 2005, the plaintiffs
    filed their notice of appeal from the dismissal with the
    California State Court of Appeals — Fourth District
    and on February 26, 2007, the court affirmed the lower
    court’s judgment of dismissal. Other cases, including
    putative class actions, have been filed in state and federal
    court on behalf of business and residential electricity
    consumers that name WCP

and/or

subsidiaries of WCP, in addition to numerous other defendants.
    These complaints allege the defendants attempted to manipulate
    gas indexes by reporting false and fraudulent trades, and
    violated California’s antitrust law and unfair business
    practices law. The complaints seek restitution and disgorgement,
    civil fines, compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys’
    fees, and declaratory and injunctive relief. Motion practice is
    proceeding in these cases and dispositive motions have been
    filed in several of these proceedings.

On September 26, 2006, the plaintiffs in

Jerry Egger,
    et all versus Dynegy Inc., et al,

Case
    No. 809822, Superior Court of California (filed May 1,
    2003) filed a voluntary notice of dismissal. Neither WCP
    and its subsidiaries nor NRG paid any defense costs, as Dynegy
    owed and provided a complete defense and indemnification.

In September 2006, Dynegy executed a settlement agreement to
    resolve the class action claims in the natural gas anti-trust
    cases consolidated and pending in state court in San Diego,
    California. WCP and some of its subsidiaries are named
    defendants and Dynegy’s settlement would include full
    releases for these entities. The

    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

settlement resolves claims by core and non-core California
    consumers of natural gas for damages arising from or relating to
    allegations of misreporting of natural gas transactions or wash
    trading. Preliminarily approved by the court, the settlement
    excludes similar cases filed by individual plaintiffs, which
    Dynegy continues to defend. Neither WCP and its subsidiaries nor
    NRG paid any defense costs or settlement funds, as Dynegy owed
    and provided a complete defense and indemnification.

In August 2006, Dynegy entered into an agreement to settle class
    action claims by California natural gas resellers and
    cogenerators. These claims are pending in Nevada federal
    district court in

“In Re Western States Wholesale
    Natural Gas Antitrust Litigation”

. WCP and its
    subsidiaries are named defendants and Dynegy’s settlement
    would include full releases for these entities. The settlement
    is expected to be submitted to the court for approval in 2007.
    Neither WCP, it subsidiaries, nor NRG paid any defense costs or
    settlement funds, as Dynegy owed and provided a complete defense
    and indemnification.

On May 17, 2006, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
    Southern District of New York granted NRG’s motion to
    disallow all pre-bankruptcy claims filed against NRG related to
    the California energy crisis in 2000 and 2001.

In cases relating to natural gas, Dynegy is defending WCP

and/or

its
    subsidiaries pursuant to an indemnification agreement and will
    be the responsible party for any loss. In cases relating to
    electricity, Dynegy’s counsel is representing it and WCP

and/or

its
    subsidiaries, with each party responsible for half of the costs
    and each party responsible for half of any loss.

California
    Department of Water Resources

On December 19, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
    the Ninth Circuit reversed FERC’s prior determinations
    regarding the enforceability of certain wholesale power
    contracts and remanded the case to FERC for further proceedings
    consistent with the decision. One of these contracts was the
    wholesale power contract between the California Department of
    Water Resources, or CDWR, and subsidiaries of WCP. This case
    originated with a February 2002 complaint filed at FERC by the
    State of California alleging that many parties, including WCP
    subsidiaries, overcharged the State. For WCP, the alleged
    overcharges totaled approximately $940 million for 2001 and
    2002. The complaint demanded that FERC abrogate the CDWR
    contract and sought refunds associated with revenues collected
    under the contract. In 2003, FERC rejected this complaint,
    denied rehearing, and the case was appealed to the Ninth Circuit
    where oral argument was held on December 8, 2004. The Court
    decided that in FERC’s review of the contracts at issue,
    FERC could not rely on the Mobile-Sierra standard presumption of
    just and reasonable rates, where such contracts were not
    reviewed by FERC with full knowledge of the then existing market
    conditions. Because an extension of time will be filed shortly,
    WCP and the other defendants will have until April 18,
    2007, to seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court, or they can
    instead wait for the case to be remanded back to FERC. If review
    before the U.S. Supreme Court is sought, the Court will
    decide in 2007 whether it will accept the appeal. At this time,
    while NRG cannot predict with certainty whether WCP will be
    required to make refunds for rates collected under the CDWR
    contract or estimate the range of any such possible refunds, a
    reconsideration of the CDWR contract by FERC with a resulting
    order mandating significant refunds could have a material
    adverse impact on NRG’s financial position, statement of
    operations, and statement of cash flows. As part of the 2006
    acquisition of Dynegy’s 50% ownership interest in WCP, WCP
    and NRG assumed responsibility for any risk of loss arising from
    this case, unless any such loss was deemed to have resulted from
    certain acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
    part of Dynegy, in which case any such loss would be shared
    equally between WCP and Dynegy.

Connecticut
    Congestion Charges

On November 28, 2001, CL&P sought recovery in the
    U.S. District Court for Connecticut for amounts it claimed
    were owed for congestion charges under the October 29, 1999
    Standard Offer Services Contract. CL&P withheld
    approximately $30 million from amounts owed to PMI under
    contract and PMI counterclaimed. CL&P’s motion for
    summary judgment, which PMI opposed, remains pending. NRG cannot
    estimate at this time the overall exposure for congestion
    charges for the term of the contract prior to the implementation
    of standard market design,

which occurred on March 1, 2003; however, the full amount

Station
    Service Disputes

On October 2, 2000, NiMo commenced an action against NRG in
    New York state court seeking damages related to NRG’s
    alleged failure to pay retail tariff amounts for utility
    services at the Dunkirk Plant between June 1999 and September
    2000. The parties agreed to consolidate this action with two
    other actions against the Huntley and Oswego Plants. On
    October 8, 2002, by stipulation and order, this action was
    stayed pending submission to FERC of the disputes in the action.
    At FERC, NiMo asserted the same claims and legal theories, and
    on November 19, 2004, FERC denied NiMo’s petition and
    ruled that the NRG facilities could net their service
    obligations over each 30 calendar day period from the day NRG
    acquired the facilities. In addition, FERC ruled that neither
    NiMo nor the New York Public Service Commission could impose a
    retail delivery charge on the NRG facilities because they are
    interconnected to transmission and not to distribution. On
    April 22, 2005, FERC denied NiMo’s motion for
    rehearing. NiMo appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
    the D.C. Circuit which, on June 23, 2006, denied the appeal
    finding that NYISO’s station service program that permits
    generators to self supply their station power needs by netting
    consumption against production in a month is lawful. On
    October 23, 2006, the D.C. Circuit denied NiMo’s
    petition for rehearing and on January 22, 2007, NiMo sought
    review before the U.S. Supreme Court. NRG believes it is
    adequately reserved.

On December 14, 1999, NRG acquired certain generating
    facilities from CL&P. A dispute arose over station service
    power and delivery services provided to the facilities. On
    December 20, 2002, as a result of a petition filed at FERC
    by Northeast Utilities Services Company on behalf of itself and
    CL&P, FERC issued an order finding that, at times when NRG
    is not able to self-supply its station power needs, there is a
    sale of station power from a third-party and retail charges
    apply. In August 2003, the parties agreed to submit the dispute
    to binding arbitration. In July and August 2006, the parties
    submitted their respective statements of the case to the three
    member arbitration panel. A discovery and briefing schedule was
    issued and a hearing is set for September 2007. NRG believes it
    is adequately reserved.

ITISA

NRG’s Brazilian project company, ITISA, the owner of a
    155 MW hydro project in Brazil, is in arbitration with the
    former Engineering, Procurement and Construction, or EPC,
    contractor for the project, Inepar Industria e Construcoes, or
    Inepar. The dispute was commenced in arbitration by ITISA in
    September 2002 and pertains to certain matters arising under the
    EPC contract between the parties. ITISA sought Real
    140 million and asserted that Inepar breached the contract.
    Inepar sought Real 39 million and alleged that ITISA
    breached the contract. On September 2, 2005, the
    arbitration panel ruled in favor of ITISA, awarding it Real
    139 million and Inepar Real 4.7 million. Due to
    interest accrued from the commencement of the arbitration to the
    award date, ITISA’s award was increased to approximately
    Real 227 million (approximately $106 million as of
    December 31, 2006). Itiquira has commenced the lengthy
    process in Brazil to execute on the arbitral award. NRG is
    unable to predict the outcome of this execution process. On
    December 21, 2005, Inepar’s request for clarifications
    was denied. Due to the uncertainty of the ongoing collection
    process, NRG is accounting for receipt of any amounts as a gain
    contingency.

CFTC
    Trading Litigation

On July 1, 2004, the Commodities Futures Trading
    Commission, or CFTC, filed a civil complaint against NRG in
    Minnesota federal district court, alleging false reporting of
    natural gas trades from August 2001 to May 2002, and seeking a
    permanent injunction against future violations of the Commodity
    Exchange Act. On March 15, 2005, NRG’s motion to
    dismiss was granted by the federal district court. On appeal,
    the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, on
    August 2, 2006, reversed the district court’s
    dismissal of the CFTC’s action. The parties have



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

agreed to a settlement in which NRG agreed to give the CFTC a
    $2 million allowed class 5 claim in NRG’s
    bankruptcy proceeding. The settlement agreement was approved by
    the Court on February 13, 2007.

Disputed
    Claims Reserve

As part of NRG’s plan of reorganization, NRG funded a
    disputed claims reserve for the satisfaction of certain general
    unsecured claims that were disputed claims as of the effective
    date of the plan. Under the terms of the plan, as such claims
    are resolved, the claimants are paid from the reserve on the
    same basis as if they had been paid out in the bankruptcy. To
    the extent the aggregate amount required to be paid on the
    disputed claims exceeds the amount remaining in the funded
    claims reserve, NRG will be obligated to provide additional cash
    and common stock to satisfy the claims. Any excess funds in the
    disputed claims reserve will be reallocated to the creditor pool
    for the pro rata benefit of all allowed claims. The contributed
    common stock and cash in the reserves is held by an escrow agent
    to complete the distribution and settlement process. Since NRG
    has surrendered control over the common stock and cash provided
    to the disputed claims reserve, NRG recognized the issuance of
    the common stock as of December 6, 2003 and removed the
    cash amounts from the balance sheet. Similarly, NRG removed the
    obligations relevant to the claims from the balance sheet when
    the common stock was issued and cash contributed.

On April 3, 2006, the Company made a supplemental
    distribution to creditors under the Company’s
    Chapter 11 plan, totaling $25 million in cash and
    2,541,000 shares of common stock. As of January 24,
    2007, the reserve held approximately $9.9 million in cash
    and approximately 691,700 shares of common stock. NRG
    believes the cash and stock together represent sufficient funds
    to satisfy all remaining disputed claims.

Bourbonnais
    Agreements

On January 31, 2006, NRG finalized a stipulation and
    settlement agreement with an equipment manufacturer related to
    turbine purchase agreements entered into in 1999 and 2001. The
    stipulation fixes the amount and provides for the allowance of
    the equipment manufacturer’s proof of claim previously
    filed during NRG’s bankruptcy proceeding. The settlement
    agreement provides for a $6 million payment by NRG to the
    equipment manufacturer, and the release of all claims NRG
    Bourbonnais and NRG have for the return of payments made under
    the 1999 and 2001 turbine purchase agreements. Under the
    settlement agreement, NRG received certain equipment valued at
    $55 million, as well as a one-year option to purchase
    new-build equipment for a fixed price. During the first quarter
    2006, NRG recorded approximately $67 million of other
    income associated with the settlement due to a reversal of
    accounts payable totaling $35 million, resulting from the
    discharge of the previously recorded liability, and an
    adjustment to write up the value of the equipment received to
    its fair value, resulting in income of approximately
    $32 million.

Note 22 — Regulatory
    Matters

With the exception of NRG’s thermal and chilled water
    business and decommissioning responsibilities related to STP,
    NRG’s operations are not regulated operations subject to
    SFAS 71 and NRG does not record assets and liabilities that
    result from the regulated ratemaking processes. NRG does
    operate, however, in a highly regulated industry and the Company
    is subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies.
    As such, NRG is affected by regulatory developments at both the
    federal and state level and in the regions in which NRG operates.

Texas
    Region

As of December 31, 2006, the decommissioning trusts for the
    decontamination and decommissioning of STP had a market value of
    $352 million. The unamortized portion of the retirement
    obligation asset was $262 million. The decommission
    liability was $324 million, and the reserve to fund the
    decommissioning from the trust assets and payments to or from
    ratepayers was $289 million. In accordance with
    SFAS 71, and due to the fact that NRG does not have any
    economic exposure for these decommissioning responsibilities,
    changes in the related assets and



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

liabilities are not reflected in the statement of operations. As
    such, the total carrying value of all assets and liabilities
    associated with the decommissioning and the trusts will always
    be equal.

In addition to the nuclear decommissioning trusts, NRG has
    recorded asset retirement obligations and liabilities in
    accordance with SFAS 143. The assets and liabilities were
    recorded on the respective acquisition dates based on the
    estimated future costs of decontamination and decommissioning of
    NRG’s 44% interest in STP. The asset is being amortized
    over the remaining licensing period for STP and is reflected as
    a component of property, plant, and equipment. The asset
    retirement obligation accretion is being recognized with the
    associated liability.

New England

—

On December 28,
    2006, the Attorneys General of the State of Connecticut and
    Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed an appeal of the FERC orders
    accepting the settlement of the New England capacity market
    design with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
    The settlement, filed March 7, 2006, by a broad group of
    New England market participants, provides for interim capacity
    transition payments for all generators in New England for the
    period starting December 1, 2006 through May 31, 2010,
    and the establishment of a FCM commencing May 31, 2010. On
    June 16, 2006, FERC issued an order accepting the
    settlement, which was reaffirmed on rehearing by order dated
    October 31, 2006. Interim capacity transition payments
    provided for under the FCM settlement commenced December 1,
    2006, as scheduled. A successful appeal by the Attorneys General
    could disturb the settlement and create a refund obligation of
    interim capacity transition payments.

On January 18, 2007, FERC announced that it had reached a
    resolution with NRG regarding the informal investigation arising
    from NRG’s self-reporting to FERC and ISO-NE that on
    January 25, 2006, Devon Unit 12 was unable to respond to a
    dispatch instruction, and that inaccurate information was
    provided to ISO-NE. On December 22, 2006, NRG entered into
    a Stipulation and Consent Agreement with FERC pursuant to which
    NRG agreed to a pay a civil penalty of $0.5 million, as
    well as to conduct additional audits during 2007 of its
    remaining Connecticut RMR units.

New York

— A dispute is ongoing with respect to
    high prices for spinning reserves, or SR, and non-spinning
    reserves, or NSR, in the NYISO-administered markets during the
    period from January 29, 2000 to March 27, 2000.
    Certain entities have argued that the NYISO acted unreasonably
    in declining to invoke Temporary Extraordinary Operating
    Procedures, or TEP, to recalculate prices and that the markets
    should be resettled for various reasons. In a series of orders,
    FERC declined to grant the requested relief. On appeal, the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the
    case back to FERC to further explain its decision not to utilize
    TEP to remedy certain of these market issues. On March 4,
    2005, FERC issued an order reaffirming that (i) the NYISO
    acted reasonably in not invoking TEP, (ii) NYISO did not
    violate its tariff, and (iii) refunds should not be
    granted; this order was reaffirmed on rehearing on
    November 17, 2005. These orders have subsequently been
    appealed to the D.C. Circuit. Resettlement of the market, while
    viewed as unlikely, could have a material financial impact on
    the Company’s results of operations.

On March 15, 2006, NRG received the results from NYISO
    Market Monitoring Unit’s review of NRG’s Astoria
    plant’s 2004 Generating Availability Data System reporting.
    This audit may result in the resettlement of NRG’s capacity
    revenues from the Astoria facility due to a redetermination of
    the amount of available capacity. NRG is currently in settlement
    discussions with the NYISO, and the Company believes that it is
    adequately reserved.

West
    Region

On December 1, 2006, NRG filed to extend the existing RMR
    agreements for NRG’s Cabrillo Power I, LLC (Encina)
    and Cabrillo Power II, LLC (San Diego Jets) for 2007,
    and is seeking to continue the existing rate effective
    January 1, 2007. On January 24, 2007, FERC accepted
    the Cabrillo Power I filing. On January 30, 2007, FERC

accepted the Cabrillo II filing, subject to refund, in
    response to protests filed by the CPUC and CAISO, and
    established settlement procedures.

Note 23 —
    Environmental Matters

The construction and operation of power projects are subject to
    stringent environmental and safety protection and land use laws
    and regulation in the U.S. If such laws and regulations
    become more stringent, or new laws, interpretations or
    compliance policies apply and NRG’s facilities are not
    exempt from coverage, the Company could be required to make
    extensive modifications to further reduce potential
    environmental impacts. In general, the effect of future laws or
    regulations is expected to require the addition of pollution
    control equipment or the imposition of restrictions on the
    Company’s operations.

Environmental
    Capital Expenditures

Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated
    that approximately $1.28 billion of capital expenditures
    will be incurred during the period 2007 through 2012 in order to
    keep NRG’s facilities in compliance with environmental
    laws, primarily related to installation of particulate,
    SO


,
    NOx, and mercury controls to comply with Clean Air Interstate
    Rule, or CAIR, and the Clean Air Mercury Rule, or CAMR, as well
    as installation of Best Technology Available under the
    Phase II 316(b) Rule. NRG updates its estimates for
    environmental capital expenditures annually. These plans,
    including installed equipment and timing as well as cost can be
    expected to change over time, in some cases materially. These
    plans are based on current regulatory requirements and best
    engineering practices. Changes to regulations or market
    conditions could result in changes to installed equipment timing
    or associated costs.

Other
    Environmental Matters

Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws and
    regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of any
    facility may be required to investigate and remediate releases
    or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or
    petroleum products located at the facility, and may be held
    liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property
    damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs
    incurred by the party in connection with any releases or
    threatened releases. These laws impose strict (without fault)
    and joint and several liability. The cost of investigation,
    remediation, or removal of any hazardous or toxic substances or
    petroleum products could be substantial.

Texas
    Region

The lignite used to fuel the Texas region’s Limestone
    facility is obtained from a surface mine adjacent to the
    facility under an amended long-term contract with Texas
    Westmoreland Coal Co., or TWCC, entered into in August 1999.
    TWCC is responsible for performing ongoing reclamation
    activities at the mine until all lignite reserves have been
    produced. When production is completed at the mine, NRG will be
    responsible for final mine reclamation obligations. The Railroad
    Commission of Texas has imposed a bond obligation of
    approximately $70 million on TWCC for the reclamation of
    this lignite mine. Final reclamation activity is expected to
    commence in 2015. Pursuant to the contract with TWCC, an
    affiliate of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. has guaranteed
    $50 million of this obligation until 2010. The remaining
    sum of approximately $20 million has been bonded by the
    mine operator, TWCC. Under the terms of the agreement, NRG is
    required to post a corporate guarantee in the amount of
    $50 million of TWCC’s reclamation bond when
    CenterPoint’s obligation lapses. As of December 31,
    2006, NRG has accrued approximately $20 million related to
    the mine reclamation obligation.

Northeast
    Region

In January 2006, NRG Indian River Operations, Inc. received a
    letter of informal notification from the Delaware Department of
    Natural Resources and Environmental Control, or DNREC, stating
    that it may be a

potentially responsible party with respect to a historic captive
    landfill. NRG is working with DNREC through the Voluntary

Clean-up

Program to investigate the site. The Company is unable to
    predict the exact financial impact at this time, but NRG
    believes the cost to remediate will not be material to the
    Company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

In November 2006, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources
    and Environmental Control, or DNREC, promulgated
    Regulation No. 1146, or Reg 1146, Electric Generating
    Unit Multi-Pollutant Regulation and Section 111(d) of the
    State Plan for the Control of Mercury Emissions from Coal-Fired
    Electric Steam Generating Units. These regulations govern the
    control of
    SO


,
    NOx, and mercury emissions from electric generating units.
    NRG’s current plan to install controls at the
    Company’s Indian River facility, while on an accelerated
    basis, is unable to meet certain deadlines for
    SO


and NOx controls in Phase 1, taking into account the time
    required, as a practical matter, to design, install, and
    commission the necessary equipment. NRG and the owners of all
    other subject facilities in the state filed a challenge to Reg
    1146 with the Environmental Appeals Board on December 6,
    2006. In addition, NRG also filed a protective appeal with the
    Delaware Superior Court on December 29, 2006. NRG is unable
    to predict the outcome of the proceedings at this time, but
    failure to obtain relief may result in a material impact on the
    Company’s results of operations.

South
    Central Region

On January 27, 2004, NRG’s Louisiana Generating, LLC
    and the Company’s Big Cajun II plant received a
    request under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act, or CAA,
    from USEPA seeking information primarily related to physical
    changes made at the Big Cajun II plant,and subsequently
    received a notice of violation, or NOV, on February 15,
    2005, alleging that NRG’s predecessors had undertaken
    projects that triggered requirements under the PSD program,
    including the installation of emission controls. NRG submitted
    multiple responses commencing February 27, 2004 and ending
    on October 20, 2004. On May 9, 2006, these entities
    received from the Department of Justice, or DOJ, a notice of
    deficiency related to their responses, to which NRG responded on
    May 22, 2006. A document review was conducted at NRG’s
    Louisiana Generating, LLC offices by the DOJ during the week of
    August 14, 2006. On December 8, 2006, the USEPA issued
    a supplemental NOV updating the original February 15, 2005
    NOV.  Discussions with the USEPA are ongoing. NRG
    cannot predict with certainty the outcome of this matter.

    Guarantees

NRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that
    include indemnification and guarantee provisions as a routine
    part of the Company’s business activities. Examples of
    these contracts include asset purchase and sale agreements,
    commodity sale and purchase agreements, joint venture
    agreements, operations and maintenance



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

agreements, service agreements, settlement agreements, and other
    types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third
    parties. These contracts generally indemnify the counter-party
    for tax, environmental liability, litigation, and other matters,
    as well as breaches of representations, warranties, and
    covenants set forth in the agreements. In many cases, the
    Company’s maximum potential liability cannot be estimated,
    since some of the underlying agreements contain no limits on
    potential liability. In accordance with FIN 45, NRG has
    estimated that the current fair value for issuing these
    guarantees was approximately $13 million as of
    December 31, 2006, and the liability in this amount is
    included in the Company’s non-current liabilities.

Letters of credit and surety bonds

— As of
    December 31, 2006, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries
    were contingently obligated for a total of approximately
    $1.1 billion under letters of credit. Most of these letters
    of credit are issued in support of the Company’s
    obligations to perform under commodity agreements, financing or
    other arrangements. A majority of these letters of credit expire
    within one year of issuance, and it is typical for the Company
    to renew them on similar terms.

Asset sale guarantees

—

NRG is
    typically requested to provide certain assurances to the
    counter-parties of the Company’s asset sale agreements.
    Such assurances may take the form of a guarantee issued by the
    Company on behalf of a directly or indirectly held
    majority-owned subsidiary which include certain indemnifications
    to a third party, usually the buyer, as described below. Due to
    the inter-company nature of such arrangements, NRG is
    essentially guaranteeing its own performance, and the nature of
    the guarantee being provided. It is not the Company’s
    policy to recognize the value of such an obligation in its
    consolidated financial statements. Most of these guarantees
    provide an explicit cap on the Company’s maximum liability,
    as well as an expiration period, exclusive of breach of
    representations and warranties.

On August 30, 2006, with the completion of the sale of
    Flinders, NRG guaranteed the payment and performance of the
    Flinders subsidiaries’ obligations under the sale and
    purchase agreement. Maximum liability of NRG is limited to the
    sale price of AU$317 million (approximately
    $242 million). In addition, with the completion of the
    sale, existing guarantees and indemnities of NRG related to
    Flinders were released.

On March 31, 2006, NRG purchased the remaining 50% interest
    in WCP from Dynegy. In conjunction with the purchase, NRG agreed
    to indemnify Dynegy, subject to certain caps and limitations,
    for breach of representations, warranties, covenants, and losses
    incurred under the CDWR litigation and certain California
    electricity-related litigation. For further information about
    the litigation, see Note 21,

Commercial sales arrangements

—

In
    connection with the purchase and sale of fuel, emission
    allowances and power generation products to and from third
    parties with respect to the operation of some of NRG’s
    generation facilities in the U.S., the Company may be required
    to guarantee a portion of the obligations of certain of its
    subsidiaries. These obligations may include liquidated damages
    payments or other unscheduled payments.

Other guarantees

—

NRG has issued
    guarantees of obligations that its subsidiaries may incur as a
    provision for environmental site remediation, payment of debt
    obligations, rail car leases, and performance under operating
    and maintenance agreements. In 2006, NRG executed a guarantee to
    the benefit of two counterparties under the Company’s
    railcar lease described in Note 21,

Commitments and
    Contingencies

. These guarantees cover payment and
    performance obligations of the Company’s wholly-owned
    subsidiary, NRG Texas LP. The Company does not believe that it
    will be required to perform under this indemnity.

The material indemnities, within the scope of FIN 45, are
    as follows:

Asset purchases and divestitures

—

The purchase and sale agreements,
    which govern NRG’s asset or share investments and
    divestitures, customarily contain indemnifications of the
    transaction to third parties. The contracts indemnify the
    parties for liabilities incurred as a result of a breach of a
    representation or warranty by the indemnifying party, or as a
    result of a change in tax laws. These obligations generally have
    a discrete term and are intended to protect the parties against
    risks that are difficult to predict or estimate at the time of
    the transaction. In several cases, the contract limits the
    liability of the indemnifier. For those indemnities in which
    liability is capped, the minimum exposures range from
    $1 million to $249 million. NRG has no reason to
    believe that the Company currently has any material liability
    relating to such routine indemnification obligations.

Other indemnities

—

Other
    indemnifications NRG has provided cover operational, tax,
    litigation and breaches of representations, warranties and
    covenants. NRG has also indemnified, on a routine basis in the
    ordinary course of business, consultants or other vendors who
    have provided services to the Company. NRG’s maximum
    potential exposure under these indemnifications can range from a
    specified dollar amount to an indeterminate amount, depending on
    the nature of the transaction. Total maximum potential exposure
    under these indemnifications is not estimable due to uncertainty
    as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved.
    NRG does not have any reason to believe that the Company will be
    required to make any material payments under these indemnity
    provisions.

Because many of the guarantees and indemnities NRG issues to
    third parties do not limit the amount or duration of its
    obligations to perform under them, there exists a risk that the
    Company may have obligations in excess of the amounts described
    above. For those guarantees and indemnities that do not limit
    the Company’s liability exposure, it may not be able to
    estimate what the Company’s liability would be, until a
    claim is made for payment or performance, due to the contingent
    nature of these contracts.

Note 26 —
    Jointly Owned Plants

Certain NRG subsidiaries own undivided interests in certain
    jointly-owned plants, described below. These plants are
    maintained and operated pursuant to their joint ownership
    participation and operating agreements. NRG is responsible for
    its subsidiaries share of operating costs and direct expense and
    includes its proportionate share of the facilities and related
    revenues and expenses in these jointly-owned plants in the
    appropriate balance sheet and income statement captions.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The non-guarantor subsidiaries include all of NRG’s foreign
    subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries. NRG conducts
    much of its business through and derives much of its income from
    its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company’s ability to make
    required payments with respect to its indebtedness and other
    obligations depends on the financial results and condition of
    its subsidiaries and NRG’s ability to receive funds from
    its subsidiaries. Except for NRG Bayou Cove, LLC, which is
    subject to certain restrictions under the Company’s Peaker
    financing agreements, there are no restrictions on the ability
    of any of the guarantor subsidiaries to transfer funds to NRG.
    In addition, there may be restrictions for certain non-guarantor
    subsidiaries.

The following condensed consolidating financial information
    presents the financial information of NRG Energy, Inc., the
    guarantor subsidiaries and the non-guarantor subsidiaries in
    accordance with

Rule 3-10

under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s

Regulation S-X.

The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of
    results of operations or financial position had the guarantor
    subsidiaries or non-guarantor subsidiaries operated as
    independent entities.

In this presentation, NRG Energy, Inc. consists of parent
    company operations. Guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor
    subsidiaries of NRG are reported on an equity basis. For
    companies acquired, the fair values of the assets and
    liabilities acquired have been presented on a push-down
    accounting basis.
