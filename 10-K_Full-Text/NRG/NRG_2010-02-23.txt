PART I

Item 1 —

Business

General

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is primarily a
    wholesale power generation company with a significant presence
    in major competitive power markets in the U.S., as well as a
    major retail electricity franchise in the Electric Reliability
    Council of Texas, or ERCOT, market. NRG is engaged in the
    ownership, development, construction and operation of power
    generation facilities, the transacting in and trading of fuel
    and transportation services, the trading of energy, capacity and
    related products in the U.S. and select international
    markets, and the supply of electricity and energy services to
    retail electricity customers in the Texas market.

As of December 31, 2009, NRG had a total global generation
    portfolio of 187 active operating fossil fuel and nuclear
    generation units, at 44 power generation plants, with an
    aggregate generation capacity of approximately 24,115 MW,
    and approximately 400 MW under construction which includes
    partner interests of 200 MW. In addition to its fossil fuel
    plant ownership, NRG has ownership interests in operating
    renewable facilities with an aggregate generation capacity of
    365 MW, consisting of three wind farms representing an
    aggregate generation capacity of 345 MW (which includes
    partner interest of 75 MW) and a solar facility with an
    aggregate generation capacity of 20 MW. Within the U.S.,
    NRG has large and diversified power generation portfolios in
    terms of geography, fuel-type and dispatch levels, with
    approximately 23,110 MW of fossil fuel and nuclear
    generation capacity in 179 active generating units at 42 plants.
    The Company’s power generation facilities are most heavily
    concentrated in Texas (approximately 11,340 MW, including
    345 MW from three wind farms), the Northeast (approximately
    7,015 MW), South Central (approximately 2,855 MW), and
    West (approximately 2,150 MW, including 20 MW from a
    solar farm) regions of the U.S., with approximately 115 MW
    of additional generation capacity from the Company’s
    thermal assets. In addition, through certain foreign
    subsidiaries, NRG has investments in power generation projects
    located in Australia and Germany with approximately
    1,005 MW of generation capacity.

NRG’s principal domestic power plants consist of a mix of
    natural gas-, coal-, oil-fired, nuclear and renewable
    facilities, representing approximately 46%, 32%, 16%, 5% and 1%
    of the Company’s total domestic generation capacity,
    respectively. In addition, 9% of NRG’s domestic generating
    facilities have dual or multiple fuel capacity, which allows
    plants to dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option.

NRG’s domestic generation facilities consist of
    intermittent, baseload, intermediate and peaking power
    generation facilities, the ranking of which is referred to as
    the Merit Order, and include thermal energy production plants.
    The sale of capacity and power from baseload generation
    facilities accounts for the majority of the Company’s
    revenues and provides a stable source of cash flow. In addition,
    NRG’s generation portfolio provides the Company with
    opportunities to capture additional revenues by selling power
    during periods of peak demand, offering capacity or similar
    products to retail electric providers and others, and providing
    ancillary services to support system reliability.

On May 1, 2009, NRG acquired Reliant Energy, which is the
    second largest electricity provider to residential and small
    business, or Mass, customers in Texas. Reliant Energy is also
    the largest electricity and energy services provider, based on
    load, to commercial, industrial and governmental/institutions,
    or C&I, customers in Texas. Based on metered locations, as
    of December 31, 2009, Reliant Energy had approximately
    1.5 million Mass customers and approximately
    0.1 million C&I customers. Reliant Energy arranges for
    the transmission and delivery of electricity to customers, bills
    customers, collects payments for electricity sold and maintains
    call centers to provide customer service.

Furthermore, NRG is focused on the development and investment in
    energy-related new businesses and new technologies where the
    benefits of such investments represent significant commercial
    opportunities and create a comparative advantage for the
    Company. These investments include low or no Greenhouse Gas, or
    GHG, emitting energy generating sources, such as nuclear, wind,
    solar thermal, photovoltaic, “clean” coal and
    gasification, and the retrofit of post-combustion carbon capture
    technologies.


NRG’s
    Business Strategy

NRG’s business strategy is intended to maximize shareholder
    value through production and the sale of safe, reliable and
    affordable power to its customers and in the markets served by
    the Company, while aggressively positioning the Company to meet
    the market’s increasing demand for sustainable and low
    carbon energy solutions, such as nuclear, renewable, electric
    vehicle and smart grid services. The Company believes that
    success in providing energy solutions that address
    sustainability and climate change concerns will not only reduce
    the carbon and capital intensity of the Company’s financial
    performance in the future, it also will reduce the real and
    perceived linkage between the Company’s financial
    performance and prospects, and volatile commodity prices
    particularly natural gas.

In support of this strategy and NRG’s core business
    strengths, the Company will continue to maintain its focus and
    execution on: (i) top decile operating performance of its
    existing operating assets and enhanced operating performance of
    the Company’s commercial operations and hedging program;
    (ii) repowering of power generation assets at existing
    sites and development of new power generation projects;
    (iii) empowering retail customers with distinctive products
    and services that transform how they use, manage and value
    energy; (iv) engaging in a proactive capital allocation
    plan focused on achieving the regular return of capital to
    stockholders within the dictates of prudent balance sheet
    management; and (v) pursuit of selective acquisitions,
    joint ventures, divestitures and investments in energy-related
    new businesses and new technologies in order to enhance the
    Company’s asset mix and competitive position in its core
    markets, both with respect to its traditional core business and
    in respect of opportunities associated with the new energy
    economy.

This strategy is supported by the Company’s five major
    initiatives (

FOR

NRG,

Repowering

NRG, econrg, Future
    NRG and NRG Global Giving) which are designed to enhance the
    Company’s competitive advantages in these strategic areas
    and enable the Company to convert the challenges faced by the
    power industry in the coming years into opportunities for
    financial growth. This strategy is being implemented by focusing
    on the following principles:

Operational Performance

— The Company is
    focused on increasing value from its existing assets. Through
    the

FOR

NRG 2.0 initiative, NRG will continue its
    companywide effort to focus on extracting value from its
    portfolio by improving plant performance, reducing costs and
    harnessing the Company’s advantages of scale in the
    procurement of fuels and other commodities, parts and services,
    and in doing so improving the Company’s return on invested
    capital, or ROIC.

In addition to the

FOR

NRG initiative, the Company seeks
    to maximize profitability and manage cash flow volatility
    through the Company’s commercial operations strategy by
    leveraging its: (i) expertise in marketing power and
    ancillary services; (ii) its knowledge of markets;
    (iii) its balanced financial structure; and (iv) its
    diverse portfolio of power generation assets in the execution of
    asset-based risk management, hedging, marketing and trading
    strategies within well-defined risk and liquidity guidelines.
    The Company’s marketing and hedging philosophy is centered
    on generating stable returns from its portfolio of baseload
    power generation assets while preserving an ability to
    capitalize on strong spot market conditions and to capture the
    extrinsic value of the Company’s intermediate and peaking
    facilities and portions of its baseload fleet.

The Company also seeks to achieve synergies between the
    Company’s retail and wholesale business in Texas through
    its complementary generation portfolio in the Texas region,
    thereby creating the potential for a more stable, reliable and
    competitive business that benefits Texas consumers. By backing
    Reliant Energy’s load-serving requirements with NRG’s
    generation and risk management practices, the need to sell and
    buy power from other financial institutions and intermediaries
    that trade in the ERCOT market may be reduced, resulting in
    reduced transaction costs, credit exposures, and collateral
    postings. In addition, with Reliant Energy’s base of retail
    customers, NRG now has a customer interface with the scale that
    is important to the successful deployment of consumer-facing
    energy technologies and services.

Finally, NRG remains focused on cash flow and maintaining
    appropriate levels of liquidity, debt and equity in order to
    ensure continued access, through all economic and financial
    cycles, to capital for investment, to enhance risk-adjusted
    returns and to provide flexibility in executing NRG’s
    business strategy, including a regular return of capital to its
    debt and equity holders.


Development

—

NRG is
    favorably positioned to pursue growth opportunities through
    expansion of its existing generating capacity and development of
    new generating capacity at its existing facilities, as well as
    “clean” coal and the retrofit of post-combustion
    carbon capture technologies. Primarily through the

Repowering

NRG and econrg initiatives, NRG intends to
    invest in its existing assets through plant improvements,
    repowerings, brownfield development and site expansions to meet
    anticipated requirements for additional capacity in NRG’s
    core markets, with an emphasis on new capacity that is supported
    by long-term power sales agreements and financed with limited or
    non-recourse project financing, and the demonstration and
    deployment of “green” technologies.

Repowering

NRG is a comprehensive portfolio redevelopment
    program designed to develop, construct and operate new
    multi-fuel, multi-technology, highly efficient and
    environmentally responsible generation capacity in locations
    where the Company anticipates retiring certain existing units
    and adding new generation to meet growing demand in the
    Company’s core markets. econrg represents NRG’s
    commitment to environmentally responsible power generation by
    addressing the challenges of climate change, clean air and
    water, and conservation of natural resources while taking
    advantage of business opportunities that may inure to NRG. NRG
    expects that these efforts will provide some or all of the
    following benefits: improved heat rates; lower delivered costs;
    expanded electricity production capability; improved ability to
    dispatch economically across the regional general portfolio;
    increased technological and fuel diversity; and reduced
    environmental impacts, including facilities that either have
    near zero GHG emissions or can be equipped to capture and
    sequester GHG emissions. In addition, several of the
    Company’s original

Repowering

NRG projects or
    projects commenced under that initiative since its inception may
    qualify for financial support under the infrastructure financing
    component of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act as well
    as other government incentive packages. NRG has several
    applications pending or contemplated.

New Businesses and New
    Technology

—

NRG is focused on the
    development and investment in energy-related new businesses and
    new technologies, including low or no GHG emitting energy
    generating sources, such as nuclear, wind, solar thermal, and
    photovoltaic, as well as other endeavors where the benefits of
    such investments represent significant commercial opportunities
    and create a comparative advantage for the Company, such as
    smart meters, electric vehicle ecosystems, and distributed
    “clean” solutions. The Company has made a series of
    recent advancements in these initiatives, including:
    (i) the acquisition of Bluewater Wind, an offshore wind
    development company; (ii) the acquisition of Blythe Solar,
    the largest photovoltaic solar power facility in California;
    (iii) the commercial operation of the Langford Wind Farm,
    the Company’s third wind farm to be brought online;
    (iv) a partnership between Reliant Energy and the City of
    Houston and a partnership between Reliant Energy and Nissan to
    make Houston, Texas a launch city for the use of electric
    vehicles; and (v) the use of “smart” meters for
    Reliant Energy customers. Furthermore, the Company, supported by
    the econrg initiative, intends to capitalize on the high growth
    opportunities presented by government-mandated renewable
    portfolio standards, tax incentives and loan guaranties for
    renewable energy projects, and new technologies and expected
    future carbon regulation.

Company-Wide
    Initiatives

—

In addition, the
    Company’s overall strategy is also supported by Future NRG
    and NRG Global Giving initiatives. Future NRG is the
    Company’s workforce planning and development initiative and
    represents NRG’s strong commitment to planning for future
    staffing requirements to meet the on-going needs of the
    Company’s current operations and initiatives. NRG Global
    Giving is designed to enhance respect for the community, which
    is one of NRG’s core values. The Global Giving Program
    invests NRG’s resources to strengthen the communities where
    NRG does business and seeks to make community investments in
    four focus areas: community and economic development, education,
    environment and human welfare.

Competition

Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive,
    commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants.
    NRG competes on the basis of the location of its plants and
    ownership of multiple plants in various regions, which increases
    the stability and reliability of its energy supply. Wholesale
    power generation is basically a local business that is currently
    highly fragmented relative to other commodity industries and
    diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide
    variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and
    identity of the companies NRG competes with depending on the
    market.

The deregulated retail energy business in ERCOT is a competitive
    business. In general, competition in the retail energy business
    is on the basis of price, service, brand image, product
    offerings and market perceptions of


creditworthiness. Reliant Energy sells electricity pursuant to
    fixed price or indexed products, and customers elect terms of
    service typically ranging from one month to five years. Reliant
    Energy’s rates are market-based rates, and not subject to
    traditional

cost-of-service

regulation by the Public Utility Commission of Texas, or PUCT.
    Non-affiliated transmission and distribution service companies
    provide, on a non-discriminatory basis, the wires and metering
    services necessary to access customers.

Competitive
    Strengths

Scale and diversity of assets —

NRG has one of
    the largest and most diversified power generation portfolios in
    the U.S., with approximately 23,110 MW of fossil fuel and
    nuclear generation capacity in 179 active generating units at 42
    plants and 365 MW renewable generation capacity which
    consists of ownership interests in three wind farms and a solar
    facility as of December 31, 2009. The Company’s power
    generation assets are diversified by fuel-type, dispatch level
    and region, which help mitigate the risks associated with fuel
    price volatility and market demand cycles. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s power generation
    assets consisted of approximately 10,660 MW of gas-fired;
    7,560 MW of coal-fired; 3,715 MW of oil-fired;
    1,175 MW of nuclear and 365 MW of renewable generating
    capacity in the U.S.

NRG has a significant power generation presence in major
    competitive power markets of the U.S. as set forth in the
    map below:

(1)

Includes 115 MW as part of
    NRG’s Thermal assets. For combined scale, approximately
    2,095 MW is dual-fuel capable. Reflects only domestic
    generation capacity as of December 31, 2009.

The Company’s U.S. power generation portfolio by
    dispatch level is comprised of approximately 37% baseload, 37%
    intermediate, 25% peaking and 1% intermittent units. NRG’s
    U.S. baseload facilities, which consist of approximately
    8,735 MW of generation capacity measured as of
    December 31, 2009, provide the Company with a significant
    source of stable cash flow, while its intermediate and peaking
    facilities, with approximately 14,375 MW of generation
    capacity as of December 31, 2009, provide NRG with
    opportunities to capture the significant upside potential that
    can arise from time to time during periods of high demand. In
    addition, approximately 9% of the Company’s domestic
    generation facilities have dual or multiple fuel capability,


which allows most of these plants to dispatch with the lowest
    cost fuel option. In 2009, NRG completed the construction of the
    Cedar Bayou Generating Station (520 MW including partner
    interests of 260 MW) and the Langford wind farm
    (150 MW), which provide electricity to the Company’s
    core region. In addition, the Company acquired Blythe Solar
    (20 MW) in November 2009, which provides electricity to the
    Company’s West region.

The following chart demonstrates the diversification of
    NRG’s domestic power generation assets as of
    December 31, 2009

Reliability of future cash flows

— NRG has
    hedged a significant portion of its expected baseload generation
    capacity with decreasing hedged levels through 2014. NRG also
    has cooperative load contract obligations in South Central
    region which expire over various dates through 2026. The Company
    has the capacity and intent to enter into additional hedges when
    market conditions are favorable. In addition, as of
    December 31, 2009, the Company had purchased fuel forward
    under fixed price contracts, with contractually-specified price
    escalators, for approximately 47% of its expected baseload coal
    requirement from 2010 to 2014. The hedge percentage is
    reflective of the current agreement of the Jewett mine in which
    NRG has the contractual ability to adjust volumes in future
    years. These forward positions provide a stable and reliable
    source of future cash flow for NRG’s investors, while
    preserving a portion of its generation portfolio for
    opportunistic sales to take advantage of market dynamics.

With its complementary generation portfolio, the Texas region is
    a supplier of power to Reliant Energy, thereby creating the
    potential for more stable, reliable cash flows. By backing
    Reliant Energy’s load-serving requirements with NRG’s
    generation and risk management practices, the need to sell and
    buy power from other financial institutions and intermediaries
    that trade in the ERCOT market may be reduced, resulting in
    lower transaction costs and credit exposures. This combination
    of generation and retail allows for a reduction in actual and
    contingent collateral, initially through offsetting transactions
    and over time by reducing the need to hedge the retail power
    supply through third parties.

Favorable cost dynamics for baseload power plants —

In 2009, approximately 87% of the Company’s domestic
    generation output was from plants fueled by coal or nuclear
    fuel. In many of the competitive markets where NRG operates, the
    price of power is typically set by the marginal costs of natural
    gas-fired and oil-fired power plants that historically have
    higher variable costs than solid-fuel baseload power plants. As
    a result of NRG’s lower marginal cost for baseload coal and
    nuclear generation assets, the Company expects the baseload
    assets in ERCOT to generate power the majority of the time they
    are available.

Locational advantages —

Many of NRG’s
    generation assets are located within densely populated areas
    that are characterized by significant constraints on the
    transmission of power from generators outside the particular
    region. Consequently, these assets are able to benefit from the
    higher prices that prevail for energy in these markets during
    periods of transmission constraints. NRG has generation assets
    located within Houston, New York City, southwestern Connecticut
    and the Los Angeles and San Diego load basins; all areas
    which experience, from

time-to-time

and to varying degrees, of constraints on the transmission of
    electricity. This gives the Company the opportunity to capture
    additional revenues by offering capacity to retail electric
    providers and others, selling power at prevailing market prices
    during periods of peak demand and providing ancillary services
    in support of system


reliability. Also, these facilities are often ideally situated
    for repowering or the addition of new capacity, because their
    location and existing infrastructure give them significant
    advantages over developed sites in their regions that do not
    have process infrastructure.

In understanding NRG’s wholesale generation business, the
    Company believes that certain performance metrics are
    particularly important. These are industry statistics defined by
    the North American Electric Reliability Council, or NERC, and
    are more fully described below:

Annual Equivalent Availability Factor, or EAF

—
    Measures the percentage of maximum generation available over
    time as the fraction of net maximum generation that could be
    provided over a defined period of time after all types of
    outages and deratings, including seasonal deratings, are taken
    into account.

Net heat rate —

The net heat rate for the
    Company’s fossil-fired power plants represents the total
    amount of fuel in BTU required to generate one net kWh provided.

Net Capacity Factor —

The net amount of
    electricity that a generating unit produces over a period of
    time divided by the net amount of electricity it could have
    produced if it had run at full power over that time period. The
    net amount of electricity produced is the total amount of
    electricity generated minus the amount of electricity used
    during generation.

In addition, the Company believes that retail customer counts
    and weighted average retail customer counts are particularly
    important performance metrics when evaluating this segment. For
    further results of Reliant Energy’s business metrics see
    Item 6 —

Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operation.

The tables below present the North American power generation
    performance metrics for the Company’s power plants

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, NRG had 4,607 employees,
    approximately 1,640 of whom were covered by U.S. bargaining
    agreements. During 2009, the Company did not experience any
    labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of its facilities. The
    increase in the number of employees is primarily due to the
    Company’s acquisition of Reliant Energy in May 2009.

Commercial
    Operations Overview

NRG seeks to maximize profitability and manage cash flow
    volatility through the marketing, trading and sale of energy,
    capacity and ancillary services into spot, intermediate and
    long-term markets and through the active management and trading
    of emissions allowances, fuel supplies and
    transportation-related services. The Company’s


principal objectives are the realization of the full market
    value of its asset base, including the capture of its extrinsic
    value, the management and mitigation of commodity market risk
    and the reduction of cash flow volatility over time.

NRG enters into power sales and hedging arrangements via a wide
    range of products and contracts, including power purchase
    agreements, fuel supply contracts, capacity auctions, natural
    gas swap agreements and other financial instruments. The PPAs
    that NRG enters into require the Company to deliver MWh of power
    to its counterparties. In addition, because changes in power
    prices in the markets where NRG operates are generally
    correlated to changes in natural gas prices, NRG uses hedging
    strategies which may include power and natural gas forward sales
    contracts to manage the commodity price risk primarily
    associated with the Company’s baseload generation assets.
    The objective of these hedging strategies is to stabilize the
    cash flow generated by NRG’s portfolio of assets.

The following table summarizes NRG’s U.S. baseload
    capacity and the corresponding revenues and average natural gas
    prices resulting from baseload hedge agreements extending beyond
    December 31, 2010, and through 2014:

Reliant Energy sells electricity on fixed price or indexed
    products, and these contracts have terms typically ranging from
    one month to five years. In a typical year, the Company sells
    approximately 50 TWh of load (comprised of approximately 40% to
    Mass customers and approximately 60% to C&I customers), but
    this amount can be affected by weather, economic conditions and
    competition. The wholesale supply is typically purchased as the
    load is contracted in order to secure profit margin. The
    wholesale supply is purchased from a combination of NRG’s
    wholesale portfolio and other third parties, depending on the
    existing hedge position for the NRG wholesale portfolio at the
    time.

Capacity
    Revenue Sources

NRG revenues and free cash flows benefit from capacity/demand
    payments originating from either market clearing capacity
    prices, Reliability Must-Run, or RMR, Resource Adequacy, or RA,
    contracts and tolling arrangements as many of NRG’s plants
    are well situated within load pockets and make critical
    contributions to system stability. Specifically, in the
    Northeast, the Company’s largest sources for capacity
    revenues are derived


either from market capacity auctions including New York, PJM
    Interconnection LLC, or PJM and New England auctions

and/or

RMRs.
    In South Central, NRG earns significant capacity revenue from
    its long-term full-requirements load contracts with 10 Louisiana
    distribution cooperatives, which are not unit specific. Of the
    ten contracts, seven expire in 2025 and account for 50% of the
    contract load, while the remaining three expire in 2014 and
    comprise 40% of contract load. Capacity revenues from these long
    terms contracts are tied to summer peak demand as well as
    provide a mechanism for recovering a portion of the costs for
    mandated environmental projects over the remaining life of the
    contract. In West, most of the Company’s sites benefit from
    either tolling agreements

and/or

RA
    contracts. Texas, does not have a capacity market; Texas
    capacity revenues reflect bilateral transactions. Prior to
    NRG’s acquisition of Texas Genco, the PUCT regulations
    required that Texas generators sell 15% of their capacity by
    auction at reduced rates. The Company was subsequently released
    from this obligation and the legacy capacity contracts expired
    in 2009. See each of the

Regional Business Descriptions
    Market Framework

below for further discussion of the plants
    and relevant capacity revenue eligibility.

Fuel
    Supply and Transportation

NRG’s fuel requirements consist primarily of nuclear fuel
    and various forms of fossil fuel including oil, natural gas and
    coal, including lignite. The prices of oil, natural gas and coal
    are subject to macro- and micro-economic forces that can change
    dramatically in both the short- and long-term. The Company
    obtains its oil, natural gas and coal from multiple suppliers
    and transportation sources. Although availability is generally
    not an issue, localized shortages, transportation availability
    and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur. The
    preceding factors related to the sources and availability of raw
    materials are fairly uniform across the Company’s business
    segments.

Coal

— The Company is largely
    hedged for its domestic coal consumption over the next few
    years. Coal hedging is dynamic and is based on forecasted
    generation and market volatility. As of December 31, 2009,
    NRG had purchased forward contracts to provide fuel for
    approximately 47% of the Company’s requirements from 2010
    through 2014. NRG arranges for the purchase, transportation and
    delivery of coal for the Company’s baseload coal plants via
    a variety of coal purchase agreements, rail/barge transportation
    agreements and rail car lease arrangements. The Company
    purchased approximately 34 million tons of coal in 2009, of
    which 96% is Powder River Basin coal and lignite. The Company is
    one of the largest coal purchasers in the U.S.

The following table shows the percentage of the Company’s
    coal and lignite requirements from 2010 through 2014 that have
    been purchased forward:

The hedge percentages reflect the
    current plan for the Jewett mine. NRG has the contractual

As of December 31, 2009, NRG had approximately 6,280
    privately leased or owned rail cars in the Company’s
    transportation fleet. NRG has entered into rail transportation
    agreements with varying tenures that provide for substantially
    all of the Company’s rail transportation requirements up to
    the next five years.

Natural Gas

— NRG operates a fleet
    of natural gas plants in the Texas, Northeast, South Central and
    West regions which are primarily comprised of peaking assets
    that run in times of high power demand. Due to the uncertainty
    of their dispatch, the fuel needs are managed on a spot basis as
    it is not prudent to forward purchase fixed price natural gas
    for units that may not run. The Company contracts for natural
    gas storage services as well as natural gas transportation
    services to ensure delivery of natural gas when needed.

Nuclear Fuel

— South Texas
    Project’s, or STP’s, owners satisfy STP’s fuel
    supply requirements by: (i) acquiring uranium concentrates
    and contracting for conversion of the uranium concentrates into
    uranium


hexafluoride; (ii) contracting for enrichment of uranium
    hexafluoride; and (iii) contracting for fabrication of
    nuclear fuel assemblies. NRG is party to a number of long-term
    forward purchase contracts with many of the world’s largest
    suppliers covering STP requirements for uranium and conversion
    services for the next five years, and with substantial portions
    of STP’s requirements procured thereafter. NRG is party to
    long-term contracts to procure STP’s requirements for
    enrichment services and fuel fabrication for the life of the
    operating license.

Seasonality
    and Price Volatility

Annual and quarterly operating results of the Company’s
    wholesale power generation segments can be significantly
    affected by weather and energy commodity price volatility.
    Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas,
    interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels
    of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power
    price volatility. NRG derives a majority of its annual revenues
    in the months of May through October, when demand for
    electricity is at its highest in the Company’s core
    domestic markets. Further, power price volatility is generally
    higher in the summer months, traditionally NRG’s most
    important season. The Company’s second most important
    season is the winter months of December through March when
    volatility and price spikes in underlying delivered fuel prices
    have tended to drive seasonal electricity prices. The preceding
    factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly
    uniform across the Company’s wholesale generation business
    segments.

The sale of electric power to retail customers is also a
    seasonal business with the demand for power peaking during the
    summer months. Weather may impact operating results and extreme
    weather conditions could materially affect results of
    operations. The rates charged to retail customers may be
    impacted by fluctuations in the price of natural gas,
    transmission constraints, competition, and changes in market
    heat rates.

Regional
    Business Descriptions

NRG is organized into business segments, with each of the
    Company’s core regions operating as a separate business
    segment as discussed below.

RELIANT
    ENERGY

Operating
    Strategy

Reliant Energy’s business is to earn a margin by selling
    electricity to end-use customers, providing innovative and
    value-enhancing services to such customers, and acquiring supply
    for the estimated demand. As a retail energy provider, Reliant
    Energy arranges for the transmission and delivery of electricity
    to customers, bills customers, collects payment for electricity
    sold, and maintains call centers to provide customer service. In
    addition, Reliant Energy is focused on developing innovative
    energy solutions including the infrastructure for electric
    vehicles and energy efficiency tools and services for consumers
    to manage their energy usage. NRG presently purchases a
    substantial portion of Reliant Energy’s supply requirements
    from third parties such as generation companies and power
    marketers and has begun the process of becoming the primary
    provider for their supply requirements. Transmission and
    distribution services are purchased from entities regulated by
    the PUCT and subject to ERCOT protocols.

The energy usage of Reliant Energy’s retail customers
    varies by season, with generally higher usage during the summer
    period. As a result, Reliant Energy’s net working capital
    requirements generally increase during summer months along with
    the higher revenues, and then decline during off-peak months.

Customer
    Segments

The following is a description of Reliant Energy’s
    significant customer segments in Texas.

•

Mass

— Reliant Energy’s Mass customer
    base is made up of approximately 1.5 million residential
    and small business customers in the ERCOT market with more than
    half located in the Houston area. Reliant Energy also serves
    customers in other competitive markets in ERCOT including the
    Dallas, Fort Worth, and Corpus Christi areas.

•

C&I

— Reliant Energy markets
    electricity and energy services to approximately
    0.1 million C&I customers in Texas. These customers
    include refineries, chemical plants, manufacturing facilities,
    hospitals, universities, commercial real estate, government
    agencies, restaurants and other commercial facilities.


Market
    Framework

In the ERCOT market, Reliant Energy is certified by the PUCT as
    a retail energy provider, or REP, to contract with end-users to
    sell electricity and provide other value enhancing services. In
    addition, Reliant Energy contracts with transmission and
    distribution service providers, or TDSPs, to arrange for
    transportation to the customer. Reliant Energy activities in
    Texas are subject to standards and regulations adopted by the
    PUCT and ERCOT. Reliant Energy operates within the same ERCOT
    market as the Company’s Texas region. For further
    discussion of the Texas market framework, which includes overall
    market structure in addition to items specific to the generation
    business, see Texas region Market Framework discussion, below.

to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

TEXAS

NRG’s largest business segment is located in Texas and is
    comprised of investments in generation facilities located in the
    physical control areas of the ERCOT market. As of
    December 31, 2009, NRG’s generation assets in the
    Texas region consisted of approximately 5,355 MW of
    baseload generation assets, approximately 345 MW of
    intermittent wind generation assets, excluding partner interests
    of 75 MW, in addition to approximately 5,640 MW of
    intermediate and peaking natural gas-fired assets. NRG realizes
    a substantial portion of its revenue and cash flow from the sale
    of power from the Company’s three baseload power plants
    located in the ERCOT market that use solid-fuel: W.A. Parish
    which uses coal, Limestone which use lignite and coal, and an
    undivided 44% interest in two nuclear generating units at STP.
    In addition, in June 2009, NRG completed construction and began
    commercial operations of the 520 MW Cedar Bayou 4 natural
    gas-fueled combined cycle generating plant at NRG’s Cedar
    Bayou Generating Station in Chambers County, Texas, of which NRG
    holds a 50% undivided interest. Also in 2009, NRG completed
    construction and began commercial operations of the 150 MW
    Langford wind farm located in west Texas. Both Cedar Bayou 4 and
    Langford are located in the ERCOT market. Power plants are
    generally dispatched in order of lowest operating cost and as of
    December 2009, approximately 59% of the net generation capacity
    in the ERCOT market was natural gas-fired. Generally, NRG’s
    three solid-fuel baseload facilities and three wind farms have
    significantly lower operating costs than natural gas plants. NRG
    expects these three solid-fuel facilities to operate the
    majority of the time when available, subject to planned and
    forced outages.

Operating
    Strategy

NRG’s operating strategy to maximize value and opportunity
    across these assets is to (i) ensure the availability of
    the baseload plants to fulfill their commercial obligations
    under long-term forward sales contracts already in place;
    (ii) manage the natural gas assets for profitability while
    ensuring the reliability and flexibility of power supply to the
    Houston market; (iii) take advantage of the skill sets and
    market or regulatory knowledge to grow the business through
    incremental capacity uprates and repowering development of
    solid-fuel baseload and gas-fired units; and (iv) play a
    leading role in the development of the ERCOT market by active
    membership and participation in market and regulatory issues.

NRG’s strategy is to sell forward a majority of its
    solid-fuel baseload capacity in the ERCOT market under long-term
    contracts or to enter into hedges by using natural gas as a
    proxy for power prices. Accordingly, the Company’s primary
    focus will be to keep these solid-fuel baseload units running
    efficiently. With respect to gas-fired assets, NRG will continue
    contracting forward a significant portion of gas-fired capacity
    one to two years out while holding a portion for

back-up

in
    case there is an operational issue with one of the baseload
    units and to provide upside for expanding heat rates. For the
    gas-fired capacity sold forward, the Company will offer a range
    of products specific to customers needs. For the gas-fired
    capacity that NRG will continue to sell commercially into the
    market, the Company will focus on making this capacity available
    to the market whenever it is economical to run.

The following is a description of NRG’s most significant
    revenue generating plants in the Texas region:

W.A. Parish —

NRG’s W.A. Parish plant is
    one of the largest fossil-fired plants in the U.S. based on
    total MWs of generation capacity. This plant’s power
    generation units include four coal-fired steam generation units
    with an aggregate generation capacity of 2,490 MW as of
    December 31, 2009. Two of these units are 650 MW and
    655 MW steam units that were placed in commercial service
    in December 1977 and December 1978, respectively. The other two
    units are 575 MW and 610 MW steam units that were
    placed in commercial service in June 1980 and December 1982,
    respectively. Each of the four coal-fired units have
    low-NO

x

burners and Selective Catalytic Reduction


systems, or SCRs, installed to reduce
    NO

x

emissions and baghouses to reduce particulates. In addition,
    W.A. Parish Unit 8 has a scrubber installed to reduce
    SO


emissions.

Limestone

— NRG’s Limestone plant is a
    lignite and coal-fired plant located approximately
    140 miles northwest of Houston. This plant includes two
    steam generation units with an aggregate generation capacity of
    1,690 MW as of December 31, 2009. The first unit is an
    830 MW steam unit that was placed in commercial service in
    1985. The second unit is an 860 MW steam unit that was
    placed in commercial service in December 1986. Limestone burns
    lignite from an adjacent mine, but also burns low sulfur coal
    and petroleum coke. This serves to lower average fuel costs by
    eliminating fuel transportation costs, which can represent up to
    two-thirds of delivered fuel costs for plants of this type. Both
    units have installed
    low-NO

x

burners to reduce
    NO

x

emissions and scrubbers to reduce
    SO


emissions.

The lignite used to fuel the Texas region’s Limestone
    facility is obtained from a surface mine, or the Jewett mine,
    adjacent to the Limestone facility under a long-term contract
    with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co., or TWCC. The contract is based
    on a cost-plus arrangement with incentives and penalties to
    ensure proper management of the mine. NRG has the flexibility to
    increase or decrease lignite purchases with adequate notice. The
    mining period was extended through 2018 with an option to extend
    the mining period by two five-year intervals. The agreement
    ensures lignite supply to NRG and confirms NRG’s
    responsibility for the final reclamation at the mine. Subject to
    the terms of the contract, NRG has the ability to step in and
    operate the mine under certain circumstances.

STP Electric Generating Station —

STP is one of
    the newest and largest nuclear-powered generation plants in the
    U.S. based on total megawatts of generation capacity. This
    plant is located approximately 90 miles south of downtown
    Houston, near Bay City, Texas and consists of two generation
    units each representing approximately 1,335 MW of
    generation capacity. STP’s two generation units commenced
    operations in August 1988 and June 1989, respectively. For the
    year ended December 31, 2009, STP had a zero percent forced
    outage rate and a 98% net capacity factor.

STP is currently owned as a tenancy in common between NRG and
    two other co-owners. NRG owns a 44%, or approximately
    1,175 MW, interest in STP, the City of San Antonio
    owns a 40% interest and the City of Austin owns the remaining
    16% interest. Each co-owner retains its undivided ownership
    interest in the two nuclear-fueled generation units and the
    electrical output from those units. Except for certain plant
    shutdown and decommissioning costs and United States Nuclear
    Regulatory Commission, or NRC, licensing liabilities, NRG is
    severally liable, but not jointly liable, for the expenses and
    liabilities of STP. The four original co-owners of STP organized
    STPNOC to operate and maintain STP. STPNOC is managed by a board
    of directors composed of one director appointed by each of the
    three co-owners, along with the chief executive officer of
    STPNOC. STPNOC is the NRC-licensed operator of STP. No single
    owner controls STPNOC and most significant commercial as well as
    asset investment decisions for the existing units must be
    approved by two or more owners who collectively control more
    than 60% of the interests.

The two STP generation units operate under licenses granted by
    the NRC that expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively. These
    licenses may be extended for additional

20-year

terms if the project satisfies NRC requirements. Adequate
    provisions exist for long-term

on-site

storage of spent nuclear fuel throughout the remaining life of
    the existing STP plant licenses.

Market
    Framework

The ERCOT market is one of the nation’s largest and
    historically fastest growing power markets. It represents
    approximately 85% of the demand for power in Texas and covers
    the entire state, with the exception of the far west
    (El Paso), a large part of the Texas Panhandle, and two
    small areas in the eastern part of the state. For 2009, hourly
    demand ranged from a low of 21,350 MW to a high of
    63,534 MW. The ERCOT market has limited interconnections
    compared to other markets in the U.S. — currently
    limited to 1,086 MW of generation capacity, and wholesale
    transactions within the ERCOT market are not subject to
    regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC.
    Any wholesale producer of power that qualifies as a power
    generation company under the Texas electric restructuring law
    and that accesses the ERCOT electric power grid is allowed to
    sell power in the ERCOT market at unregulated rates.


As of December 2009, installed generation capacity of
    approximately 84,000 MW existed in the ERCOT market,
    including 3,000 MW of generation that has suspended
    operations, or been “mothballed”. Natural gas-fired
    generation represents approximately 50,000 MW, or 59%.
    Approximately 24,000 MW, or 29%, was lower marginal cost
    generation capacity such as coal, lignite and nuclear plants.
    NRG’s coal and nuclear fuel baseload plants represent
    approximately 5,355 MW net, or 22%, of the total solid-fuel
    baseload net generation capacity in the ERCOT market.
    Additionally, NRG commenced commercial operations of the
    520 MW Cedar Bayou 4 natural gas-fueled combined cycle
    generating plant at NRG’s Cedar Bayou Generating Station in
    Chambers County, Texas, of which NRG holds a 50% undivided
    interest. Also in 2009, NRG commenced commercial operations of
    the 150 MW Langford wind farm located in west Texas. Both
    Cedar Bayou 4 and Langford are located in the ERCOT market.

The ERCOT market has established a target equilibrium reserve
    margin level of approximately 12.5%. The reserve margin for 2009
    was 16.8% forecast to increase to 21.8% for 2010 per
    ERCOT’s latest Capacity Demand and Reserve Report. There
    are currently plans being considered by the PUCT to build a
    significant amount of transmission from west Texas and
    continuing across the state to enable wind generation to reach
    load. The ultimate impact on the reserve margin and wholesale
    dynamics from these plans are unknown.

In the ERCOT market, buyers and sellers enter into bilateral
    wholesale capacity, power and ancillary services contracts or
    may participate in the centralized ancillary services market,
    including balancing energy, with the ERCOT administers.
    Published in August 2009, the “2008 State of the Market
    Report for the ERCOT Wholesale Electricity Markets” from
    the Independent Market Monitor indicated that natural gas is
    typically the marginal fuel in the ERCOT market. As a result of
    NRG’s lower marginal cost for baseload coal and nuclear
    generation assets, the Company expects these ERCOT assets to
    generate power the majority of the time they are available.

The ERCOT market is currently divided into four regions or
    congestion zones, namely: North, Houston, South and West, which
    reflect transmission constraints that are commercially
    significant and which have limits as to the amount of power that
    can flow across zones. NRG’s W.A. Parish plant, STP and all
    its natural gas-fired plants are located in the Houston zone.
    NRG’s Limestone plant is located in the North zone while
    the Elbow Creek, Langford, and Sherbino wind farms are located
    in the West Zone.

The ERCOT market operates under the reliability standards set by
    the North American Electric Reliability Council. The PUCT has
    primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure the
    adequacy and reliability of power supply across Texas’s
    main interconnected power transmission grid. The ERCOT is
    responsible for facilitating reliable operations of the bulk
    electric power supply system in the ERCOT market. Its
    responsibilities include ensuring that power production and
    delivery are accurately accounted for among the generation
    resources and wholesale buyers and sellers. Unlike power pools
    with independent operators in other regions of the country, the
    ERCOT market is not a centrally dispatched power pool and the
    ERCOT does not procure power on behalf of its members other than
    to maintain the reliable operations of the transmission system.
    The ERCOT also serves as an agent for procuring ancillary
    services for those who elect not to provide their own ancillary
    services.

Power sales or purchases from one location to another may be
    constrained by the power transfer capability between locations.
    Under the current ERCOT protocol, the commercially significant
    constraints and the transfer capabilities along these paths are
    reassessed every year and congestion costs are directly assigned
    to those parties causing the congestion. This has the potential
    to increase power generators’ exposure to the congestion
    costs associated with transferring power between zones.

The PUCT has adopted a rule directing the ERCOT to develop and
    to implement a wholesale market design that, among other things,
    includes a day-ahead energy market and replaces the existing
    zonal wholesale market design with a nodal market design that is
    based on Locational Marginal Prices, or LMP, for power. See also
    Regional Regulatory Developments — Texas Region. One
    of the stated purposes of the proposed market restructuring is
    to reduce local (intra-zonal) transmission congestion costs. The
    market redesign project is now proposed to take effect in
    December 2010. NRG expects that implementation of any new market
    design will require modifications to its existing procedures and
    systems.


NORTHEAST

NRG’s second largest asset base is located in the Northeast
    region of the U.S. with generation assets within the
    control areas of the New York Independent System Operator, or
    NYISO, the Independent System Operator —
    New England, or ISO-NE, and the PJM. As of
    December 31, 2009, NRG’s generation assets in the
    Northeast region consisted of approximately 1,870 MW of
    baseload generation assets and approximately 5,145 MW of
    intermediate and peaking assets.

Operating
    Strategy

The Northeast region’s strategy is focused on optimizing
    the value of NRG’s broad and varied generation portfolio in
    the three interconnected and actively traded competitive
    markets: the NYISO, the ISO-NE and the PJM. In the Northeast
    markets, load-serving entities generally lack their own
    generation capacity, with much of the generation base aging and
    the current ownership of the generation highly disaggregated.
    Thus, commodity prices are more volatile on an as-delivered
    basis than in other NRG regions due to the distance and
    occasional physical constraints that impact the delivery of fuel
    into the region. In this environment, NRG seeks both to enhance
    its ability to be the low cost wholesale generator capable of
    delivering wholesale power to load centers within the region
    from multiple locations using multiple fuel sources, and to be

Certain of the Northeast region assets are located in or near
    load centers and inside transmission constraints such as New
    York City, southwestern Connecticut and the Delmarva Peninsula.
    Assets in these areas tend to attract higher capacity revenues
    and higher energy revenues and thus present opportunities for
    repowering these sites. The Company has benefited from the
    introduction of capacity market reforms in both the New England
    Power Pool, or NEPOOL, and PJM. The Locational Forward Reserve
    Markets, or LFRM, in the NEPOOL, became effective
    October 1, 2006, and the transition capacity payments
    preceding the Forward Capacity Market, or FCM, were effective
    December 1, 2006. In all seven LFRM auctions to date, the
    market has cleared at the administratively set price of $14/kw
    month reflecting the shortage of peaking generation especially
    in the Connecticut zone. The LFRM and interim capacity payments
    serve as a prelude to the full implementation of the FCM which
    begins June 1, 2010. PJM’s Reliability Pricing Model,
    or RPM, became effective June 1, 2007, and the Company has
    participated in auctions providing capacity price certainty
    through May 2012.

RMR Agreements

— Certain of the Northeast
    region’s Connecticut assets have been designated as
    required to be available to ensure reliability to ISO-NE. These
    assets are subject to RMR agreements, which are contracts under
    which NRG agrees to maintain its facilities to be available to
    run when needed, and are paid to provide these capability
    services based on the Company’s costs. During 2009,
    Middletown, Montville and Norwalk Power (Units 1 and
    2) were covered by RMR agreements. Unless terminated
    earlier, these agreements will terminate on June 1, 2010,
    which coincides with the commencement of the FCM in NEPOOL.

The following is a description of NRG’s most significant
    revenue generating plants in the Northeast region:

Arthur Kill

— NRG’s Arthur Kill plant is a
    natural gas-fired power plant consisting of three units and is
    located on the west side of Staten Island, New York. The plant
    produces an aggregate generation capacity of 865 MW from
    two intermediate load units (Units 20 and 30) and one peak
    load unit (Unit GT-1). Unit 20 produces an aggregate generation
    capacity of 350 MW and was installed in 1959. Unit 30
    produces an aggregate generation capacity of 505 MW and was
    installed in 1969. Both Unit 20 and Unit 30 were converted from
    coal-fired to natural gas-fired facilities in the early 1990s.
    Unit GT-1 produces an aggregate generation capacity of
    10 MW and is activated when Consolidated Edison issues a
    maximum generation alarm on hot days and during thunderstorms.

Astoria Gas Turbine

— Located in Astoria,
    Queens, New York, the NRG Astoria Gas Turbine facility occupies
    approximately 15 acres within the greater Astoria
    Generating complex which includes several competing generating
    facilities. NRG’s Astoria Gas Turbine facility has an
    aggregate generation capacity of approximately 550 MW from
    19 operational combustion turbine generators classified into
    three types of turbines. The first group consists of 12
    gas-fired Pratt & Whitney GG-4 Twin Packs in Buildings
    2, 3 and 4, which have a net generation capacity of 145 MW
    per building. The second group consists of Westinghouse
    Industrial Combustion Turbines #191A in Buildings 5, 7 and
    8 that fire on liquid distillate with a net generation capacity
    of approximately 12 MW per building. The third group
    consists of Westinghouse Industrial Gas Turbines #251GG
    located in Buildings 10, 11, 12 and 13 and fire on liquid
    distillate with a net generation capacity of 20 MW per
    building. The Astoria units also supply Black Start Service to
    the NYISO. The site also contains tankage for distillate fuel
    with a capacity of 86,000 barrels.

Dunkirk

— The Dunkirk plant is a coal-fired
    plant located on Lake Erie in Dunkirk, New York. This plant
    produces an aggregate generation capacity of 530 MW from
    four baseload units. Units 1 and 2 produce up to 75 MW each
    and were put in service in 1950, and Units 3 and 4 produce
    approximately 190 MW each and were put in service in 1959
    and 1960, respectively. In a settlement agreement reached with
    the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, or
    NYSDEC, in January 2005, NRG committed to reducing
    SO


emissions from Dunkirk and Huntley stations by 86.8% below
    baseline emissions of 107,144 by 2013 and
    NO

x

emissions by 80.9% below baseline emission of 17,005 by 2012. In
    order to comply with the NYSDEC settlement agreement, as well as
    with various federal and state emissions standards, the Company
    installed back-end control facilities at Dunkirk in 2009. All
    units have returned to service and the fabric filters are
    functioning as designed.

Huntley

— The Huntley plant is a coal-fired
    plant consisting of six units and is located in Tonawanda,
    New York, approximately three miles north of Buffalo. The
    plant has a net generation capacity of 380 MW from two
    baseload units (Units 67 and 68). Units 67 and 68 generate a net
    capacity of approximately 190 MW each, and were put in
    service in 1957 and 1958, respectively. Units 63 and 64 are
    inactive and were officially retired in May 2006. To comply with
    the January 2005 NYSDEC settlement agreement referenced above,
    NRG retired Units 65 and 66 effective June 3, 2007, and in
    January 2009, Huntley Units 67 and 68 fabric filters were placed
    in service and they are functioning as designed.

Indian River

— The Indian River Power plant is
    a coal-fired plant located in southern Delaware on a
    1,170 acre site. The plant consists of four coal-fired
    electric steam units (Units 1 through 4) and one 15 MW
    combustion turbine, bringing total plant capacity to
    approximately 740 MW. Units 1 and 2 are each 80 MW of
    capacity and were placed in service in 1957 and 1959,
    respectively. Unit 3 is 155 MW of capacity and was placed
    in service in 1970, while Unit 4 is 410 MW of capacity and
    was placed in service in 1980. Units 1, 2, 3 and 4 are equipped
    with selective non-catalytic reduction systems, for the
    reduction of
    NO

x

emissions. All four units are equipped with electrostatic
    precipitators to remove fly ash from the flue gases as well as
    low
    NO

x

burners with over fired air to control
    NO

x

emissions and activated carbon injection systems to control
    mercury. Units 1, 2 and 3 are fueled with eastern bituminous
    coal, while Unit 4 is fueled with low sulfur compliance coal.
    Pursuant to a consent order dated September 25, 2007,
    between NRG and the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and
    Environmental Control, or DNREC, NRG agreed to operate the units
    in a manner that would limit the emissions of
    NO

x

,
    SO


and mercury. Further, the Company agreed to mothball unit 2 by
    May 1, 2010, and unit 1 by May 1, 2011, and has
    notified PJM of the plan to mothball these units. In the absence
    of the appropriate control technology installed at this
    facility, Units 3 and 4 totaling approximately 565 MW,
    could not operate beyond December 31, 2011, per terms of
    the consent order. On February 3, 2010, the Company
    together with DNREC announced a proposed plan to retire the


155 MW unit 3 by December 31, 2013. The plan, subject
    to definitive documentation, extends the operable period of the
    plant two years beyond the December 31, 2011 date and
    avoids the incremental cost of control technology. The
    410 MW unit 4 is not affected by this proposal, and in
    2009, the Company began construction to install selective
    catalytic reduction systems, scrubbers and fabric filters on
    this unit. These controls are scheduled to be operational at the
    end of 2011.

Market
    Framework

Although each of the three Northeast Independent Systems
    Operators, or ISOs, and their respective energy markets are
    functionally, administratively and operationally independent,
    they all follow, to a certain extent, similar market designs.
    Each ISO dispatches power plants to meet system energy and
    reliability needs, and settles physical power deliveries at LMPs
    which reflect the value of energy at a specific location at the
    specific time it is delivered. This value is determined by an
    ISO-administered auction process, which evaluates and selects
    the least costly supplier offers or bids to create a reliable
    and least-cost dispatch. The ISO-sponsored LMP energy markets
    consist of two separate and characteristically distinct
    settlement time-frames. The first time-frame is a financially
    firm, day-ahead unit commitment market. The second time-frame is
    a financially settled, real-time dispatch and balancing market.
    Prices paid in these LMP energy markets, however, are affected
    by, among other things, market mitigation measures, which can
    result in lower prices associated with certain generating units
    that are mitigated because they are deemed to have locational
    market power.

SOUTH
    CENTRAL

NRG is the third largest generator in the South Central region
    of the U.S. with generation assets within the control areas
    of the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council/Entergy, or
    SERC-Entergy, region. As of December 31, 2009, the
    Company’s generation assets in Louisiana consist of its
    primary asset, Big Cajun II, a coal-fired plant located near
    Baton Rouge, Louisiana which has approximately 1,495 MW of
    baseload capacity and 905 MW of intermediate and peaking
    assets. A significant portion of the region’s generation
    capacity has been sold to ten cooperatives within the region
    through 2026. From time to time, the Company may contract for
    intermediate generation capacity to support its load
    obligations. In addition, the region also operates 455 MW
    of peaking generation in Rockford, Illinois under the PJM region.

The South Central region lacks a regional transmission
    organization, or RTO, and, therefore, remains a bilateral
    market, which is not able to take advantage of the large scale
    economic dispatch of an ISO-administered energy market. NRG
    operates the LaGen Control Area which encompasses the generating
    facilities and the Company’s cooperative load. As a result,
    the LaGen control area is capable of providing control area
    services, in addition to wholesale power, that allows NRG to
    provide full requirement services to load-serving entities, thus
    making the LaGen Control Area a competitive alternative to the
    integrated utilities operating in the region.

Operating
    Strategy

The South Central region maximizes its strategic position as a
    significant coal-fired generator in a market that is highly
    dependent on natural gas for power generation. South Central
    also has long-term full service contracts with ten rural
    cooperatives serving load across Louisiana and makes incremental
    wholesale energy sales when its coal-fired capacity exceeds the
    cooperative contract requirements. The South Central region
    works to expand its customer base within and beyond Louisiana
    and works within the confines of the Entergy Transmission System
    to obtain paths for incremental sales as well as secure
    transmission service for long-term sales or expansions.

Big Cajun II —

NRG’s Big Cajun II
    plant is a coal-fired,

sub-critical

baseload plant located along the banks of the Mississippi River,
    near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. This plant includes three
    coal-fired generation units (Units 1, 2 and 3) with an
    aggregate generation capacity of 1,745 MW. The plant uses
    coal supplied from the Powder River Basin and was commissioned
    between 1981 and 1983. NRG owns 100% of Units 1 and 2 and a 58%
    undivided interest in Unit 3 for an aggregate owned capacity of
    1,495 MW of the plant. All three units have been upgraded
    with advanced
    low-NO

x

burners and overfire air systems.

Market
    Framework

NRG’s assets in the South Central region are located within
    the franchise territories of vertically integrated utilities,
    primarily Entergy Corp., or Entergy. In the South Central
    region, all power sales and purchases are consummated
    bilaterally between individual counterparties. Transacting
    counterparties are required to procure transmission service from
    the relevant transmission owners at their FERC-approved tariff
    rates.

As of December 31, 2009, NRG had long-term all-requirements
    contracts with ten Louisiana distribution cooperatives with
    initial terms ranging from ten to twenty-five years. Of the ten
    contracts, seven expire in 2025 and account for 50% of the
    contract load, while the remaining three expire in 2014 and
    comprise 40% of contract load. In addition to earning energy
    revenues from these cooperative agreements, NRG also earns
    capacity revenues which are tied to summer peak demand as well
    as provide a mechanism for recovering a portion of the costs for
    mandated environmental projects over the remaining life of the
    contract. During 2009, NRG successfully executed
    all-requirements contracts with three Arkansas municipalities
    with service start dates as early as mid-year 2010. These new
    contracts account for over 500 MW of total load obligations
    for NRG and the South Central region, more than offsetting the
    South Central region’s reduction in load in 2009 due to the
    expiration of a Louisiana distribution cooperative contract. In
    addition, NRG also has certain long-term contracts with the
    Municipal Energy Agency of Mississippi, Mississippi Delta Energy
    Agency, South Mississippi Electric Power Association, and
    Southwestern Electric Power Company, which collectively
    comprised an additional 10% of the region’s contract load
    requirement.

During limited peak demand periods, the load requirements of
    these contract customers exceed the baseload capacity of
    NRG’s coal-fired Big Cajun II plant. During such peak
    demand periods, NRG either employs its owned or leased gas-fired
    assets or purchases power from external sources, depending upon
    the then-current gas commodity pricing, and these purchases can
    be at higher prices than can be recovered under the
    Company’s contracts. NRG has to date successfully mitigated
    the risk of these peak contract load requirements by contracting
    for new large industrial or municipal loads outside contract
    pricing at market rates. Also, to minimize this risk during the
    peak summer and winter seasons, the Company has been successful
    in entering into structured agreements to reduce or eliminate
    the need for spot market purchases.


WEST

NRG’s generation assets in the West region of the
    U.S. are primarily located in the California Independent
    System Operator, or CAISO, control area. The West region’s
    generation assets currently consists of the Long Beach
    Generating Station, the El Segundo Generating Station, the
    Encina Generating Station and Cabrillo II, which consists of 12
    combustion turbines located in San Diego County. The
    Company’s generation assets in the West region are
    predominately intermediate and peaking duty natural gas-fired
    plants located in southern California. In addition, the region
    owns a 50% interest in the Saguaro power plant which is a
    90 MW baseload, gas-fired plant located in Nevada and a
    20 MW photovoltaic solar facility located in southern
    California.

Operating
    Strategy

NRG’s West region strategy is focused on maximizing the
    cash flow and value associated with its generating plants and
    the development of renewable and repowering projects that
    leverage off of existing capabilities, assets and sites, as well
    as the preservation and ultimate realization of the commercial
    value of the underlying real estate. There are four principal
    components to this strategy: (i) capturing the value of the
    portfolio’s generation assets through a combination of
    forward contracts and market sales of capacity, energy, and
    ancillary services; (ii) leveraging existing site control
    and emission allowances to permit new, more efficient generating
    units at existing sites; (iii) developing renewable project
    opportunities that are positioned to compete for long-term
    contracts offered by load serving entities; and
    (iv) optimizing the value of the region’s coastal
    property for other purposes.

The Company’s Encina Generating Station has sold all energy
    and capacity, 965 MW in the aggregate, to a load-serving
    entity through 2010, on a tolling basis, and recovers its
    operating costs plus a capacity payment. For calendar year 2009,
    El Segundo station entered into 548 MWs of RA capacity
    contracts and placed the capacity in the market through a
    portfolio of forward contracts. For calendar year 2010, El
    Segundo station entered into 335 MWs of RA capacity
    contracts and retained its rights to sell energy and ancillary
    services into the market. Cabrillo II sold 188 MW of
    RA capacity for calendar year 2009 and 2010, and 88 MW for
    the period January 1, 2011 through November 30, 2013.
    Units with RA contracts also sell into energy and ancillary
    services markets consistent with unit availability.

The Saguaro power plant is located in Henderson, Nevada, and is
    contracted to NV Energy (formerly Nevada Power) and two steam
    hosts. The Saguaro plant is contracted to NV Energy through
    2022, one steam host, Olin (formerly known as Pioneer), whose
    contract was extended in 2009 for an additional two years, and a
    steam off-taker, Ocean Spray, whose contract runs through 2015.
    Saguaro Power Company, LP, the project company, procures fuel in
    the open market. NRG manages its share of any fuel price risk
    through NRG’s commodity price risk strategy.

On November 20, 2009, NRG, through its wholly owned
    subsidiary NRG Solar LLC, acquired Blythe Solar from First
    Solar, Inc. On December 18, 2009, construction was
    completed and commercial operation began for the 20 MW
    utility-scale photovoltaic, or PV, solar facility located in
    Riverside County in southeastern California. The Blythe Solar PV
    field will provide electricity to Southern California Edison, or
    SCE, under a

20-year

Power Purchase Agreement, or PPA. First Solar will operate and
    maintain the solar facility under contract.

The following are descriptions of the Company’s most
    significant revenue generating plants in the West region:

Encina —

The Encina Station is located in
    Carlsbad, California and has a combined generating capacity of
    965 MW from five fossil-fuel steam-electric generating
    units and one combustion turbine. The five fossil-fuel
    steam-electric units provide intermediate load services and use
    natural gas. Also located at the Encina Station is a combustion
    turbine that provides peaking and black-start services of
    15 MW. Units 1, 2 and 3 each have a generation capacity of
    approximately 107 MW and were installed in 1954, 1956 and
    1958, respectively. Units 4 and 5 have a generation capacity of
    approximately 300 MW and 330 MW respectively, and were
    installed in 1973 and 1978. The combustion turbine was installed
    in 1966. Low
    NO

x

burner modifications and Selective Catalytic Reduction, or SCR,
    equipment have been installed on all the steam units.

El Segundo —

The El Segundo plant is located in
    El Segundo, California and produces an aggregate generation
    capacity of 670 MW from two gas-fired intermediate load
    units (Units 3 and 4). These units, which have a generation
    capacity of 335 MW each, were installed in 1964 and 1965,
    respectively. SCR equipment has been installed on Units 3 and 4.

Long Beach —

On August 1, 2007, the
    Company successfully completed and commissioned the repowering
    of 260 MW of gas-fired generating capacity at its Long
    Beach Generating Station. Generation from Long Beach provides
    needed support for the summer peak and during transmission
    contingencies to load serving entities and the CAISO. This
    project is backed by a

10-year

PPA
    executed with SCE in November 2006 and effective through
    July 31, 2017. The new generation consists of refurbished
    gas turbines with SCR equipment.

Cabrillo II —

Cabrillo II consists of 12
    combustion turbines located on 4 sites throughout San Diego
    County with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately
    190 MW. The combustion turbines were installed between 1968
    and 1972 and are operated under a license agreement with
    SDG&E through 2013. The combustion turbines provide peaking
    services and serve a reliability function for the CAISO.

Blythe Solar —

Blythe Solar consists of a
    20 MW utility-scale photovoltaic, or PV, solar facility
    located in Riverside County in southeastern California. The site
    uses approximately 350,000 photovoltaic solar modules that turn
    sunlight directly into electricity. The Blythe Solar site covers
    approximately 200 acres. The output of the facility is
    fully contracted to SCE under a

20-year

PPA.

Market
    Framework

Except for the Saguaro facility, NRG’s generation assets in
    the West region operate within the balancing authority of CAISO.
    CAISO’s current market allows NRG’s CAISO assets to
    serve multiple load serving entities, or LSEs, and operates a
    nodal balancing market and congestion clearing mechanism. CAISO
    also has a locational capacity requirement, which requires LSEs
    to procure a significant portion of load from defined local
    reliability areas. All of NRG’s CAISO assets are in the Los
    Angeles or San Diego local reliability areas. CAISO’s
    new market,


known as Market Redesign and Technology Upgrade, or MRTU, became
    operational on April 1, 2009. MRTU established a day-ahead
    market for energy and ancillary services and settles prices
    locationally. NRG’s CAISO assets are all peaking and
    intermediate in nature and are well positioned to capitalize on
    the higher locational prices that may result from LMPs in
    location constrained areas and will continue to satisfy local
    distribution company capacity requirements. Longer term,
    NRG’s California portfolio’s locational advantage may
    be impacted by new transmission, which may affect load pocket
    procurement requirements. So far, however, the impacts of
    increasing demand and need for flexible cycling capability
    combined with delays in the online date of new transmission have
    muted the impact of this long-term threat.

California’s resource mix will be significantly shaped in
    the years ahead by California’s renewable portfolio
    standard and its greenhouse gas reduction rules promulgated
    pursuant to Assembly Bill 32 — California Global
    Warming Solutions Act of 2006, or AB32. In particular, the
    state’s renewable portfolio standard is currently set at
    20% for 2010 and the Governor, by Executive Order, has directed
    that the standard be increased to 33% by 2020. This increase is
    expected to create greater demand for low emission resources.
    The intermittent and remote nature of most renewable resources
    will create a strong demand for flexible load pocket resources.
    NRG’s California portfolio may also be impacted by
    legislation and by any mechanism, such as

cap-and-trade,

that places a price on incremental carbon emissions. NRG’s
    expectation is that the emission costs will be reflected in the
    market price of power and that the net cost to the
    Company’s existing portfolio of intermediate and peaking
    resources will be manageable.

California’s investor-owned utilities are sponsoring
    competitive solicitations for new fossil and renewable
    generating capacity. The El Segundo repowering project has been
    selected and contracted by a load-serving entity and is in the
    final stages of permitting. The project is planned to be in
    operation in the summer of 2013. A permit application for the
    Encina repowering project has been submitted and is under
    evaluation by the California Energy Commission. The Encina
    repowering project has cost and location advantages that enhance
    its competitive prospects. Both projects are supported by air
    emissions credits that have been banked after the retirement of
    older generating units.

INTERNATIONAL

As of December 31, 2009, NRG, through certain foreign
    subsidiaries, had investments in power generation projects
    located in Australia and Germany with approximately
    1,005 MW of generation capacity. The Company’s
    strategy is to maximize its return on investment and concentrate
    on contract management; monitoring of its facility operators to
    ensure safe, profitable and sustainable operations; management
    of cash flow and finances; and growth of its businesses through
    investments in projects related to current businesses.

NRG’s international power generation assets as of
    December 31, 2009, are summarized in the table below:

— Through a joint venture, NRG holds
    a 37.5% equity interest in the Gladstone power station, or
    Gladstone. A wholly owned subsidiary, NRG Gladstone Operating
    Services, serves as the station’s sole operator. Because
    NRG is neither the majority owner nor the joint venture manager,
    NRG does not have unilateral control over the operation,
    maintenance, and management of this asset. Gladstone
    station’s output is fully contracted through 2029 to Boyne
    Smelter Limited and Stanwell Corporation Limited. Boyne Smelter
    is owned by a consortium whose members include all the members
    of the Gladstone joint venture other than NRG. Its business is
    to refine alumina into aluminum. Stanwell is a state owned
    corporation that generates power, purchases power from other
    generators such as Gladstone, trades power in the Australian
    National Electricity Market and delivers power to retail
    customers.


Germany —

NRG, through its wholly-owned
    subsidiary Saale Energie GmbH, or SEG, owns 400 MW of the
    Schkopau plant’s electric capacity which is sold under a
    long-term contract to Vattenfall Europe Generation, AG. The
    900 MW Schkopau generating plant, in which the Company has
    a 41.9% equity interest, is fueled with lignite.

On June 10, 2009, NRG completed the sale of its 50%
    ownership interest in Mitteldeutsche Braunkohlengesellschaft
    mbH, or MIBRAG, to a consortium of Severoćeské doly
    Chomutov, a member of the CEZ Group, and J&T Group. Mibrag
    B.V.’s principal holding is MIBRAG, which is jointly owned
    by NRG and URS Corporation. For further discussion of
    MIBRAG disposition, see Item 14 — Note 4,

Discontinued Operation and Dispositions,

    Consolidated Financial Statements.

THERMAL

Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NRG Thermal LLC, or NRG
    Thermal, the Company owns thermal and chilled water businesses
    that have a steam and chilled water capacity of approximately
    1,020 megawatts thermal equivalent, or MWt. As of
    December 31, 2009, NRG Thermal provided steam heating to
    approximately 495 customers and chilled water to 100 customers
    in five different cities in the U.S. The Company’s
    thermal businesses in Pittsburgh, Harrisburg and
    San Francisco are regulated by their respective
    state’s Public Utility Commission. The other thermal
    businesses are subject to contract terms with their customers.
    In addition, NRG Thermal owns and operates a thermal project
    that serves two industrial customers with high-pressure steam.
    NRG Thermal also owns an 88 MW combustion turbine peaking
    generation facility and a 16 MW coal-fired cogeneration
    facility in Dover, Delaware as well as a 12 MW gas-fired
    project in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Approximately 37% of NRG
    Thermal’s revenues are derived from its district heating
    and chilled water business in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

FOR

NRG
    Update

Beginning in January 2009, the Company transitioned to

FOR

NRG 2.0 to target an incremental 100 basis point
    improvement to the Company’s ROIC by 2012. The initial
    targets for

FOR

NRG 2.0 were based upon improvements in
    the Company’s ROIC as measured by increased cash flow. The
    economic goals of

FOR

NRG 2.0 will focus on:
    (i) revenue enhancement; (ii) cost savings; and
    (iii) asset optimization, including reducing excess working
    capital and other assets. The

FOR

NRG 2.0 program will
    measure its progress towards the

FOR

NRG 2.0 goals by
    using the Company’s 2008 financial results as a baseline,
    while plant performance calculations will be based upon the
    appropriate historic baselines.

The 2009

FOR

NRG goal was a 20 basis point
    improvement in ROIC which corresponds to approximately
    $30 million in cash flow. As of December 31, 2009, the
    Company exceeded its 2009 goal with a 50.37 basis point
    improvement in ROIC, which is equivalent to approximately
    $76 million in cash flows. The performance of the plants
    coupled with strategic projects undertaken by corporate
    functions is evidenced in the overall corporate


performance. During 2010, the Company expects to progress
    further toward the program goal of 100 basis point ROIC
    improvement by 2012.

Repowering

NRG
    Update

NRG has several projects in varying stages of development that
    include the following: a new generating unit at the Limestone
    power station and the repowering of Encina and El Segundo sites.
    In addition, on December 22, 2009, NRG entered into a

13-year

agreement with University Medical Center of Princeton to provide
    comprehensive high efficiency energy to this 237 room hospital.
    The hospital, which is currently under construction, will use
    electricity from an NRG owned combined heat and power system
    that includes the production of steam for heating and chilled
    water for air conditioning, achieved by means of a thermal
    energy storage system. Construction of the facility will
    commence in early 2010 with expected commercial operation by the
    first quarter 2012. The development of these projects is subject
    to certain conditions and milestones which may effect the
    Company’s decision to pursue further development of these
    projects. The Company’s development projects are generally
    subject to certain conditions, milestones, or other factors that
    may result in the Company’s decision to no longer pursue
    development of these projects.

The following is a summary of the 2009 repowering projects that
    have been completed and operating as well as those still under
    construction. In addition, NRG continues to participate in
    active bids in response to requests for proposals in markets in
    which it operates.

Cedar Bayou Generating Station

—

On June 24, 2009, NRG and Optim
    Energy, LLC, or Optim Energy, completed construction and began
    commercial operation of a new natural gas-fueled combined cycle
    generating plant at NRG’s Cedar Bayou Generating Station in
    Chambers County, Texas. NRG and Optim Energy have a

50/50 undivided

interest basis in the 520 MW generating plant. NRG is the
    operator of the plant and Optim Energy is acting as energy
    manager for Cedar Bayou unit 4. Cedar Bayou unit 4 is providing
    the Company a net capacity of 260 MW given NRG’s 50%
    ownership.

GenConn Energy LLC

—

In a
    procurement process conducted by the Department of Public
    Utility Control, or DPUC, and finalized in 2008, GenConn Energy,
    or GenConn, a


/


joint venture of NRG and The United Illuminating Company,
    secured contracts in 2008 with Connecticut Light &
    Power, or CL&P, for the construction and operation of two
    200 MW peaking facilities, at NRG’s Devon and
    Middletown sites in Connecticut. The contracts, which are
    structured as contracts for differences for the operation of the
    new power plants, have a

30-year

term
    and call for commercial operation of the Devon project by
    June 1, 2010, and the Middletown project by June 1,
    2011. GenConn has secured all state permits required for the
    projects and has entered into contracts for engineering,
    construction and procurement of the eight GE LM6000 combustion
    turbines required for the projects. Construction has begun at
    the Devon facility while site demolition and excavation has
    begun at the Middletown location.

On April 27, 2009, GenConn closed on $534 million of
    project financing related to these projects. The project
    financing includes a seven-year project backed term loan and a
    five-year working capital facility which together total
    $291 million. In addition, NRG and United Illuminating have
    each closed an equity bridge loan of $121.5 million, which
    together total $243 million. NRG is funding its share of
    costs related to these projects via year to date draw downs on
    the equity bridge loan of $108 million as of
    December 31, 2009. In August 2009, GenConn began to draw on
    the project financing facility to cover costs related to the
    Devon project.

Retail
    Development

Electric Vehicle Services

—

In
    2009, NRG began development of a service business to support the
    mass deployment of electric vehicles through its subsidiary
    Reliant Energy. In 2010, Reliant Energy plans to begin selling
    new products and services that enable both public and home
    charging of electric vehicles. In conjunction with this effort,
    Reliant Energy announced in November 2009 that it will work with
    Nissan Motor Co. to make the City of Houston a launch city for
    the broader use of electric vehicles. Also in November 2009,
    Reliant Energy announced a


joint project with the City of Houston to add plug-in fleet
    vehicles as well as public charging stations to support them.

Smart Energy

—

In 2009, Reliant
    Energy submitted an application to the Department of Energy, or
    DOE, requesting $20 million in the Smart Grid Investment
    Grant funds for a three-year project to bring a suite of Smart
    Grid enabled products to residential customers. Reliant
    Energy’s project was selected by the DOE in October 2009.
    The Company is now in the process of negotiating a definitive
    agreement with the DOE and expects to begin the project in the
    first quarter 2010. Reliant Energy’s share of the project
    costs are expected to be $45.5 million over a three-year
    period.

Capital
    Allocation Program

NRG’s capital allocation philosophy includes reinvestment
    in its core facilities, maintenance of prudent debt levels and
    interest coverage, the regular return of capital to shareholders
    and investment in repowering opportunities. Each of these
    components are described further as follows:

•

Reinvestment in existing assets — Opportunities to
    invest in the existing business, including maintenance and
    environmental capital expenditures that improve operational
    performance, ensure compliance with environmental laws and
    regulations, and expansion projects.

•

Management of debt levels — The Company uses several
    metrics to measure the efficiency of its capital structure and
    debt balances, including the Company’s targeted net debt to
    total capital ratio range of 45% to 60% and certain cash flow
    and interest coverage ratios. The Company intends in the normal
    course of business to continue to manage its debt levels towards
    the lower end of the range and may, from time to time, pay down
    its debt balances for a variety of reasons.

•

Return of capital to shareholders — The Company’s
    debt instruments include restrictions on the amount of capital
    that can be returned to shareholders. The Company has in the
    past returned capital to shareholders while maintaining
    compliance with existing debt agreements and indentures. The
    Company expects to regularly return capital to shareholders
    through opportunistic share repurchases, while exploring other
    prospects to increase its flexibility under restrictive debt
    covenants.

•

Repowering, econrg and new build opportunities — The
    Company intends to pursue repowering initiatives that enhance
    and diversify its portfolio and provide a targeted economic
    return to the Company.

Nuclear
    Development

Nuclear Innovation North America

— In
    2008, NRG formed Nuclear Innovation North America LLC, or NINA,
    an NRG subsidiary focused on marketing, siting, developing,
    financing and investing in new advanced design nuclear projects
    in select markets across North America, including the planned
    South Texas Projects Units 3 and 4, or STP Units 3 and 4. NINA
    is currently owned 88% by NRG and 12% by Toshiba American
    Nuclear Energy Corporation, or TANE, a wholly owned subsidiary
    of Toshiba Corporation.

Based on its current NRC schedule, the Company expects to
    achieve commercial operation for Unit 3 in 2016 and commercial
    operation for Unit 4 approximately 12 months thereafter.
    The total rated capacity of the new units, STP Units 3 and 4, is
    expected to equal or exceed 2,700 MW. NINA is in the
    process of assessing the potential for increasing the gross
    output of the units through an uprate amendment, shortly after
    receipt of the Combined Operating License, or COL. This would
    increase the rated gross output of the units to approximately
    3,000 MWs. The NRC licensing process also provides an
    opportunity for individuals to intervene in the COL application
    as an ordinary part of the COL application process. At this
    time, several individuals have elected to intervene in the COL
    proceedings and NINA is currently in the process of defending,
    addressing or eliminating, as appropriate, all open contentions
    by the interveners.

The DOE has confirmed that the STP Units 3 and 4 project is one
    of four projects selected for further due diligence and
    negotiation leading to a conditional commitment under the DOE
    loan guarantee program. NINA is currently in discussions with
    the DOE on the specific terms and amount to be loaned for the
    project. NRG believes DOE loan guarantee support is critical to
    new nuclear development projects. In addition to U.S. loan
    guarantees,


NINA is seeking to augment potential financial support from the
    DOE by actively pursuing additional loan guarantees through the
    Japanese government. The project is expected to have significant
    Japanese content.

In 2009, NINA executed an EPC agreement with TANE to build STP
    Units 3 and 4. The EPC agreement is structured so as to assure
    that the new plant is constructed on time, on budget and to
    exacting standards. There are three primary cost elements that
    make up the total cost of the STP Units 3 and 4. The largest is
    the EPC Cost, which is the cost the prime contractor will charge
    for the engineering, construction, procurement, and
    material/equipment of the STP Units 3 and 4. The second cost is
    what is referred to as Owners’ Cost, comprised of licensing
    fees, contingency, internal and agent resource costs, operations
    training, owner’s engineers and other third party support
    costs. The final cost component is the Financing Cost, which
    includes subsidy costs of the DOE loan guarantee, interest
    during construction, and support services associated with
    putting the financing in place.

On December 30, 2009, NINA had received an estimate from
    TANE, the prime contractor, containing the overnight estimate of
    the EPC Cost. The estimate was approximately $11.5 billion
    for STP Units 3 and 4 with an opportunity to reduce cost subject
    to certain specification changes. Based on the estimate provided
    by TANE and the Company’s internal assessments, NINA
    continues to believe that its stated target of
    $9.8 billion, or $3,229/kW based on 3,000 MW gross
    output is achievable. Cost reductions will be achieved through a
    combination of specification changes and the re-alignment of
    risks and responsibilities among key project stakeholders.

Owners’ Costs for the project, on an escalated basis, are
    estimated to total approximately $2.1 billion during the
    construction period. This is primarily comprised of the costs
    for NRG’s agent STPNOC, owners’ contingency and the
    initial fuel load. Financing Costs are estimated to be
    approximately $1.5 billion during the construction period,
    and are comprised of the variables described above.

On February 17, 2010, an agreement in principle was reached
    with CPS for NINA to acquire a controlling interest in the
    project to construct STP Units 3 and 4 through a settlement of
    the litigation between the parties. As part of the agreement,
    NINA would increase its ownership in the STP Units 3 and 4
    project from 50% to 92.375% and would assume full management
    control of the project. NINA would also pay $80 million to
    CPS, subject to receipt of a conditional DOE loan guarantee. The
    first $40 million would be promptly paid after receipt of
    the guarantee and the other half six months later. An additional
    $10 million would be donated by NRG over four years in
    annual payments of $2.5 million to the Residential Energy
    Assistance Partnership in San Antonio. As part of the
    agreement with CPS, all litigation would be dismissed with
    prejudice. The parties continue to negotiate terms regarding
    final documentation of the agreement in principle.

The agreement would enable the STP Unit 3 and 4 project
    expansion to move forward and allow NINA to continuing pursuing
    its application for a conditional loan guarantee from the DOE.
    If NINA is not successful in reaching a final settlement with
    CPS, obtaining a conditional loan guarantee or selling down its
    interest in STP Units 3 and 4, there could be negative
    implications for the project that may result in a reassessment
    of the probability of success of the project and an impairment
    of the value of the capitalized assets for STP Units 3 and 4. An
    impairment would result in a permanent write-down of the
    $299 million of construction-in-progress capitalized
    through December 31, 2009, plus any amounts capitalized
    through the impairment date.

Renewable
    Development

NRG has routinely invested in the development of renewable
    energy projects such as wind, solar and biomass, to support the
    Company’s econrg initiative. NRG’s renewable strategy
    is to capitalize on both first mover advantages and the
    Company’s inherent regional presence. The following are the
    renewable development projects that Company is actively engaged
    in:

Solar
    Development

NRG intends to leverage its market knowledge, functional
    expertise, cash position and tax appetite to be the leading
    developer and owner of assets in the high growth solar power
    industry. The Company intends to align itself with technology
    providers who it believes are or will be the leading
    technologies in the industry. These strategic relationships will
    exist with photovoltaic, or PV, concentrated solar power, or
    CSP, Sterling Dish, and storage technologies. NRG will focus on
    projects that are supported by long term off-take agreements and
    have the ability to


secure either commercial bank or DOE funding to maximize equity
    returns. In 2009, NRG completed the following activities:

Acquisition and completion of Blythe
    Solar

— On November 20, 2009, NRG,
    through its wholly-owned subsidiary NRG Solar LLC, acquired FSE
    Blythe 1, LLC, or Blythe Solar, from First Solar, Inc. On
    December 18, 2009, construction was completed and
    commercial operation began for the 20 MW utility-scale PV
    solar facility located in Riverside County in southeastern
    California. The Blythe Solar PV field provides electricity to
    Southern California Edison, or SCE, under a

20-year

PPA.
    The site uses approximately 350,000 photovoltaic solar modules
    that turn sunlight directly into electricity. The Blythe Solar
    site covers approximately 200 acres of held land which is
    fully permitted and is connected to SCE’s electrical
    distribution grid. The project is eligible for a cash grant from
    the Department of Treasury and NRG will file an application for
    an $18 million grant.

Agreement with eSolar

—

On
    June 1, 2009, NRG completed an agreement with eSolar, a
    leading provider of modular, scalable solar thermal power
    technology, to acquire the development rights for up to
    465 MW of solar thermal power plants at sites in California
    and the Southwest. The first plant is anticipated to begin
    producing electricity as early as 2011, subject to certain
    technology demonstration milestones being pursued by eSolar and
    a successful financial closing in 2010. At the closing with
    eSolar, NRG invested $5 million for an equity interest in
    eSolar and $5 million for deposits and land purchase
    options associated with development rights for three projects on
    sites in south central California and the Southwest U.S. as
    well as a portfolio of PPAs to develop, build, own and operate
    up to 10 eSolar modular solar generating units at these sites.
    These development assets will use eSolar’s CSP, technology
    to sell renewable electricity under contracted PPAs with local
    utilities.

NRG has three projects in various stages of development: NRG New
    Mexico SunTower, Alpine SunTower and Desert View SunTower. While
    each of these projects has an anticipated commercial operation
    date, the development of these projects are subject to certain
    conditions and milestones which may effect the Company’s
    decision to pursue further development of these projects.

Wind
    Development

NRG is an active participant in both onshore and offshore wind
    energy across its core regions. As part of this strategy, the
    Company actively engages in the development, acquisition,
    divestiture and establishment of joint ventures of wind
    projects. In the Northeast, there are strong offshore wind
    resources located near major load centers which can support
    projects of a size and scale larger than most on land wind and
    other renewable projects in the region. NRG looks to achieve a
    first-mover advantage in the U.S. offshore wind market through
    the development, construction and operation of projects in the
    region, as evidenced by the NRG’s acquisition of Bluewater
    Wind in the fourth quarter 2009. In 2009, NRG completed the
    following activities:

Bluewater Wind Acquisition

— On
    November 9, 2009, NRG through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
    NRG Bluewater Holdings LLC, completed the acquisition of a 100%
    interest in all the subsidiaries of Bluewater Wind LLC (such
    subsidiaries, with NRG Bluewater Holdings LLC, or NRG Bluewater)
    as part of the Company’s strategy to promote development of
    renewable energy projects in its core regions. NRG Bluewater
    currently has a number of offshore wind energy projects that are
    in various stages of development along the eastern seaboard and
    the Great Lakes region of the U.S. In Delaware, NRG
    Bluewater has a

25-year,

200 MW PPA with Delmarva Power & Light Company
    that has been approved by the Delaware Public Service Commission
    and other state agencies. On December 8, 2009, NRG
    Bluewater was also selected to finalize a power purchase
    agreement from the State of Maryland to provide up to 55 MW
    of wind generation from the Delaware project. In 2009, NRG
    Bluewater was awarded a $4 million rebate from the state of
    New Jersey to build a meteorological tower, which would collect
    wind and other data from a site off the coast of New Jersey.

Langford Wind Project

— On
    December 8, 2009, NRG announced the completion of its
    Langford project, a wholly-owned 150 MW wind farm located
    in Tom Green, Irion, and Schleicher Counties, Texas. The Company
    funded and developed this wind farm which consists of 100
    General Electric 1.5 MW wind turbines. The project is
    eligible for a cash grant from the Department of Treasury and
    NRG has filed an application for an $84 million grant.

Padoma Wind

— On January 11, 2010,
    NRG sold its terrestrial wind development company, Padoma Wind
    Power LLC, or Padoma, to Enel North America, Inc., or Enel. NRG
    acquired Padoma in 2006 to develop terrestrial


wind projects. NRG is maintaining its existing ownership
    interest in its three Texas wind farms — Sherbino,
    Elbow Creek and Langford. In addition, NRG will maintain a
    strategic partnership with Enel to evaluate potential
    opportunities in renewable energy. NRG will retain a Right of
    First Offer should Enel seek an equity partner in Padoma
    projects.

Biomass
    Development

NRG has several biomass projects in varying stages of
    development, including a pilot project at the Big Cajun II
    facility to be renewably fueled with switchgrass and
    high-biomass sorghum, as well as the retrofit a steam unit at
    Montville Station to enable the unit to use clean wood biomass
    to produce up to 40 MW of renewable energy.

Regulatory
    Matters

As operators of power plants and participants in wholesale
    energy markets, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation
    by various federal and state government agencies. These include
    the CFTC, FERC, NRC, PUCT and other public utility commissions
    in certain states where NRG’s generating or thermal assets
    are located. In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules,
    procedures and protocols of the various ISO markets in which it
    participates. Certain of the Reliant Energy entities are
    competitive Retail Electric Providers, or REPs, and as such are
    subject to the rules and regulations of the PUCT governing REPs.
    NRG must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements
    imposed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation,
    or NERC, and the regional reliability councils in the regions
    where the Company operates.

The operations of, and wholesale electric sales from, NRG’s
    Texas region are not subject to rate regulation by the FERC, as
    they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and
    not in interstate commerce. As discussed below, these operations
    are subject to regulation by PUCT, as well as to regulation by
    the NRC with respect to the Company’s ownership interest in
    STP.

Commodities
    Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC

The CFTC, among other things, has regulatory oversight authority
    over the trading of electricity and gas commodities, including
    financial products and derivatives, under the Commodity Exchange
    Act, or CEA. Specifically, under existing statutory authority,
    CFTC has the authority to commence enforcement actions and seek
    injunctive relief against any person, whenever that person
    appears to be engaged in the communication of false or
    misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market
    information or conditions that affected or tended to affect the
    price of natural gas, a commodity in interstate commerce, or
    actions intended to or attempting to manipulate commodity
    markets. The CFTC also has the authority to seek civil monetary
    penalties, as well as the ability to make referrals to the
    Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, in connection
    with any conduct that violates the CEA. Proposals are pending in
    Congress to expand CFTC oversight of the

over-the-counter

markets and bilateral financial transactions.

Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission

The FERC, among other things, regulates the transmission and the
    wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the
    authority of the Federal Power Act, or FPA. In addition, under
    existing regulations, the FERC determines whether an entity
    owning a generation facility is an Exempt Wholesale Generator,
    or EWG, as defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
    2005, or PUHCA of 2005. The FERC also determines whether a
    generation facility meets the ownership and technical criteria
    of a Qualifying Facility, or QF, under Public Utility Regulatory
    Policies Act of 1978, or PURPA. Each of NRG’s
    U.S. generating facilities has either been determined by
    the FERC to qualify as a QF, or the subsidiary owning the
    facility has been determined to be an EWG.

Federal Power Act —

The FPA gives the FERC
    exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over the wholesale sale of
    electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate
    commerce. Under the FPA, the FERC, with certain exceptions,
    regulates the owners of facilities used for the wholesale sale
    of electricity or transmission in interstate commerce as public
    utilities. The FPA also gives the FERC jurisdiction to review
    certain transactions and numerous other activities of public
    utilities. NRG’s QFs are currently exempt from the
    FERC’s rate regulation


under Sections 205 and 206 of the FPA to the extent that
    sales are made pursuant to a state regulatory authority’s
    implementation of PURPA.

Public utilities under the FPA are required to obtain the
    FERC’s acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA,
    of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity.
    All of NRG’s non-QF generating and power marketing
    companies in the U.S. make sales of electricity pursuant to
    market-based rates authorized by the FERC. The FERC’s
    orders that grant NRG’s generating and power marketing
    companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to
    revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently
    determines that NRG can exercise market power, create barriers
    to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In
    addition, NRG’s market-based sales are subject to certain
    market behavior rules and, if any of its generating or power
    marketing companies were deemed to have violated any one of
    those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of
    profits associated with the violation

and/or

suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority,
    as well as criminal and civil penalties. As a condition of the
    orders granting NRG market-based rate authority, NRG is required
    to file regional market updates demonstrating that it continues
    to meet the FERC’s standards with respect to generating
    market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether its
    entities qualify for market-based rates. NRG is also required to
    report to the FERC any material changes in status that would
    reflect a departure from the characteristics that the FERC
    relied upon when granting NRG’s various generating and
    power marketing companies market-based rates. If NRG’s
    generating and power marketing companies were to lose their
    market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to
    obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a

cost-of-service

rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting,
    record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on
    utilities with cost-based rate schedules.

On April 27, 2009 and July 21, 2009, FERC accepted the
    Company’s updated market power analyses for its Northeast
    and South Central assets, respectively. NRG’s next such
    market power update filing is due June 30, 2010, for its
    CAISO and southwest assets.

Section 203 of the FPA requires the FERC’s prior
    approval for the transfer of control of assets subject to the
    FERC’s jurisdiction. Section 204 of the FPA gives the
    FERC jurisdiction over a public utility’s issuance of
    securities or assumption of liabilities. However, the FERC
    typically grants blanket approval for future securities
    issuances and the assumption of liabilities to entities with
    market-based rate authority. In the event that one of NRG’s
    generating and power marketing companies were to lose its
    market-based rate authority, such company’s future
    securities issuances or assumption of liabilities could require
    prior approval from the FERC.

In compliance with Section 215 of the Energy Policy Act of
    2005, or EPAct of 2005, the FERC has approved the NERC as the
    national Energy Reliability Organization, or ERO. As the ERO,
    NERC is responsible for the development and enforcement of
    mandatory reliability standards for the wholesale electric power
    system. NRG is responsible for complying with the standards in
    the regions in which it operates. As the ERO, NERC has the
    ability to assess financial penalties for non-compliance. In
    addition to complying with NERC requirements, each NRG entity
    must comply with the requirements of the regional reliability
    entity for the region in which it is located.

Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 —

PUHCA of 2005 provides the FERC with certain authority over
    and access to books and records of public utility holding
    companies not otherwise exempt by virtue of their ownership of
    EWGs, QFs, and Foreign Utility Companies, or FUCOs. NRG is a
    public utility holding company, but because all of the
    Company’s generating facilities have QF status or are owned
    through EWGs, it is exempt from the accounting, record
    retention, and reporting requirements of the PUHCA of 2005.

Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act —

PURPA
    was passed in 1978 in large part to promote increased energy
    efficiency and development of independent power producers. PURPA
    created QFs to further both goals, and the FERC is primarily
    charged with administering PURPA as it applies to QFs. As
    discussed above, under current law, some categories of QFs may
    be exempt from regulation under the FPA as public utilities.
    PURPA incentives also initially included a requirement that
    utilities must buy and sell power to QFs. Among other things,
    EPAct of 2005 provides for the elimination of the obligation
    imposed on certain utilities to purchase power from QFs at an
    avoided cost rate under certain conditions. However, the
    purchase obligation is only eliminated if the FERC first finds
    that a QF has non-discriminatory access to wholesale energy
    markets having certain characteristics, including
    nondiscriminatory transmission and interconnection services
    provided by a regional transmission entity in certain
    circumstances. Existing contracts entered into under PURPA are
    not expected to be impacted. NRG


currently owns only one QF, Saguaro Power Company, a Limited
    Partnership, which is interconnected to and has a contract with
    Nevada Power Company. Nevada Power Company is not located in a
    region with an ISO market.

Nuclear
    Regulatory Commission, or NRC

The NRC is authorized under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
    amended, or the AEA, among other things, to grant licenses for,
    and regulate the operation of, commercial nuclear power
    reactors. As a holder of an ownership interest in STP, NRG is an
    NRC licensee and is subject to NRC regulation. The NRC license
    gives the Company the right to only possess an interest in STP
    but not to operate it. Operating authority under the NRC
    operating license for STP is held by STPNOC. NRC regulation
    involves licensing, inspection, enforcement, testing,
    evaluation, and modification of all aspects of plant design and
    operation including the right to order a plant shutdown,
    technical and financial qualifications, and decommissioning
    funding assurance in light of NRC safety and environmental
    requirements. In addition, NRC’s written approval is
    required prior to a licensee transferring an interest in its
    license, either directly or indirectly. As a possession-only
    licensee, i.e., non-operating co-owner, the NRC’s
    regulation of NRG is primarily focused on the Company’s
    ability to meet its financial and decommissioning funding
    assurance obligations. In connection with the NRC license, the
    Company and its subsidiaries have a support agreement to provide
    up to $120 million to support operations at STP.

Decommissioning Trusts

— Upon expiration of the
    operation licenses for the two generating units at STP,
    currently scheduled for 2027 and 2028, the co-owners of STP are
    required under federal law to decontaminate and decommission the
    STP facility. Under NRC regulations, a power reactor licensee
    generally must pre-fund the full amount of its estimated NRC
    decommissioning obligations unless it is a rate-regulated
    utility, or a state or municipal entity that sets its own rates,
    or has the benefit of a state-mandated non-bypassable charge
    available to periodically fund the decommissioning trust such
    that the trust, plus allowable earnings, will equal the
    estimated decommissioning obligations by the time the
    decommissioning is expected to begin.

As a result of the acquisition of Texas Genco, NRG, through its
    44% ownership interest, has become the beneficiary of
    decommissioning trusts that have been established to provide
    funding for decontamination and decommissioning of STP.
    CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, or CenterPoint, and
    American Electric Power, or AEP, collect, through rates or other
    authorized charges to their electric utility customers, amounts
    designated for funding NRG’s portion of the decommissioning
    of the facility. See also Item 14 — Note 7,

Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund,

to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

In the event that the funds from the trusts are ultimately
    determined to be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities,
    the original owners of the Company’s STP interests,
    CenterPoint and AEP, each will be required to collect, through
    their PUCT-authorized non-bypassable rates or other charges to
    customers, additional amounts required to fund NRG’s
    obligations relating to the decommissioning of the facility.
    Following the completion of the decommissioning, if surplus
    funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, those excesses will
    be refunded to the respective rate payers of CenterPoint or AEP,
    or their successors.

Public
    Utility Commission of Texas, or PUCT

NRG’s Texas generation subsidiaries are registered as power
    generation companies with the PUCT. The PUCT also has
    jurisdiction over power generation companies with regard to
    their sales in the wholesale markets, the implementation of
    measures to address undue market power or price volatility, and
    the administration of nuclear decommissioning trusts. The PUCT
    exercises its jurisdiction both directly, and indirectly,
    through its oversight of the ERCOT, the regional transmission
    organization. Certain of its subsidiaries within the Texas
    region are also subject to regulatory oversight as a power
    marketer or as a Qualified Scheduling Entity. NRG Power
    Marketing, LLC, or PMI, is registered as a power marketer with
    the PUCT and thus is also subject to the jurisdiction of the
    PUCT with respect to its sales in the ERCOT. Certain of the
    Reliant Energy entities are competitive Retail Electric
    Providers, or REPs, and as such are subject to the rules and
    regulations of the PUCT governing REPs.

Regional
    Regulatory Developments

In New England, New York, the Mid-Atlantic region, the Midwest
    and California, the FERC has approved regional transmission
    organizations, also commonly referred to as ISOs. Most of these
    ISOs administer a wholesale


centralized bid-based spot market in their regions pursuant to
    tariffs approved by the FERC and associated ISO market rules.
    These tariffs/market rules dictate how the capacity and energy
    markets operate, how market participants may make bilateral
    sales with one another, and how entities with market-based rates
    are compensated within those markets. The ISOs in these regions
    also control access to and the operation of the transmission
    grid within their regions. In Texas, pursuant to a 1999
    restructuring statute, the PUCT granted similar responsibilities
    to the ERCOT.

NRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO
    regions. The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power
    markets have in the past imposed, and may in the future continue
    to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms to address
    market power or volatility in these markets. These types of
    price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may adversely
    affect the profitability of NRG’s generation facilities
    that sell capacity and energy into the wholesale power markets.
    In addition, new approaches to the sale of electric power are
    being implemented, and it is not clear whether they will operate
    effectively or whether they will provide adequate compensation
    to generators over the long-term.

For further discussion on regulatory developments see
    Item 14 — Note 23,

Regulatory
    Matters,

to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Texas
    Region

The ERCOT has adopted “Texas Nodal Protocols” that
    will revise the wholesale market design to incorporate
    locational marginal pricing (in place of the current ERCOT zonal
    market). Major elements of the Texas Nodal Protocols include the
    continued capability for bilateral contracting of energy and
    ancillary services, a financially binding day-ahead market,
    resource-specific energy and ancillary service offer curves, the
    direct assignment of all congestion rents, nodal energy prices
    for resources, aggregation of nodal to zonal energy prices for
    loads, congestion revenue rights (including pre-assignment for
    public power entities), and pricing safeguards. The PUCT
    approved the Texas Nodal Protocols on April 5, 2006, and
    full implementation of the new market design was scheduled to
    begin in 2008. On May 20, 2008, the ERCOT announced that it
    would delay the implementation of the Texas Nodal Protocols, and
    is now targeting a December 2010 implementation.

On October 6, 2008, as part of its determination of
    Competitive Renewable Energy Zones, or CREZ, the PUCT issued its
    final order approving a significant transmission expansion plan
    to provide for the delivery of approximately 18,500 MW of
    energy from the western region of Texas, primarily wind
    generation. The transmission expansion plan is composed of
    approximately 2,300 miles of new 345 kV lines and
    42 miles of new 138 kV lines. In January 2009, Texas
    Industrial Energy Consumers, a trade organization composed of
    large industrial customers, appealed the PUCT’s CREZ plan
    in state district court, seeking reversal of the final order. On
    March 30, 2009, the PUCT issued a final order designating
    the transmission utilities that plan to construct the various
    CREZ transmission component projects. A large number of separate
    transmission licensing proceedings will be required prior to
    construction of the CREZ facilities. In July of 2009, the PUCT
    approved schedules for utilities to file applications to license
    several of the CREZ transmission projects (to obtain
    certificates of convenience and necessity, or CCNs). If the CREZ
    projects are completed as currently anticipated, the
    transmission upgrades and associated wind generation could
    impact wholesale energy and ancillary service prices in ERCOT.
    There are various appeals and other challenges to CREZ that
    could disrupt or delay the schedule. As part of the normal ERCOT
    five-year planning process, transmission utilities are also
    planning other system improvements, 2,800 circuit miles of
    transmission and more than 17,000 MVA of autotransformer
    capacity, intended to support increasing power demand and to
    address transmission congestion in the ERCOT Region.

Northeast
    Region

New England —

NRG’s Middletown, Montville
    and Norwalk facilities continue to be operated pursuant to RMR
    agreements. Unless terminated earlier, these RMR agreements will
    terminate upon the commencement of the FCM on June 1, 2010.

New York —

The state-wide Installed Reserve
    Margin, or IRM, is set annually by the New York State
    Reliability Council, or NYSRC, and affects the overall demand
    for capacity in the New York market. The NYSRC approved a 2010
    IRM of 18%, which is an increase of 1.5% from the 2009
    requirement. This increase may be offset


by lower load forecasts for 2010. On January 29, 2008, the
    FERC accepted the NYISO’s installed capacity demand curves
    for 2008/2009, 2009/2010, and 2010/2011. The demand curves are a
    critical determinant of capacity market prices. Of particular
    note to the New York City capacity market, New York Power
    Authority, or NYPA, retired its 885 MW Poletti facility on
    January 31, 2010.

West
    Region

California

— The CAISO MRTU commenced
    April 1, 2009.  Significant components of the
    MRTU include: (i) locational marginal pricing of energy;
    (ii) a more effective congestion management system;
    (iii) a day-ahead market; and (iv) an increase to the
    existing bid caps. NRG considers these market reforms to
    generally be a positive development for its assets in the
    region, but additional time is needed to assess the impact of
    MRTU.

Environmental
    Matters

NRG is subject to a wide range of environmental regulations
    across a broad number of jurisdictions in the development,
    ownership, construction and operation of domestic and
    international projects. These laws and regulations generally
    require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained
    before construction and during operation of power plants.
    Environmental laws have become increasingly stringent in recent
    years, especially around the regulation of air emissions from
    power generators. Such laws generally require regular capital
    expenditures for power plant upgrades, modifications and the
    installation of certain pollution control equipment. In general,
    future laws and regulations are expected to require the addition
    of emission controls or other environmental quality equipment or
    the imposition of certain restrictions on the operations of the
    Company’s facilities. NRG expects that future liability
    under, or compliance with, environmental requirements could have
    a material effect on the Company’s operations or
    competitive position.

Federal
    Environmental Initiatives

Climate Change

— The United States
    signed the Copenhagen Accord, or the Accord, which sets the
    stage for a worldwide approach to this global issue. Under the
    Accord, the U.S. has committed to a 17% reduction from 2005
    emission levels of GHGs by 2020. While Congress was unable to
    come to agreement on climate legislation in 2009, the subject
    continues to be a topic for consideration in 2010. Lack of
    legislation will prolong the uncertainty associated with the
    nature and timing of GHG requirements, and therefore impact on
    NRG.

On December 15, 2009, the U.S. EPA issued a final rule
    finding that a mix of six key GHGs in the atmosphere, carbon
    dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons,
    perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride, threaten the public
    health and welfare. This action paves the way for finalization
    of the September 28, 2009,

Proposed GHG Emissions
    Standards for Motor Vehicles

. These actions are in response
    to the Supreme Court’s decision in

Massachusetts v.
    U.S. EPA

, which requires the U.S. EPA to decide
    under the Clean Air Act’s, or CAA, mobile source title
    whether GHGs contribute to climate change, and if so, promulgate
    appropriate regulations. Under the CAA, these regulations would
    render GHGs regulated pollutants and subject them to other
    existing requirements that affect stationary sources, including
    power plants. The primary impact on NRG would be a statutory
    requirement to install Best Available Control Technology, or
    BACT, determined on a

case-by-case

basis, for major modifications or improvements at power plants
    if they cause GHG emissions to increase by the statutory
    Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD limits of 100
    tons per year. The U.S. EPA also released, on
    September 30, 2009, a draft PSD tailoring rule for GHGs
    that would increase the major stationary source threshold of
    25,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide equivalents. This
    threshold level would be used to determine (i) if an
    existing source would be required to obtain a Title V
    operating permit and (ii) if a new facility or a major
    modification at an existing facility would trigger PSD
    permitting requirements. Existing major sources making
    modifications that result in an increase of emissions above the
    significance level would be required to obtain a PSD permit and
    install BACT. The timing and implementation of the final motor
    vehicle rule, acceptance of the PSD tailoring rule and
    U.S. EPA’s approach to BACT for GHGs could affect the
    level of impact to NRG’s plants, and future repowering
    projects that have not completed their permitting process.

In 2009, in the course of producing approximately
    71 million MWh of electricity, NRG’s power plants
    emitted 59 million tonnes of
    CO


,
    of which 53 million tonnes were emitted in the U.S.,
    3 million tonnes in Germany and


3 million tonnes in Australia. The impact from legislation
    or federal, regional or state regulation of GHGs on the
    Company’s financial performance will depend on a number of
    factors, including the overall level of GHG reductions required
    under any such regulations, the price and availability of
    offsets, and the extent to which NRG would be entitled to
    receive
    CO


emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an
    auction or on the open market. Thereafter, under any such
    legislation or regulation, the impact on NRG would depend on the
    Company’s level of success in developing and deploying low
    and no carbon technologies such as those being pursued as part
    of

Repowering

NRG. Additionally, NRG’s current
    contracts with its South Central region’s cooperative
    customers allows for the recovery of emission-based costs.

Regulations

— A number of regulations
    are under review by U.S. EPA including CAIR, MACT, National
    Ambient Air Quality Standards, or NAAQS, for ozone, nitrogen
    dioxide,
    SO


,
    small particle matter or
    PM

2.5

,
    and the Phase II 316(b) Rule. These rules address air
    emissions and best practices for units with
    once-through-cooling. In addition, the U.S. EPA has
    announced that it is considering new rules regarding the
    handling and disposition of coal combustion byproducts. While
    the Company cannot predict the requirements in the final
    versions nor the ultimate effect that the changing regulations
    will have on NRG’s business, NRG’s planned
    environmental capital expenditures include installation of
    particulate,
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury controls to comply with federal and state air
    quality rules and consent orders, as well as installation of
    “Best Technology Available”, or BTA, under
    Phase II 316(b) Rule. NRG continues to explore
    cost-effective alternatives that can achieve desired results.
    This planned investment reflects anticipated schedules and
    controls related to CAIR, MACT for mercury, and the
    Phase II 316(b) Rule which are under remand to the
    U.S. EPA and, as such, the full impact on the scope and
    timing of environmental retrofits from any new or revised
    regulations cannot be determined at this time.

    timing and substantive provisions of any ensuing revised or
    replacement regulations or legislation may alter the composition

and/or

rate
    of spending for environmental retrofits at the Company’s
    facilities.

In a ruling on December 22, 2006, the U.S. Court of
    Appeals for the District of Columbia, or D.C. Circuit,
    overturned portions of the U.S. EPA’s Phase I
    implementation rule for the new

eight-hour

ozone standard. Specifically, the D.C. Circuit ruled that the
    U.S. EPA could revoke the

one-hour

standard as long as there was no backsliding from more stringent
    control measures. This ruling could result in the imposition of
    fees under Section 185 of the CAA on volatile organic
    carbon, or VOC, and
    NO

x

emissions in severe non-attainment areas. The fees could be as
    high as $7,700/ton for emissions above 80% of baseline emissions
    levels. Depending on the determination of baseline emission
    levels, this could materially impact NRG’s operations in
    Los Angeles, New York City Area and Houston.

The U.S. EPA strengthened the primary and secondary ground
    level ozone NAAQS, (eight hour average) from 0.08 ppm to
    0.075 ppm on March 12, 2008. The U.S. EPA plans
    to finalize ozone non-attainment regions by March 2010 and
    states would likely submit plans to come into attainment by
    2013. The Company is unable to predict with certainty the impact
    of the states’ future recommendations on NRG’s
    operations.

In the 1990s, the U.S. EPA commenced an industry-wide
    investigation of coal-fired electric generators to determine
    compliance with environmental requirements under the CAA
    associated with repairs, maintenance, modifications and
    operational changes made to facilities over the years. As a
    result, the U.S. EPA and several states filed suits against
    a number of coal-fired power plants in mid-western and southern
    states alleging violations of the CAA, NSR, and, PSD
    requirements. The U.S. EPA previously issued two Notices of
    Violation, or NOV, against NRG’s Big Cajun II plant
    alleging that NRG’s predecessors had undertaken projects
    that triggered requirements under the PSD program, including the
    installation of emission controls. NRG has evaluated the claims
    and believes


they have no merit. Further discussion on this matter can be
    found in Item 14 — Note 22,

Water

— In July 2004, the U.S. EPA
    published rules governing cooling water intake structures at
    existing power facilities commonly referred to as the
    Phase II 316(b) rules. These rules specify standards for
    cooling water intake structures at existing power plants using
    the largest amounts of cooling water. These rules will require
    implementation of the BTA for minimizing adverse environmental
    impacts unless a facility shows that such standards would result
    in very high costs or little environmental benefit. As a result
    of a decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the
    U.S. EPA suspended the rule in July 2007 while preparing a
    revised version. The U.S. Supreme Court released a decision
    on the challenge on April 1, 2009, in which it concluded
    that the U.S. EPA does have the authority to allow a
    cost-benefit analysis in the evaluation of BTA. This ruling is
    favorable for the industry and NRG as it improves the
    U.S. EPA’s ability to include alternatives to
    closed-loop cooling in its redraft of the Phase II 316(b)
    Rules. In the absence of federal regulations, some states in
    which NRG operates, such as California, Connecticut, Delaware
    and New York, are moving ahead with guidance for more stringent
    requirements for once-through cooled units which may have an
    impact on future operations.

Nuclear Waste

— The Obama administration
    has determined that Yucca Mountain, Nevada is not a workable
    option for a nuclear waste repository and will discontinue its
    program to construct a repository at the mountain in 2010. In
    order to meet the federal government’s obligations to
    safely manage used nuclear fuel and radioactive waste under the
    U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the Department of
    Energy has announced the establishment of a blue ribbon
    commission to explore alternatives. Consistent with the
    U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, owners of nuclear
    plants, including the owners of STP, entered into contracts
    setting out the obligations of the owners and the DOE including
    the fees to be paid by the owners for DOE’s services. Since
    1998, the DOE has been in default on its obligations to begin
    removing spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste
    from reactors.

Under the federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of
    1980, as amended, the state of Texas is required to provide,
    either on its own or jointly with other states in a compact, for
    the disposal of all low-level radioactive waste generated within
    the state. In 2003, the state of Texas enacted legislation
    allowing a private entity to be licensed to accept low-level
    radioactive waste for disposal. NRG intends to continue to ship
    low-level waste material from STP offsite for as long as an
    alternative disposal site is available. Should existing off-site
    disposal become unavailable, the low-level waste material will
    then be stored

on-site.

STP’s

on-site

storage capacity is expected to be adequate for STP’s needs
    until other off-site facilities become available.

Under AB32, which was enacted in 2007, the state of California
    will launch a multi sector climate change program which likely
    will include, among other things, a phased

cap-and-trade

approach starting in 2012 and an increased use of renewable
    energy. NRG does not expect any implementation of

cap-and-trade

under AB32 in California to have a significant adverse financial
    impact on the Company for a variety of reasons, including the
    fact that NRG’s California portfolio consists of natural
    gas-fired peaking facilities and will likely be able to pass
    through any costs of purchasing allowances in power prices.

South
    Central Region

On February 11, 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice
    acting at the request of the U.S. EPA commenced a lawsuit
    against Louisiana Generating, LLC in federal district court in
    the Middle District of Louisiana alleging violations of the CAA
    at the Big Cajun II power plant. This is the same matter
    for which NOVs were issued to Louisiana Generating, LLC on
    February 15, 2005, and on December 8, 2006. Further
    discussion on this matter can be found in

Domestic
    Site Remediation Matters

Under certain federal, state and local environmental laws and
    regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of any
    facility, including an electric generating facility, may be
    required to investigate and remediate


releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances
    or petroleum products at the facility. NRG may also be held
    liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property
    damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs
    incurred by a party in connection with hazardous material
    releases or threatened releases. These laws, including the
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
    Act of 1980 as amended by the Superfund Amendments and
    Reauthorization Act of 1986, or SARA, impose liability without
    regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of
    the hazardous substances, and the courts have interpreted
    liability under such laws to be strict (without fault) and joint
    and several. Cleanup obligations can often be triggered during
    the closure or decommissioning of a facility, in addition to
    spills or other occurrences during its operations.

In January 2006, NRG’s Indian River Operations, Inc.
    received a letter of informal notification from the DNREC
    stating that it may be a potentially responsible party with
    respect to Burton Island Old Ash Landfill, a historic captive
    landfill located at the Indian River facility. On
    October 1, 2007, NRG signed an agreement with the DNREC to
    investigate the site through the Voluntary

Clean-up

Program. On February 4, 2008, the DNREC issued findings
    that no further action is required in relation to surface water
    and that a previously planned shoreline stabilization project
    would adequately address shore line erosion. The landfill itself
    will require a further Remedial Investigation and Feasibility
    Study to determine the type and scope of any additional work
    required. Until the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study
    is completed, the Company is unable to predict the impact of any
    required remediation.

On May 29, 2008, the DNREC issued an invitation to
    NRG’s Indian River Operations, Inc. to participate in the
    development and performance of a Natural Resource Damage
    Assessment, or NRDA, at the Burton Island Old Ash Landfill. NRG
    is currently working with the DNREC and other Trustees to close
    out the matter.

    Financial Statements.

International
    Environmental Matters

Most of the foreign countries in which NRG owns, may acquire or
    develop independent power projects have environmental and safety
    laws or regulations relating to the ownership or operation of
    electric power generation facilities. These laws and
    regulations, like those in the U.S., are constantly evolving and
    have a significant impact on international wholesale power
    producers. In particular, NRG’s international power
    generation facilities will likely be affected by emissions
    limitations and operational requirements imposed by the Kyoto
    Protocol, an international treaty related to greenhouse gas
    emissions enacted on February 16, 2005, as well as
    country-based restrictions pertaining to global climate change
    concerns.

NRG retains appropriate advisors in foreign countries and seeks
    to design its international asset management strategy to comply
    with each country’s environmental and safety laws and
    regulations. There can be no assurance that changes in such laws
    or regulations will not adversely affect the Company’s
    international operations.

Schkopau, Germany

— The cost of
    compliance with the
    CO


regulation for NRG’s Schkopau plant is passed through to
    its off-taker of energy under terms of its existing PPA.

Gladstone, Australia —

On
    December 3, 2007, Australia ratified the Kyoto Protocol
    that commits to targets for GHG reductions. Australia also set a
    target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 60% of 2000 levels
    by 2050. The government established a single national system for
    reporting of GHG, abatement actions and energy consumption and
    generation on July 1, 2008. This will underpin the
    Australian Emissions Trading Scheme, currently being debated in
    the Parliament. If it is passed into law, it is not expected to
    be effective until 2012. NRG may be able to mitigate its
    exposure to such law by getting free credits

and/or

contractually passing the obligation to buy credits on to its
    counterparties.

Environmental
    Capital Expenditures

Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated
    that environmental capital expenditures to be incurred from 2010
    through 2014 to meet NRG’s environmental commitments will
    be approximately $0.9 billion. These capital expenditures,
    in general, are related to installation of particulate,
    SO


,
    NO

and mercury controls to comply with federal and state air
    quality rules and consent orders, as well as installation of
    “Best Technology


Available” under the Phase II 316(b) rule. NRG
    continues to explore cost effective alternatives that can
    achieve desired results. While this estimate reflects schedules
    and controls to meet anticipated reduction requirements, the
    full impact on the scope and timing of environmental retrofits
    cannot be determined until issuance of final rules by the
    U.S. EPA.

NRG’s current contracts with the Company’s rural
    electrical customers in the South Central region allow for
    recovery of a significant portion of the regions capital costs,
    along with a capital return incurred by complying with new laws,
    including interest over the asset life of the required
    expenditures. Actual recoveries will depend, among other things,
    on the duration of the contracts.

Item 1A —

Risk
    Factors Related to NRG Energy, Inc.

Many
    of NRG’s power generation facilities operate, wholly or
    partially, without long-term power sale
    agreements.

Many of NRG’s facilities operate as “merchant”
    facilities without long-term power sales agreements for some or
    all of their generating capacity and output, and therefore are
    exposed to market fluctuations. Without the benefit of long-term
    power sales agreements for these assets, NRG cannot be sure that
    it will be able to sell any or all of the power generated by
    these facilities at commercially attractive rates or that these
    facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead
    to future impairments of the Company’s property, plant and
    equipment or to the closing of certain of its facilities,
    resulting in economic losses and liabilities, which could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations, financial condition or cash flows.

NRG’s
    financial performance may be impacted by changing natural gas
    prices, significant and unpredictable price fluctuations in the
    wholesale power markets and other market factors that are beyond
    the Company’s control.

A significant percentage of the Company’s domestic revenues
    are derived from baseload power plants that are fueled by coal.
    In many of the competitive markets where NRG operates, the price
    of power typically is set by natural gas-fired power plants that
    currently have substantially higher variable costs than
    NRG’s coal-fired baseload power plants. This allows the
    Company’s baseload coal generation assets to earn
    attractive operating margins compared to plants fueled by
    natural gas. A decrease in natural gas prices could result in a
    corresponding decrease in


the market price of power that could significantly reduce the
    operating margins of the Company’s baseload generation
    assets and materially and adversely impact its financial
    performance.

In addition, because changes in power prices in the markets
    where NRG operates are generally correlated with changes in
    natural gas prices, NRG’s hedging portfolio includes
    natural gas derivative instruments to hedge power prices for its
    baseload generation. If this correlation between power prices
    and natural gas prices is not maintained and a change in gas
    prices is not proportionately offset by a change in power
    prices, the Company’s natural gas hedges may not fully
    cover this differential. This could have a material adverse
    impact on the Company’s cash flow and financial position.

Market prices for power, capacity and ancillary services tend to
    fluctuate substantially. Unlike most other commodities, electric
    power can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally
    must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, power
    prices are subject to significant volatility from supply and
    demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead and spot markets.
    Long- and short-term power prices may also fluctuate
    substantially due to other factors outside of the Company’s
    control, including:

•

changes in generation capacity in the Company’s markets,
    including the addition of new supplies of power from existing
    competitors or new market entrants as a result of the
    development of new generation plants, expansion of existing
    plants or additional transmission capacity;

•

electric supply disruptions, including plant outages and
    transmission disruptions;

•

changes in power transmission infrastructure;

•

fuel transportation capacity constraints;

•

weather conditions;

•

changes in the demand for power or in patterns of power usage,
    including the potential development of demand-side management
    tools and practices;

•

development of new fuels and new technologies for the production
    of power;

•

regulations and actions of the ISOs; and

•

federal and state power market and environmental regulation and
    legislation.

These factors have caused the Company’s operating results
    to fluctuate in the past and will continue to cause them to do
    so in the future.

NRG’s
    costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows
    could be adversely impacted by disruption of its fuel
    supplies.

NRG relies on coal, oil and natural gas to fuel a majority of
    its power generation facilities. Delivery of these fuels to the
    facilities is dependent upon the continuing financial viability
    of contractual counterparties as well as upon the infrastructure
    (including rail lines, rail cars, barge facilities, roadways,
    and natural gas pipelines) available to serve each generation
    facility. As a result, the Company is subject to the risks of
    disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at its
    generation facilities if a counterparty fails to perform or if
    there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.

NRG has sold forward a substantial portion of its baseload power
    in order to lock in long-term prices that it deemed to be
    favorable at the time it entered into the forward sale
    contracts. In order to hedge its obligations under these forward
    power sales contracts, the Company has entered into long-term
    and short-term contracts for the purchase and delivery of fuel.
    Many of the forward power sales contracts do not allow the
    Company to pass through changes in fuel costs or discharge the
    power sale obligations in the case of a disruption in fuel
    supply due to force majeure events or the default of a fuel
    supplier or transporter. Disruptions in the Company’s fuel
    supplies may therefore require it to find alternative fuel
    sources at higher costs, to find other sources of power to
    deliver to counterparties at a higher cost, or to pay damages to
    counterparties for failure to deliver power as contracted. Any
    such event could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial performance.


NRG also buys significant quantities of fuel on a short-term or
    spot market basis. Prices for all of the Company’s fuels
    fluctuate, sometimes rising or falling significantly over a
    relatively short period of time. The price NRG can obtain for
    the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate, or may not
    rise at all, to match a rise in fuel or delivery costs. This may
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    performance. Changes in market prices for natural gas, coal and
    oil may result from the following:

•

weather conditions;

•

seasonality;

•

demand for energy commodities and general economic conditions;

•

disruption or other constraints or inefficiencies of
    electricity, gas or coal transmission or transportation;

•

additional generating capacity;

•

availability and levels of storage and inventory for fuel stocks;

•

natural gas, crude oil, refined products and coal production
    levels;

•

changes in market liquidity;

•

federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and
    legislation; and

•

the creditworthiness and liquidity and willingness of fuel
    suppliers/transporters to do business with the Company.

NRG’s plant operating characteristics and equipment,
    particularly at its coal-fired plants, often dictate the
    specific fuel quality to be combusted. The availability and
    price of specific fuel qualities may vary due to supplier
    financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions
    and force majeure. At times, coal of specific quality may not be
    available at any price, or the Company may not be able to
    transport such coal to its facilities on a timely basis. In this
    case, the Company may not be able to run the coal facility even
    if it would be profitable. Operating a coal facility with
    different quality coal can lead to emission or operating
    problems. If the Company had sold forward the power from such a
    coal facility, it could be required to supply or purchase power
    from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. This could have a
    material adverse impact on the financial results of specific
    plants and on the Company’s results of operations.

There
    may be periods when NRG will not be able to meet its commitments
    under forward sale obligations at a reasonable cost or at
    all.

A substantial portion of the output from NRG’s baseload
    facilities has been sold forward under fixed price power sales
    contracts through 2014, and the Company also sells forward the
    output from its intermediate and peaking facilities when it
    deems it commercially advantageous to do so. Because the
    obligations under most of these agreements are not contingent on
    a unit being available to generate power, NRG is generally
    required to deliver power to the buyer, even in the event of a
    plant outage, fuel supply disruption or a reduction in the
    available capacity of the unit. To the extent that the Company
    does not have sufficient lower cost capacity to meet its
    commitments under its forward sale obligations, the Company
    would be required to supply replacement power either by running
    its other, higher cost power plants or by obtaining power from
    third-party sources at market prices that could substantially
    exceed the contract price. If NRG fails to deliver the
    contracted power, it would be required to pay the difference
    between the market price at the delivery point and the contract
    price, and the amount of such payments could be substantial.

In the South Central region, NRG has long-term contracts with
    rural cooperatives that require it to serve all of the
    cooperatives’ requirements at prices that generally reflect
    the costs of coal-fired generation. During limited peak demand
    periods, the load requirements of these contract customers
    exceed the baseload capacity of NRG’s coal-fired Big
    Cajun II plant. During such peak demand periods, NRG either
    employs its owned or leased gas-fired assets or purchases power
    from external sources and, depending upon the then-current gas
    commodity pricing, these purchases can be at higher prices than
    can be recovered under the Company’s contracts. NRG’s
    financial returns from its South Central region could be
    negatively impacted for a limited period if the rural
    cooperatives


significantly grow their customer base during the remaining
    terms of these contracts prior to the expiration of half of the
    cooperative contracts in 2014. In addition, NRG has other
    obligations to supply power to load serving entities and, at
    times, NRG’s load obligations may exceed its available
    generation and long-term purchases thus requiring the Company to
    purchase energy at market prices.

NRG’s
    trading operations and the use of hedging agreements could
    result in financial losses that negatively impact its results of
    operations.

The Company typically enters into hedging agreements, including
    contracts to purchase or sell commodities at future dates and at
    fixed prices, in order to manage the commodity price risks
    inherent in its power generation operations. These activities,
    although intended to mitigate price volatility, expose the
    Company to other risks. When the Company sells power forward, it
    gives up the opportunity to sell power at higher prices in the
    future, which not only may result in lost opportunity costs but
    also may require the Company to post significant amounts of cash
    collateral or other credit support to its counterparties. The
    Company also relies on counterparty performance under its
    hedging agreements and is exposed to the credit quality of its
    counterparties under those agreements. Further, if the values of
    the financial contracts change in a manner that the Company does
    not anticipate, or if a counterparty fails to perform under a
    contract, it could harm the Company’s business, operating
    results or financial position.

NRG does not typically hedge the entire exposure of its
    operations against commodity price volatility. To the extent it
    does not hedge against commodity price volatility, the
    Company’s results of operations and financial position may
    be improved or diminished based upon movement in commodity
    prices.

NRG may engage in trading activities, including the trading of
    power, fuel and emissions allowances that are not directly
    related to the operation of the Company’s generation
    facilities or the management of related risks. These trading
    activities take place in volatile markets and some of these
    trades could be characterized as speculative. The Company would
    expect to settle these trades financially rather than through
    the production of power or the delivery of fuel. This trading
    activity may expose the Company to the risk of significant
    financial losses which could have a material adverse effect on
    its business and financial condition.

NRG
    may not have sufficient liquidity to hedge market risks
    effectively.

The Company is exposed to market risks through its power
    marketing business, which involves the sale of energy, capacity
    and related products and the purchase and sale of fuel,
    transmission services and emission allowances. These market
    risks include, among other risks, volatility arising from
    location and timing differences that may be associated with
    buying and transporting fuel, converting fuel into energy and
    delivering the energy to a buyer.

NRG undertakes these marketing activities through agreements
    with various counterparties. Many of the Company’s
    agreements with counterparties include provisions that require
    the Company to provide guarantees, offset of netting
    arrangements, letters of credit, a first or second lien on
    assets

and/or

cash
    collateral to protect the counterparties against the risk of the
    Company’s default or insolvency. The amount of such credit
    support that must be provided typically is based on the
    difference between the price of the commodity in a given
    contract and the market price of the commodity. Significant
    movements in market prices can result in the Company being
    required to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in
    very large amounts. The effectiveness of the Company’s
    strategy may be dependent on the amount of collateral available
    to enter into or maintain these contracts, and liquidity
    requirements may be greater than the Company anticipates or will
    be able to meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital
    to post as collateral in support of performance guarantees or as
    a cash margin, the Company may not be able to manage price
    volatility effectively or to implement its strategy. An increase
    in the amount of letters of credit or cash collateral required
    to be provided to the Company’s counterparties may
    negatively affect the Company’s liquidity and financial
    condition.

Further, if any of NRG’s facilities experience unplanned
    outages, the Company may be required to procure replacement
    power at spot market prices in order to fulfill contractual
    commitments. Without adequate liquidity to meet margin and
    collateral requirements, the Company may be exposed to
    significant losses, may miss significant opportunities, and may
    have increased exposure to the volatility of spot markets.


The
    accounting for NRG’s hedging activities may increase the
    volatility in the Company’s quarterly and annual financial
    results.

NRG engages in commodity-related marketing and price-risk
    management activities in order to financially hedge its exposure
    to market risk with respect to electricity sales from its
    generation assets, fuel utilized by those assets and emission
    allowances.

NRG generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical and
    financial purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract
    volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations
    through the use of financial and physical derivative contracts.
    These derivatives are accounted for in accordance with ASC-815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, or ASC 815, which requires the
    Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair
    value with changes in the fair value resulting from fluctuations
    in the underlying commodity prices immediately recognized in
    earnings, unless the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge
    accounting treatment. Whether a derivative qualifies for cash
    flow hedge accounting treatment depends upon it meeting specific
    criteria used to determine if the cash flow hedge is and will
    remain appropriate for the term of the derivative. All economic
    hedges may not necessarily qualify for cash flow hedge
    accounting treatment. As a result, the Company’s quarterly
    and annual results are subject to significant fluctuations
    caused by changes in market prices.

Competition
    in wholesale power markets may have a material adverse effect on
    NRG’s results of operations, cash flows and the market
    value of its assets.

NRG has numerous competitors in all aspects of its business, and
    additional competitors may enter the industry. Because many of
    the Company’s facilities are old, newer plants owned by the
    Company’s competitors are often more efficient than
    NRG’s aging plants, which may put some of these plants at a
    competitive disadvantage to the extent the Company’s
    competitors are able to consume the same or less fuel as the
    Company’s plants consume. Over time, the Company’s
    plants may be squeezed out of their markets, or may be unable to
    compete with these more efficient plants.

In NRG’s power marketing and commercial operations, it
    competes on the basis of its relative skills, financial position
    and access to capital with other providers of electric energy in
    the procurement of fuel and transportation services, and the
    sale of capacity, energy and related products. In order to
    compete successfully, the Company seeks to aggregate fuel
    supplies at competitive prices from different sources and
    locations and to efficiently utilize transportation services
    from third-party pipelines, railways and other fuel transporters
    and transmission services from electric utilities.

Other companies with which NRG competes with may have greater
    liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial
    resources, lower cost structures, more effective risk management
    policies and procedures, greater ability to incur losses,
    longer-standing relationships with customers, greater potential
    for profitability from ancillary services or greater flexibility
    in the timing of their sale of generation capacity and ancillary
    services than NRG does.

NRG’s competitors may be able to respond more quickly to
    new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote
    greater resources to the construction, expansion or
    refurbishment of their power generation facilities than NRG can.
    In addition, current and potential competitors may make
    strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships
    among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is
    possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new
    competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market
    share. There can be no assurance that NRG will be able to
    compete successfully against current and future competitors, and
    any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flow.

Operation
    of power generation facilities involves significant risks and
    hazards customary to the power industry that could have a
    material adverse effect on NRG’s revenues and results of
    operations. NRG may not have adequate insurance to cover these
    risks and hazards.

The ongoing operation of NRG’s facilities involves risks
    that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes,
    performance below expected levels of output or efficiency and
    the inability to transport the Company’s product to its
    customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission
    capacity. Unplanned outages of


generating units, including extensions of scheduled outages due
    to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time
    and are an inherent risk of the Company’s business.
    Unplanned outages typically increase the Company’s
    operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce the
    Company’s revenues as a result of selling fewer MWh or
    require NRG to incur significant costs as a result of running
    one of its higher cost units or obtaining replacement power from
    third parties in the open market to satisfy the Company’s
    forward power sales obligations. NRG’s inability to operate
    the Company’s plants efficiently, manage capital
    expenditures and costs, and generate earnings and cash flow from
    the Company’s asset-based businesses could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations,
    financial condition or cash flows. While NRG maintains
    insurance, obtains warranties from vendors and obligates
    contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of
    such insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not be
    adequate to cover the Company’s lost revenues, increased
    expenses or liquidated damages payments should the Company
    experience equipment breakdown or non-performance by contractors
    or vendors.

Power generation involves hazardous activities, including
    acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large
    pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to
    transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural
    risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind,
    other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and
    machinery failure are inherent risks in the Company’s
    operations. These and other hazards can cause significant
    personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and
    destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of,
    or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The
    occurrence of any one of these events may result in NRG being
    named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for
    substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs,
    personal injury and property damage and fines

and/or

penalties. NRG maintains an amount of insurance protection that
    it considers adequate, but the Company cannot provide any
    assurance that its insurance will be sufficient or effective
    under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities
    to which it may be subject. A successful claim for which the
    Company is not fully insured could hurt its financial results
    and materially harm NRG’s financial condition. Further, due
    to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets,
    NRG cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage
    will continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms
    similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by
    insurance could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Maintenance,
    expansion and refurbishment of power generation facilities
    involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power
    outages or reduced output and could have a material adverse
    effect on NRG’s results of operations, cash flow and
    financial condition.

Many of NRG’s facilities are old and require periodic
    upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including
    failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any
    unanticipated capital expenditures could result in reduced
    profitability.

NRG cannot be certain of the level of capital expenditures that
    will be required due to changing environmental and safety laws
    and regulations (including changes in the interpretation or
    enforcement thereof), needed facility repairs and unexpected
    events (such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks). The
    unexpected requirement of large capital expenditures could have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and
    financial condition.

If NRG makes any major modifications to its power generation
    facilities, the Company may be required to install the best
    available control technology or to achieve the lowest achievable
    emission rates as such terms are defined under the new source
    review provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Any such
    modifications would likely result in substantial additional
    capital expenditures.

The
    Company may incur additional costs or delays in the development,
    construction and operation of new plants, improvements to
    existing plants, or the implementation of environmental control
    equipment at existing plants and may not be able to recover
    their investment or complete the project.

The Company is in the process of developing or constructing new
    generation facilities, improving its existing facilities and
    adding environmental controls to its existing facilities. The
    development, construction, expansion, modification and
    refurbishment of power generation facilities involve many
    additional risks, including:

•

delays in obtaining necessary permits and licenses;


•

environmental remediation of soil or groundwater at contaminated
    sites;

•

interruptions to dispatch at the Company’s facilities;

•

supply interruptions;

•

work stoppages;

•

labor disputes;

•

weather interferences;

•

unforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems;

•

unanticipated cost overruns;

•

exchange rate risks;

•

performance risks; and

•

unsuccessful partnering relationships.

In addition, NINA, the Company’s subsidiary focused on
    marketing, siting, developing, financing and investing in new
    advanced design nuclear projects in select markets across North
    America, including the planned STP Units 3 and 4 is subject to
    these and to additional risks, including delays in receiving or
    failure to receive commitments under the DOE’s loan
    guaranty program and the inability to sell down NINA’s
    interest in the STP expansion as the project develops.

Any of these risks could cause NRG’s financial returns on
    new investments to be lower than expected, or could cause the
    Company to operate below expected capacity or availability
    levels, which could result in lost revenues, increased expenses,
    higher maintenance costs and penalties. Insurance is maintained
    to protect against these risks, warranties are generally
    obtained for limited periods relating to the construction of
    each project and its equipment in varying degrees, and
    contractors and equipment suppliers are obligated to meet
    certain performance levels. The insurance, warranties or
    performance guarantees, however, may not be adequate to cover
    increased expenses. As a result, a project may cost more than
    projected and may be unable to fund principal and interest
    payments under its construction financing obligations, if any. A
    default under such a financing obligation could result in losing
    the Company’s interest in a power generation facility.

If the Company is unable to complete the development or
    construction of a facility or environmental control, or decides
    to delay or cancel such project, it may not be able to recover
    its investment in that facility or environmental control. In
    addition, the Company’s nuclear development initiatives are
    an integral part of the Company’s overall low or no carbon
    growth initiatives and the inability of the Company to maintain
    significant involvement in new nuclear development may result in
    the Company’s inability to successfully implement the
    Company’s other growth initiatives. Furthermore, if
    construction projects are not completed according to
    specification, the Company may incur liabilities and suffer
    reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs and reduced net
    income.

The
    Company’s RepoweringNRG program is subject to financing
    risks that could adversely impact NRG’s financial
    performance.

While NRG currently intends to develop and finance the more
    capital intensive, solid fuel-fired projects included in the

Repowering

NRG program on a non-recourse or limited
    recourse basis through separate project financed entities, and
    intends to seek additional investments in most of these projects
    from third parties, NRG anticipates that it will need to make
    significant equity investments in these projects. NRG may also
    decide to develop and finance some of the projects, such as
    smaller gas-fired and renewable projects, using corporate
    financial resources rather than non-recourse debt, which could
    subject NRG to significant capital expenditure requirements and
    to risks inherent in the development and construction of new
    generation facilities. In addition to providing some or all of
    the equity required to develop and build the proposed projects,
    NRG’s ability to finance these projects on a non-recourse
    basis is contingent upon a number of factors, including the
    terms of the EPC contracts, construction costs, PPAs and fuel
    procurement contracts, capital markets conditions, the
    availability of tax credits and other government incentives for
    certain new technologies. To the extent NRG is not able to
    obtain


non-recourse financing for any project or should the credit
    rating agencies attribute a material amount of the project
    finance debt to NRG’s credit, the financing of the

Repowering

NRG projects could have a negative impact on
    the credit ratings of NRG.

As part of the

Repowering

NRG program, NRG may also choose
    to undertake the repowering, refurbishment or upgrade of current
    facilities based on the Company’s assessment that such
    activity will provide adequate financial returns. Such projects
    often require several years of development and capital
    expenditures before commencement of commercial operations, and
    key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an
    investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding
    construction costs, timing, available financing and future fuel
    and power prices.

Supplier
    and/or customer concentration at certain of NRG’s
    facilities may expose the Company to significant financial
    credit or performance risks.

NRG often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small
    number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of
    fuel and other services required for the operation of certain of
    its facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, the Company
    utilizes the marketplace to provide these services. There can be
    no assurance that the marketplace can provide these services as,
    when and where required.

At times, NRG relies on a single customer or a few customers to
    purchase all or a significant portion of a facility’s
    output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account
    for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a
    given facility. The Company has also hedged a portion of its
    exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price
    power sales and natural gas price swap agreements.
    Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable
    to perform their obligations. NRG may not be able to enter into
    replacement agreements on terms as favorable as its existing
    agreements, or at all. If the Company was unable to enter into
    replacement PPA’s, the Company would sell its plants’
    power at market prices. If the Company is unable to enter into
    replacement fuel or fuel transportation purchase agreements, NRG
    would seek to purchase the Company’s fuel requirements at
    market prices, exposing the Company to market price volatility
    and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available
    during certain periods at any price.

The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its
    contractual obligations to NRG could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial results. Consequently,
    the financial performance of the Company’s facilities is
    dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance
    by, suppliers and customers.

NRG
    relies on power transmission facilities that it does not own or
    control and that are subject to transmission constraints within
    a number of the Company’s core regions. If these facilities
    fail to provide NRG with adequate transmission capacity, the
    Company may be restricted in its ability to deliver wholesale
    electric power to its customers and the Company may either incur
    additional costs or forego revenues. Conversely, improvements to
    certain transmission systems could also reduce
    revenues.

NRG depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by
    others to deliver the wholesale power it sells from the
    Company’s power generation plants to its customers. If
    transmission is disrupted, or if the transmission capacity
    infrastructure is inadequate, NRG’s ability to sell and
    deliver wholesale power may be adversely impacted. If a
    region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate,
    the Company’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may
    be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is
    imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient
    incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.
    The Company cannot also predict whether transmission facilities
    will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive
    access to those markets.

In addition, in certain of the markets in which NRG operates,
    energy transmission congestion may occur and the Company may be
    deemed responsible for congestion costs if it schedules delivery
    of power between congestion zones during times when congestion
    occurs between the zones. If NRG were liable for such congestion
    costs, the Company’s financial results could be adversely
    affected.

The Company has a significant amount of generation located in
    load pockets, making that generation valuable, particularly with
    respect to maintaining the reliability of the transmission grid.
    Expansion of transmission systems


to reduce or eliminate these load pockets could negatively
    impact the value or profitability of the Company’s existing
    facilities in these areas.

Because
    NRG owns less than a majority of some of its project
    investments, the Company cannot exercise complete control over
    their operations.

NRG has limited control over the operation of some project
    investments and joint ventures because the Company’s
    investments are in projects where it beneficially owns less than
    a majority of the ownership interests. NRG seeks to exert a
    degree of influence with respect to the management and operation
    of projects in which it owns less than a majority of the
    ownership interests by negotiating to obtain positions on
    management committees or to receive certain limited governance
    rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, the
    Company may not always succeed in such negotiations. NRG may be
    dependent on its co-venturers to operate such projects. The
    Company’s co-venturers may not have the level of
    experience, technical expertise, human resources management and
    other attributes necessary to operate these projects optimally.
    The approval of co-venturers also may be required for NRG to
    receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer the
    Company’s interest in projects.

Future
    acquisition activities may have adverse effects.

NRG may seek to acquire additional companies or assets in the
    Company’s industry or which complement the Company’s
    industry. The acquisition of companies and assets is subject to
    substantial risks, including the failure to identify material
    problems during due diligence, the risk of over-paying for
    assets, the ability to retain customers and the inability to
    arrange financing for an acquisition as may be required or
    desired. Further, the integration and consolidation of
    acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other
    resources and, ultimately, the Company’s acquisitions may
    not be successfully integrated. There can be no assurances that
    any future acquisitions will perform as expected or that the
    returns from such acquisitions will support the indebtedness
    incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to
    develop them.

NRG’s
    business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and
    may be adversely affected by legislative or regulatory changes,
    as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply
    with, existing or future regulations or
    requirements.

NRG’s business is subject to extensive foreign, and
    U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulation.
    Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory
    regimes may cause the Company to incur significant additional
    costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result
    in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of
    liens, fines,

and/or

civil
    or criminal liability.

Public utilities under the FPA are required to obtain FERC
    acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of
    electricity. All of NRG’s non-qualifying facility
    generating companies and power marketing affiliates in the
    U.S. make sales of electricity in interstate commerce and
    are public utilities for purposes of the FPA. The FERC has
    granted each of NRG’s generating and power marketing
    companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based
    rates. The FERC’s orders that grant NRG’s generating
    and power marketing companies market-based rate authority
    reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC
    subsequently determines that NRG can exercise market power in
    transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage
    in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, NRG’s
    market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules,
    and if any of NRG’s generating and power marketing
    companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they
    are subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with
    the violation

and/or

suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority.
    If NRG’s generating and power marketing companies were to
    lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be
    required to obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a

cost-of-service

rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting,
    record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on
    utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an
    adverse effect on the rates NRG charges for power from its
    facilities.

NRG is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as
    well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost
    allocations, and bidding rules that occur in the existing ISOs.
    The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets
    impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation,
    including price limitations, offer caps, and other mechanisms to
    address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of
    market power in


these markets. These types of price limitations and other
    regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the
    profitability of NRG’s generation facilities that sell
    energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets.

The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power
    industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several
    years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state
    and federal levels. These changes are ongoing and the Company
    cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets
    or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment
    will have on NRG’s business. In addition, in some of these
    markets, interested parties have proposed material market design
    changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price
    mechanism, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets or
    require divestiture by generating companies to reduce their
    market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and
    legislative or other attention to the electric power market
    restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation
    process. If competitive restructuring of the electric power
    markets is reversed, discontinued, or delayed, the
    Company’s business prospects and financial results could be
    negatively impacted.

Furthermore, Congress is currently considering legislative
    proposals that would significantly increase the regulation of

over-the-counter

derivatives including those related to energy commodities,
    through the amendment of the Commodity Exchange Act. While NRG
    cannot predict at this time the outcome of any of the
    legislative efforts, many of the proposals generally contemplate
    mandatory clearing of such derivatives through clearing
    organizations and the increased standardization of contracts,
    products, and collateral requirements. Such changes could
    negatively impact NRG’s ability to hedge its portfolio in
    an efficient, cost-effective manner, and, among other things,
    may limit NRG’s ability to utilize liens as collateral. In
    addition, certain proposals seek to limit the proprietary
    trading activity of the banking institutions. Such changes may
    also result in a decrease in liquidity in the commodity markets.

NRG’s
    ownership interest in a nuclear power facility subjects the
    Company to regulations, costs and liabilities uniquely
    associated with these types of facilities.

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or AEA,
    operation of STP, of which NRG indirectly owns a 44.0% interest,
    is subject to regulation by the NRC. Such regulation includes
    licensing, inspection, enforcement, testing, evaluation and
    modification of all aspects of nuclear reactor power plant
    design and operation, environmental and safety performance,
    technical and financial qualifications, decommissioning funding
    assurance and transfer and foreign ownership restrictions.
    NRG’s 44% share of the output of STP represents
    approximately 1,175 MW of generation capacity.

There are unique risks to owning and operating a nuclear power
    facility. These include liabilities related to the handling,
    treatment, storage, disposal, transport, release and use of
    radioactive materials, particularly with respect to spent
    nuclear fuel, and uncertainties regarding the ultimate, and
    potential exposure to, technical and financial risks associated
    with modifying or decommissioning a nuclear facility. The NRC
    could require the shutdown of the plant for safety reasons or
    refuse to permit restart of the unit after unplanned or planned
    outages. New or amended NRC safety and regulatory requirements
    may give rise to additional operation and maintenance costs and
    capital expenditures. STP may be obligated to continue storing
    spent nuclear fuel if the Department of Energy continues to fail
    to meet its contractual obligations to STP made pursuant to the
    U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept and dispose
    of STP’s spent nuclear fuel. See also

“Environmental Matters — U.S. Federal
    Environmental Initiatives — Nuclear Waste”

in
    Item 1 for further discussion. Costs associated with these
    risks could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on
    NRG’s results of operations, financial condition or cash
    flow. In addition, to the extent that all or a part of STP is
    required by the NRC to permanently or temporarily shut down or
    modify its operations, or is otherwise subject to a forced
    outage, NRG may incur additional costs to the extent it is
    obligated to provide power from more expensive alternative
    sources — either NRG’s own plants, third party
    generators or the ERCOT — to cover the Company’s
    then existing forward sale obligations. Such shutdown or
    modification could also lead to substantial costs related to the
    storage and disposal of radioactive materials and spent nuclear
    fuel.

NRG and the other owners of STP maintain nuclear property and
    nuclear liability insurance coverage as required by law. The
    Price-Anderson Act, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005,
    requires owners of nuclear power plants in the U.S. to be
    collectively responsible for retrospective secondary insurance
    premiums for liability


to the public arising from nuclear incidents resulting in claims
    in excess of the required primary insurance coverage amount of
    $300 million per reactor. The Price-Anderson Act only
    covers nuclear liability associated with any accident in the
    course of operation of the nuclear reactor, transportation of
    nuclear fuel to the reactor site, in the storage of nuclear fuel
    and waste at the reactor site and the transportation of the
    spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste from the nuclear reactor.
    All other non-nuclear liabilities are not covered. Any
    substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the
    Price-Anderson Act or losses not covered by insurance could have
    a material adverse effect on NRG’s financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows.

NRG is
    subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose
    extensive and increasingly stringent requirements on the
    Company’s ongoing operations, as well as potentially
    substantial liabilities arising out of environmental
    contamination. These environmental requirements and liabilities
    could adversely impact NRG’s results of operations,
    financial condition and cash flows.

NRG’s business is subject to the environmental laws and
    regulations of foreign, federal, state and local authorities.
    The Company must comply with numerous environmental laws and
    regulations and obtain numerous governmental permits and
    approvals to operate the Company’s plants. Should NRG fail
    to comply with any environmental requirements that apply to its
    operations, the Company could be subject to administrative,
    civil

and/or

criminal liability and fines, and regulatory agencies could take
    other actions seeking to curtail the Company’s operations.
    In addition, when new requirements take effect or when existing
    environmental requirements are revised, reinterpreted or subject
    to changing enforcement policies, NRG’s business, results
    of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be
    adversely affected.

Environmental laws and regulations have generally become more
    stringent over time, and the Company expects this trend to
    continue. Regulations currently under revision by U.S. EPA,
    including CAIR, MACT standards to control Mercury or acid gases
    and the 316 (b) rule to mitigate impact by once-through
    cooling, could result in tighter standards or reduced compliance
    flexibility. While the NRG fleet employs advanced controls and
    utilizes industry’s best practices, new regulations to
    address tightened National Ambient Air Quality Standards for
    Ozone and PM 2.5 or new rules to further restrict ash handling
    at coal-fired power plants could also further restrict plant
    operations.

Policies
    at the national, regional and state levels to regulate GHG
    emissions could adversely impact NRG’s result of
    operations, financial condition and cash flows.

At the national level and at various regional and state levels,
    policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions. In
    addition, GHG emissions from power plants will be subject to
    existing sections of the CAA including PSD/NSR and Title V
    permitting, at some point after the Light Duty Vehicle
    Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards take effect. Implementation
    practices under the PSD/NSR requirements will determine the
    extent to which power plant operations are affected over time In
    2009, in the course of producing approximately 71 million
    MWh of electricity, NRG’s power plants emitted
    59 million tonnes of
    CO


,
    of which 53 million tonnes were emitted in the U.S.,
    3 million tonnes in Germany and 3 million tonnes in
    Australia.

Further federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions
    could have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    performance. The actual impact on the Company’s financial
    performance will depend on a number of factors, including the
    overall level of GHG reductions required under any such
    regulations, the extent to which mitigation is required, the
    price and availability of offsets, and the extent to which NRG
    would be entitled to receive
    CO


emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an
    auction or on the open market.

Of the approximately 53 million tonnes of
    CO


emitted by NRG in the U.S. in 2009, approximately
    8 million tonnes were emitted from the Company’s
    generating units in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland,
    Massachusetts, and New York that are subject to RGGI which
    started in 2009. While 2009 through 2011
    CO


allowance prices have remained low, the impact of RGGI on future
    power prices (and thus on the Company’s financial
    performance), indirectly through generators seeking to pass
    through the cost of their
    CO


emissions, cannot be predicted.

Hazards customary to the power production industry include the
    potential for unusual weather conditions, which could affect
    fuel pricing and availability, the Company’s route to
    market or access to customers,


i.e. transmission and distribution lines, or critical plant
    assets. To the extent that climate change contributes to the
    frequency or intensity of weather related events, NRG’s
    operations and planning process could be impacted.

NRG’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by its unionized
    employees or inability to replace employees as they
    retire.

As of December 31, 2009, approximately 63% of NRG’s
    employees at its U.S. generation plants were covered by
    collective bargaining agreements. In the event that the
    Company’s union employees strike, participate in a work
    stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strife or
    disruption, NRG would be responsible for procuring replacement
    labor or the Company could experience reduced power generation
    or outages. NRG’s ability to procure such labor is
    uncertain. Strikes, work stoppages or the inability to negotiate
    future collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms could
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In
    addition, a number of the Company’s employees at NRG’s
    plants are close to retirement. The Company’s inability to
    replace those workers could create potential knowledge and
    expertise gaps as those workers retire.

Changes
    in technology may impair the value of NRG’s power
    plants.

Research and development activities are ongoing to provide
    alternative and more efficient technologies to produce power,
    including fuel cells, “clean” coal and coal
    gasification, micro-turbines, photovoltaic (solar) cells and
    improvements in traditional technologies and equipment, such as
    more efficient gas turbines. Advances in these or other
    technologies could reduce the costs of power production to a
    level below what the Company has currently forecasted, which
    could adversely affect its cash flow, results of operations or
    competitive position.

Acts
    of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on NRG’s
    financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

NRG’s generation facilities and the facilities of third
    parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist
    activities, as well as events occurring in response to or in
    connection with them, that could cause environmental
    repercussions

and/or

result in full or partial disruption of the facilities ability
    to generate, transmit, transport or distribute electricity or
    natural gas. Strategic targets, such as energy-related
    facilities, may be at greater risk of future terrorist
    activities than other domestic targets. Any such environmental
    repercussions or disruption could result in a significant
    decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or
    remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flow.

NRG’s
    level of indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to
    raise additional capital to fund its operations, or return
    capital to stockholders. It could also expose it to the risk of
    increased interest rates and limit its ability to react to
    changes in the economy or its industry.

NRG’s substantial debt could have important consequences,
    including:

•

increasing NRG’s vulnerability to general economic and
    industry conditions;

•

requiring a substantial portion of NRG’s cash flow from
    operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and
    interest on its indebtedness, therefore reducing NRG’s
    ability to pay dividends to holders of its preferred or common
    stock or to use its cash flow to fund its operations, capital
    expenditures and future business opportunities;

•

limiting NRG’s ability to enter into long-term power sales
    or fuel purchases which require credit support;

•

exposing NRG to the risk of increased interest rates because
    certain of its borrowings, including borrowings under its new
    senior secured credit facility are at variable rates of interest;

•

limiting NRG’s ability to obtain additional financing for
    working capital including collateral postings, capital
    expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and
    general corporate or other purposes; and

•

limiting NRG’s ability to adjust to changing market
    conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared
    to its competitors who have less debt.


The indentures for NRG’s notes and senior secured credit
    facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants that
    may limit the Company’s ability to return capital to
    stockholders or otherwise engage in activities that may be in
    its long-term best interests. NRG’s failure to comply with
    those covenants could result in an event of default which, if
    not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of
    the Company’s indebtedness.

In addition, NRG’s ability to arrange financing, either at
    the corporate level or at a non-recourse project-level
    subsidiary, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on
    numerous factors, including:

•

general economic and capital market conditions;

•

credit availability from banks and other financial institutions;

•

investor confidence in NRG, its partners and the regional
    wholesale power markets;

•

NRG’s financial performance and the financial performance
    of its subsidiaries;

•

NRG’s level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants
    in debt agreements;

•

maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;

•

cash flow; and

•

provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising
    capital.

NRG may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for
    these or other reasons. The failure to obtain additional capital
    from time to time may have a material adverse effect on its
    business and operations.

Goodwill
    and/or other intangible assets not subject to amortization that
    NRG has recorded in connection with its acquisitions are subject
    to mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result, the
    Company could be required to write off some or all of this
    goodwill and other intangible assets, which may adversely affect
    the Company’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

In accordance with ASC-350,

Intangibles-Goodwill and
    Others

; or ASC 305, goodwill is not amortized but is
    reviewed annually or more frequently for impairment and other
    intangibles are also reviewed at least annually or more
    frequently, if certain conditions exist, and may be amortized.
    Any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill or other
    intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings which
    could materially adversely affect NRG’s reported results of
    operations and financial position in future periods.

Volatile
    power supply costs and demand for power could adversely affect
    the financial performance of NRG’s retail
    business.

Although NRG has begun the process of becoming the primary
    provider of Reliant Energy’s supply requirements, Reliant
    Energy presently purchases a significant portion of its supply
    requirements from third parties. As a result, Reliant
    Energy’s financial performance depends on its ability to
    obtain adequate supplies of electric generation from third
    parties at prices below the prices it charges its customers.
    Consequently, the Company’s earnings and cash flows could
    be adversely affected in any period in which Reliant
    Energy’s power supply costs rise at a greater rate than the
    rates it charges to customers. The price of power supply
    purchases associated with Reliant Energy’s energy
    commitments can be different than that reflected in the rates
    charged to customers due to, among other factors:

•

varying supply procurement contracts used and the timing of
    entering into related contracts;

•

subsequent changes in the overall price of natural gas;

•

daily, monthly or seasonal fluctuations in the price of natural
    gas relative to the

12-month

forward prices;

•

transmission constraints and the Company’s ability to move
    power to its customers; and

•

changes in market heat rate (i.e., the relationship between
    power and natural gas prices).

The Company’s earnings and cash flows could also be
    adversely affected in any period in which the demand for power
    significantly varies from the forecasted supply, which could
    occur due to, among other factors, weather events, competition
    and economic conditions.


NRG’s
    Texas retail business depends on the Electric Reliability
    Council of Texas, or ERCOT, to communicate operating and system
    information in a timely and accurate manner. Information that is
    not timely or accurate can have an impact on the Company’s
    current and future reported financial results.

ERCOT communicates information relating to a customer’s
    choice of retail electric provider and other data needed for
    servicing the customer accounts of the Company’s retail
    electric providers. Any failure to perform these tasks will
    result in delays and other problems in enrolling, switching and
    billing customers. Information that is not timely or accurate
    may adversely impact the Company’s ability to serve load in
    the optimum manner.

NRG’s
    Texas retail business could be liable for a share of the payment
    defaults of other market participants.

If a market participant defaults on its payment obligations to
    an ISO, the Company, together with other market participants,
    are liable for a portion of the default obligation that is not
    otherwise covered by the defaulting market participant. Each ISO
    establishes credit requirements applicable to market
    participants and the basis for allocating payment default
    amounts to market participants. In ERCOT, the allocation is
    based on share of the total load.

Significant
    events beyond the Company’s control, such as hurricanes and
    other weather-related problems or acts of terrorism, could cause
    a loss of load and customers and thus have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s Texas retail
    business.

The uncertainty associated with events beyond the Company’s
    control, such as significant weather events and the risk of
    future terrorist activity, could cause a loss of load and
    customers and may affect the Company’s results of
    operations and financial condition in unpredictable ways. In
    addition, significant weather events or terrorist actions could
    damage or shut down the power transmission and distribution
    facilities upon which the retail business is dependent. Power
    supply may be sold at a loss if these events cause a significant
    loss of retail customer load.

Item 3 —

Legal
    Proceedings

City of San Antonio, Texas, acting by and through the
    City Public Service Board of San Antonio, a Texas municipal
    utility v. Toshiba Corporation; NRG Energy, Inc.; Nuclear
    Innovation North America, LLC; NINA Texas 3 LLC; and NINA Texas
    4 LLC (as amended), 37th Judicial District Court, Bexar
    County, TX, Case #2009CL19492

(filed December 6,
    2009) —

The original December 6, 2009,
    complaint against two Nuclear Innovation North America, or NINA,
    entities asked the court to declare the rights, obligations, and
    remedies of the parties pursuant to the 1997 and 2007 agreements
    between the parties should CPS unilaterally withdraw from the
    proposed South Texas Project Units 3 and 4, or the STP Units 3
    and 4 Project. On December 23, 2009, CPS amended its
    original December 6 complaint adding NRG, Toshiba Corporation,
    and NINA LLC as defendants and not only continued to request
    that the Court declare the rights, obligations, and remedies of
    the parties under the two operative governing agreements, but
    also sought $32 billion in damages. CPS amended its
    complaint again on December 28, 2009.

On January 6, 2010, CPS amended its complaint for the third
    time. In addition to requesting immediate injunctive relief, the
    amended complaint alleges that NRG, Toshiba, and NINA have been
    involved in a conspiracy to defraud CPS, that they purposefully
    misled CPS in inducing it to be a partner in the STP Units 3 and
    4 Project, that they maliciously interfered with CPS contracts
    and business relationships, and that they willfully disparaged
    CPS. It sought declarations that: (i) owner consensus is
    required for all development decisions; (ii) there is a
    right to voluntary withdrawal, after which no further
    obligations accrue but undiluted ownership continues;
    (iii) both the partition waiver and forfeiture provisions
    are unenforceable against CPS under Texas law if they did apply;
    and (iv) CPS is not currently in breach. In addition, CPS
    sought relief among the following alternatives: partition by
    sale; an order forcing NRG and NINA to buy CPS undiluted share
    at an independent valuation; an order requiring NRG to
    compensate CPS $350 million investment and fair value for
    the site; an order granting CPS twelve months


following withdrawal to sell its stake in the project; or an
    order that no further development take place without consensus
    of all project owners. The case was removed and remanded to and
    from federal court on three separate occasions. On
    January 19, 2010, CPS dismissed Toshiba from the lawsuit.

The parties agreed to a January 25, 2010, phased trial
    wherein all other claims would be reserved for an undetermined
    future phase II date and a trial would go forward in phase
    I only on CPS’ request for declaratory relief to determine
    the respective rights, obligations, and remedies of the parties
    under the two operative governing agreements should CPS withdraw
    from the STP Units 3 and 4 Project. On January 25,2010, the
    parties argued the NINA entities and NRG’s Motion for
    Summary Judgment which was denied on January 26, 2010.
    After a

two-day

trial, the court issued its ruling on January 29, 2010,
    making a number of findings. It ruled that as of
    January 29, CPS and NINA were each 50% equity owners as
    tenants in common under Texas law in the STP Units 3 and 4
    Project. The court found that while a withdrawing party does not
    forfeit its 50% interest upon a withdrawal, the governing
    agreements are silent as to whether that withdrawing party can
    recoup its sunk costs upon withdrawal. Finally, the court noted
    that for CPS to remain a 50% equity owner, it must pay all
    appropriate costs. Failure to do so, the court determined, would
    result in a complete loss of CPS’ equity share.

On February 17, 2010, an agreement in principle was reached
    with CPS for NINA to acquire a controlling interest in the STP
    Units 3 and 4 Project through a settlement of all pending
    litigation between the parties. As part of that agreement, all
    litigation would be dismissed with prejudice, including all
    Phase II claims, thereby ending this matter. For further
    discussion, see Item 1,

Nuclear Development.

The
    parties continue to negotiate terms regarding final
    documentation of the agreement in principle.

    contracts and other defendants, the California Department of
    Water Resources, or CDWR, and its wholesale power contract with
    subsidiaries of WCP (Generation) Holdings, Inc., or WCP. The
    case originated with a February 2002 complaint filed by the
    State of California alleging that many parties, including WCP
    subsidiaries, overcharged the State of California. For WCP, the
    alleged overcharges totaled approximately $940 million for
    2001 and 2002. The complaint demanded that the FERC abrogate the
    CDWR contract and sought refunds associated with revenues
    collected under the contract. In 2003, the FERC rejected this
    complaint, denied rehearing, and the case was appealed to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit where oral
    argument was held on December 8, 2004. On December 19,
    2006, the Ninth Circuit decided that in the FERC’s review
    of the contracts at issue, the FERC could not rely on the

Mobile-Sierra

standard presumption of just and reasonable
    rates, where such contracts were not reviewed by the FERC with
    full knowledge of the then existing market conditions. WCP and
    others sought review by the U.S. Supreme Court. WCP’s
    appeal was not selected, but instead held by the Supreme Court.
    In the appeal that was selected by the Supreme Court, on
    June 26, 2008 the Supreme Court ruled: (i) that the

Mobile-Sierra

public interest standard of review applied
    to contracts made under a seller’s market-based rate
    authority; (ii) that the public interest “bar”
    required to set aside a contract remains a very high one to
    overcome; and (iii) that the

Mobile-Sierra

presumption of contract reasonableness applies when a
    contract is formed during a period of market dysfunction unless
    (a) such market conditions were caused by the illegal
    actions of one of the parties or (b) the contract
    negotiations were tainted by fraud or duress. In this related
    case, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the Ninth
    Circuit’s decision agreeing that the case should be
    remanded to the FERC to clarify the FERC’s 2003 reasoning
    regarding its rejection of the original complaint relating to
    the financial burdens under the contracts at issue and to
    alleged market manipulation at the time these contracts were
    formed. As a result, the U.S. Supreme Court then reversed
    and remanded the WCP CDWR case to the Ninth Circuit for
    treatment consistent with its June 26, 2008 decision in the
    related case. On October 20, 2008, the Ninth Circuit asked
    the parties in the remanded CDWR case, including WCP and the
    FERC, whether that Court should answer a question the
    U.S. Supreme Court did not address in its June 26,
    2008, decision; whether the

Mobile-Sierra

doctrine
    applies to a third-party that was not a signatory to any of the
    wholesale power contracts, including the CDWR contract, at issue
    in that case. Without answering that reserved question, on
    December 4, 2008, the Ninth Circuit vacated its prior
    opinion and remanded the WCP CDWR case back to the FERC for
    proceedings consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court’s
    June 26, 2008 decision. On December 15, 2008, WCP and
    the other seller-defendants filed with the FERC a Motion for
    Order Governing Proceedings on Remand. On January 14, 2009,
    the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California filed
    an Answer and Cross Motion for an Order Governing Procedures on
    Remand, and on January 28, 2009, WCP and the other
    seller-defendants filed their reply.


At this time, while NRG cannot predict with certainty whether
    WCP will be required to make refunds for rates collected under
    the CDWR contract or estimate the range of any such possible
    refunds, a reconsideration of the CDWR contract by the FERC with
    a resulting order mandating significant refunds could have a
    material adverse impact on NRG’s financial position,
    statement of operations, and statement of cash flows. As part of
    the 2006 acquisition of Dynegy’s 50% ownership interest in
    WCP, WCP and NRG assumed responsibility for any risk of loss
    arising from this case, unless any such loss was deemed to have
    resulted from certain acts of gross negligence or willful
    misconduct on the part of Dynegy, in which case any such loss
    would be shared equally between WCP and Dynegy.

On January 14, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its
    decision in an unrelated proceeding involving the

Mobile-Sierra

doctrine that will affect the standard of
    review applied to the CDWR contract on remand before the FERC.
    In

NRG Power Marketing v. Maine Public Utilities
    Commission

, the Supreme Court held by an 8 to 1 margin that
    the

Mobile-Sierra

presumption regarding the
    reasonableness of contract rates does not depend on the identity
    of the complainant who seeks a FERC investigation/refund. The
    Supreme Court proceeding arose following an appeal by the
    Attorneys General of the State of Connecticut and of the
    Commonwealth of Massachusetts regarding the settlement
    establishing the New England Forward Capacity Market. The
    settlement, filed with the FERC on March 7, 2006, provides
    for interim capacity transition payments for all generators in
    New England for the period from December 1, 2006, through
    May 31, 2010, and for the Forward Capacity Market auction
    rates thereafter. The Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, or DC
    Circuit, had rejected all substantive challenges to the
    settlement, but had sustained one procedural argument relating
    to the applicability of the

Mobile-Sierra

doctrine to
    third parties. The Supreme Court reversed the DC Circuit on this
    point, and remanded the case for further consideration of
    whether the transition payments and auction rates qualify as
    contract rates.

United States of America v. Louisiana Generating,
    LLC., U.S.D.C Middle District of Louisiana,

Civil
    Action

No. 09-100-RET-CN

(filed February 11, 2009) —

The
    U.S. Department of Justice acting at the request of the
    U.S. EPA commenced a lawsuit against Louisiana Generating,
    LLC in federal district court in the Middle District of
    Louisiana alleging violations of the CAA at the Big
    Cajun II power plant. This is the same matter for which
    NOVs were issued to Louisiana Generating, LLC on
    February 15, 2005, and on December 8, 2006.
    Specifically, it is alleged that in the late 1990’s,
    several years prior to NRG’s acquisition of the Big
    Cajun II power plant from the Cajun Electric bankruptcy and
    several years prior to the NRG bankruptcy, modifications were
    made to Big Cajun II Units 1 and 2 by the prior owners
    without appropriate or adequate permits and without installing
    and employing the BACT to control emissions of nitrogen oxides

and/or

sulfur dioxides. The relief sought in the complaint includes a
    request for an injunction to: (i) preclude the operation of
    Units 1 and 2 except in accordance with the CAA; (ii) order
    the installation of BACT on Units 1 and 2 for each pollutant
    subject to regulation under the CAA; (iii) obtain all
    necessary permits for Units 1 and 2; (iv) order the
    surrender of emission allowances or credits; (v) conduct
    audits to determine if any additional modifications have been
    made which would require compliance with the CAA’s
    Prevention of Significant Deterioration program; (vi) award
    to the Department of Justice its costs in prosecuting this
    litigation; and (vii) assess civil penalties of up to
    $27,500 per day for each CAA violation found to have occurred
    between January 31, 1997, and March 15, 2004, up to
    $32,500 for each CAA violation found to have occurred between
    March 15, 2004, and January 12, 2009, and up to
    $37,500 for each CAA violation found to have occurred after
    January 12, 2009.

On April 27, 2009, Louisiana Generating, LLC made several
    filings. It filed an objection in the Cajun Electric Cooperative
    Power, Inc.’s bankruptcy proceeding in the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Louisiana
    to seek to prevent the bankruptcy from closing. It also filed a
    complaint in the same bankruptcy proceeding in the same court
    seeking a judgment that: (i) it did not assume liability
    from Cajun Electric for any claims or other liabilities under
    environmental laws with respect to Big Cajun II that arose,
    or are based on activities that were undertaken, prior to the
    closing date of the acquisition; (ii) it is not otherwise
    the successor to Cajun Electric; and (iii) Cajun Electric

and/or

the
    Bankruptcy Trustee are exclusively liable for the violations
    alleged in the February 11, 2009 lawsuit to the extent that
    such claims are determined to have merit. On June 8, 2009,
    the parties filed a joint status report setting forth their
    views of the case and proposing a trial schedule. On
    June 18, 2009, Louisiana Generating, LLC filed a motion to
    bifurcate the Department of Justice lawsuit into separate
    liability and remedy phases, and on June 30, 2009, the
    Department of Justice filed its opposition. On August 24,
    2009, Louisiana Generating, LLC filed a motion to dismiss this
    lawsuit, and on September 25, 2009, the


Department of Justice filed its opposition to the motion to
    dismiss. A new federal bankruptcy judge was appointed on
    October 9, 2009.

On February 18, 2010, the Louisiana Department of Environmental
    Quality, or LDEQ, filed a motion to intervene in the above
    lawsuit and a complaint against Louisiana Generating LLC for
    alleged violations of Louisiana’s PSD regulations and
    Louisiana’s Title V operating permit program. LDEQ seeks
    similar relief to that requested by the Department of Justice.
    Specifically, LDEQ seeks injunctive relief to: (i) preclude the
    operation of Units 1 and 2 except in accordance with the CAA;
    (ii) order the installation of BACT on Units 1 and 2 for each
    pollutant subject to regulation under the CAA; (iii) obtain  all
    necessary permits for Units 1 and 2 pursuant to the requirements
    of PSD and the Louisiana Title V operating permits program; (iv)
    conduct audits to determine if any additional modifications have
    occurred which would require it to meet the requirements of PSD
    and report the Results of the audit to the LDEQ and EPA; (v)
    order the surrender of emission allowances or credits; (vi) take
    other appropriate actions to remedy, mitigate and offset the
    harm to public health and the environment caused by violations
    of the CAA; (vii) assess civil penalties; and (viii) award to
    the LDEQ its costs in prosecuting the litigation. On
    February 19, 2010, the district court granted LDEQ’s
    motion to intervene.

Hohl Industrial Services, Inc, v. Dunkirk Power LLC,
    et al; New York State Supreme Court, County of Chautauqua; Index
    No, Kl-2009-1510

(original complaint filed August 28,
    2009, cross claims filed by CBEEC on February 17,
    2010) —

In 2005, NRG entered into a Consent Decree
    with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
    whereby it agreed to reduce certain emissions generated by its
    Huntley and Dunkirk power plants. Pursuant to the Consent
    Decree, on November 21, 2007, Clyde Bergemann EEC, or
    CBEEC, and NRG entered into a firm fixed price contract for the
    supply of equipment, material and services for six fabric
    filters for NRG’s Dunkirk Electric Power Generating
    Station. Subsequent to contracting with NRG, CBEEC subcontracted
    with Hohl Industrial Services, Inc., or Hohl, to perform steel
    erection and equipment installation at Dunkirk.

On August 28, 2009, Hohl filed its original complaint
    against NRG, its subsidiary Dunkirk Power LLC, or Dunkirk Power,
    and CBEEC among others for claims of breach of contract, quantum
    meruit, unjust enrichment and foreclosure of mechanics’
    liens. As part of CBEEC’s contractual obligation to NRG,
    CBEEC agreed to defend, under a reservation of rights,
    NRG’s interest in this lawsuit. CBEEC filed an answer to
    the above complaint on behalf of itself, NRG and Dunkirk Power
    on October 5, 2009. On December 16, 2009, CBEEC filed
    a Motion for Summary Judgment on behalf of itself, NRG, and
    Dunkirk Power, which has yet to be decided.

On February 1, 2010, NRG and Dunkirk Power filed a Motion
    for Leave to file an Amended Answer with Cross-Claims against
    CBEEC. NRG asserted breach of contract claims seeking liquidated
    damages for the delays caused by CBEEC. NRG also retained its
    own counsel to represent its interest in the cross-claims and
    reserved its rights to seek reimbursement from CBEEC. On
    February 17, 2010, CBEEC filed an Amended Answer with
    Affirmative Defenses, Counterclaims and Cross-Claims against
    NRG. CBEEC is seeking approximately $30 million alleging
    breach of contract, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and
    foreclosure of two mechanic’s liens, as a result of alleged
    delays caused by NRG and Dunkirk Power. A court ordered hearing
    and settlement conference is scheduled for February 23,
    2010.

Excess Mitigation Credits

—

From January
    2002 to April 2005, CenterPoint Energy applied excess mitigation
    credits, or EMCs, to its monthly charges to retail electric
    providers as ordered by the PUCT. The PUCT imposed these credits
    to facilitate the transition to competition in Texas, which had
    the effect of lowering the retail electric providers’
    monthly charges payable to CenterPoint Energy. As indicated in
    its Petition for Review filed with the Supreme Court of Texas on
    June 2, 2008, CenterPoint Energy has claimed that the
    portion of those EMCs credited to Reliant Energy Retail
    Services, LLC, or RERS, a retail electric provider and NRG
    subsidiary acquired from RRI Energy Inc., or RRI, totaled
    $385 million for RERS’s “Price to Beat”
    Customers. It is unclear what the actual number may be.
    “Price to Beat” was the rate RERS was required by
    state law to charge residential and small commercial customers
    that were transitioned to RERS from the incumbent integrated
    utility company commencing in 2002. In its original stranded
    cost case brought before the PUCT on March 31, 2004,
    CenterPoint Energy sought recovery of all EMCs that were
    credited to all retail electric providers, including RERS, and
    the PUCT ordered that relief in its Order on Rehearing in Docket
    No. 29526, on December 17, 2004. After an appeal to
    state district court, the court entered a final judgment on
    August 26, 2005, affirming the PUCT’s order with
    regard to EMCs credited to RERS. Various parties filed appeals
    of that judgment with the Court of Appeals for the Third
    District of Texas with


the first such appeal filed on the same date as the state
    district court judgment and the last such appeal filed on
    October 10, 2005. On April 17, 2008, the Court of
    Appeals for the Third District reversed the lower court’s
    decision ruling that CenterPoint Energy’s stranded cost
    recovery should exclude only EMCs credited to RERS for its
    “Price to Beat” customers. On June 2, 2008,
    CenterPoint Energy filed a Petition for Review with the Supreme
    Court of Texas and on June 19, 2009, the Court agreed to
    consider the CenterPoint Energy appeal as well as two related
    petitions for review filed by other entities. Oral argument
    occurred on October 6, 2009.

In November 2008, CenterPoint Energy and RRI, on behalf of
    itself and affiliates including RERS, agreed to suspend
    unexpired deadlines, if any, related to limitations periods that
    might exist for possible claims against REI and its affiliates
    if CenterPoint Energy is ultimately not allowed to include in
    its stranded cost calculation those EMCs previously credited to
    RERS. Regardless of the outcome of the Texas Supreme Court
    proceeding, NRG believes that any possible future CenterPoint
    Energy claim against RERS for EMCs credited to RERS would lack
    legal merit. No such claim has been filed.

Additional Litigation —

In addition to
    the foregoing, NRG is party to other litigation or legal
    proceedings. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to
    the legal proceedings and investigations described above and
    intends to defend them vigorously. However, litigation is
    inherently subject to many uncertainties. There can be no
    assurance that additional litigation will not be filed against
    the Company or its subsidiaries in the future asserting similar
    or different legal theories and seeking similar or different
    types of damages and relief. Unless specified above, the Company
    is unable to predict the outcome these legal proceedings and
    investigations may have or reasonably estimate the scope or
    amount of any associated costs and potential liabilities. An
    unfavorable outcome in one or more of these proceedings could
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The
    Company also has indemnity rights for some of these proceedings
    to reimburse the Company for certain legal expenses and to
    offset certain amounts deemed to be owed in the event of an
    unfavorable litigation outcome.

Consists of NRG Energy, Inc.’s
    Long-Term Incentive Plan, or the LTIP, and NRG Energy,
    Inc.’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP. The LTIP
    became effective upon the Company’s emergence from
    bankruptcy. The LTIP was subsequently approved by the
    Company’s stockholders on August 4, 2004 and was
    amended on April 28, 2006 to increase the number of shares
    available for issuance to 16,000,000, on a post-split basis, and
    again on December 8, 2006 to make technical and
    administrative changes. The LTIP provides for grants of stock
    options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
    performance units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalent
    rights. NRG’s directors, officers and employees, as well as
    other individuals performing services for, or to whom an offer
    of employment has been extended by the Company, are eligible to
    receive grants under the LTIP. The purpose of the LTIP is to
    promote the Company’s long-term growth and profitability by
    providing these individuals with incentives to maximize
    stockholder value and otherwise contribute to the Company’s
    success and to enable the Company to attract, retain and reward
    the best available persons for positions of responsibility. The
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the
    LTIP. There were 5,129,593 and 6,798,074 shares of common
    stock remaining available for grants of awards under NRG’s
    LTIP as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    ESPP was approved by the Company’s stockholders on
    May 14, 2008. There were 500,000 shares reserved from
    the Company’s treasury shares for the ESPP. As of
    December 31, 2009, there were 418,468 shares of
    treasury stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. In January
    2010, 54,845 shares were issued to employees accounts from
    the treasury stock reserve for the ESPP.

Energy revenue consists of revenues received from third parties
    for sales in the day-ahead and real-time markets, as well as
    bilateral sales. Beginning in 2006, energy revenues also
    included revenues from the settlement of financial instruments
    that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment.

Capacity revenue consists of revenues received from a third
    party at either the market or negotiated contract rates for
    making installed generation capacity available in order to
    satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements. Capacity
    revenues also included revenues from the settlement of financial
    instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting
    treatment. In addition, capacity revenue includes revenue
    received under tolling arrangements, which entitle third parties
    to dispatch NRG’s facilities and assume title to the
    electrical generation produced from that facility.

Retail revenue, representing operating revenue of Reliant
    Energy, consists of revenues from retail electric sales to
    residential, small business, commercial, industrial and
    governmental/institutional customers, as well as revenues from
    the sale of excess supply into various markets in Texas.

Risk management activities includes fair value changes of
    economic hedges that did not qualify for cash flow hedge
    accounting, ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges and trading
    activities. It also includes the settlement of all derivative
    transactions that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting
    treatment. Prior to 2006, risk management activities included
    the settlement of financial instruments that qualified for cash
    flow hedge accounting treatment.

Thermal revenue consists of revenues received from the sale of
    steam, hot and chilled water generally produced at a central
    district energy plant and sold to commercial, governmental and
    residential buildings for space heating, domestic hot water
    heating and air conditioning. It also includes the sale of
    high-pressure steam produced and delivered to industrial
    customers that is used as part of an industrial process.

Contract amortization revenues consists of acquired power
    contracts, gas swaps, and certain power sales agreements assumed
    at Fresh Start and Texas Genco purchase accounting dates related
    to the sale of electric capacity and energy in future periods,
    which are amortized into revenue over the term of the underlying
    contracts based on actual generation or contracted volumes. Also
    included is amortization of the intangible asset for net
    in-market C&I contracts that was established in connection
    with the acquisition of Reliant Energy.

Hedge Reset is the impact from the net settlement of long-term
    power contracts and gas swaps by negotiating prices to current
    market. This transaction was completed in November 2006.

Other revenue primarily consists of operations and maintenance
    fees, or O&M fees, construction management services, or CMA
    fees, sale of natural gas and emission allowances, and revenue
    from ancillary services. O&M fees consist of revenues
    received from providing certain unconsolidated affiliates with
    services under long-term operating agreements. CMA fees are
    earned where NRG provides certain management and oversight of
    construction projects pursuant to negotiated agreements such as
    for the GenConn and Cedar Bayou 4 construction projects.
    Ancillary services are comprised of the sale of energy-related
    products associated with the generation of electrical energy
    such as spinning reserves, reactive power and other similar
    products.

Executive
    Summary

Overview

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is primarily a
    wholesale power generation company with a significant presence
    in major competitive power markets in the U.S., as well as a
    major retail electricity franchise in the ERCOT (Texas) market.
    NRG is engaged in the ownership, development, construction and
    operation of power generation facilities, the transacting in and
    trading of fuel and transportation services, the trading of
    energy, capacity and related products in the U.S. and
    select international markets, and the supply of electricity and
    energy services to retail electricity customers in the Texas
    market.

As of December 31, 2009, NRG had a total global generation
    portfolio of 187 active operating fossil fuel and nuclear
    generation units, at 44 power generation plants, with an
    aggregate generation capacity of approximately 24,115 MW,
    and approximately 400 MW under construction which includes
    partner interests of 200 MW. In addition to its fossil fuel
    plant ownership, NRG has ownership interests in operating
    renewable facilities with an aggregate generation capacity of
    365 MW, consisting of three wind farms representing an
    aggregate generation capacity of 345 MW (which includes
    partner interest of 75 MW) and a solar facility with an
    aggregate generation capacity of 20 MW. Within the U.S.,
    NRG has large and diversified power generation portfolios in
    terms of geography, fuel-type and dispatch levels, with
    approximately 23,110 MW of fossil fuel and nuclear
    generation capacity in 179 active generating units at 42 plants.
    The Company’s power generation facilities are most heavily
    concentrated in Texas (approximately 11,340 MW, including
    345 MW from three wind farms), the Northeast (approximately
    7,015 MW), South Central (approximately 2,855 MW), and
    West (approximately 2,150 MW, including 20 MW from a
    solar farm) regions of the U.S., with approximately 115 MW
    of additional generation capacity from the Company’s
    thermal assets. In addition, through certain foreign
    subsidiaries, NRG has investments in power generation projects
    located in Australia and Germany with approximately
    1,005 MW of generation capacity.


NRG’s principal domestic power plants consist of a mix of
    natural gas-, coal-, oil-fired, nuclear and renewable
    facilities, representing approximately 46%, 32%, 16%, 5% and 1%
    of the Company’s total domestic generation capacity,
    respectively. In addition, 9% of NRG’s domestic generating
    facilities have dual or multiple fuel capacity, which allows
    plants to dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option.

NRG’s domestic generation facilities consist of
    intermittent, baseload, intermediate and peaking power
    generation facilities, the ranking of which is referred to as
    the Merit Order, and include thermal energy production plants.
    The sale of capacity and power from baseload generation
    facilities accounts for the majority of the Company’s
    revenues and provides a stable source of cash flow. In addition,
    NRG’s generation portfolio provides the Company with
    opportunities to capture additional revenues by selling power
    during periods of peak demand, offering capacity or similar
    products to retail electric providers and others, and providing
    ancillary services to support system reliability.

On May 1, 2009, NRG acquired Reliant Energy, which is the
    second largest electricity provider to Mass customers in Texas.
    Reliant Energy is also the largest electricity and energy
    services provider, based on load, to C&I customers in
    Texas. Based on metered locations, as of December 31, 2009,
    Reliant Energy had approximately 1.5 million Mass customers
    and approximately 0.1 million C&I customers. Reliant
    Energy arranges for the transmission and delivery of electricity
    to customers, bills customers, collects payments for electricity
    sold and maintains call centers to provide customer service.

NRG’s
    Business Strategy

NRG’s business strategy is intended to maximize shareholder
    value through production and the sale of safe, reliable and
    affordable power to its customers and in the markets served by
    the Company, while aggressively pursuing sustainable energy
    solutions for the future.

The Company’s strategy is focused on: (i) top decile
    operating performance of its existing operating assets and
    enhanced operating performance of the Company’s commercial
    operations and hedging program; (ii) repowering of power
    generation assets at existing sites and development of new power
    generation projects; (iii) empowering retail customers with
    distinctive products and services that transform how they use,
    manage and value energy; (iv) engaging in a proactive
    capital allocation plan focused on achieving the regular return
    of capital to stockholders within the dictates of prudent
    balance sheet management; and (v) pursuit of selective
    acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and investments in
    energy-related new businesses and new technologies in order to
    enhance the Company’s asset mix and competitive position in
    the its core markets, as well as increasing demand for
    sustainable energy lifestyles and combating climate change.

This strategy is supported by the Company’s five major
    initiatives (

FOR

NRG,

Repowering

NRG, econrg, Future
    NRG and NRG Global Giving) which are designed to enhance the
    Company’s competitive advantages in these strategic areas
    and enable the Company to convert the challenges faced by the
    power industry in the coming years into opportunities for
    financial growth. This strategy is being implemented by focusing
    on the following principles:

Operational Performance

— The Company is
    focused on increasing value from its existing assets. Through
    the

FOR

NRG 2.0 initiative, NRG will continue its
    companywide effort to focus on extracting value from its
    portfolio by improving plant performance, reducing costs and
    harnessing the Company’s advantages of scale in the
    procurement of fuels and other commodities, parts and services,
    and in doing so improving the Company’s ROIC.

In addition to the

FOR

NRG initiative, the Company seeks
    to maximize profitability and manage cash flow volatility
    through the Company’s commercial operations strategy by
    leveraging its: (i) expertise in marketing power and
    ancillary services; (ii) its knowledge of markets;
    (iii) its balanced financial structure; and (iv) its
    diverse portfolio of power generation assets in the execution of
    asset-based risk management, hedging, marketing and trading
    strategies within well-defined risk and liquidity guidelines.
    The Company’s marketing and hedging philosophy is centered
    on generating stable returns from its portfolio of baseload
    power generation assets while preserving an ability to
    capitalize on strong spot market conditions and to capture the
    extrinsic value of the Company’s intermediate and peaking
    facilities and portions of its baseload fleet.


The Company also seeks to achieve synergies between the
    Company’s retail and wholesale business in Texas through
    its complementary generation portfolio in the Texas region,
    thereby creating the potential for a more stable, reliable and
    competitive business that benefits Texas consumers. By backing
    Reliant Energy’s load-serving requirements with NRG’s
    generation and risk management practices, the need to sell and
    buy power from other financial institutions and intermediaries
    that trade in the ERCOT market may be reduced, resulting in
    reduced transaction costs, credit exposures, and collateral
    postings. In addition, with Reliant Energy’s base of retail
    customers, NRG now has a customer interface with the scale that
    is important to the successful deployment of consumer facing
    energy technologies and services.

Finally, NRG remains focused on cash flow and maintaining
    appropriate levels of liquidity, debt and equity in order to
    ensure continued access, through all economic and financial
    cycles, to capital for investment, to enhance risk-adjusted
    returns and to provide flexibility in executing NRG’s
    business strategy, including a regular return of capital to its
    debt and equity holders.

Development

— NRG is favorably
    positioned to pursue growth opportunities through expansion of
    its existing generating capacity and development of new
    generating capacity at its existing facilities, as well as
    “clean” coal and the retrofit of post-combustion
    carbon capture technologies. Primarily through the

Repowering

NRG and econrg initiatives, NRG intends to
    invest in its existing assets through plant improvements,
    repowerings, brownfield development and site expansions to meet
    anticipated requirements for additional capacity in NRG’s
    core markets, with an emphasis on new capacity that is supported
    by long-term power sales agreements and financed with limited or
    non-recourse project financing, and the demonstration and
    deployment of “green” technologies.

Repowering

NRG is a comprehensive portfolio redevelopment
    program designed to develop, construct and operate new
    multi-fuel, multi-technology, highly efficient and
    environmentally responsible generation capacity in locations
    where the Company anticipates retiring certain existing units
    and adding new generation to meet growing demand in the
    Company’s core markets. econrg represents NRG’s
    commitment to environmentally responsible power generation by
    addressing the challenges of climate change, clean air and
    water, and conservation of our natural resources while taking
    advantage of business opportunities that may inure to NRG. NRG
    expects that these efforts will provide some or all of the
    following benefits: improved heat rates; lower delivered costs;
    expanded electricity production capability; improved ability to
    dispatch economically across the regional general portfolio;
    increased technological and fuel diversity; and reduced
    environmental impacts, including facilities that either have
    near zero GHG emissions or can be equipped to capture and
    sequester GHG emissions. In addition, several of the
    Company’s original

Repowering

NRG projects or
    projects commenced under that initiative since its inception may
    qualify for financial support under the infrastructure financing
    component of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act as well
    as other government incentive packages. NRG has several
    applications pending or contemplated.

New Businesses and New Technology

— NRG
    is focused on the development and investment in energy-related
    new businesses and new technologies, including low or no GHG
    emitting energy generating sources, such as nuclear, wind, solar
    thermal, and photovoltaic, as well as other endeavors where the
    benefits of such investments represent significant commercial
    opportunities and create a comparative advantage for the
    Company, such as smart meters, electric vehicle ecosystems, and
    distributed “clean” solutions. The Company has made a
    series of recent advancements in these initiatives, including:
    (i) the acquisition of Bluewater Wind, an offshore wind
    development company; (ii) the acquisition of Blythe Solar,
    the largest photovoltaic solar power facility in California;
    (iii) the commercial operation of the Langford Wind Farm,
    the Company’s third wind farm to be brought online;
    (iv) a partnership between Reliant Energy and the City of
    Houston and a partnership between Reliant Energy and Nissan to
    make Houston, Texas a launch city for the use of electric
    vehicles; and (v) the use of “smart” meters for
    Reliant Energy customers. Furthermore, the Company, supported by
    the econrg initiative, intends to capitalize on the high growth
    opportunities presented by government-mandated renewable
    portfolio standards, tax incentives and loan guaranties for
    renewable energy projects, new technologies and expected future
    carbon regulation.

Company-Wide Initiatives

— In addition,
    the Company’s overall strategy is also supported by Future
    NRG and NRG Global Giving initiatives. Future NRG is the
    Company’s workforce planning and development initiative and
    represents NRG’s strong commitment to planning for future
    staffing requirements to meet the on-going needs of the
    Company’s current operations and initiatives. NRG Global
    Giving is designed to enhance respect for the community, which
    is one of NRG’s core values. The Global Giving Program
    invests NRG’s resources to strengthen


the communities where NRG does business and seeks to make
    community investments in four focus areas: community and
    economic development, education, environment and human welfare.

Business
    Environment

General Industry

— Trends impacting the power
    industry include: (i) financial credit market availability;
    and (ii) increased regulatory and political scrutiny. The
    industry dynamics and external influences that will affect the
    Company and the power generation industry in 2010 and for the
    medium term include:

Consolidation

— Over the long-term, industry
    consolidation is expected to occur, with mergers and
    acquisitions activity in the power generation sector likely to
    involve utility-merchant or merchant-merchant combinations.
    There may also be interest by foreign power companies,
    particularly European utilities, in the American power
    generation sector.

Financial Credit Market Availability

— Power
    generation companies are capital intensive and, as such, rely on
    the credit markets for liquidity and for the financing of power
    generation investments. In addition, economic recessions
    historically result in lower power demand, power prices, and
    fuel prices. During 2009, the nation’s credit markets
    recovered to some extent although credit continued to be tight
    relative to years prior to 2008. As evidence of the
    markets’ improvement, in April 2009, GenConn Energy, a
    joint venture of NRG and the United Illuminating Company, closed
    on a $534 million project financing and NRG was able to
    issue $700 million of bonds in June 2009, with a

10-year

maturity at a yield to maturity of 8.75%. In addition, NRG had
    arranged a Credit Sleeve Reimbursement Agreement, or CSRA, with
    Merrill Lynch to support Reliant Energy after closing the
    acquisition. NRG has a diversified liquidity program, with
    $3.8 billion in total liquidity as of December 31,
    2009, excluding funds deposited by counterparties, and a first
    and second lien structure that enables significant strategic
    hedging while reducing requirements for the posting of cash or
    letters of credit as collateral. NRG transacts with a
    diversified pool of counterparties and actively manages the
    Company’s exposure to any single counterparty. See
    Part II, Item 6 —

Liquidity and Capital
    Resources

, and Part II, Item 6a —

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

for a further discussion.

The addition of Reliant Energy to NRG’s existing generation
    business may provide opportunities to match generation to load
    directly which should reduce hedging and credit costs that both
    businesses would incur if hedged separately. Reliant Energy,
    which expects to lock in its wholesale supply in order to secure
    its margin as load is contracted, should also benefit from
    having better access to nonstandard and longer term products
    necessary to meet load. NRG expects to continue hedging its
    wholesale production consistent with its prior practice, but now
    will benefit from having an additional outlet for its range of
    generation products.

Climate Change

— The U.S. signed the
    Copenhagen Accord, or the Accord, which sets the stage for a
    worldwide approach to this global issue. Under the Accord, the
    U.S. has committed to a 17% reduction from 2005 emission
    levels of GHGs by 2020. While Congress was unable to come to
    agreement on climate legislation in 2009, the subject continues
    to be a topic for consideration in 2010. Lack of legislation
    will prolong the uncertainty of the nature and timing of GHG
    requirements and their resulting impact on NRG.

Climate change efforts continued outside of the legislature. The
    RGGI

cap-and-trade

program, in which NRG’s emissions of
    CO


were 8 million tonnes in 2009, ended its first year with
    low allowance prices, nearing the reserve floor. This trend is
    expected to continue in the short term while the region works
    through the recession and increased use of renewable energy.
    California continues to develop their program for 2012
    implementation. In addition to regional efforts, the
    U.S. EPA moved forward with a finding that GHGs do pose a
    threat to public health and welfare and light duty tailpipe
    regulations. These efforts will ultimately trigger the
    application of existing GHG permitting requirements for new and
    modified stationary sources like power plants, although the
    effective date and specifics of implementation lack clarity. The
    impact to NRG is dependent on the timing and implementation of
    PSD/NSR and Title V permit requirements with regard to GHGs
    and any future actions taken by the U.S. EPA.

In 2009, in the course of producing approximately
    71 million MWh of electricity, NRG’s power plants
    emitted 59 million tonnes of
    CO


,
    of which 53 million tonnes were emitted in the U.S.,
    3 million tonnes in Germany and 3 million tonnes in
    Australia. The impact from legislation or federal, regional or
    state regulation of GHGs on the Company’s financial
    performance will depend on a number of factors, including the
    overall level of GHG reductions


required under any such regulations, the price and availability
    of offsets, and the extent to which NRG would be entitled to
    receive
    CO


emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an
    auction or on the open market. Thereafter, under any such
    legislation or regulation, the impact on NRG would depend on the
    Company’s level of success in developing and deploying low
    and no carbon technologies such as those being pursued as part
    of the

Repowering

NRG. Additionally, NRG’s current
    contracts with its South Central region’s cooperative
    customers allows for the recovery of emission-based costs.

Environmental Regulatory Landscape

— A number
    of regulations that could significantly impact the power
    generation industry are in development or under review by the
    U.S. EPA: CAIR, MACT, NAAQS revisions, coal combustion
    wastes, once-through cooling, and GHG regulations. While most of
    these regulations have been considered for some time, they are
    expected to gain clarity in 2010 through 2011. The timing and
    stringency of these regulations will provide a framework for the
    retrofit of existing fossil plants and deployment of new,
    cleaner technologies in the next decade. The Company has
    included capital to meet anticipated CAIR Phase I and II, MACT
    standards for mercury, and the installation of “Best
    Technology Available” under the 316(b) Rule in the current
    estimated environmental capital expenditure. While the Company
    cannot predict the impact of future regulations and would likely
    face additional investments over time, these expenditures,
    combined with the Company’s already existing air quality
    controls; use of Powder River Basin coal; closed cycle cooling;
    and dry ash handling systems, position NRG well to meet more
    stringent requirements.

Public Policy Support and Government Financial
    Incentives

— The economic crisis, a changing
    public policy environment, and the current political climate
    have led to a shift away from utility investment in traditional
    fossil-fueled coal and natural gas-fired capacity and towards
    investment in non-traditional capacity, including renewable
    technologies, demand-side resources and nuclear. Generous public
    support, in the form of tax credits, loan guarantees,
    depreciation tax benefits, renewable energy credits, or RECs,
    and various other state and local incentives, are now available
    to builders of renewable electric generation. State Renewable
    Portfolio Standards, or RPS, requirements are now “on the
    books” in 28 states requiring load-serving entities to
    eventually source large percentages of their supply requirements
    from renewable sources or by purchasing REC credits, and federal
    requirements may follow. Designers of capacity markets in the
    Northeast region have attempted to improve the position of
    demand side resources relative to peaking capacity by holding
    these resources to a less stringent deliverability standard.
    Finally, the threat of carbon policy has had a
    “chilling” effect on new fossil generation supply
    additions, while encouraging all zero-carbon sources. These
    developments are likely to increase the role of renewable energy
    in the next energy commodity cycle, driving changes in wholesale
    market dynamics as renewable market share rises.

Infrastructure Development

— In the recent
    recessionary environment, the U.S. has experienced a
    contraction in demand, led primarily by reduced industrial
    demand in the manufacturing, chemical and petrochemical
    industries. As a result of lower demand and a proliferation of
    new natural gas supply from shale gas reserves, near term gas
    and power markets have experienced lower prices thus causing
    delays and cancellations of new generation supply and
    transmission investments. The Company expects recovery from the
    recession could lead to demand recovery and a trending back
    toward normalized growth rates spurring the need for additional
    generation supply. The potential for future federal carbon
    legislation and more restrictive environmental regulations could
    cause a rebalancing of the generation sector with older less
    efficient coal plants risking retirement and new infrastructure
    capital being deployed into low carbon technology in the form of
    baseload nuclear, renewable energy projects, and high efficiency
    (quick start) natural gas units. Government sponsored subsidies
    in the form of cash grants, investment tax credits and loan
    guarantees along with improved environmental policy clarity will
    continue to be crucial to help finance additional generation
    investment.

Natural Gas Market

— The price of natural gas
    plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in
    many of the regions where NRG operates power plants. Natural gas
    prices are driven by many variables including demand from
    industrial, residential; and electric sectors; productivity
    across natural gas supply basins; fixed and variable costs of
    natural gas production; changes in pipeline infrastructure, and
    the financial and hedging profile of natural gas consumers and
    producers. In 2009, domestic natural gas supply increased, while
    demand decreased in the wake of the recession, leading to a fall
    in natural gas prices when compared to 2008. The increase in
    natural gas supply was due to increased production from
    unconventional resources, particularly the shale basins, and
    from the low variable costs of extraction from these resources.
    The Company expects rebalancing of the natural gas market to


continue, and a price recovery could be driven by supply cuts as
    producer hedges roll-off and variable costs rise above market
    prices.

Electricity Prices

— The price of electricity
    is a key determinant of the profitability of the Company’s
    generation portfolio. In 2009, prices for electricity were lower
    than in 2008, affected by both lower prices for natural gas and
    lower electric demand due largely to the recession. As general
    economic conditions improve, NRG expects to see a similar
    recovery in electric demand. The following table summarizes
    average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in
    which NRG operates for the years ended December 31, 2009,

Competition

Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive,
    commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants.
    NRG competes on the basis of the location of its plants and
    ownership of multiple plants in various regions, which increases
    the stability and reliability of its energy supply. Wholesale
    power generation is basically a local business that is currently
    highly fragmented relative to other commodity industries and
    diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide
    variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature, and
    identity of the companies NRG competes with depending on the
    market.

The deregulated retail energy business in ERCOT is a competitive
    business. In general, competition in the retail energy business
    is on the basis of price, service, brand image, product
    offerings, and market perceptions of creditworthiness. Reliant
    Energy sells electricity pursuant to fixed price or indexed
    products, and customers elect terms of service typically ranging
    from one month to five years. Reliant Energy’s rates are
    market-based rates, and not subject to traditional

cost-of-service

regulation by the PUCT. Non-affiliated transmission and
    distribution service companies provide, on a non-discriminatory
    basis, the wires and metering services necessary to access
    customers.

Weather

Weather conditions in the different regions of the
    U.S. influence the financial results of NRG’s
    businesses. Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand
    for electricity and fuels. Changes in energy supply and demand
    may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the
    spot and forward markets, which may affect the Company’s
    results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price
    of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons,
    when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of
    natural gas and oil are higher in the winter. However, all
    regions of North America typically do not experience extreme
    weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG is typically not
    exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its
    business at once.

Other
    Factors

A number of other factors significantly influence the level and
    volatility of prices for energy commodities and related
    derivative products for NRG’s business. These factors
    include:

•

seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand;

•

extreme peak demands;

•

available supply resources;

•

transportation and transmission availability and reliability
    within and between regions;


•

location of NRG’s generating facilities relative to the
    location of its load-serving opportunities;

•

procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical
    electricity system during extreme conditions; and

•

changes in the nature and extent of federal and state
    regulations.

These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices
    in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may
    vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences
    in:

•

weather conditions;

•

market liquidity;

•

capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas
    systems;

•

local transportation systems; and

•

the nature and extent of electricity deregulation.

    the Company’s financial results.

NINA

— On December 30, 2009, NINA
    had received an estimate from TANE, the prime contractor,
    containing the overnight estimate of the EPC Cost. The estimate
    was approximately $11.5 billion for STP Units 3 and 4 with
    an opportunity to reduce cost subject to certain specification
    changes. Based on the estimate provided by TANE and the
    Company’s internal assessments, NINA continues to believe
    that NRG’s stated target of $9.8 billion or $3,229/kW
    based on 3,000 MW gross output is achievable. Cost
    reductions will be achieved through a combination of
    specification changes and the re-alignment of risks and
    responsibilities among key project stakeholders.

Owners’ Costs for the project, on an escalated basis, are
    estimated to total approximately $2.1 billion during the
    construction period. This is primarily comprised of the costs
    for NRG’s agent STPNOC, owners’ contingency and the
    initial fuel load. Financing Costs are estimated to be
    approximately $1.5 billion during the construction period,
    and are comprised of the variables described above.

On February 17, 2010, an agreement in principle was reached
    with CPS for NINA to acquire a controlling interest in the
    project to construct STP Units 3 and 4 through a settlement of
    the litigation between the parties. As part of the agreement,
    NINA would increase its ownership in the STP Units 3 and 4
    project from 50% to 92.375% and would assume full management
    control of the project. NINA would also pay $80 million to
    CPS, subject to receipt of a conditional DOE loan guarantee. The
    first $40 million would be promptly paid after receipt of
    the guarantee and the other half six months later. An additional
    $10 million would be donated by NRG over four years in
    annual payments of $2.5 million to the Residential Energy
    Assistance Partnership in San Antonio. As part of the
    agreement with CPS, all litigation would be dismissed with
    prejudice. The parties continue to negotiate terms regarding
    final documentation of the agreement in principle.

The agreement would enable the STP Unit 3 and 4 project
    expansion to move forward and allow NINA to continuing pursuing
    its application for a conditional loan guarantee from the DOE.
    If NINA is not successful in reaching a final agreement with
    CPS, obtaining a conditional loan guarantee, or selling down its
    interest in STP Units 3 and 4, there could be negative
    implications for the project that may result in a reassessment
    of the probability of success of the project and an impairment
    of the value of the capitalized assets for STP Units 3 and 4. An
    impairment would result in a permanent

write-down

of the $299 million of

construction-in-progress

capitalized through December 31, 2009, plus any amounts
    capitalized through the impairment date.


Impact
    of inflation on NRG’s results

Unless discussed specifically in the relevant segment, for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the impact of
    inflation and changing prices (due to changes in exchange rates)
    on NRG’s revenues and income from continuing operations was
    immaterial.

Capital
    Allocation Program

NRG’s capital allocation philosophy includes reinvestment
    in its core facilities, maintenance of prudent debt levels and
    interest coverage, the regular return of capital to shareholders
    and investment in repowering opportunities. As part of the 2010
    program, the Company will invest approximately $474 million
    in maintenance and environmental capital expenditures in the
    existing assets and $707 million in projects under

Repowering

NRG that are currently under construction or
    for which there exists current obligations. Finally, in addition
    to scheduled debt amortization payment, in the first quarter
    2010 the Company will offer its first lien lenders
    $430 million of its 2009 excess cash flow (as defined in
    the Senior Credit Facility) of which the Company made a
    prepayment of $200 million in December 2009.

Significant
    events during the year ended December 31,

Results
    of Operations and Financial Condition

•

Acquisition of Reliant Energy

— On May 1,
    2009, NRG acquired Reliant Energy, which consisted of the entire
    Texas electric retail business operation of RRI, for cash
    consideration of $360 million, net of cash acquired. During
    the eight months ended December 31, 2009, Reliant Energy
    added $4.4 billion in retail revenue and $3.5 billion
    in cost of sales to the Company’s results. In addition, NRG
    incurred non-recurring acquisition-related transaction and
    integration costs which totaled $54 million for the eight
    months ended December 31, 2009.

•

Lower energy revenue

— Energy revenues
    decreased $1.5 billion as a result of reduced energy prices
    as well as lower generation. The reduced energy prices were
    caused by lower average natural gas prices of approximately 56%.
    The reduction in generation was driven by weakened demand for
    power due to the recessionary economy.

•

Lower capacity revenue

— Capacity revenue
    decreased $329 million as a result of a lower portion of
    baseload contracts in the Texas region containing a capacity
    component.

•

Higher selling, general and administrative

—
    The Company’s total selling, general and administrative
    expense increased in 2009 by $231 million. For the eight
    months ended December 31, 2009, Reliant Energy selling,
    general and administrative expense totaled $203 million,
    including $61 million of bad debt expense. Also included in
    2009 results was the non-recurring cost of the Exelon’s
    exchange offer and proxy contest efforts of $31 million.

•

Liquidity position

— The Company’s total
    liquidity, excluding collateral received, rose $430 million
    in 2009. Cash balances grew by $810 million since the end
    of 2008 as $2.1 billion of cash provided by operating
    activities exceeded cash used including $734 million of
    capital expenditures, $644 million in debt payments,
    $500 million in treasury share payments, and
    $427 million in business acquisitions offset by the
    proceeds from the sale of MIBRAG of $284 million and the
    proceeds from the issuance of debt of $892 million.

•

Purchase of treasury shares

— During 2009, the
    Company repurchased 19,305,500 shares of common stock under
    its capital allocation plan for a total of $500 million.

•

Preferred Stock conversion

— On March 16,
    2009, all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s 5.75%
    Preferred Stock were converted into common stock for
    $447 million. During 2009, a total of 265,870 shares
    of Company’s 4% Preferred Stock were converted into common
    stock for $257 million.

•

Sale of MIBRAG

— In 2009, the Company sold its
    50% ownership interest in MIBRAG, to a consortium of
    Severoćeské doly Chomutov, a member of the CEZ Group,
    and J&T Group. For its share, NRG received proceeds of
    $284 million, net of transaction costs and realized a
    $128 million gain on sale of the equity method investment.


•

Issuance of 2019 Senior Notes

— In June 2009,
    NRG completed the issuance of $700 million aggregate
    principal amount of 8.5% Senior Notes due 2019, or 2019
    Senior Notes. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds of
    $678 million to facilitate the early termination of
    NRG’s obligations pursuant to the CSRA Amendment, which
    became effective October 5, 2009.

•

Merrill Lynch Credit Sleeve Facility

— On
    May 1, 2009, NRG arranged with Merrill Lynch to provide
    continuing credit support to Reliant Energy after closing the
    acquisition. In connection with entering into a transitional
    credit sleeve facility, or CSRA, NRG contributed
    $200 million of cash to Reliant Energy. In conjunction with
    the CSRA, NRG Power Marketing LLC, or PML, and Reliant Energy
    Power Supply LLC, or REPS, modified or novated certain
    transactions with counterparties to transfer PML’s

in-the-money

transactions to REPS and moved $522 million of cash
    collateral held by NRG to Merrill Lynch, thereby reducing
    Merrill Lynch’s actual and contingent collateral supporting
    Reliant Energy

out-of-money

positions. Effective October 5, 2009, the Company then
    executed the CSRA Amendment. In connection with this
    transaction, the Company posted $366 million of cash
    collateral to Merrill Lynch and other counterparties, returned
    $53 million of counterparty collateral, issued
    $206 million of letters of credit, and received
    $45 million of counterparty collateral. In addition,
    Merrill Lynch returned $250 million of previously posted
    cash collateral, and released liens on $322 million of
    unrestricted cash held by Reliant Energy. Upon execution of the
    CSRA Amendment, the Company was required to post collateral for
    any net liability derivatives, and other static margin
    associated with supply for Reliant Energy.

•

GenConn LLC related financings

— In April 2009,
    NRG Connecticut Peaking LLC., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG,
    executed an equity bridge loan facility, or EBL, in the amount
    of $121.5 million from a syndicate of banks. The purpose of
    the EBL is to fund the Company’s proportionate share of the
    project construction costs required to be contributed into
    GenConn. Also in April 2009, GenConn secured financing for 50%
    of the Devon and Middletown project construction costs through a

7-year

term
    loan facility, and also entered into a

5-year

revolving working capital loan and letter of credit facility.
    The aggregate credit amount secured is $291 million,
    including $48 million for the revolving facility. In August
    2009, GenConn began to draw under the secured financing to cover
    costs related to the Devon project and as of December 31,
    2009, has drawn $48 million.

Other

•

NINA

— On February 24, 2009, NINA executed
    an EPC agreement with TANE to build the STP expansion.
    Concurrent with the execution of the EPC agreement, NINA entered
    into a $500 million credit facility with Toshiba to finance
    the cost of long-lead materials for STP Units 3 and 4.

•

Cedar Bayou Generating Station

— In June 2009,
    NRG and Optim Energy, LLC, or Optim Energy, completed
    construction and began commercial operation of a new natural
    gas-fueled combined cycle generating plant at NRG’s Cedar
    Bayou Generating Station in Chambers County, Texas. NRG and
    Optim Energy have a 50/50 undivided interest basis in the
    520 MW generating plant. NRG is the operator of the plant
    and Optim Energy is acting as energy manager for Cedar Bayou
    unit 4. Cedar Bayou unit 4 is providing the Company a net
    capacity of 260 MW given NRG’s 50% ownership.

•

Langford Wind Project

— In December 2009, NRG
    completed its Langford project, a wholly-owned 150 MW wind
    farm located in Tom Green, Irion, and Schleicher Counties,
    Texas. The Company funded and developed this wind farm which
    consists of 100 General Electric 1.5 MW wind turbines. The
    project is eligible for a cash grant from the Department of
    Treasury and NRG has filed an application for an
    $84 million grant.

•

Acquisition and completion of Blythe Solar

— On
    November 20, 2009, NRG acquired through its wholly-owned
    subsidiary NRG Solar LLC, FSE Blythe 1, LLC, or Blythe Solar,
    from First Solar, Inc. On December 18, 2009, construction
    was completed and commercial operation began for the 20 MW
    utility-scale photovoltaic, or PV, solar facility located in
    Riverside County in southeastern California. The project is
    eligible for a cash grant from the Department of Treasury and
    NRG will file an application for an $18 million grant.

•

Unsolicited Exelon Proposal

— On
    October 19, 2008, the Company received an unsolicited
    proposal from Exelon Corporation to acquire all of the
    outstanding shares of the Company and on November 12, 2008,
    Exelon announced a tender offer for all of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock. NRG’s Board of


Directors, after carefully reviewing the proposal, unanimously
    concluded that the proposal was not in the best interests of the
    stockholders and recommended that NRG stockholders not tender
    their shares. In addition, on June 17, 2009, Exelon filed a
    Definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC presenting their
    proposals for the Company’s 2009 Annual Meeting of
    Stockholders. NRG’s Board of Directors recommended a vote
    against each of their proposals. On July 2, 2009, Exelon
    revised their unsolicited proposal and NRG’s Board of
    Directors, after carefully reviewing the proposal, unanimously
    concluded that the proposal was not in the best interests of the
    stockholders and recommended that NRG stockholders not tender
    their shares. On July 21, 2009, stockholders voted to
    re-elect all of the Company’s director nominees to the NRG
    Board of Directors and rejected Exelon’s proposals. On
    July 21, 2009, Exelon Corporation announced that in light
    of the vote results, effective immediately, it terminated its
    offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of NRG. The total
    defense costs associated with Exelon’s unsolicited proposal
    was approximately $39 million for the period
    October 1, 2008, through December 31, 2009, of which
    $31 million was for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Retail revenue

— the acquisition of Reliant
    Energy contributed $4.4 billion of retail revenue during
    the eight months ended December 31, 2009. Retail revenue
    includes Mass revenues of $2.6 billion, C&I revenues
    of $1.6 billion, and supply management revenues of
    $251 million.

•

Energy revenue

— decreased $1.5 billion
    during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the
    same period in 2008:

○

Texas

— decreased by $431 million, with
    $253 million of the decrease driven by lower average
    realized energy prices, $116 million of the decrease driven
    by a reduction in generation, and a $62 million decrease in
    margin on MWh sold from purchased energy. The average realized
    energy price decreased by 9%, driven by a 45% decrease in
    merchant prices, offset by a 23% increase in contract prices.
    Lower merchant prices were driven by the combination of lower
    gas prices in 2009 and unusually high pricing events that
    occurred in 2008 that did not repeat in 2009. Generation
    decreased by 4% driven by a 9% decrease in coal plant
    generation. This decrease in generation was offset by a 12%
    increase in gas plant generation primarily from Cedar Bayou 4
    gas plant, and generation from Elbow Creek and Langford wind
    farms, none of which were in operation in 2008. Coal plant
    generation was adversely affected by lower energy prices driven
    by a 56% decrease in average natural gas prices in combination
    with increased wind generation which shifted the coal
    unit’s position in the bid stack, negatively affecting coal
    plant generation.


○

Northeast

— decreased by $575 million,
    with $295 million of the decrease driven by lower energy
    prices and $334 million of the decrease attributable to a
    reduction in generation offset by a $54 million increase
    from higher net contract revenue. Merchant energy prices were
    lower by an average of 40%. The lower energy prices reduced the
    Company’s net cost incurred to meet obligations under load
    serving contracts in the PJM market. Generation decreased by
    31%, with a 31% decrease in coal generation and a 31% decrease
    in oil and gas generation. Weakened demand for power combined
    with lower gas prices resulted in reduced merchant energy
    prices. Lower merchant energy prices combined with higher costs
    of production from the introduction of RGGI resulted in
    increased hours where the coal plants were uneconomical to
    dispatch. The decline in oil and gas generation is attributable
    to fewer reliability run hours at Norwalk plant and higher
    maintenance work at Arthur Kill.

○

South Central

— decreased by $118 million
    due to a $80 million decline in contract revenue, a
    $2 million decrease in merchant energy revenues and a
    $36 million decrease in margin on MWh sold from purchased
    energy. The contract revenue decrease was attributed to a 10%
    decrease in sales volumes and a $5.15 per MWh lower average
    realized price. The decline in contract energy price was driven
    by a $16 million decrease in fuel cost pass-through to the
    cooperatives reflecting an overall decline in natural gas
    prices. Also contributing to the decline in contract revenue was
    $60 million due to the expiration of a contract with a
    regional utility. The expiration of the contract allowed more
    energy to be sold into the merchant market, but at lower average
    prices resulting in a $2 million decline in revenue.
    Increased use of the region’s tolled facility provided
    additional energy to the merchant market.

○

Intercompany energy revenue

— intercompany
    sales of $349 million by the Company’s Texas region to
    Reliant Energy were eliminated in consolidation.

•

Capacity revenue

— decreased $329 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the
    same period in 2008:

○

Texas

— decreased by $300 million due to a
    lower proportion of baseload contracts which contain a capacity
    component.

○

Northeast

— decreased by $8 million due to
    lower capacity prices in the NYISO.

○

South Central

— increased by $36 million
    resulting primarily from a new capacity agreement.

○

Intercompany capacity revenue

— intercompany
    capacity revenue of $47 million by the Company’s Texas
    region to Reliant Energy were eliminated in consolidation.

•

Contract amortization revenue

— decreased by
    $457 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, as
    compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease resulted from
    a reduction of $198 million in revenue from the Texas Genco
    acquisition due to the lower volume of contracted energy. Also
    reducing contract amortization revenue was the amortization
    expense of net in-market C&I contracts related to the
    Reliant Energy acquisition of $258 million.

•

Other revenues

— decreased by $85 million
    driven by $51 million in lower ancillary revenue,
    $51 million in lower emissions revenue, and a
    $18 million decrease in fuels trading. Lower ancillary
    revenue was driven by a lesser load on the power grid as opposed
    to 2008 and lower ancillary prices. Lower emissions revenue was
    driven by lower carbon financial instrument sales and a loss on
    emission allowance sales. These decreases were offset by the
    recognition of a $31 million non-cash gain related to
    settlement of a pre-existing

in-the-money

contract with Reliant Energy at the time of acquisition. Other
    revenue also included $3 million in intercompany ancillary
    services in 2009 by the Company’s Texas region and Reliant
    Energy that were eliminated in consolidation.

Cost
    of Operations

Cost of operations, excluding risk management activities,
    increased $2.1 billion during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008 and
    increased as a percentage of revenues to 66% for 2009 as
    compared to 56% for 2008.


•

Cost of sales

— increased $1.9 billion
    during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the
    same period in 2008, and increased as a percentage of revenues
    to 53% for 2009 as compared to 41% for 2008 due to:

○

Retail

— Reliant Energy incurred
    $3 billion of cost of energy during the eight months ended
    December 31, 2009, which included $399 million of
    intercompany supply costs.

○

Texas

— cost of energy decreased
    $305 million due to lower natural gas, coal, purchased
    energy and ancillary services costs.

—

Fuel expense

— Natural gas costs decreased
    $281 million, reflecting a 56% decline in average natural
    gas per MMBtu prices offset by a 12% increase in gas-fired
    generation. Coal costs increased by $5 million driven by a
    $44 million increase from higher coal prices and a
    $9 million increase in higher transportation costs. These
    increases were offset by a $28 million decrease from lower
    coal volume resulting from reduced generation and a
    $15 million loss reserve related to a coal contract dispute
    in 2008.

—

Ancillary service expense

— Ancillary service
    costs decreased $44 million due to a decrease in purchased
    ancillary service costs incurred to meet contract obligations.

○

Northeast

— cost of energy decreased
    $295 million due to a $187 million reduction in
    natural gas and oil costs and a $129 million reduction in
    coal costs.

—

Fuel expense

— Natural gas and oil costs
    decreased due to 31% lower generation and 56% lower average
    natural gas prices.

—

Coal costs

—

decreased primarily due to 31% lower coal generation.

—

RGGI expense

— These decreases were offset by a
    $22 million increase in costs related to RGGI which became
    effective in 2009.

○

South Central

— cost of energy decreased
    $90 million due to a $58 million decrease in purchased
    energy reflecting lower fuel costs associated with the
    region’s tolled facility and lower market energy prices, a
    $15 million decrease in natural gas costs, an
    $11 million decrease in coal costs, and an $8 million
    decrease in transmission expense due to transmission line
    outages. The decrease in natural gas cost is attributable to a
    30% decrease in owned gas generation and a 54% decrease in
    natural gas prices. The coal cost decreased due to a 6% decrease
    in generation offset by a 1% increase in price.

○

West

— cost of energy decreased $6 million
    due to a 29% decline in average natural gas per MMBtu prices
    offset by an 8% increase in natural gas consumption and a
    $3 million increase in fuel oil expense resulting from a
    write-down to market of fuel oil inventory no longer used in the
    production of energy.

○

Intercompany cost of energy

— intercompany
    purchases of $399 million by Reliant Energy from the
    Company’s Texas region were eliminated in consolidation.

•

Other cost of operations

— increased
    $180 million during the year ended December 31, 2009,
    compared to the same period in 2008. Reliant Energy incurred
    $153 million which includes $98 million for customer
    service operations and $55 million for gross receipt tax on
    revenue. Further, property taxes increased by $14 million
    due to reduction in eligibility related to Empire Zone tax
    credits in New York. Plant maintenance expenses were relatively
    flat during the period, however these expenses decreased in
    Northeast region by $22 million offset by an increase of
    $11 million in West region, a $6 million increase in
    South Central region and a $3 million increase in Texas
    region. In addition, NRG incurred a $12 million asset
    write-down due to the expected cancellation of the Indian River
    Unit 3 air pollution control equipment project and the
    consequent write-off of previously incurred construction costs.


Risk
    Management Activities

Risk management activities include economic hedges that did not
    qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, ineffectiveness on cash
    flow hedges, and trading activities. Total derivative gains
    increased by $338 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. The

The $114 million

mark-to-market

gain in revenue related to economic hedges consisted of a
    $217 million gain recognized in earnings from previously
    deferred amounts in other comprehensive income, or OCI, as the
    Company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting in the first
    quarter for certain 2009 transactions in Texas and New York due
    to lower expected generation, offset by a $103 million
    decrease in value in forward sales of electricity and fuel
    relating to economic hedges due to lower forward power and gas
    prices. The $47 million mark-to-market loss in expense
    related to economic hedges consisted of a $18 million
    decrease in value of forward purchases of electricity and fuel
    and a loss of $29 million resulting from discontinued
    Normal Purchase Normal Sale, or NPNS, designated coal purchases
    due to expected lower coal consumption and accordingly, the
    Company could not assert taking physical delivery of coal
    purchase transactions under NPNS designation.

Reliant Energy’s loss positions were acquired as of
    May 1, 2009, and valued using forward prices on that date.
    The $656 million roll-off amounts were offset by realized
    losses at the settled prices and higher costs of physical power
    which are reflected in revenues and cost of operations during
    the same period. The $104 million gain from the reversal of
    a loss was offset by a realized loss at the settled prices and
    are reflected in cost of operations during the same period.

Since these hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk
    of commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy, the
    changes in such results should not be viewed in isolation, but
    rather should be taken together with the effects of pricing and
    cost changes on energy revenue and costs. During and prior to
    2009, NRG hedged a portion of the Company’s 2009 through
    2013 generation. During 2009, the settled prices of electricity
    and natural gas decreased resulting in the recognition of
    realized gains while forward power and gas prices decreased
    resulting in the recognition of unrealized

mark-to-market

gains. During 2008, decreasing forward prices of electricity and
    natural gas resulted in recognition of unrealized

mark-to-market

gains while the settled prices for power and gas increased
    resulting in the recognition of realized losses.

In accordance with ASC

815-10-45-9,

the following table represents the results of the Company’s
    financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, and 2008. The realized
    financial trading results and unrealized financial and physical
    trading results are included in the risk management activities


above, while the realized physical trading results are included
    in energy revenue. The Company’s trading activities are

Depreciation
    and Amortization

NRG’s depreciation and amortization expense increased by
    $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    compared to the same period in 2008. Reliant Energy’s
    depreciation and amortization expense for the eight month period
    was $137 million principally for amortization of customer
    relationships. The balance of the increase was due to
    depreciation on the baghouse projects in western New York and
    the Elbow Creek project which came online in late 2008, and the
    Cedar Bayou 4 plant which came online in the second quarter 2009.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by
    $231 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    compared to the same period in 2008 and increased as a
    percentage of revenues to 6% for 2009 from 5% for 2008. The
    increase was due to:

•

Reliant Energy’s selling, general and administrative
    expense

— totaled $203 million, including
    $61 million of bad debt expense incurred during the eight
    months ended December 31, 2009.

•

Wage and benefits expense

— increased
    $19 million.

•

Consultant costs

— increased $12 million
    consisting of a rise in non-recurring costs related to
    Exelon’s exchange offer and proxy contest efforts of
    $23 million offset by a decrease in other consulting costs
    of $11 million.

Acquisition-Related
    Transaction and Integration Costs

NRG incurred Reliant Energy acquisition-related transaction
    costs of $23 million and integration costs of
    $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Equity
    in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates

NRG’s equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates
    decreased by $18 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008.
    During 2009, the Company’s share in Gladstone Power Station
    and MIBRAG decreased by $4 million and $16 million,
    respectively. These decreases were offset by the Company’s
    share of NRG Saguaro, LLC earnings increasing $11 million
    in 2009 as compared to 2008. In addition, there was a
    $6 million decrease in Sherbino’s

mark-to-market

unrealized loss as compared to 2008 as a result of a natural gas
    swap executed to hedge to future power generation.

Gain
    on Sale of Equity Method Investments and Other Income/(Loss),
    Net

NRG’s gain on sale of equity method investments was
    $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
    Other income/(loss), net decreased by $22 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period
    in 2008. The 2009 amounts include a $128 million gain on
    the sale of NRG’s 50% ownership interest in MIBRAG and a
    $24 million realized loss on a forward contract for foreign
    currency executed to hedge the sale proceeds from the MIBRAG
    sale. In addition, interest income for 2009 was reduced by
    $17 million as compared to


2008 due to lower interest rates. Further in 2008, a
    $23 million impairment charge was incurred to restructure
    distressed investments in commercial paper.

Refinancing
    Expenses

In 2009, NRG incurred a $20 million expense associated with
    the unwind of CSRA with Merrill Lynch. There were no such
    expenses in 2008.

Interest
    Expense

NRG’s interest expense increased by $51 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same
    period in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a
    $32 million increase in fees incurred during the months of
    May through December of 2009 on the CSRA facility, a
    $34 million increase in interest expense as a result of the
    2019 Senior Notes issued in June 2009, a $4 million
    increase related to ineffective portion of the interest rate
    cash flow hedges on the Company’s Term Loan Facility and an
    $8 million increase in the amortization of deferred
    financing costs. These increases were offset by a
    $33 million decrease in interest expense on the
    Company’s Term Loan Facility due to a decrease in the
    outstanding notional amount and lower interest rates related to
    the unhedged portion of Term Loan and fair value portion of
    Senior Notes.

Income
    Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased by $15 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, compared to 2008. The effective
    tax rate was 43.6% and 40.4% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Effective income tax rate

43.6

%

40.4

%

The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the
    U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to:

•

Valuation Allowance

— The Company generated
    capital losses in 2009 primarily due to the derivative contracts
    that are eligible for capital treatment for tax purposes. The
    valuation allowance is recorded primarily against capital loss
    carryforwards. This resulted in an increase of $127 million
    in income tax expense in 2009.

•

Tax Expense Reduction

— The Company recorded a
    lower federal and state tax expense of $35 million
    primarily due to lower pre-tax earnings.

•

Change in state effective tax rate

— The
    Company decreased its estimated effective tax rate to 3% due to
    increased operational activities within the state of Texas
    resulting from the acquisition of Reliant Energy. This resulted
    in a tax benefit of $5 million.


•

Foreign Operations

— The Company elected not to
    permanently reinvest its earnings from foreign operations in
    2008. In 2009, the Company sold its investment in the MIBRAG
    facility for a book gain of $128 million and no tax gain
    which resulted in minimal tax due in the local jurisdiction.

The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period
    depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business
    mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances
    in accordance with ASC-740

, Income Taxes

, or ASC 740.
    These factors and others, including the Company’s history
    of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in
    assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $896 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007. This was due to:

•

Energy revenue

— increased $254 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the
    same period in 2007:

○

Texas

— increased $172 million, with
    $430 million of this increase driven by higher prices,
    offset by $42 million reduced generation and a
    $216 million decrease on net margin on MWh sold from market
    purchases. The price variance was attributable to a more
    favorable mix of merchant versus contract sales, as well as a
    28% increase in merchant prices partially offset by a 14%
    decrease in contract energy prices. The 839 thousand MWh or 2%
    reduction in generation was comprised of a 3% reduction from
    nuclear plant generation, a 14% reduction from gas plant
    generation, offset by a 1% increase in coal plant generation.
    The reduction in gas plant generation was attributable to the
    effects of hurricane Ike in September 2008.

○

Northeast

— decreased $40 million, with
    $66 million reduced generation, a $38 million decrease
    from lower net contract revenue offset by a $64 million
    increase driven by higher energy prices. The decline due to
    generation was driven by a net 6% reduction in the region’s
    generation, due to a decrease in oil-fired generation as a
    result of higher average oil prices as well as decrease in
    gas-fired generation related to a cooler summer in 2008 compared
    to 2007. The increase due to energy prices reflects an average
    6% rise in merchant energy prices offset by lower contract
    revenue, driven by higher costs required to service the PJM
    contracts, as a result of the increase in market energy prices.

○

South Central

— increased $74 million,
    attributable to a $41 million increase caused by higher
    energy prices and a $33 million increase on net margin on
    MWh sold from market purchases. The growth in merchant energy
    revenues reflected 577 thousand more merchant MWh sold, as a
    decrease in contract load MWh allowed more sales to the merchant
    market at higher prices.

○

West

— increased $35 million due to the
    dispatch of the El Segundo plant outside of the tolling
    agreement in 2008. In 2007, no such dispatch occurred.

•

Capacity revenue

— increased $163 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the
    same period in 2007:

○

Texas

— increased $130 million due to a
    greater proportion of base-load contracts, which contain a
    capacity component.

○

Northeast

— increased $13 million
    reflecting $31 million higher capacity revenues in the PJM
    and NEPOOL markets offset by a $18 million reduction in
    capacity revenue in NYISO.

○

South Central

— increased $12 million due
    to a $10 million higher capacity payment from the
    region’s cooperative customers and an $8 million rise
    in RPM capacity payments from the PJM market. These increases
    were offset by a $6 million reduction related to lower
    contract volume to other customers.

○

West

— increased $3 million due to a
    tolling arrangement at Long Beach plant offset by the reduction
    of revenue from the El Segundo tolling arrangement.

•

Contract amortization revenue

— increased
    $36 million during the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to the same period in 2007 due to the volume of
    contracted energy affected by a greater spread between contract
    prices and market prices used in the Texas Genco purchase
    accounting.

•

Other revenues

— increased by $40 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the
    same period in 2007. The increases arose from greater ancillary
    services revenue of $28 million and increased activity in
    the trading of emission allowances and carbon financial
    instruments of $21 million. These increases were offset by
    $14 million in lower gas and coal trading activities.


Cost
    of Operations

Cost of operations excluding risk management activities,
    increased $220 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007 and
    remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 56% for 2008 and
    2007.

•

Cost of energy

— increased $213 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the
    same period in 2007 and remained flat as a percentage of
    revenues at 41% for 2008 and 2007. This increase was due to :

○

Texas

— Cost of energy increased
    $59 million due to a net increase in fuel expense and
    ancillary service costs offset by reductions in nuclear fuel
    expenses, purchased power expense and amortization of contracts
    cost.

—

Fuel expense

— Natural gas costs rose
    $99 million due to an increase of 28% in average natural
    gas prices, offset by a 14% decrease in gas-fired generation. In
    addition, coal costs increased by $44 million as a result
    of higher coal prices and the settlement payment related to a
    coal contract dispute. These increases were offset by a decrease
    of $19 million in nuclear fuel expense as amortization of
    nuclear fuel inventory established under Texas Genco purchase
    accounting ended in early 2008.

—

Purchased energy

— Purchased energy expense
    decreased $26 million as a result of lower forced outage
    rates at the region’s base-load plants.

—

Ancillary service expense

— Ancillary services
    and other costs increased by $14 million as a result of
    higher ERCOT ISO fees offset by reduced purchased ancillary
    services costs.

—

Fuel contract amortization

— Amortized contract
    costs decreased by $59 million due to a $36 million
    decrease in the amortization of water supply contracts which
    ended in 2007. In addition, the amortization of coal contracts
    decreased by a net $22 million as a result of a reduction
    in expense related to

in-the-money

coal contract amortization. These contracts were established
    under Texas Genco purchase accounting.

○

Northeast

— Cost of energy increased
    $54 million due to higher fuel costs. Coal costs increased
    $61 million due to higher coal prices and fuel
    transportation surcharges. Natural gas costs rose
    $22 million as a result of 32% higher average natural gas
    prices, despite 12% lower generation. These increases were
    offset by a $27 million reduction in oil costs as a result
    of 55% lower oil-fired generation.

○

South Central

— Cost of energy increased
    $56 million due to higher fuel costs and increased
    purchased energy expense.

—

Fuel expense

— Coal costs increased
    $16 million resulting from an increase in coal consumption
    and higher fuel transportation surcharges; natural gas costs
    rose by $14 million as the region’s peaker plants ran
    extensively to support transmission system stability after
    hurricane Gustav.

—

Purchased energy

— Higher purchased energy
    expenses of $16 million reflected higher natural gas costs
    for tolling contracts.

—

Transmission costs

— increased by
    $9 million due to additional

point-to-point

transmission costs driven by an increase in merchant energy
    sales.

○

West

— Cost of energy increased
    $30 million due to the dispatch of the El Segundo plant
    outside of the tolling agreement in 2008. In 2007, no such
    dispatch occurred.

•

Other operating costs —

increased
    $7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to the same period in 2007. This increase was due to:

○

Texas

— increased $30 million due to a
    second planned outage at STP and the acceleration of planned
    outages at the base-load plants.


○

Northeast —

decreased $3 million due to
    $18 million in lower operating and maintenance expenses
    resulting from less outage work at the Norwalk plants and Indian
    River plants. This decrease was offset by a $16 million
    increase in utilities cost. The 2007 utilities cost included a
    benefit of $19 million due to a lower than planned
    settlement of the station service agreement with CL&P.

○

South Central —

decreased by $10 million
    due to reduction in major maintenance expense. The 2007 expense
    included more extensive outage work that was performed at the
    Big Cajun II plant.

○

West —

decreased by $4 million due to a
    $3 million reduction in lease expenses and an environmental
    liability of $2 million which was recognized in 2007
    related to the El Segundo plant.

Risk
    Management Activities

Risk management activities include economic hedges that did not
    qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, ineffectiveness on cash
    flow hedges and trading activities. Such revenues increased by
    $414 million during the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to the same period in 2007. The breakdown of changes by
    region was as follows:

NRG’s 2008 gain is comprised of $525 million of

mark-to-market

gains and a $107 million in settled losses, or financial
    revenue. Of the $525 million of

mark-to-market

gains, the $38 million loss represents the reversal of

mark-to-market

gains recognized on economic hedges and the $32 million
    loss represents the reversal of

mark-to-market

gains recognized on trading activity. Both of these losses
    ultimately settled as financial or physical revenues during
    2008. The $500 million gain from economic hedge positions
    included a $524 million increase in value of forward sales
    of electricity as the result of the reduction in forward power
    and gas prices at the close of the year ended December 31,
    2008. These hedges are considered effective economic hedges that
    do not receive cash flow hedge accounting treatment. In addition
    there was a $24 million loss primarily from hedge
    accounting ineffectiveness related to gas trades in the Texas
    region which was driven by decreasing forward gas prices while
    forward power prices declined at a slower pace. NRG also
    recognized a $95 million unrealized gain associated with
    the company’s trading activity. This gain was primarily due
    to declining forward electricity and fuel prices.

Since these hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk
    of commodity price movements on revenues the changes in such
    results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather should be
    taken together with the effects of pricing and cost changes on
    energy revenues. During and throughout 2008, NRG hedged a
    portion of the Company’s 2008 through 2013 generation.
    Since that time, the settled and forward prices of electricity
    and natural gas have decreased, resulting in the recognition of
    unrealized

mark-to-market

forward gains.


In accordance with ASC

General
    and Administrative

NRG’s G&A costs for the year ended December 31,
    2008, increased by $10 million compared to 2007, and as a
    percentage of revenues was 5% in both 2008 and 2007.

•

Wage and benefit costs —

increased
    $19 million attributable to higher wages and related
    benefits cost increases.

•

Consultant cost —

increased by $3 million
    resulting from $8 million spent on Exelon’s exchange
    offer offset by a $5 million reduction in information
    technology consultants.

•

Franchise tax —

The Company’s Louisiana
    state franchise tax decreased by approximately $4 million.
    Prior year franchise tax was assessed based on the
    Company’s total debt and equity that increased
    significantly following the acquisition of Texas Genco.

•

Insurance cost —

decreased by $4 million
    due to favorable rates.

Development
    Costs

NRG’s development costs for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 decreased by $55 million compared to
    2007. These costs were due to the Company’s

Repowering

NRG projects:

•

Texas STP Units 3 and 4 projects

— No
    development expense was reflected in results of operations for
    2008 as NRG began to capitalize STP Units 3 and 4 development
    costs incurred after January 1, 2008, following the
    NRC’s docketing of the Company’s COLA in late 2007.
    The Company recorded $52 million in development expenses
    during 2007.

•

Wind projects

— The Company incurred
    $21 million in costs related to wind development which is a
    $4 million decrease from the same period in 2007.

•

Other projects

— The Company incurred
    $25 million in development costs related to other domestic

Repowering

NRG projects in 2008, which decreased
    $7 million from the same period in 2007 as a result of the
    capitalization of costs to develop the El Segundo Energy Center
    in 2008.

Gain
    on Sale of Assets

The Company reported no gains on sales of assets for 2008. For
    2007, NRG’s gain on the sale of assets was
    $17 million. On January 3, 2007, NRG completed the
    sale of the Company’s Red Bluff and Chowchilla II
    power plants resulting in a pre-tax gain of $18 million.

Equity
    in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates

NRG’s equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for
    the year ended December 31, 2008, increased by
    $5 million compared to 2007. This increase was due to a
    $9 million

mark-to-market

unrealized gain on a forward contract for a natural gas swap
    executed to hedge the future power generation of Sherbino I Wind
    Farm LLC, offset by a $4 million reduction in earnings from
    international equity investments.


Other
    Income, Net

NRG’s other income, net decreased by $38 million for
    2008 compared to the same period in 2007. The Company recorded a
    further $23 million impairment charge in 2008 to
    restructure distressed investments in commercial paper, for
    which an $11 million impairment charge was taken in the
    fourth quarter of 2007. The impairment charge resulted from a
    change in the Company’s fair value assessment as a result
    of a public auction of the assets in the structured investment
    vehicle holding the investments; this auction was the first
    observable market participation since the structured investment
    vehicle became illiquid in 2007. This 2008 impairment charge,
    along with cash receipts of $2 million, reduced the
    carrying value of the commercial paper to $7 million. In
    addition, the 2008 results reflect reduced interest income of
    $25 million from lower market interest rates on cash
    deposits.

Interest
    Expense

NRG’s interest expense decreased by $119 million for
    2008 compared to the same period in 2007. This decrease was due
    to interest savings on $531 million debt repayments
    accompanied by a reduction on the variable interest rates on
    long-term debt. The debt repayments included a $300 million
    prepayment in December 2007 and an additional payment of
    $143 million in March 2008 of the Term Loan Facility in
    connection with the mandatory offer under the Senior Credit
    Facility. Interest capitalized on

Repowering

NRG projects
    under construction also contributed to this decrease in interest
    expense.

NRG has interest rate swaps with the objective of fixing the
    interest rate on a portion of NRG’s Senior Credit Facility.
    These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815,
    and the impact associated with ineffectiveness was immaterial to
    NRG financial results. For the year ended December 31,
    2008, NRG had a deferred loss of $90 million in other
    comprehensive income compared to a deferred loss of
    $31 million in 2007.

Refinancing
    Expense

There was no refinancing activity in 2008. In 2007, NRG
    completed a $4.4 billion refinancing of the Company’s
    Senior Credit Facility, resulting in a charge of
    $35 million from the write-off of deferred financing costs
    as the lenders for 45% of the Term Loan Facility either exited
    the financing or reduced their holdings and were replaced by
    other institutions.

Income
    Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased by $336 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007. The effective
    tax rate was 40.4% for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    and 2007.

The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to:

•

Increase in income

— pre-tax income
    increased by $833 million, with a corresponding increase of
    $336 million in income tax expense.

•

Permanent differences

— The Company’s
    effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of
    35% due to:

○

Taxable dividends from foreign subsidiaries

— due to the provision of deferred taxes in 2008
    on foreign income no longer expected to be permanently
    reinvested overseas offset by decreased dividends from foreign
    operations in the current year, tax expense increased by
    approximately $6 million as compared to 2007.

○

Non-deductible interest

— resulted in an
    additional income tax expense of $2 million in 2008 as
    compared to the same period in 2007.

○

Change in German tax rate

— as a result of
    revaluing the Company’s deferred tax assets, income tax
    expense benefited by $29 million in 2007, with no
    comparable benefit in 2008.

○

Valuation Allowance

— The Company generated
    capital gains in 2008 primarily due to the sale of ITISA and
    derivative contracts that are eligible for capital treatment for
    tax purposes. These gains enabled NRG to reduce the
    Company’s valuation allowance against capital loss
    carryforwards. In addition, applicable changes to the state and
    local effective tax rate are captured in the current period.
    This resulted in a decrease of $18 million income tax
    expense in 2008 as compared to 2007.

○

Change in state effective tax rate

— The
    Company reduced its domestic state and local deferred income tax
    rate from 7% to 6% in the current period.

The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period
    depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business
    mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances
    in accordance with ASC 740. These factors and others, including
    the Company’s history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are
    taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred
    tax assets.

Income
    from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax
    Expense

Discontinued operations included ITISA results for 2008 and the
    same period in 2007. For 2008 and the same period in 2007, NRG
    recorded income from discontinued operations, net of income tax
    expense, of $172 million and $17 million,
    respectively. NRG closed the sale of ITISA during the second
    quarter 2008 and recognized an after-tax gain of
    $164 million.

•

Gross margin

— Reliant Energy’s gross
    margin totaled $909 million, which was driven by strong
    margins in the Mass customer class and expanding margins in the
    C&I customer class. Volumes were higher due to greater
    customer usage driven by favorable weather as compared to the
    30 year CDD and HDD averages, although partially offset by
    a decrease in number of customers during the period ended
    December 31, 2009. The Company acquired Reliant Energy
    customers on prices more consistent with 2008 costs of natural
    gas. Reliant Energy announced and enacted price reductions
    effective June 1 and July 1, 2009, that cumulatively
    lowered prices up to 20% for certain Mass customer classes.
    These reduced prices, relative to lower short-term supply costs,
    delivered strong margins. Competition, price reductions, and
    supply costs based on forward market prices, will likely drive
    lower margins in the future.

With the decline in natural gas prices, and the corresponding
    decline in the cost of energy supply, competitive retail prices
    have decreased relative to 2008. If supply costs continue to
    remain low, the Company expects competitive retail prices to
    continue their decline and to place pressure on unit margins.
    Additionally, the Company’s customer counts have declined
    approximately by 6% since May 1, 2009.

Operating
    Revenues

Total operating revenues, including risk management activities,
    for the period ended December 31, 2009, were
    $4.2 billion and consisted of the following:

•

Mass revenues

— totaled $2.6 billion from retail electric
    sales to approximately 1.6 million end use customers in the
    Texas market. Revenue rates for acquired Reliant Energy
    customers were not consistent with the current costs of natural
    gas. These acquired revenue rates were reduced by Reliant
    Energy’s announced and enacted price reductions effective
    June 1 and July 1, 2009 of up to 20% for certain Mass
    customer classes. Also, favorable weather, as compared to the

30-year

CDD
    and HDD averages, caused an increase in customer usage. The
    higher prices, along with higher usage, were accompanied by a 5%
    decrease in the number of customers since May 1, 2009.

•

Commercial and industrial
    revenue

— C&I revenues for the period ended
    December 31, 2009, totaled $1.6 billion on volume
    sales of approximately 20,915 GWh. Variable rate contracts tied
    to the market price of natural gas accounted for approximately
    73% of the contracted volumes as of December 31, 2009.


•

Contract amortization

— reduced operating revenues by $258 million
    resulting from net in-market C&I contracts acquired in the
    Reliant Energy acquisition. These contracts will be amortized
    over the life of the contracts with the longest contract term
    being approximately four years.

•

Supply management
    revenues

— totaled $251 million from the sale
    of excess supply into various markets in Texas.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy for the period ended December 31, 2009, was
    $2.7 billion and consisted of the following:

•

Supply costs

— totaled $2 billion. The market cost of
    energy is significantly down due to the decline in natural gas
    prices since the same period last year. Also, favorable weather
    for the period, as compared to the

30-year

CDD
    and HDD averages, caused an increase in purchased supply volumes
    at a relatively low cost.

•

Risk management activities

— Unrealized gains of $794 million on
    economic hedges relate to supply contracts that were recognized
    for the period ended December 2009, including $657 million
    of gains representing a roll-off of loss positions acquired at
    May 1, 2009, valued at forward prices on that date,
    reversal of losses of $104 million due to the termination
    of positions related to the CSRA unwind, and $33 million of
    gains that represent

mark-to-market

changes in the forward value of purchased electricity and gas.
    The $657 million gain from the roll-off of loss positions
    was offset by realized losses at the settled prices and higher
    cost of physical power which are reflected in the cost of
    operations during the same period. The $104 million gain
    from reversal of losses was offset by realized losses at the
    settled prices and is reflected in cost of operations during the
    same period.

•

Transmission and distribution
    charges

— totaled $964 million for the cost
    to transport the power from the generation sources to the
    end-use customers.

•

Financial settlements

— totaled $480 million resulting from
    financial settlement of energy related derivatives.

•

Contract amortization

— reduced cost of energy by $49 million,
    resulting from the net

out-of-market

supply contracts established at the acquisition date. These
    contracts will be amortized over the life of the contracts with
    the longest contract term being approximately seven years.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses for the period ended December 31,
    2009, were $356 million, or 9% of Reliant Energy’s
    total operating revenues. Other operating expenses consisted of
    the following:

•

Operations and maintenance
    expenses

— totaled $98 million. Theses
    expenses primarily consisted of the labor and external costs
    associated with customer activities, including the call center,
    billing, remittance processing and credit and collections, as
    well as the information technology costs associated with those
    activities.

•

Selling, general and
    administrative expenses

— totaled
    $142 million. These expenses primarily consisted of the
    costs of labor and external costs associated with advertising
    and other marketing activities, as well as human resources,
    community activities, legal, procurement, regulatory,
    accounting, internal audit and management, as well as facilities
    leases and other office expenses.

•

Gross receipts tax

— totaled $55 million or 1.3% of Mass and
    C&I revenues.

•

Bad debt expense

— totaled $61 million or 1.5% of Mass and
    C&I revenues which was driven by higher summer bills due to
    warmer weather and economic factors including unemployment in
    Dallas and Houston which is approaching national averages.

Operating
    Income

Operating income decreased by $845 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in
    2008, primarily due to:

•

Operating revenues

— decreased by $1.1 billion due to
    unfavorable energy and capacity revenue offset by a favorable
    impact of risk management activities.

•

Cost of energy

— decreased by $277 million driven by lower
    natural gas costs.

Operating
    Revenues

Total operating revenues decreased by $1.1 billion during
    the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same
    period in 2008, due to:

•

Energy revenue

— decreased $431 million
    due to:

○

Energy prices

— decreased by $253 million
    as the average realized merchant price was lower in 2009 due to
    the combination of lower gas prices and unusually high pricing
    events that occurred in 2008 but did not repeat in 2009. Higher
    MWh sold under merchant market was offset by lower merchant
    prices. The average realized energy price decreased by 9%,
    driven by a 45% decrease in merchant prices offset by a 23%
    increase in contract prices.


○

Generation

— decreased by 4% resulting in a
    $116 million decrease in sales volume. This decrease was
    driven by a 9% decrease in coal plant generation. This decrease
    was offset by a 12% increase in gas plant generation, and
    generation from the recently constructed Cedar Bayou 4 gas
    plant, the Elbow Creek wind farm, and the Langford wind farm
    which began commercial operations in June 2009, December 2008
    and December 2009, respectively. Coal plant generation was
    adversely affected by lower energy prices driven by a 56%
    decrease in average natural gas prices in combination with
    increased wind generation in the region.

○

Margin on MWH sold from market purchases

— decreased by $62 million.

•

Capacity revenue

— decreased by $300 million due to a lower
    proportion of baseload contracts which contain a capacity
    component.

•

Risk management
    activities

— decreased by $89 million
    reflecting the difference between gains of $228 million
    recorded for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to
    gains of $318 million during the same period in 2008. The
    $89 million decrease included $102 million of
    unrealized

mark-to-market

losses and $330 million in gains on settled transactions,
    or financial income, compared to $413 million in unrealized

mark-to-market

gains and $95 million in financial losses during the same
    period in 2008. For further discussion of the Company’s
    risk management activities, see Consolidated Results of
    Operations.

•

Contract amortization revenue

— resulting from the Texas Genco acquisition
    decreased by $198 million due to the reduced volume of
    contracted energy in 2009 as compared to 2008.

•

Other revenues

— decreased by $62 million primarily due to
    lower ancillary services revenue of $47 million provided to
    the market, and lower emissions credit revenue of
    $11 million.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy decreased by $277 million during the year
    ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in
    2008, due to:

•

Natural gas costs

— decreased by $281 million due to a 56%
    decline in average natural gas prices offset by a 12% increase
    in gas-fired generation.

•

Ancillary service costs

— decreased by $44 million due to a decrease
    in purchased ancillary services costs incurred to meet contract
    obligations.

These decreases were offset by:

•

Fuel risk management activities

— losses of $27 million were recorded for the
    year ended December 31, 2009. In the first quarter 2009,
    all NPNS coal contracts were discontinued and reclassified into

mark-to-market

accounting. The $27 million loss included $8 million
    of unrealized

mark-to-market

losses, largely associated with forward coal positions and
    $19 million in losses on settled transactions, or financial
    cost of energy. For further discussion of the Company’s
    risk management activities, see Consolidated Results of
    Operations.

•

Coal costs —

increased by $5 million driven by a $44 million
    increase in coal prices, offset by a $28 million decrease
    in coal volume. Additionally, an increase in higher
    transportation costs of $9 million was offset by a
    $15 million loss reserve related to a coal contract dispute
    in the first quarter of 2008, combined with a decrease of
    $3 million due to lower lignite royalties.

•

Cost Contract
    Amortization —

increased $19 million driven
    primarily by the reduction in amortization for

out-of-the

money coal contracts assumed in the acquisition of Texas Genco
    as coal is delivered under that contract.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses increased by $21 million during
    the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same
    period in 2008, driven by an increase of $14 million in
    general and administrative expense due to higher corporate
    allocations as a result of the change in method in allocating
    corporate costs as described in Item 14 —
    Note 18,

Segment Reporting,

to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. In addition, there was an increase of


$3 million for operations and maintenance costs, as well as
    an increase of $3 million in property and other taxes due
    to the recently constructed Cedar Bayou 4 and Elbow Creek
    facilities.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by
    $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    compared to the same period in 2008. This increase was the
    result of Cedar Bayou 4 and Elbow Creek reaching commercial
    operations in June 2009 and December 2008, respectively.

    compared to 2007

Operating
    Income

Operating income increased by $716 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in
    2007, primarily due to:

•

Operating revenues

— increased by $739 million due to favorable
    risk management activities, energy and capacity revenues.

•

Cost of energy

— increased by $59 million reflecting the
    effects of increased natural gas and coal prices.

Operating
    Revenues

Total operating revenues increased by $739 million during
    the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007 due to
    the following:

•

Risk management activities

— gains of $318 million were recognized for
    the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to a
    $33 million loss in the same period in 2007. The
    $318 million included $413 million of unrealized

mark-to-market

gains and $95 million in settled losses, or financial


revenue. The $413 million was the net effect of a
    $400 million gain from economic hedge positions and a
    $25 million loss on reversals of

mark-to-market

gains on economic hedges. In addition, there were
    $37 million in unrealized

mark-to-market

gains on trading transactions combined with a $1 million
    gain on reversals of

mark-to-market

losses on trading activity. The $400 million gain from
    economic hedges incorporated $424 million in unrealized
    gains in the value of forward sales of electricity and fuel
    driven by lower power and natural gas prices. These hedges were
    considered effective economic hedges that do not receive cash
    flow hedge accounting treatment. The remaining $24 million
    in losses were from hedge ineffectiveness which was driven by
    decreasing gas prices while power prices decreased at a slower
    pace.

•

Energy revenue

— increased by $172 million
    due to:

○

Energy prices —

increased by $430 million
    as the average realized merchant price was higher in 2008 due to
    the combination of higher gas prices and unusually high pricing
    events. The average realized energy price increased by 18%,
    driven by a 44% increase in merchant prices offset by a 16%
    decrease in contract prices.

○

Generation —

decreased by 2% resulting in a
    $42 million decline in sales volume. This decrease in
    generation was due to a 3% decline in nuclear generation at STP,
    as a result of additional plant outages, and a 14% decline in
    overall gas plant generation for the year ended December 2008.
    Hurricane Ike in September 2008 caused major damage to the
    Houston area transmission grid which reduced significantly the
    demand for power causing a decrease in gas-fired generation.
    These declines were offset by a 1% increase in coal generation
    in 2008.

○

Margin on MWh sold from market purchases —

decreased by $216 million.

•

Capacity revenue

— increased by $130 million due to a greater
    proportion of base-load contracts which contain a capacity
    component.

•

Other revenue —

increased by $50 million related to a $23 million
    increase in ancillary services revenue in 2008, a
    $22 million increase of allocations for trading of emission
    allowances and carbon financial instruments, and increased
    activity in trading natural gas and coal of $4 million.

•

Contract amortization revenue

— increased by $36 million due to the volume
    of contracted energy being positively affected by a greater
    spread between contract prices and market prices used in the
    Texas Genco purchase accounting.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy increased by $59 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to 2007 due to the following:

•

Natural gas costs

— increased by $99 million due to a 28% rise
    in average gas prices offset by a 14% decrease in gas-fired
    generation.

•

Coal costs

— increased by $44 million due to higher coal
    prices and the settlement of a coal contract dispute.

•

Ancillary service costs

— increased by $14 million due to a
    $16 million rise in ancillary service costs purchased
    through ERCOT, offset by a $2 million decrease in other
    purchased ancillary service costs.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

Amortized contract costs

— decreased by $59 million due to a
    $36 million decrease in the amortization of water supply
    contracts which ended in 2007. In addition, the amortization of
    coal contracts decreased by a net $22 million as a result
    of a reduction in expense related to

in-the-money

coal contract amortization. These contracts were established
    under Texas Genco purchase accounting.

•

Nuclear fuel expense

— decreased by $19 million as amortization of
    nuclear fuel inventory established under Texas Genco purchase
    accounting ended in early 2008.


•

Purchased power

— decreased by $26 million due to lower
    forced outage rates at the region’s baseload plants.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses decreased by $18 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007 due to the
    following:

•

Development costs

— decreased by $59 million primarily due to
    the initial costs for developing the nuclear Units 3 and 4 at
    STP associated with the

Repowering

NRG initiative that
    began in 2007. Costs for STP nuclear Units 3 and 4 are being
    capitalized in 2008.

This decrease was primarily offset by:

•

Operations and maintenance
    expense

— increased by $32 million due to an
    additional planned outage at STP and the acceleration of planned
    outages at the baseload plants.

•

General and administrative
    expense

— increased by $10 million driven by
    higher corporate allocations.

Operating
    Income

Operating income decreased by $91 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in
    2008, due to:

•

Operating revenues

— decreased by $429 million due to
    unfavorable energy revenues, other revenues and capacity
    revenues partially offset by a favorable impact from risk
    management activities.

•

Cost of
    energy

— decreased by $354 million due
    to lower generation and fuel prices.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues decreased by $429 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in
    2008, due to:

•

Energy revenue

— decreased by $575 million
    due to:

○

Energy prices

— decreased by $295 million
    reflecting an average 40% decline in merchant energy prices.

○

Generation

— decreased by $334 million due
    to a 31% decrease in generation in 2009 compared to 2008, driven
    by a 31% decrease in coal generation and a 31% decrease in oil
    and gas generation. Coal generation declined 24%, or
    1,471,726 MWhs, in western New York; 39%, or
    1,503,975 MWhs, at Indian River; and 80%, or
    476,537 MWh, at Somerset. The decline in generation at
    these plants is due to a combination of weakened demand for
    power, low gas prices and higher cost of production from the
    introduction of RGGI resulting in increased hours where the
    units were uneconomic to dispatch. The decline in oil and gas
    generation is attributable to fewer reliability run hours at the
    Norwalk plant and higher maintenance work at the Arthur Kill
    plant in 2009.

○

Margin on MWh sold from market purchases

— increased by $54 million driven by lower
    net costs incurred in meeting obligations under load serving
    contracts in the PJM market.

•

Other revenues

— decreased by $38 million due to
    $20 million from decreased activity in the trading of
    emission allowances and $17 million lower allocations of
    net physical gas sales.

•

Capacity revenue

— decreased by $8 million due to lower
    capacity cash flow revenue in New York in 2009.

These decreases were offset by:

•

Risk management activities

— gains of $277 million were recorded for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, compared to gains of
    $85 million during the same period in 2008. The
    $277 million gain included $107 million of unrealized

mark-to-market

losses and $384 million in gains on settled transactions,
    or financial income, compared to $82 million in unrealized

mark-to-market

gains and $3 million in financial gains during the same
    period in 2008. For further discussion of the Company’s
    risk management activities, see Consolidated Results of
    Operations.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy decreased by $354 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, due
    to:

•

Natural gas and oil costs

— decreased by $187 million, or 60%, due to
    31% lower generation and 56% lower average natural gas prices.

•

Coal costs

— decreased by $129 million, or 35%, due to
    lower coal generation of 31% accounting for $111 million
    and lower prices accounting for $18 million. The lower
    prices are due to lower fuel transportation surcharges.

•

Fuel risk management activities

— gains of $60 million were recorded for the
    year ended December 31, 2009. In the first quarter 2009,
    all NPNS coal contracts were discontinued and reclassified to


mark-to-market

accounting. The $60 million gain included $67 million
    of unrealized

mark-to-market

gains, largely associated with forward coal positions and
    $7 million in losses on settled transactions, or financial
    cost of energy. For further discussion of the Company’s
    risk management activities, see Consolidated Results of
    Operations.

These decreases were offset by:

•

Carbon emission expense

— increased by $22 million due to the
    January 1, 2009, implementation of RGGI and the recognition
    of carbon compliance cost under this program.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization increased by $9 million
    primarily due to depreciation from the 2009 baghouse projects at
    NRG’s Western New York coal plants.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses increased by $7 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period
    in 2008, due to:

•

Property taxes

— increased by $14 million
    due to lower Empire Zone tax benefits recognized in 2009 at the
    Oswego plant due to the plant receiving notice of
    decertification from the Empire Zone program in 2009 from the
    State of New York which decision is under appeal by the Company.

•

Write-down of assets

— increased by
    $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    compared to the same period in 2008. The write-down was due to
    the cancellation and subsequent write off of construction costs
    incurred through year end 2009 on the Indian River Unit 3 air
    pollution control equipment project. NRG and DNREC announced a
    proposed plan, subject to definitive documentation, that would
    shut down Unit 3 by December 31, 2013, and relieve NRG of
    the requirement to install this back-end control equipment. Unit
    4 is not affected by this plan and construction on similar
    equipment continues with an expected in-service date of year-end
    2011.

•

General and administrative expense

— increased
    by $2 million due to higher labor and employee benefit
    costs.

•

Development costs

— increased by
    $2 million due to increased repowering efforts at the
    Astoria plant and a biomass project at the Montville plant.

These increases was offset by:

•

Operations and maintenance expenses

— decreased
    by $22 million due to lower chemical spending and routine
    maintenance work as a result of lower generation and lower
    planned major maintenance work at the Huntley and Indian River
    plants.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration-Climate Prediction Center — A CDD
    represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a
    particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. An
    HDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature
    for a particular day is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each
    region. The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by
    adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period.

Operating
    Income

Operating income decreased by $24 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to:

•

Cost of energy

— increased by $54 million due to higher coal
    costs, increased coal transportation surcharges and higher
    natural gas prices. The increase was offset by lower oil costs
    from lower oil-fired generation.

This unfavorable variance was offset by:

•

Operating revenues —

increased by $25 million due to higher capacity revenue
    and risk management revenues partially offset by lower energy
    revenue.

•

Other operating expenses

— decreased by $12 million due to lower major
    maintenance expenses and property taxes offset by higher
    utilities expense.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $25 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to:

•

Risk management activities

— gains of $85 million were recorded for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, compared to gains of
    $27 million during the same period in 2007. The
    $85 million gain includes $82 million of unrealized

mark-to-market

gains and $3 million of gains in settled transactions, or
    financial revenue. The $82 million unrealized gains is the
    net effect of a $96 million gain from economic hedge
    positions, the $13 million loss due to the reversal of
    previously recognized

mark-to-market

gains on economic hedges, the $14 million loss due to the
    reversal of

mark-to-market

gains on trading activity and $13 million in unrealized

mark-to-market

gains on trading activity. Gains are driven by increases in
    power and gas prices.


•

Capacity revenue

— increased by
    $13 million due to:

○

PJM

— capacity revenue increased by
    $20 million reflecting recognition of a year of revenue
    from the RPM capacity market (effective on June 1,
    2007) in 2008 compared to seven months in 2007.

○

NEPOOL

— capacity revenue increased
    $11 million due to increased revenue recognized on the
    Norwalk RMR contract (effective on June 19, 2007) in
    2008 compared to seven months in 2007.

○

NYISO

— capacity revenue decreased by
    $18 million due to unfavorable market prices. The lower
    capacity market prices are a result of NYISO’s reductions
    in Installed Reserve Margins and installed capacity in-city
    mitigation rules effective March 2008. These decreases were
    offset by higher capacity contract revenue.

These gains were offset by:

•

Energy revenues —

decreased by $40 million
    due to:

○

Energy prices

— increased by $64 million
    due to an average 6% rise in merchant energy prices.

○

Generation

— decreased by $66 million due
    to a net 6% decrease in generation. The decrease in generation
    represented a 55% decrease in oil-fired generation as these
    oil-fired plants were not dispatched due to 41% higher average
    oil prices. In addition, there was a 12% decrease in gas-fired
    generation related to a cooler summer in 2008 as compared to
    2007. Coal generation was flat in 2008 compared to 2007.

○

Margin on MWh sold from market purchases

— decreased by $38 million driven by higher
    net costs incurred to service PJM contracts as a result of the
    increase in market energy prices.

•

Other revenues

— decreased by $6 million due to lower
    allocations of net physical sales in 2008 of $17 million
    offset by higher allocations for trading of emission allowances
    and carbon financial instruments of $10 million.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy increased by $54 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, due
    to:

•

Coal costs

— increased by $61 million due
    to higher coal costs and fuel transportation surcharges.

•

Natural gas costs

— increased by
    $22 million, despite 12% lower generation, due to a 32%
    higher average natural gas prices.

These increases were offset by:

•

Oil costs

— decreased by $27 million due to lower
    oil-fired generation of 55% as these plants were not dispatched
    in 2008 due to 41% higher average oil prices.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses decreased by $12 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period
    in 2007, due to:

•

Major maintenance

— decreased $18 million
    as a result of less outage work at the Norwalk and Indian River
    plants.

•

Property taxes

— decreased $10 million due to
    $4 million in property tax credits received in 2008 at the
    region’s New York City plants and higher property credits
    received in 2008 at the region’s Western New York
    plants.

These decreases were offset by:

•

Utilities expense

— increased by $16 million as a result of a
    $19 million benefit included in the 2007 utilities cost due
    to a lower than planned settlement of the station service
    agreement with CL&P.

Operating
    Income

Operating income decreased by $94 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in
    2008 due to:

•

Operating revenues

— declined by $165 million as a result of
    decreases in energy revenue, risk management activities and
    other revenue. These decreases were offset by an increase in
    capacity revenue.

•

Cost of energ

y —
    declined by $69 million due to lower purchased energy, fuel
    and transmission costs, offset by higher fuel risk management
    activities.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues decreased by $165 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in
    2008, due to:

•

Energy revenue

— decreased by $118 million due to a
    $80 million decline in contract revenue, a $2 million
    decrease in merchant energy revenue and a $36 million
    decrease in margin on MWh sold from market purchases. The
    contract revenue decrease was attributed to a 10% decrease in
    sales volumes and a $5.15 per MWh lower average realized price.
    The decline in contract energy price was driven by a
    $16 million decrease in fuel cost pass-through to the
    cooperatives reflecting an overall decline in natural gas
    prices. Also contributing to the decline in contract revenue was
    a $60 million decrease due to the expiration of a


contract with a regional utility. The expiration of the contract
    allowed more energy to be sold into the merchant market, but at
    lower prices resulting in a $2 million decline in revenue.

•

Risk management activities

— losses of $71 million were recorded for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, compared to gains of
    $10 million during the same period in 2008. The
    $71 million loss included $78 million of unrealized

mark-to-market

losses offset by $7 million in gains on settled
    transactions, or financial income, compared to $26 million
    in unrealized

mark-to-market

gains offset by $16 million in financial losses during the
    same period in 2008. For further discussion of the
    Company’s risk management activities, see Consolidated
    Results of Operations.

These decreases were offset by:

•

Capacity revenue

— grew by $36 million driven by a
    $40 million increase from new capacity agreements with
    regional utilities and a $5 million increase in capacity
    revenue contributed by the region’s Rockford plants which
    dispatch into the PJM market, offset by reduced contract
    capacity revenue of $9 million.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy is down by $69 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008,
    reflecting:

•

Purchased energy

— declined by $58 million while purchased
    capacity rose by $3 million. The lower purchased energy was
    driven by lower fuel costs associated with the region’s
    tolled facility and lower market energy prices. The energy
    declines were offset by increased capacity payments of
    $3 million on tolled facilities.

•

Natural gas expense

— decreased by $15 million reflecting a 30%
    drop in owned gas generation and a 54% decline in gas prices.
    The region’s gas facilities ran extensively to support
    transmission system stability following hurricane Gustav in
    September 2008.

•

Coal expense

— decreased $11 million as coal generation
    was down 6%, offset by a 1% increase in cost per ton.

•

Transmission expense

— declined by $8 million due to certain
    transmission line outages between electrical power regions which
    limited merchant energy volumes that would incur transmission
    costs as well as lower network interchange transmission costs
    associated with reduced contract customer energy volumes.

These decreases were offset by:

•

Fuel risk management activities

— losses of $21 million were recorded for the
    year ended December 31, 2009. In the first quarter 2009,
    all NPNS coal contracts were discontinued and reclassified into

mark-to-market

accounting. The $21 million loss included $12 million
    of unrealized

mark-to-market

losses largely associated with forward coal positions and
    $9 million in losses on settled transactions, or financial
    cost of energy. For further discussion of the Company’s
    risk management activities, see Consolidated Results of
    Operations.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses decreased by $2 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 2008, associated
    with:

•

General and administrative
    expense

— Corporate allocations declined by
    $8 million in 2009 versus the same period in 2008.
    Franchise tax expense grew by $2 million due to credits
    recorded in 2008 related to prior years.

•

Operating and maintenance
    expense

— Labor costs increased by $2 million
    because of higher benefit costs. Major maintenance rose by
    $2 million due to more extensive outage work performed at
    the Big Cajun II plant in 2009 compared to the same period
    in 2008.

Operating
    Income

Operating income increased by $43 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in
    2007, due to:

•

Operating revenues —

increased by
    $88 million due to increases in energy revenue and capacity
    revenue.

•

Cost of energy

— increased by $56 million due to higher
    purchased energy, coal transportation costs, natural gas and
    transmission costs.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $88 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to:

•

Energy revenue

— increased by $74 million due to a
    $41 million increase in merchant energy revenues and a
    $33 million increase in margin on MWh sold from market
    purchases. A decline in contract sales of 577 thousand MWh
    allowed for increased sales into the merchant market at higher
    prices. Revenue from contract load was flat as higher fuel cost
    pass-through adjustments for the region’s cooperative
    customers were offset by reductions in contract volume to other
    contract customers.

•

Capacity revenue

— increased by
    $12 million.  Capacity payments from the
    region’s cooperative customers increased by
    $10 million due to new peak loads set by the region’s
    cooperative customers and increased transmission and
    environmental pass-through costs. Increased RPM capacity
    payments from the region’s Rockford facilities in the PJM
    market contributed an additional


$8 million. These increases were offset by a reduction in
    contract volumes to other customers of $6 million.

•

Risk management activities

— gains of $10 million were recognized during
    2008 compared to $10 million in gains recognized during the
    same period in 2007. Unrealized gains in 2008 of
    $26 million were offset by realized losses of
    $16 million. The $26 million unrealized gain was the
    net effect of a $45 million unrealized

mark-to-market

gain from trading activities in the region offset by the
    reversal of $19 million loss of previously recognized

mark-to-market

gains on trading activity. Unrealized gains were primarily
    driven by decreases in power and gas prices relative to the
    Company’s forward positions.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy increased by $56 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to:

•

Purchased energy

— increased by $16 million reflecting a 21%
    increase in the average cost per MWh of purchased energy which
    reflects higher gas costs associated with the region’s
    tolling agreements. This increase was offset by an 8% decrease
    in purchased MWh as increased plant availability and lower
    contract load requirements reduced the need to purchase power.

•

Coal costs

— increased by $16 million due to a $2 per
    ton increase in fuel transportation surcharges combined with a
    1% increase in coal generation. These increases were offset by a
    $3 million decrease in allocated rail car lease fees.

•

Natural gas costs

— increased $14 million. The region’s
    Bayou Cove and Big Cajun I peaker plants ran extensively to
    support transmission system stability after hurricane Gustav in
    September 2008.

•

Transmission costs

— increased by $9 million due to additional

point-to-point

transmission costs driven by an increase in merchant energy
    sales.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses decreased by $10 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to:

•

General and administrative
    expense

— Franchise tax decreased by
    $5 million due to retroactive charges recorded in 2007. The
    Louisiana state franchise tax is assessed on the Company’s
    total debt and equity that significantly increased following the
    acquisition of Texas Genco. This decrease was offset by
    $6 million in higher corporate allocations in 2008 compared
    to the same period in 2007.

•

Operating and maintenance
    expense

— Major maintenance decreased by
    $9 million due to more extensive spring outage work
    performed at the Big Cajun II plant in 2007 compared to the
    same period in 2008. Normal maintenance rose $2 million as
    a result of increased forced outages and higher contractor
    costs. Asset retirements decreased by $4 million reflecting
    disposals associated with the 2007 outage work at Big Cajun II.

Operating
    Income

Operating income decreased by $26 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in
    2008, due to decreases in capacity revenue, energy revenue, risk
    management activities and other revenues.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues decreased by $21 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in
    2008, due to:

•

Capacity revenue

— decreased by $3 million due to the
    expiration of a two-year tolling agreement at the El Segundo
    facility in April 2008, which was replaced by resource adequacy
    and capacity contracts at lower prices.

•

Energy
    revenue

— decreased by $5 million
    primarily due to a 16% decrease in merchant prices in 2009
    compared to 2008. This decrease was offset by a 5% increase in
    merchant generation in 2009 compared to 2008.

•

Other revenues

— decreased by $5 million due to lower
    emission allowance sales partially offset by an increase in
    ancillary services revenue.


•

Risk management activities

— realized losses of $8 million on settled
    transactions were recognized during the period. There was no
    risk management activity in 2008. For further discussion of the
    Company’s risk management activities, see Consolidated
    Results of Operations.

Cost
    of Energy and Other Operating Expenses

Cost of energy and other operating expenses increased by
    $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    compared to the same period in 2008, due to:

•

Cost of energy

— decreased by $6 million due to a 29%
    decline in average natural gas prices per MMBtu. This decrease
    was partially offset by an 8% increase in natural gas
    consumption and a $3 million increase in fuel oil expense
    resulting from a write-down to market of fuel oil inventory no
    longer used in the production of energy.

•

Other operating expenses

— increased by $11 million due to higher
    maintenance expense associated with a major overhaul at El
    Segundo and higher maintenance at Long Beach.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $44 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in
    2007, due to:

•

Energy revenue

— increased by $35 million due to the 2008
    dispatch of the El Segundo plant outside of the tolling
    agreement in 2008. In 2007, no such dispatch occurred.

•

Other revenues

— increased by $6 million due to higher
    allocations for trading of emission allowances in 2008.

•

Capacity revenue

— increased by $3 million primarily due to
    the tolling agreement at the Long Beach plant partially offset
    by the expiration of a two year tolling agreement at the El
    Segundo facility:

¡

Long Beach

— On August 1, 2007, NRG
    successfully completed the repowering of a 260 MW natural
    gas-fueled generating plant at its Long Beach generating
    facility. The plant contributed $15 million in incremental
    capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008.

¡

El Segundo

— The expiration of the two year
    tolling agreement at the end of April resulted in a decrease of
    $11 million in capacity revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Cost
    of Energy and Other Operating Expenses

Cost of energy and other operating expenses increased by
    $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to the same period in 2007, due to:

•

Cost of energy —

increased by $30 million due to the dispatch of the El
    Segundo plant outside of the tolling agreement in 2008. In 2007,
    no such dispatch occurred.

•

Depreciation and amortization

— increased by $5 million, reflecting
    depreciation associated with the repowered plant at the Long
    Beach generating facility.

•

Other operating expenses

— decreased by $10 million as a result of a
    $5 million reduction in

Repowering

NRG expenses due
    to the capitalization of cost for the El Segundo Energy Center
    project in 2008. In addition there was a $3 million
    reduction in lease expenses in 2008 and the recognition of a
    $2 million environmental liability for the El Segundo plant
    in 2007.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Liquidity
    Position

As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, NRG’s liquidity,
    excluding collateral received, was approximately
    $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, comprised
    of the following:

For the year ended December 31, 2009, total liquidity,
    excluding collateral received, increased by $430 million
    due to a higher cash balance of $810 million, partially
    offset by decreased availability of the Synthetic Letter of
    Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility of
    $277 million and $95 million, respectively. Changes in
    cash balances are further discussed hereinafter under

Cash
    Flow Discussion

. Cash and cash equivalents and funds
    deposited by counterparties at December 31, 2009, are
    predominantly held in money market funds invested in treasury
    securities, treasury repurchase agreements or government agency
    debt.

The line item “Funds deposited by counterparties”
    represents the amounts that are held by NRG as a result of
    collateral posting obligations from the Company’s
    counterparties due to positions in the Company’s hedging
    program. These amounts are segregated into separate accounts
    that are not contractually restricted but, based on the
    Company’s intention, are not available for the payment of
    NRG’s general corporate obligations. Depending on market
    fluctuation and the settlement of the underlying contracts, the
    Company will refund this collateral to the counterparties
    pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underlying trades.
    Since collateral requirements fluctuate daily and the Company
    cannot predict if any collateral will be held for more than
    twelve months, the funds deposited by counterparties are
    classified as a current asset on the Company’s balance
    sheet, with an offsetting liability for this cash collateral
    received within current liabilities. The decrease in these
    amounts from December 31, 2008, was due to cash collateral
    moved from NRG to Merrill Lynch in connection with novations
    under the CSRA (see Item 14 — Note 3,

Business Acquisitions

, to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements), offset by a increase of

in-the-money

positions as a result of decreasing forward prices.

Management believes that the Company’s liquidity position
    and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance
    operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund
    dividends to NRG’s preferred shareholders, and other
    liquidity commitments. Management continues to regularly monitor
    the Company’s ability to finance the needs of its
    operating, financing and investing activity in a manner
    consistent with its intention to maintain a net debt to capital
    ratio in the range of

45-60%.

Credit
    Ratings

Credit rating agencies rate a firm’s public debt
    securities. These ratings are utilized by the debt markets in
    evaluating a firm’s credit risk. Ratings influence the
    price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the
    market the Company’s ability to pay principal, interest and
    preferred dividends. Rating agencies evaluate a firm’s
    industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and hedge profile,
    among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firm’s
    credit risk.

SOURCES
    OF FUNDS

The principal sources of liquidity for NRG’s future
    operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived
    from new and existing financing arrangements, asset sales,
    existing cash on hand and cash flows from operations.

Financing
    Arrangements

Senior
    Credit Facility

As of December 31, 2009, NRG has a Senior Credit Facility
    which is comprised of a senior first priority secured term loan,
    or the Term Loan Facility, a $1.0 billion senior first
    priority secured revolving credit facility, or the Revolving
    Credit Facility, and a $1.3 billion senior first priority
    secured synthetic letter of credit facility, or the


Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility
    was last amended on June 8, 2007. As of December 31,
    2009, NRG had issued $717 million of letters of credit
    under the Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, leaving
    $583 million available for future issuances. Under the
    Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2009, NRG had
    issued letters of credit of $95 million, of which
    $59 million supports the tax exempt bonds issued by Dunkirk
    Power LLC as described in Item 14 — Note 12,

Debt and Capital Leases,

to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

    Senior Notes

On June 5, 2009, NRG completed the issuance of
    $700 million aggregate principal amount of 8.5% Senior
    Notes due 2019, or 2019 Senior Notes, as described in
    Item 14 — Note 12,

Debt and Capital
    Leases,

to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The
    Company used a portion of the net proceeds of $678 million
    to facilitate the early termination on October 5, 2009 of
    NRG’s obligations pursuant to the CSRA Amendment. Net
    proceeds in excess of this amount are available for general
    corporate purposes. See further discussion of the CSRA Amendment
    in Item 14 — Note 3,

Business
    Acquisitions,

to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Merrill
    Lynch Credit Sleeve Facility

See discussion in Item 14 — Note 3,

Business Acquisitions,

to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, regarding the CSRA entered into to support the
    retail business as a result of the acquisition of Reliant Energy
    on May 1, 2009. Effective October 5, 2009, the Company
    executed the CSRA Amendment. In connection with this amendment,
    the Company posted $366 million of cash collateral to
    Merrill Lynch and other counterparties, returned
    $53 million of counterparty collateral, issued
    $206 million of letters of credit, and received
    $45 million of counterparty collateral. In addition,
    Merrill Lynch returned $250 million of previously posted
    cash collateral, and released liens on $322 million of
    unrestricted cash held by Reliant Energy. Upon execution of the
    CSRA Amendment, the Company was required to post collateral for
    any net liability derivatives, and other static margin
    associated with supply for Reliant Energy.

TANE
    Facility

On February 24, 2009, NINA executed an EPC agreement with
    TANE, which specifies the terms under which STP Units 3 and 4
    will be constructed. Concurrent with the execution of the EPC
    agreement, NINA and TANE entered into the TANE Facility wherein
    TANE has committed up to $500 million to finance purchases
    of long-lead materials and equipment for the construction of STP
    Units 3 and 4. The TANE Facility matures on February 24,
    2012, subject to two renewal periods, and provides for customary
    events of default, which include, among others: nonpayment of
    principal or interest; default under other indebtedness; the
    rendering of judgments; and certain events of bankruptcy or
    insolvency. Outstanding borrowings will accrue interest at LIBOR
    plus 3%, subject to a ratings grid, and are secured by
    substantially all of the assets of and membership interests in
    NINA and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2009, no
    amounts had been borrowed under the TANE Facility.

Dunkirk
    Power LLC Tax-Exempt Bonds

On April 15, 2009, NRG executed a $59 million
    tax-exempt bond financing through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
    Dunkirk Power LLC. The bonds were issued by the County of
    Chautauqua Industrial Development Agency and will be used for
    construction of emission control equipment on the Dunkirk
    Generating Station in Dunkirk, NY. The bonds initially bear
    weekly interest based on the Securities Industry and Financial
    Markets Association, or SIFMA, rate, have a maturity date of
    April 1, 2042, and are enhanced by a letter of credit under
    the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility covering amounts
    drawn on the facility. The proceeds received through
    December 31, 2009, were $52 million with the remaining
    balance being released over time as construction costs are paid.
    On February 1, 2010, the Company fixed the rate on the
    bonds at 5.875%. Interest will be payable semiannually. In
    addition, the $59 million letter of credit issued by NRG in
    support of the bonds was cancelled and replaced with a parent
    guarantee. These bonds are part of the Company’s first lien
    debt.


GenConn
    Energy LLC related financings

In April 2009, NRG Connecticut Peaking LLC., a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of NRG, executed an equity bridge loan facility, or
    EBL, in the amount of $121.5 million from a syndicate of
    banks. The purpose of the EBL is to fund the Company’s
    proportionate share of the project construction costs required
    to be contributed into GenConn Energy LLC, or GenConn, a 50%
    equity method investment of the Company. The EBL, which is fully
    collateralized with a letter of credit issued under the
    Company’s Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility covering
    amounts drawn on the facility, will bear interest at a rate of
    LIBOR plus 2% on drawn amounts. The EBL will mature on the
    earlier of the commercial operations date of the Middletown
    project or July 26, 2011. The EBL also requires mandatory
    prepayment of the portion of the loan utilized to pay costs of
    the Devon project, of approximately $54 million, on the
    earlier of Devon’s commercial operations date or
    January 27, 2011. The proceeds of the EBL received through
    December 31, 2009, were $108 million and the remaining
    amounts will be drawn as necessary to fund construction costs.

In April 2009, GenConn secured financing for 50% of the Devon
    and Middletown project construction costs through a

7-year

term
    loan facility, and also entered into a

5-year

revolving working capital loan and letter of credit facility,
    which collectively with the term loan is referred to as the
    GenConn Facility. The aggregate credit amount secured under the
    GenConn Facility, which is non-recourse to NRG, is
    $291 million, including $48 million for the revolving
    facility. In August 2009, GenConn began to draw under the
    GenConn Facility to cover costs related to the Devon project and
    as of December 31, 2009, has drawn $48 million.

First and
    Second Lien Structure

NRG has granted first and second liens to certain counterparties
    on substantially all of the Company’s assets. NRG uses the
    first or second lien structure to reduce the amount of cash
    collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be
    required to post from time to time to support its obligations
    under

out-of-the-money

hedge agreements for forward sales of power or MWh equivalents.
    To the extent that the underlying hedge positions for a
    counterparty are

in-the-money

to NRG, the counterparty would have no claim under the lien
    program. The lien program limits the volume that can be hedged,
    not the value of underlying

out-of-the-money

positions. The first lien program does not require NRG to post
    collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. Within the
    first and second lien structure, the Company can hedge up to 80%
    of its baseload capacity and 10% of its non-baseload assets with
    these counterparties for the first 60 months and then
    declining thereafter. Net exposure to a counterparty on all
    trades must be positively correlated to the price of the
    relevant commodity for the first lien to be available to that
    counterparty. The first and second lien structure is not subject
    to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a
    counterparty and has no stated maturity date.

NRG’s lien counterparties may have a claim on the
    Company’s assets to the extent market prices exceed the
    hedged price. As of December 31, 2009 and February 9,
    2010, all hedges under the first and second lien were

in-the-money

on a counterparty aggregate basis.

The following table summarizes the amount of MWs hedged against
    the Company’s baseload assets and as a percentage relative
    to the Company’s forecasted baseload capacity under the
    first and second lien structure as of February 9, 2010:

Asset
    Sales

MIBRAG

— On June 10, 2009, NRG completed
    the sale of its 50% ownership interest in Mibrag B.V. to a
    consortium of Severoćeské doly Chomutov, a member of
    the CEZ Group, and J&T Group. Mibrag B.V.’s principal


holding was MIBRAG, which was jointly owned by NRG and
    URS Corporation. As part of the transaction,
    URS Corporation also entered into an agreement to sell its
    50% stake in MIBRAG.

For its share, NRG received EUR 203 million
    ($284 million at an exchange rate of 1.40 U.S.$/EUR), net
    of transaction costs. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, NRG recognized a pre-tax gain of $128 million. Prior
    to completion of the sale, NRG continued to record its share of
    MIBRAG’s operations to “Equity in earnings of
    unconsolidated affiliates.”

In connection with the transaction, NRG entered into a foreign
    currency forward contract to hedge the impact of exchange rate
    fluctuations on the sale proceeds. The foreign currency forward
    contract had a fixed exchange rate of 1.277 and required NRG to
    deliver EUR 200 million in exchange for
    $255 million on June 15, 2009. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, NRG recorded an exchange loss of
    $24 million on the contract within “Other
    income/(loss), net.”

ITISA

— On April 28, 2008, NRG completed
    the sale of its 100% interest in Tosli Acquisition B.V., or
    Tosli, which held all NRG’s interest in ITISA, to
    Brookfield Renewable Power Inc. (previously Brookfield Power
    Inc.), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management
    Inc. In addition, the purchase price adjustment contingency
    under the sale agreement was resolved on August 7, 2008. In
    connection with the sale, NRG received $300 million of cash
    proceeds from Brookfield, and removed $163 million of
    assets, including $59 million of cash, $122 million of
    liabilities, including $63 million of debt, and
    $15 million in foreign currency translation adjustment from
    its 2008 consolidated balance sheet. As discussed in
    Item 14 — Note 4,

Discontinued Operations
    and Dispositions

, to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
    the activities of Tosli and ITISA have been classified as
    discontinued operations.

USES
    OF FUNDS

The Company’s requirements for liquidity and capital
    resources, other than for operating its facilities, can
    generally be categorized by the following: (i) commercial
    operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations;
    (iii) capital expenditures including

Repowering

NRG
    and environmental; and (iv) corporate financial
    transactions including return of capital to shareholders.

Commercial
    Operations

NRG’s commercial operations activities require a
    significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These
    liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin
    and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) initial
    collateral required to establish trading relationships;
    (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e., buying
    fuel before receiving energy revenues); and (iv) initial
    collateral for large structured transactions. As of
    December 31, 2009, commercial operations had total cash
    collateral outstanding of $359 million, and
    $508 million outstanding in letters of credit to third
    parties primarily to support its economic hedging activities for
    both wholesale and retail transactions. As of December 31,
    2009, total collateral held from counterparties was
    $177 million, and $24 million of letters of credit.

Upon execution of the CSRA Amendment, effective October 5,
    2009, the Company was required to post collateral for any net
    liability derivatives, and other static margin associated with
    supply for Reliant Energy that was transferred to NRG. As of
    January 29, 2010, all wholesale energy supply contracts
    relating to retail supply hedging were transferred to the
    Company, so that Merrill Lynch was no longer providing any
    credit support for wholesale energy supply contracts relating to
    retail supply hedging.

Future liquidity requirements may change based on the
    Company’s hedging activities and structures, fuel
    purchases, and future market conditions, including forward
    prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition,
    liquidity requirements are dependent on NRG’s credit
    ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.

Debt
    Service Obligations

NRG must annually offer a portion of its excess cash flow (as
    defined in the Senior Credit Facility) to its first lien lenders
    under the Term Loan Facility. The percentage of excess cash flow
    offered to these lenders is dependent


upon the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio (as defined
    in the Senior Credit Facility) at the end of the preceding year.
    The 2010 mandatory offer related to 2009 is expected to be
    $430 million, against which the Company made a prepayment
    of $200 million in December 2009. Based on current credit
    market conditions, the Company expects that its lenders will
    accept in full the 2010 mandatory offer related to 2009, and, as
    such, the Company has reclassified approximately
    $230 million of Term Loan Facility maturity from a
    non-current to a current liability as of December 31, 2009.

On October 9, 2009, NRG commenced the process of unwinding
    the CSF II Debt, making a $181 million capital contribution
    to a CSF II cash account, effectively restricting the cash for
    the benefit of Credit Suisse Group, or CS. On October 13,
    2009, CS began the process of unwinding their hedges in
    connection with the CSF II structure, which they completed by
    November 24, 2009. Once complete, CS returned
    5,400,000 shares of NRG common stock borrowed under the
    Share Lending Agreements, and released 9,528,930 common shares
    held as collateral for the CSF II Debt, and the Company remitted
    payment to CS of the $181 million for outstanding principal
    and interest. The CSF II Debt contained an embedded derivative
    feature, or CFS II CAGR, which required NRG to pay CS at
    maturity, either in cash or stock at NRG’s option, the
    excess of NRG’s then current stock price over a Threshold
    Price of $40.80 per share. On November 24, 2009, the CSF II
    CAGR expired with no payment due.

Principal payments on debt and capital leases as of
    December 31, 2009, are due in the following periods:

Repowering

NRG project capital
    expenditures consisted of approximately $197 million
    related to the development of STP Units 3 and 4 in Texas,
    $120 million related to the Company’s Langford wind
    farm project which became commercially operational in December
    2009 and $29 million for the construction of Cedar Bayou
    Unit 4 in Texas.

The Company’s repowering capital expenditures for 2010 are
    expected to be approximately $707 million. Of this amount,
    $684 million is estimated for STP Units 3 and 4 without
    giving effect to any partner contributions or potential equity
    sell down.

Major maintenance and environmental capital
    expenditures

— The Company’s maintenance
    capital expenditures were $256 million, of which
    $160 million was related to the Texas region’s assets
    including approximately $61 million in nuclear fuel
    expenditures related to STP Units 1 and 2. The Company’s
    environmental capital expenditures were $172 million
    consisting of $130 million at the Huntley and Dunkirk
    plants due to the baghouse projects and $31 million at the
    Indian River plant due to a project to install selective
    catalytic reduction systems, scrubbers and fabric filters on
    Units 3 and 4. On February 3, 2010, NRG and DNREC announced
    a proposed plan, subject to definitive documentation, that would
    shut down Unit 3 by December 31, 2013 and relieve NRG of
    the requirement to install this back end control equipment on
    this unit. Unit 4 is not affected by this plan and construction
    on similar equipment continues with an expected in service date
    of year end 2011.

NRG anticipates funding these maintenance capital projects
    primarily with funds generated from operating activities. In
    addition, on April 15, 2009, the Company executed a
    $59 million tax-exempt bond financing through its
    wholly-owned subsidiary, Dunkirk Power LLC, with the bonds
    issued by the County of Chautauqua Industrial Development
    Agency. These funds are expected to fund environmental capital
    expenditures at the Dunkirk facility.

Loans to affiliates

— The Company had funded
    approximately $48 million in interest bearing loans to
    GenConn Energy LLC, a 50/50 joint venture vehicle of NRG and the
    United Illuminating Company as part of the Devon and Middletown
    plant repowering projects prior to the closing of the EBL and
    GenConn Facility. During 2009, these loans were repaid with
    proceeds from the EBL financing. Subsequent to the financing,
    the equity portion of construction costs for GenConn is funded
    through the EBLs of NRG Connecticut Peaking and United
    Illuminating. These funds are made available to GenConn through
    convertible interest bearing promissory notes that convert to
    equity upon repayment of the EBL loans by NRG Connecticut
    Peaking and United Illuminating. As of December 31, 2009,
    there was $108 million outstanding under the loan from NRG
    Connecticut Peaking.


Environmental
    Capital Expenditures

Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated
    that environmental capital expenditures to be incurred from 2010
    through 2014 to meet NRG’s environmental commitments will
    be approximately $0.9 billion. These capital expenditures,
    in general, are related to installation of particulate,
    SO

    NO

,
    and mercury controls to comply with federal and state air
    quality rules and consent orders, as well as installation of
    “Best Technology Available” under the Phase II
    316(b) rule. NRG continues to explore cost effective
    alternatives that can achieve desired results. While this
    estimate reflects schedules and controls to meet anticipated
    reduction requirements, the full impact on the scope and timing
    of environmental retrofits cannot be determined until issuance
    of final rules by the U.S. EPA.

This estimate reflects the recent announcement to retrofit only

    timing of other projects to reflect anticipated issuance dates
    for revised regulations.

NRG’s current contracts with the Company’s rural
    electrical customers in the South Central region allow for
    recovery of a significant portion of the regions capital costs,
    along with a capital return incurred by complying with new laws,
    including interest over the asset life of the required
    expenditures. Actual recoveries will depend, among other things,
    on the duration of the contracts.

Capital
    Allocation

2009 Capital Allocation Plan —

In addition to
    the aforementioned planned investments in maintenance and
    environmental capital expenditures and

Repowering

NRG in
    2009, and the 2009 repayment of Term Loan Facility debt to the
    first lien lenders, the Company’s Capital Allocation Plan
    included the completion of the 2008 Capital Allocation Plan with
    the purchase of $30 million of common stock as well as the
    purchase of an additional $300 million in common stock
    under the previously announced 2009 Capital Allocation Plan. In
    July 2009, as part of the Company’s 2009 Capital Allocation
    Program, the Board of Directors approved an increase to the
    Company’s previously authorized common share repurchases
    under its capital allocation plan from the existing
    $330 million to $500 million. The Company’s
    repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2009, were
    $500 million.

2010 Capital Allocation Plan —

On
    February 23, 2010, the Company announced its 2010 Capital
    Allocation Plan to purchase $180 million in common stock.
    The Company’s share repurchases are subject to market
    prices, financial restrictions under the Company’s debt
    facilities, and as permitted by securities laws. As part of the
    2010 plan, the Company will invest approximately
    $474 million in maintenance and environmental capital
    expenditures in existing assets and $707 million in
    projects under

Repowering

NRG that are currently under
    construction or for which there exists current obligations.
    Finally, in addition to scheduled debt amortization payment, in
    the first quarter 2010 the Company will offer its first lien
    lenders $430 million of its 2009 excess cash flow (as
    defined in the Senior Credit Facility) of which the Company made
    a prepayment of $200 million in December 2009.

Preferred
    Stock Dividend Payments

For the year ended December 31, 2009, NRG paid
    $6 million, $17 million and $10 million in
    dividend payments to holders of the Company’s 5.75%, 4% and
    3.625% Preferred Stock. On March 16, 2009, the outstanding
    shares of the 5.75% Preferred Stock converted into common stock
    and, as a result, there will be no further dividends paid with
    respect to this series of preferred stock. During 2009, a total
    of 265,870 shares of the 4% Preferred Stock were converted
    into common stock and 73 shares were redeemed for cash.


Benefit
    Plans Obligations

As of December 31, 2009, NRG contributed $27 million
    towards its three defined benefit pension plans to meet the
    Company’s 2009 benefit obligation. Based on the
    Company’s December 31, 2009 measurement of its benefit
    obligation for its three defined benefit pension plans, the
    Company is expected to contribute another $18 million to
    these plans during 2010, $5 million of which also relates
    to the Company’s 2009 benefit obligation.

Reliant
    Energy Customer Deposits

Revisions in the PUCT rules will require that NRG keep a
    segregated account, or that the Company post a fully
    collateralized letter of credit on or before May 21, 2010
    to cover outstanding customer deposits and residential advance
    payments. The Company’s current plan is to file for an
    amendment to its Retail Energy Provider recertification
    applications during the first quarter 2010 and post a letter of
    credit to satisfy the rule changes. The amount of deposits
    subject to segregation or collateralization at December 31,
    2009, was $54 million.

Cash
    Flow Discussion

The following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the
    comparative years; all cash flow categories include the cash
    flows from both continuing operations and discontinued
    operations:

Net Cash
    Provided By Operating Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash provided by
    operating activities increased by $627 million compared to
    the same period in 2008, due to:

•

Cash generated by Reliant Energy

— Reliant
    Energy contributed approximately $855 million to
    the Company’s consolidated cash flow from operations
    in 2009, primarily reflecting $966 million in
    pre-tax income since the May 1, 2009, acquisition
    date, adjusted for the non-cash effects of depreciation
    and amortization and changes in derivatives.

•

Lower cash flows from Wholesale Power Generation

— The Company’s cash flow from
    operation excluding Reliant Energy was lower by
    approximately $228 million in 2009 compared to 2008,
    as decreases in generation and power prices impacted
    results from operations. In addition, $16 million more
    cash was used for working capital in 2009 compared to 2008, as
    higher coal inventory balances were partially offset by
    $72 million in lower pension contributions.

Net Cash
    Used By Investing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash used in
    investing activities increased by $282 million compared to
    the same period in 2008, due to:

•

Acquisition of businesses

— During 2009, the
    Company paid $427 million, net of cash acquired
    of $6 million, to acquire three businesses.

•

Proceeds from sale of equity method investment and
    discontinued operations

— Net proceeds
    from investing activities increased by $43 million in
    2009 as compared to 2008 due to the sale of MIBRAG in June
    2009 for net proceeds of $284 million compared to the sale
    of ITISA for proceeds, net of divested cash, of
    $241 million in April 2008.


•

Capital expenditures and loans to affiliates

— NRG’s capital expenditures decreased by
    $165 million due to decreased spending on

Repowering

NRG.

•

Trading of emission allowances

— Net purchases
    and sales of emission allowances resulted in a decrease in
    cash of $105 million for 2009 as compared to 2008.

Net Cash
    Used By Financing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash used by
    financing activities decreased by $144 million compared to
    the same period in 2008, due to:

•

Issuance of debt

— During 2009, the Company
    received $688 million in gross proceeds from the
    2019 Senior Notes, $108 million in NRG Connecticut
    Peaking financing, $52 million from the Dunkirk
    bonds and $19 million from other borrowings. During
    2008, the Company received $20 million in
    proceeds from borrowings which resulted in a net cash
    increase of $872 million.

•

Term Loan Facility debt payment

— In 2009, the
    Company paid down $429 million of its Term
    Loan Facility, including the payment of excess cash flow,
    as discussed above under

Debt Service
    Obligations

. The Company paid down $174 million of
    its Term Loan Facility during 2008 which resulted in a net
    cash decrease of $255 million.

•

Other debt payments

— In November 2009, the
    Company paid $181 million to CS for the benefit of
    CSF II to unwind the Company’s CSF II notes and
    preferred interests.

•

Share repurchase

— During 2009, the Company
    repurchased common stock of $500 million as
    compared to $185 million in 2008, which resulted in a
    net cash decrease of $315 million.

NOLs,
    Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications,
    under ASC-740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had generated total
    domestic pre-tax book income of $1.5 billion and foreign
    continuing pre-tax book income of $161 million. The Company
    has net operating losses for tax return purposes available to
    offset taxable income in the current period. The tax return net
    operating losses have been classified as capital loss
    carryforwards for financial statement purposes and a full
    valuation allowance has been established. As of
    December 31, 2009, these capital losses have expired for
    financial statement purposes. In addition, NRG has cumulative
    foreign NOL carryforwards of $280 million, of which
    $82 million will expire starting in 2011 through 2017 and
    of which $198 million do not have an expiration date.

In addition to these amounts, the Company has $643 million
    of tax effected unrecognized tax benefits which relate primarily
    to net operating losses for tax return purposes but have been
    classified as capital loss carryforwards for financial
    statements purposes and for which a full valuation allowance has
    been established. As a result of the Company’s tax
    position, and based on current forecasts, we anticipate income
    tax payments of up to $75 million in 2010.

However, as the position remains uncertain for the
    $643 million of tax effected unrecognized tax benefits, the
    Company has recorded a non-current tax liability of
    $347 million and may accrue the remaining balance as an
    increase to non-current liabilities until final resolution with
    the related taxing authority. The $347 million non-current
    tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits is primarily due to
    taxable earnings for the period for which there are no NOLs
    available to offset for financial statement purposes.

The Company is under examination by the Internal Revenue Service
    for years 2004 through 2006. It is possible that the IRS
    examination may conclude during 2010 but because of a possible
    extension, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible
    changes in unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.


Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Obligations
    under Certain Guarantee Contracts

NRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee
    arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate
    commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements
    include financial and performance guarantees, stand-by letters
    of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications.
    See also Item 14 — Note 26,

Guarantees,

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    discussion.

Retained
    or Contingent Interests

NRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests
    in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.

Derivative
    Instrument Obligations

The Company’s 3.625% Preferred Stock includes a feature
    which is considered an embedded derivative per ASC 815. Although
    it is considered an embedded derivative, it is exempt from
    derivative accounting as it is excluded from the scope pursuant
    to ASC 815. As of December 31, 2009, based on the
    Company’s stock price, the embedded derivative was

out-of-the-money

and had no redemption value. See also Item 14 —
    Note 15,

Capital Structure,

to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional discussion.

Obligations
    Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated
    Entity

Variable interest in Equity investments

— As of
    December 31, 2009, NRG has several investments with an
    ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and
    energy-related entities that are accounted for under the equity
    method of accounting. One of these investments, GenConn Energy
    LLC, is a variable interest entity for which NRG is not the
    primary beneficiary.

NRG’s pro-rata share of non-recourse debt held by
    unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $93 million as
    of December 31, 2009. This indebtedness may restrict the
    ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or
    distributions to NRG. See also Item 14 —
    Note 16,

Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method,

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    discussion.

Letter of Credit Facilities

— The
    Company’s $1.3 billion Synthetic Letter of Credit
    Facility is unfunded by NRG and is secured by a
    $1.3 billion cash deposit at Deutsche Bank AG, New York
    Branch that was funded using proceeds from the Term Loan
    Facility investors who participated in the facility syndication.
    Under the Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, NRG is allowed to
    issue letters of credit for general corporate purposes including
    posting collateral to support the Company’s commercial
    operations activities.


Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments

NRG has a variety of contractual obligations and other
    commercial commitments that represent prospective cash
    requirements in addition to the Company’s capital
    expenditure programs. The following tables summarize NRG’s
    contractual obligations and contingent obligations for
    guarantee. See also Item 14 — Note 12,

Fair
    Value of Derivative Instruments

NRG may enter into long-term power sales contracts, fuel
    purchase contracts and other energy-related financial
    instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to
    fluctuations in spot market prices and to hedge fuel
    requirements at generation facilities. In addition, in order to
    mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the
    Company’s variable rate and fixed rate debt, NRG enters
    into interest rate swap agreements.


NRG’s trading activities are subject to limits in
    accordance with the Company’s Risk Management Policy. These
    contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and
    changes in the fair value of these derivative financial
    instruments are recognized in earnings.

The tables below disclose the activities that include both
    exchange and non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair
    value in accordance with ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosures

, or ASC 820. Specifically, these tables
    disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value;
    disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2009,
    based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in
    ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at
    December 31, 2009. Also, in connection with the
    Company’s acquisition of Reliant Energy, NRG acquired
    retail load and supply contracts. The tables below also includes

A small portion of NRG’s contracts are exchange-traded
    contracts with readily available quoted market prices. The
    majority of NRG’s contracts are non-exchange-traded
    contracts valued using prices provided by external sources,
    primarily price quotations available through brokers or

over-the-counter

and on-line exchanges. For the majority of NRG markets, the
    Company receives quotes from multiple sources. To the extent
    that NRG receives multiple quotes, the Company’s prices
    reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices obtained
    from all sources that NRG believes provide the most liquid
    market for the commodity. If the Company receives one quote then
    the mid point of the bid-ask spread for that quote is used. The
    terms for which such price information is available vary by
    commodity, region and product. A significant portion of the fair
    value of the Company’s derivative portfolio is based on
    price quotes from brokers in active markets who regularly
    facilitate the Company’s transactions and the Company
    believes such price quotes are executable. The Company does not
    use third party sources that derive price based on proprietary
    models or market surveys. The remainder of the assets and
    liabilities represent contracts for which external sources or
    observable market quotes are not available. These contracts are
    valued based on various valuation techniques including but not
    limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of
    the market and extrapolation of observable market data with
    similar characteristics. Contracts valued with prices provided
    by models and other valuation techniques make up 3% of the total
    fair value of all derivative contracts. The fair value of each
    contract is discounted using a risk free interest rate. In
    addition, the Company applies a credit reserve to reflect credit
    risk which is calculated based on published default
    probabilities. To the extent that NRG’s net exposure after
    cash collateral paid/received under a specific master agreement
    is an asset, the Company calculates credit reserve applying the
    counterparty’s default swap rate. If the net exposure after
    cash collateral paid/received under a specific master agreement
    is a liability, the Company calculates credit reserve applying
    NRG’s default swap rate. The credit reserve is added to the
    discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market
    participant would be willing to receive to assume NRG’s
    liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay
    for NRG’s assets. As of December 31, 2009, the credit
    reserve resulted in a $1 million increase in fair value
    which is composed of a $1 million loss in OCI and a
    $2 million gain in derivative revenue and cost of
    operations.


The fair values in each category reflect the level of forward
    prices and volatility factors as of December 31, 2009 and
    may change as a result of changes in these factors. Management
    uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity
    and derivative contracts NRG holds and sells. These estimates
    consider various factors including closing exchange and

over-the-counter

price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit
    exposure. It is possible however, that future market prices
    could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities
    from energy marketing and trading activities and such variations
    could be material.

The Company has elected to disclose derivative assets and
    liabilities on a

trade-by-trade

basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master
    agreement level. Also, collateral received or paid on the
    Company’s derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on
    a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the
    magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current
    derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying
    credit and market risk of the Company’s portfolio. As
    discussed in Item 6A

— Commodity Price
    Risk

, NRG measures the sensitivity of the Company’s
    portfolio to potential changes in market prices using Value at
    Risk, or VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk
    of loss based on market price and volatility. NRG’s risk
    management policy places a limit on

one-day

holding period VaR, which limits the Company’s net open
    position. As the Company’s

trade-by-trade

derivative accounting results in a

gross-up

of
    the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities, the net
    derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator
    of NRG’s hedging activity. As of December 31, 2009,
    NRG’s net derivative asset was $459 million, a
    decrease to total fair value of $537 million as compared to
    December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by
    the acquisition of Reliant Energy’s retail portfolio offset
    by increase in fair value due to the decreases in gas and power
    prices as well as the roll-off of trades that settled during the
    period.

Based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions,
    the impact of a $1 per MMBtu increase or decrease in natural gas
    prices across the term of the derivative contracts would cause a
    change of approximately $489 million in the net value of
    derivatives as of December 31, 2009.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

NRG’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition
    and results of operations are based upon the consolidated
    financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    U.S. The preparation of these financial statements and
    related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, or GAAP, requires the application of
    appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as
    the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
    related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The
    application of these policies necessarily involves judgments
    regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of
    particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges. These
    judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the
    financial statements and disclosures based on varying
    assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the
    financial and operating environment may also have a significant
    effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the
    results reported through the application of accounting measures
    used in preparing the financial statements and related
    disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have
    not changed.

On an ongoing basis, NRG evaluates these estimates, utilizing
    historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods
    the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results
    may differ substantially from the Company’s estimates. Any
    effects on the Company’s business, financial position or
    results of operations resulting from revisions to these
    estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that
    give rise to the revision become known.

NRG’s significant accounting policies are summarized in
    Item 14 — Note 2,

Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

, to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting
    policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to
    the portrayal of the Company’s


financial position and results of operations, and that require
    the most difficult, subjective

and/or

complex judgments by management regarding estimates about
    matters that are inherently uncertain.

mark-to-market

all derivative instruments on the balance sheet, and recognize
    changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments
    immediately in earnings. In certain cases, NRG may apply hedge
    accounting to the Company’s derivative instruments. The
    criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is
    appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an
    underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being
    reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the
    fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying
    hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in
    earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the
    related hedged item, or deferred and recorded as a component of
    OCI, and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged
    transactions occur.


For purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative
    instruments, NRG uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes.
    When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models
    to determine the fair value. These internal models include
    assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on
    the specific market in which the energy commodity is being
    purchased or sold, using externally available forward market
    pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model.
    In order to qualify derivative instruments for hedged
    transactions, NRG estimates the forecasted generation occurring
    within a specified time period. Judgments related to the
    probability of forecasted generation occurring are based on
    available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and
    generation, and historical physical delivery on similar
    contracts. The probability that hedged forecasted generation
    will occur by the end of a specified time period could change
    the results of operations by requiring amounts currently
    classified in OCI to be reclassified into earnings, creating
    increased variability in the Company’s earnings. These
    estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.

Certain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for
    derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope
    exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered NPNS.
    The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption
    that NRG has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take
    delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on
    available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and
    generation and historical physical delivery on contracts.
    Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from
    derivative accounting treatment, and are accounted for under
    accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction
    designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to
    changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on
    the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate
    recognition through earnings.

Income
    Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax
    Assets

As of December 31, 2009, NRG had a valuation allowance of
    $233 million. This amount is comprised of
    U.S. domestic capital loss carryforwards and
    non-depreciable property of $154 million, foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards of $78 million and foreign
    capital loss carryforwards of approximately $1 million. In
    assessing the recoverability of NRG’s deferred tax assets,
    the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that
    some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
    The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
    upon projected capital gains and available tax planning
    strategies.

NRG continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing
    authorities in other jurisdictions. Considerable judgment is
    required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item
    that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. NRG is
    subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax
    returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various
    state and foreign jurisdictions including major operations
    located in Germany and Australia. The Company is no longer
    subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years
    prior to 2002. With few exceptions, state and local income tax
    examinations are no longer open for years before 2003. The
    Company’s significant foreign operations are also no longer
    subject to examination by local jurisdictions for years prior to
    2000.

Evaluation
    of Assets for Impairment and Other Than Temporary Decline in
    Value

In accordance with ASC-360,

Property, Plant, and
    Equipment

, or ASC 360, NRG evaluates property, plant and
    equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever
    indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or
    events are:

•

Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;

•

Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used
    or its physical condition;

•

Adverse business climate;

•

Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
    originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an
    asset;

•

Current-period loss combined with a history of losses or the
    projection of future losses; and

•

Change in the Company’s intent about an asset from an
    intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset
    will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously
    estimated useful life.

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
    comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future
    net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through
    considering project specific assumptions for long-term power
    pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and
    expected plant operations. If such


assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
    recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by
    factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of
    action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be
    determined using valuation techniques such as the present value
    of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in
    making these evaluations and considers various factors,
    including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs and
    operating costs. However, actual future market prices and
    project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the
    Company’s estimates, and the impact of such variations
    could be material.

For assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that
    the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the
    carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to
    determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets

held-for-sale

are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value
    less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value under ASC
    360, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or
    with an asset

held-for-sale,

and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature
    subjective. NRG considers quoted market prices in active markets
    to the extent they are available. In the absence of such
    information, the Company may consider prices of similar assets,
    consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. NRG
    will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated
    with the asset using a single interest rate representative of
    the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected
    present value method that probability-weights a range of
    possible outcomes. The use of these methods involves the same
    inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously
    discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future
    market prices and project costs could vary from those used in
    the Company’s estimates, and the impact of such variations
    could be material.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, and 2007, there were
    reductions of $23 million and $11 million,
    respectively, in income from continuing operation due to
    impairment of an investment in commercial paper. The Company
    recorded these impairments as a reduction to interest income.
    There were no impairment charges on this investment in 2009.

NRG is also required to evaluate its equity-method and
    cost-method investments to determine whether or not they are
    impaired. ASC-323,

Investments-Equity Method and Joint
    Ventures

, or ASC 323, provides the accounting requirements
    for these investments. The standard for determining whether an
    impairment must be recorded under ASC 323 is whether the value
    is considered an “other than a temporary” decline in
    value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under ASC
    323 involves the same uncertainties as described for long-lived
    assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in
    accordance with ASC 360. Similarly, the estimates that NRG makes
    with respect to its equity and cost-method investments are
    subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates
    could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the
    Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under
    the provisions of ASC 360, NRG would record its proportionate
    share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment
    for an other than temporary decline in value under ASC 323.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

As part of the acquisition of Texas Genco in 2006, NRG recorded
    goodwill and intangible assets at its Texas segment reporting
    unit. The Company also recorded intangible assets in connection
    with the Reliant Energy acquisition in 2009, measured primarily
    based on significant inputs that are not observable in the
    market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined
    in ASC 820. See Item 14 — Note 3,

Business Acquisitions

, to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for a discussion of the Reliant Energy acquisition
    fair value measurements. The Company applied ASC 805,

Business Combinations,

or ASC 805, and ASC 350,

Intangibles — Goodwill and Other

, or ASC 350,
    to account for its goodwill and intangible assets. Under these
    standards, the Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible
    assets over their respective estimated weighted-average useful
    lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not
    amortized. However, goodwill and all intangible assets not
    subject to amortization are tested for impairments at least
    annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in
    circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the
    fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The
    Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit
    level, which is identified by assessing whether the components
    of the Company’s operating segments constitute businesses
    for which discrete financial information is available and
    whether segment management regularly reviews the operating
    results of those components. If it is determined that the fair
    value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, where
    necessary the Company’s goodwill

and/or

intangible asset with indefinite lives will be impaired at that
    time.


The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment
    as of December 31, 2009, for its Texas reporting unit, or
    NRG Texas, which is at the operating segment level. The Company
    determined the fair value of this reporting unit using primarily
    an income approach and then applied an overall market approach
    reasonableness test to reconcile that fair value with NRG’s
    overall market capitalization. Significant inputs to the
    determination of fair value were as follows:

•

For the three solid-fuel baseload plants that drive a majority
    of the value in the reporting unit, and for the region’s
    Elbow Creek, Langford and Cedar Bayou facilities that recently
    commenced operations, the Company applied a discounted cash flow
    methodology to their long-term budgets in accordance with the
    guidance in paragraphs B152 and B155 of SFAS 142. This
    approach is consistent with that used to determine fair value at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. These budgets are based on the
    Company’s views of power and fuel prices, which consider
    market prices in the near term and the Company’s
    fundamental view for the longer term as some relevant market
    prices are illiquid beyond 24 months. Hedging is included
    to the extent of contracts already in place. Projected
    generation in the long-term budgets is based on
    management’s estimate of supply and demand within the

sub-markets

for each plant and the physical and economic characteristics of
    each plant;

•

For the reporting unit’s remaining gas plants, the Company
    applied a market-derived earnings multiple to the gas
    plants’ aggregate estimated 2009 earnings before interest,
    taxes, depreciation and amortization, in accordance with the
    guidance in ASC-350-20-35-24. This approach is consistent with
    that used to determine fair values at December 31, 2008 and
    2007;

•

The potential impact of carbon legislation was estimated using a
    discounted cash flow methodology applied to the Company’s
    view of the impact of potential legislation that is based on
    recent proposals to Congress.

If fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value,
    goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. Under
    the income approach described above, the Company estimated the
    fair value of NRG Texas’ invested capital to exceed its
    carrying value by approximately 25% at December 31, 2009.
    This estimate of fair value is affected by assumptions about
    projected power prices, generation, fuel costs, capital
    expenditure requirements and environmental regulations, and the
    Company believes that the most significant impact arises from
    future power prices. Assuming all other factors are held
    constant, a hypothetical $1 drop in the Company’s long-term
    natural gas price view would not have caused the fair value of
    NRG Texas to fall below its carrying value at December 31,
    2009.

To reconcile the fair value determined under the income approach
    with NRG’s market capitalization, the Company considered
    historical and future budgeted earnings measures to estimate the
    average percentage of total company value represented by NRG
    Texas, and applied this percentage to an adjusted business
    enterprise value of NRG. To derive this adjusted business
    enterprise value, the Company applied a range of control
    premiums based on recent market transactions to the business
    enterprise value of NRG on a non-controlling, marketable basis,
    and also made adjustments for some non-operating assets and for
    some of the significant factors that impact NRG differently from
    NRG Texas, such as environmental capital expenditures outside of
    the Texas region, or limitations on the Company’s Capital
    Allocation Plans under NRG’s debt. The Company was able to
    reconcile the proportional value of NRG Texas to NRG’s
    market capitalization at a value that would not indicate an
    impairment.

Contingencies

NRG records a loss contingency when management determines it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until management determines it is certain that the
    future event will become or does become a reality. Such
    determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts
    and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of
    the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail
    its contingencies in Item 14 — Note 22,

Commitments and Contingencies,

to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.


Accrued
    Unbilled Revenues

Accrued unbilled revenues related to the Reliant Energy segment
    are critical accounting estimates as volumes are not precisely
    known at the end of each reporting period and the revenue
    amounts are material. Accrued unbilled revenues were
    $308 million as of December 31, 2009, which represents
    3% of the Company’s consolidated revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, and 7% of Reliant Energy’s
    revenues for the eight-month period ended December 31,
    2009. Accrued unbilled revenues are based on Reliant
    Energy’s estimates of customer usage since the date of the
    last meter reading provided by the independent system operators
    or electric distribution companies. Volume estimates are based
    on daily forecasted volumes and estimated customer usage by
    class. Unbilled revenues are calculated by multiplying these
    volume estimates by the applicable rate by customer class.
    Estimated amounts are adjusted when actual usage is known and
    billed.

    Accounting Developments

    developments.

Item 6A —

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

NRG is exposed to several market risks in the Company’s
    normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss
    that may result from market changes associated with the
    Company’s merchant power generation or with an existing or
    forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of
    market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk,
    interest rate risk and currency exchange risk. In order to
    manage these risks the Company uses various fixed-price forward
    purchase and sales contracts, futures and option contracts
    traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps and
    options traded in the

over-the-counter

financial markets to:

•

Manage and hedge fixed-price purchase and sales commitments;

•

Manage and hedge exposure to variable rate debt obligations;

•

Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices, and

•

Hedge fuel requirements for the Company’s generating
    facilities.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot
    prices, forward prices, volatility in commodities, and
    correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas,
    electricity, coal, oil, and emissions credits. A number of
    factors influence the level and volatility of prices for energy
    commodities and related derivative products. These factors
    include:

•

Seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;

•

Extreme peak demands due to weather conditions;

•

Available supply resources;

•

Transportation availability and reliability within and between
    regions; and

•

Changes in the nature and extent of federal and state
    regulations.

NRG’s portfolio consists of generation assets and full
    requirement load serving obligations. NRG manages the commodity
    price risk of the Company’s merchant generation operations
    and load serving obligations by entering into various derivative
    or non-derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future
    cash flows from forecasted sales of electricity and purchases
    and fuel. These instruments include forwards, futures, swaps,
    and option contracts traded on various exchanges, such as New
    York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, Intercontinental Exchange,
    or ICE, and Chicago Climate Exchange, or CCX, as well as

over-the-counter

markets. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary
    based upon management’s assessment of market, weather,
    operation and other factors.

While some of the contracts the Company uses to manage risk
    represent commodities or instruments for which prices are
    available from external sources, other commodities and certain
    contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other
    pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected
    future market prices, contract quantities, or both. NRG uses the
    Company’s best estimates to determine the fair value of
    those derivative contracts.


However, it is likely that future market prices could vary from
    those used in recording

mark-to-market

derivative instrument valuation, and such variations could be
    material.

NRG measures the risk of the Company’s portfolio using
    several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests,
    scenario tests, stress tests, position reports, and VaR. VaR is
    a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based
    on market price and volatility. Currently, the company estimates
    VaR using a Monte Carlo simulation based methodology.

NRG uses a diversified VaR model to calculate an estimate of the
    potential loss in the fair value of the Company’s energy
    assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, load
    obligations, and bilateral physical and financial transactions.
    The key assumptions for the Company’s diversified model
    include: (i) a lognormal distribution of prices;

(ii) one-day

holding period; (iii) a 95% confidence interval;
    (iv) a rolling

36-month

forward looking period; and (v) market implied volatilities
    and historical price correlations.

As of December 31, 2009, the VaR for NRG’s commodity
    portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and
    bilateral physical and financial transactions calculated using
    the diversified VaR model was $38 million.

The following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VaR
    for NRG for the year ended December 31, 2009, and 2008:

VaR

In millions

As of December 31, 2009

$


Average

As of December 31, 2008

Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as
    VaR, the evolving nature of the competitive markets for
    electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of
    changes in market prices, the VaR calculation may not capture
    the full extent of commodity price exposure. As a result, actual
    changes in the fair value of

mark-to-market

energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated
    VaR, and such changes could have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial results.

In order to provide additional information for comparative
    purposes to NRG’s peers, the Company also uses VaR to
    estimate the potential loss of derivative financial instruments
    that are subject to

mark-to-market

accounting. These derivative instruments include transactions
    that were entered into for both asset management and trading
    purposes. The VaR for the derivative financial instruments
    calculated using the diversified VaR model as of
    December 31, 2009, for the entire term of these instruments
    entered into for both asset management and trading, was
    $24 million primarily driven by asset-backed transactions.

Interest
    Rate Risk

NRG is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through the
    Company’s issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt.
    Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by
    entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate
    swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts
    reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in
    primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account
    the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate
    derivative instrument. NRG’s risk management policies allow
    the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate
    debt obligations.

In May 2009, NRG entered into a series of forward-starting
    interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps become effective
    on April 1, 2011, and are intended to hedge the risks
    associated with floating interest rates. For each of the
    interest rate swaps, the Company will pay its counterparty the
    equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a predetermined
    notional value, and NRG receives the monthly equivalent of a
    floating interest payment based on a

1-month

LIBOR calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate
    swap payments by NRG and its


counterparties are made monthly and the LIBOR is determined in
    advance of each interest period. The total notional amount of
    these swaps, which mature on February 1, 2013, is
    $900 million.

In 2006, the Company entered into a series of interest rate
    swaps which are intended to hedge the risk associated with
    floating interest rates. For each of the interest rate swaps,
    NRG pays its counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest
    payment on a predetermined notional value, and NRG receives the
    equivalent of a floating interest payment based on a

3-month

LIBOR rate calculated on the same notional value. All interest
    rate swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made
    quarterly, and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each
    interest period. While the notional value of each of the swaps
    does not vary over time, the swaps are designed to mature
    sequentially. The total notional amount of these swaps as of
    December 31, 2009, was $1.7 billion. The maturities
    and notional amounts of each tranche of these swaps in
    connection with the Senior Credit Facility are as follows:

Maturity

Notional Value

$

190 million

March 31, 2011

In addition to those discussed above, the Company had the
    following additional interest rate swaps outstanding as of
    December 31, 2009:

If all of the above swaps had been discontinued on
    December 31, 2009, the Company would have owed the
    counterparties $104 million. Based on the investment grade
    rating of the counterparties, NRG believes its exposure to
    credit risk due to nonperformance by counterparties to its hedge
    contracts to be insignificant.

NRG has both long and short-term debt instruments that subject
    the Company to the risk of loss associated with movements in
    market interest rates. As of December 31, 2009, a 1% change
    in interest rates would result in a $10 million change in
    interest expense on a rolling twelve month basis.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company’s long-term debt
    fair value was $8.2 billion and the carrying amount was
    $8.3 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market
    interest rates would have increased the fair value of the
    Company’s long-term debt by $415 million.

Liquidity
    Risk

Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of
    NRG’s activities and in the management of the
    Company’s assets and liabilities. NRG’s liquidity
    management framework is intended to maximize liquidity access
    and minimize funding costs. Through active liquidity management,
    the Company seeks to preserve stable, reliable and
    cost-effective sources of funding. This enables the Company to
    replace maturing obligations when due and fund assets at
    appropriate maturities and rates. To accomplish this task,
    management uses a variety of liquidity risk measures that take
    into consideration market conditions, prevailing interest rates,
    liquidity needs, and the desired maturity profile of liabilities.

Based on a sensitivity analysis for power and gas positions
    under marginable contracts, a $1 per MMBtu change in natural gas
    prices across the term of the marginable contracts would cause a
    change in margin collateral posted of approximately
    $128 million as of December 31, 2009, and a
    0.25 MMBtu/MWh change in heat rates for heat rate positions
    would result in a change in margin collateral posted of
    approximately $51 million as of December 31, 2009.
    This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated
    based on portfolio composition and margin-related contract
    provisions as of December 31, 2009. Currently, NRG is
    exposed to additional margin if natural gas prices decrease.

Under the second lien, NRG is required to post certain letter of
    credits as credit support for changes in commodity prices. As of
    December 31, 2009, no letters of credit are outstanding to
    second lien counterparties. With changes in commodity prices,
    the letters of credit could grow to $64 million, the cap
    under the agreements.


Credit
    Risk

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from
    non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the
    terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and
    manages credit risk through credit policies that include:
    (i) an established credit approval process; (ii) a
    daily monitoring of counterparties’ credit limits;
    (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin,
    collateral, credit derivatives, prepayment arrangements, or
    volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting
    agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements
    that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of
    various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks
    surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately
    impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company
    seeks to mitigate counterparty risk with a diversified portfolio
    of counterparties, including nine participants under its first
    and second lien structure. The Company also has credit
    protection within various agreements to call on additional
    collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is
    collected and held at NRG to cover the credit risk of the
    counterparty until positions settle.

As of December 31, 2009, total credit exposure to
    substantially all wholesale counterparties was $1.3 billion
    and NRG held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against
    those positions of $186 million resulting in a net exposure
    of $1.1 billion. Total credit exposure is discounted at the
    risk free rate.

The following table highlights the credit quality and the net
    counterparty credit exposure by industry sector. Net
    counterparty credit risk is defined as the aggregate net asset
    position for NRG with counterparties where netting is permitted
    under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow,

mark-to-market

and NPNS, and non-derivative transactions. The exposure is shown
    net of collateral held, and includes amounts net of receivables
    or payables.

Credit exposure excludes California
    tolling, uranium, coal transportation/railcar leases, New
    England RMR, certain cooperative load contracts and Texas
    Westmoreland coal contracts. The aforementioned exposures were
    excluded for various reasons including regulatory support liens
    held against the contracts which serve to reduce the risk of
    loss, or credit risks for certain contracts are not readily
    measurable due to a lack of market reference prices.

NRG has credit risk exposure to certain wholesale counterparties
    representing more than 10% of total net exposure and the
    aggregate of such counterparties was $351 million.
    Approximately 82% of NRG’s positions relating to credit
    risk roll-off by the end of 2012. Changes in hedge positions and
    market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty
    concentration. Given the credit quality, diversification and
    term of the exposure in the portfolio, NRG does not anticipate a
    material impact on the Company’s financial position or
    results of operations from nonperformance by any of NRG’s
    counterparties.

NRG is exposed to retail credit risk through its competitive
    electricity supply business, which serves C&I customers and
    the Mass market in Texas. Retail credit risk results when a
    customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses could be
    incurred from nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and any

in-the-money

forward value. NRG manages retail credit risk through the use of
    established credit policies that include monitoring of the
    portfolio, and the use of credit mitigation measures such as
    deposits or prepayment arrangements.


As of December 31, 2009, the Company’s credit exposure
    to C&I customers was diversified across many customers and
    various industries. No one customer represented more than 2% of
    total exposure and the majority of the customers have investment
    grade credit quality, as determined by NRG.

NRG is also exposed to credit risk relating to its
    1.5 million Mass customers, which may result in a write-off
    of a bad debt. The current economic conditions may affect the
    Company’s customers’ ability to pay bills in a timely
    manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead
    to an increase in bad debt expense.

Certain of the Company’s hedging agreements contain
    provisions that require the Company to post additional
    collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been
    deterioration in credit quality, generally termed “adequate
    assurance” under the agreements. Other agreements contain
    provisions that require the Company to post additional
    collateral if there was a one notch downgrade in the
    Company’s credit rating. The collateral required for

out-of-the-money

positions and net accounts payable for contracts that have
    adequate assurance clauses that are in a net liability position
    as of December 31, 2009, was $80 million. The
    collateral required for

out-of-the-money

positions and net accounts payable for contracts with credit
    rating contingent features that are in a net liability position
    as of December 31, 2009, was $49 million. The Company
    is also a party to certain marginable agreements where NRG has a
    net liability position but the counterparty has not called for
    the collateral due, which is approximately $3 million as of
    December 31, 2009.

Currency
    Exchange Risk

NRG may be subject to foreign currency risk as a result of the
    Company entering into purchase commitments with foreign vendors
    for the purchase of major equipment associated with

Repowering

NRG initiatives. To reduce the risks to such
    foreign currency exposure, the Company may enter into
    transactions to hedge its foreign currency exposure using
    currency options and forward contracts. At December 31,
    2009, no foreign currency options and forward contracts were
    outstanding.

In connection with the MIBRAG sale transaction, NRG entered into
    a foreign currency forward contract to hedge the impact of
    exchange rate fluctuations on the sale proceeds. The foreign
    currency forward contract had a fixed exchange rate of 1.277 and
    required NRG to deliver EUR 200 million in exchange
    for $255 million on June 15, 2009. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, NRG recorded an exchange loss of
    $24 million on the contract within “Other
    income/(loss), net.”

As a result of the Company’s limited foreign currency
    exposure to date, the effect of foreign currency fluctuations
    has not been material to the Company’s results of
    operations, financial position and cash flows.

The effects of a hypothetical simultaneous 10% appreciation in
    the U.S. dollar from year-end 2008 levels against all other
    currencies of countries in which the Company has continuing
    operations would result in an immaterial impact to NRG’s
    consolidated statements of operations and approximately
    $79 million in pre-tax unrealized income reflected in the
    currency translation adjustment component of OCI.

Conclusion
    Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of NRG’s
    management, including its principal executive officer, principal
    financial officer and principal accounting officer, NRG
    conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such
    term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

or

15d-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s
    principal executive officer, principal financial officer and
    principal accounting


officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective as of the end of the period covered by this
    annual report on

Form 10-K.

Management’s report on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting and the report of the Company’s
    independent registered public accounting firm are incorporated
    under the caption “Management’s Report on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting” and under the caption
    “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
    Firm,” of the Company’s 2009 Annual Report to
    Shareholders.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting (as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) that occurred in the fourth quarter of
    2009 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations over Internal Controls

NRG’s internal control over financial reporting is designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that:

1.

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of our assets;

2.

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
    made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
    and directors; and

3.

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our
    assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated
    financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
    absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
    because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility
    of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of
    controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system
    may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely
    basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
    future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

NRG Energy Inc.’s management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company’s management, including its principal executive
    officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting
    officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the
    Company’s evaluation under the framework in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework, the Company’s
    management concluded that its internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been
    audited by KPMG LLP, the Company’s independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is
    included in this

Form 10-K.


REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

NRG Energy, Inc.:

We have audited NRG Energy, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO). NRG Energy, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, NRG Energy, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries
    as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
    and comprehensive income / (loss), and cash flows for
    each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2009, and our report dated February 23,
    2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
    financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

NRG Energy, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009
    and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
    income / (loss), and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009. In
    connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
    statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule
    “Schedule II. Valuation and Qualifying Accounts.”
    These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
    our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (SFAS) 141R,

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 —

Nature
    of Business

General

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is primarily a
    wholesale power generation company with a significant presence
    in major competitive power markets in the U.S., as well a major
    retail electricity franchise in the ERCOT (Texas) market. NRG is
    engaged in the ownership, development, construction and
    operation of power generation facilities, the transacting in and
    trading of fuel and transportation services, the trading of
    energy, capacity and related products in the U.S. and
    select international markets, and supply of electricity and
    energy services to retail electricity customers in the Texas
    market.

As of December 31, 2009, NRG had a total global generation
    portfolio of 187 active operating fossil fuel and nuclear
    generation units, at 44 power generation plants, with an
    aggregate generation capacity of approximately 24,115 MW,
    and approximately 400 MW under construction which includes
    partner interests of 200 MW. In addition to its fossil fuel
    plant ownership, NRG has ownership interests in operating
    renewable facilities with an aggregate generation capacity of
    365 MW, consisting of three wind farms representing an
    aggregate generation capacity of 345 MW (which includes
    partner interest of 75 MW) and a solar facility with an
    aggregate generation capacity of 20 MW. Within the U.S.,
    NRG has large and diversified power generation portfolios in
    terms of geography, fuel-type and dispatch levels, with
    approximately 23,110 MW of fossil fuel and nuclear
    generation capacity in 179 active generating units at 42 plants.
    The Company’s power generation facilities are most heavily
    concentrated in Texas (approximately 11,340 MW, including
    345 MW from three wind farms), the Northeast (approximately
    7,015 MW), South Central (approximately 2,855 MW), and
    West (approximately 2,150 MW, including 20 MW from a
    solar farm) regions of the U.S., with approximately 115 MW
    of additional generation capacity from the Company’s
    thermal assets. In addition, through certain foreign
    subsidiaries, NRG has investments in power generation projects
    located in Australia and Germany with approximately
    1,005 MW of generation capacity.

On May 1, 2009, NRG acquired Reliant Energy, which is the
    second largest electricity provider to Mass customers in Texas.
    Reliant Energy is also the largest electricity and energy
    services provider, based on load, to C&I customers in
    Texas. Based on metered locations, as of December 31, 2009,
    Reliant Energy had approximately 1.5 million Mass customers
    and approximately 0.1 million C&I customers. Reliant
    Energy arranges for the transmission and delivery of electricity
    to customers, bills customers, collects payments for electricity
    sold and maintains call centers to provide customer service.

NRG was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on May 29,
    1992. NRG’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock
    Exchange under the symbol “NRG”. The Company’s
    headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 211
    Carnegie Center, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. NRG’s
    telephone number is

(609) 524-4500.

The address of the Company’s website is

www.nrgenergy.com

. NRG’s recent annual reports,
    quarterly reports, current reports, and other periodic filings
    are available free of charge through the Company’s website.

Note 2 —

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include NRG’s
    accounts and operations and those of its subsidiaries in which
    the Company has a controlling interest. All significant
    intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
    consolidation. The usual condition for a controlling financial
    interest is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of
    an entity. However, a controlling financial interest may also
    exist in entities, such as a variable interest entity, through
    arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests.

As such, NRG applies the guidance of ASC 810,

Consolidations,

or ASC 810, to consolidate variable interest entities, or
    VIEs, for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. ASC 810
    requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that
    party will absorb a majority of the expected losses of the VIE,
    receive the majority of the


expected residual returns of the VIE, or both. This party is
    considered the primary beneficiary. Conversely, NRG will not
    consolidate a VIE in which it has a majority ownership interest
    when the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary. In
    determining the primary beneficiary, NRG thoroughly evaluates
    the VIE’s design, capital structure, and relationships
    among variable interest holders.

As discussed in Note 16,

Investments Accounted for by
    the Equity Method

, NRG has investments in partnerships,
    joint ventures and projects, one of which is a VIE for which the
    Company is not the primary beneficiary.

Accounting policies for all of NRG’s operations are in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    U.S. Upon its emergence from bankruptcy on December 5,
    2003, the Company qualified for and adopted fresh start
    reporting, or Fresh Start, under ASC 852,

Reorganizations

, or ASC 852.

These financial statements and notes reflect the Company’s
    evaluation of events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet
    date through February 23, 2010, the date the financial
    statements were issued.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
    an original maturity of three months or less at the time of
    purchase.

Funds
    Deposited by Counterparties

Funds deposited by counterparties consist of cash held by NRG as
    a result of collateral posting obligations from the
    Company’s counterparties due to positions in NRG’s
    hedging program. These amounts are segregated into separate
    accounts that are not contractually restricted but, based on the
    Company’s intention, are not available for the payment of
    NRG’s general corporate obligations. Depending on market
    fluctuations and the settlement of the underlying contracts, the
    Company will refund this collateral to the hedge counterparties
    pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underlying trades.
    Since collateral requirements fluctuate daily and the Company
    cannot predict if any collateral will be held for more than
    twelve months, the funds deposited by counterparties are
    classified as a current asset on the Company’s balance
    sheet, with an offsetting liability for this cash collateral
    received within current liabilities. Changes in funds deposited
    by counterparties are closely associated with the Company’s
    operating activities, and are classified as an operating
    activity in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash
    flows.

Restricted
    Cash

Restricted cash consists primarily of funds held to satisfy the
    requirements of certain debt agreements and funds held within
    the Company’s projects that are restricted in their use.
    These funds are used to pay for current operating expenses and
    current debt service payments, per the restrictions of the debt
    agreements.

Trade
    Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade receivables are reported in the balance sheet at
    outstanding principal adjusted for any write-offs and the
    allowance for doubtful accounts. For its Reliant Energy
    business, the Company accrues an allowance for doubtful accounts
    based on estimates of uncollectible revenues by analyzing
    counterparty credit ratings (for commercial and industrial
    customers), historical collections, accounts receivable aging
    and other factors. Reliant Energy writes-off accounts receivable
    balances against the allowance for doubtful accounts when it
    determines a receivable is uncollectible.

Inventory

Inventory is valued at the lower of weighted average cost or
    market, unless evidence indicates that the weighted average cost
    will be recovered with a normal profit in the ordinary course of
    business, and consists principally of fuel oil, coal and raw
    materials used to generate electricity or steam. The Company
    removes these inventories as they are used in the production of
    electricity or steam. Spare parts inventory is valued at a
    weighted average cost, since the Company expects to recover
    these costs in the ordinary course of business. The Company
    removes these


inventories when they are used for repairs, maintenance or
    capital projects. Sales of inventory are classified as an
    operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost; however
    impairment adjustments are recorded whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be
    recoverable. NRG also classifies nuclear fuel related to the
    Company’s 44% ownership interest in STP as part of the
    Company’s property, plant, and equipment. Significant
    additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized
    as incurred, while repairs and maintenance that do not improve
    or extend the life of the respective asset are charged to
    expense as incurred. Depreciation other than nuclear fuel is
    computed using the straight-line method, while nuclear fuel is
    amortized based on units of production over the estimated useful
    lives. Certain assets and their related accumulated depreciation
    amounts are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with
    the resulting gain or loss included in cost of operations in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

Asset
    Impairments

Long-lived assets that are held and used are reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    carrying values may not be recoverable. Such reviews are
    performed in accordance with ASC 360. An impairment loss is
    recognized if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows
    expected from an asset are less than its carrying value. An
    impairment charge is measured by the difference between an
    asset’s carrying amount and fair value with the difference
    recorded in operating costs and expenses in the statements of
    operations. Fair values are determined by a variety of valuation
    methods, including appraisals, sales prices of similar assets
    and present value techniques.

Investments accounted for by the equity method are reviewed for
    impairment in accordance with ASC 323, which requires that a
    loss in value of an investment that is other than a temporary
    decline should be recognized. The Company identifies and
    measures losses in the value of equity method investments based
    upon a comparison of fair value to carrying value.

Discontinued
    Operations

Long-lived assets or disposal groups are classified as
    discontinued operations when all of the required criteria
    specified in ASC 360 are met. These criteria include, among
    others, existence of a qualified plan to dispose of an asset or
    disposal group, an assessment that completion of a sale within
    one year is probable and approval of the appropriate level of
    management. In addition, upon completion of the transaction, the
    operations and cash flows of the disposal group must be
    eliminated from ongoing operations of the Company, and the
    disposal group must not have any significant continuing
    involvement with the Company. Discontinued operations are
    reported at the lower of the asset’s carrying amount or
    fair value less cost to sell.

Project
    Development Costs and Capitalized Interest

Project development costs are expensed in the preliminary stages
    of a project and capitalized when the project is deemed to be
    commercially viable. Commercial viability is determined by one
    or a series of actions including among others, Board of Director
    approval pursuant to a formal project plan that subjects the
    Company to significant future obligations that can only be
    discharged by the use of a Company asset.

Interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance capital projects
    is capitalized, until the project under construction is ready
    for its intended use. The amount of interest capitalized for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, was
    $37 million, $45 million, and $11 million,
    respectively.

When a project is available for operations, capitalized interest
    and project development costs are reclassified to property,
    plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the estimated useful life of the project’s related assets.
    Capitalized costs are charged to expense if a project is
    abandoned or management otherwise determines the costs to be
    unrecoverable.


Debt
    Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest
    expense on a basis which approximates the effective interest
    method over the term of the related debt.

Intangible
    Assets

Intangible assets represent contractual rights held by NRG. The
    Company recognizes specifically identifiable intangible assets
    including customer contracts, customer relationships, energy
    supply contracts, trade names, emission allowances, and fuel
    contracts when specific rights and contracts are acquired. In
    addition, NRG also established values for emission allowances
    and power contracts upon adoption of Fresh Start reporting.
    These intangible assets are amortized based on expected volumes,
    expected delivery, expected discounted future net cash flows,
    straight line or units of production basis.

Intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not
    amortized, but rather are tested for impairment at least
    annually or more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that such acquired intangible assets have
    been determined to have finite lives and should now be amortized
    over their useful lives. NRG had no intangible assets with
    indefinite lives recorded as of December 31, 2009.

Emission allowances

held-for-sale,

which are included in other non-current assets on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet, are not amortized;
    they are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and reviewed
    for impairment in accordance with ASC 360.

Goodwill

In accordance with ASC 350, the Company recognizes goodwill for
    the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net value
    assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

NRG performs goodwill impairment tests annually, typically
    during the fourth quarter, and when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step
    process:

Step one

—

Identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a
    reporting unit to the book value, including goodwill. If the
    fair value exceeds book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is
    not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value,
    proceed to step two.

Step two

—

Compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill to the book value of the reporting unit goodwill. If
    the book value of goodwill exceeds fair value, an impairment
    charge is recognized for the sum of such excess.

Income
    Taxes

NRG accounts for income taxes using the liability method in
    accordance with ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, or ASC 740, which
    requires that the Company use the asset and liability method of
    accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income
    taxes for all significant temporary differences.

NRG has two categories of income tax expense or
    benefit — current and deferred, as follows:

•

Current income tax expense or benefit consists solely of regular
    tax less applicable tax credits, and

•

Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the change in the net
    deferred income tax asset or liability, excluding amounts
    charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income.

NRG reports some of the Company’s revenues and expenses
    differently for financial statement purposes than for income tax
    return purposes resulting in temporary and permanent differences
    between the Company’s financial statements and income tax
    returns. The tax effects of such temporary differences are
    recorded as either deferred income tax assets or deferred income
    tax liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets. NRG measures the Company’s deferred income tax
    assets and deferred income tax liabilities using income tax
    rates that are


currently in effect. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce
    the Company’s net deferred tax assets to an amount that is
    more-likely-than-not to be realized.

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance
    with ASC 740, which applies to all tax positions related to
    income taxes. Under ASC 740, tax benefits are recognized when it
    is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained
    upon examination by the authorities. The benefit from a position
    that has surpassed the more-likely-than-not threshold is the
    largest amount of benefit that is more than 50% likely to be
    realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and
    penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a
    component of income tax expense.

Revenue
    Recognition

Energy

— Both physical and financial
    transactions are entered into to optimize the financial
    performance of NRG’s generating facilities. Electric energy
    revenue is recognized upon transmission to the customer.
    Physical transactions, or the sale of generated electricity to
    meet supply and demand, are recorded on a gross basis in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Financial
    transactions, or the buying and selling of energy for trading
    purposes, are recorded net within operating revenues in the
    consolidated statements of operations in accordance with ASC
    815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, or ASC 815.

Capacity —

Capacity revenues are recognized
    when contractually earned, and consist of revenues billed to a
    third party at either the market or a negotiated contract price
    for making installed generation capacity available in order to
    satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements.

Sale of Emission Allowances —

NRG records the
    Company’s bank of emission allowances as part of the
    Company’s intangible assets. From time to time, management
    may authorize the transfer of emission allowances in excess of
    usage from the Company’s emission bank to intangible assets

held-for-sale

for trading purposes. NRG records the sale of emission
    allowances on a net basis within other revenue in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Contract Amortization —

Assets and liabilities
    recognized from power sales agreements assumed at Fresh Start
    and through acquisitions related to the sale of electric
    capacity and energy in future periods for which the fair value
    has been determined to be significantly less (more) than market
    is amortized to revenue over the term of each underlying
    contract based on actual generation

and/or

contracted volumes.

Retail revenues —

Gross revenues for energy
    sales and services to Mass customers and to C&I customers
    are recognized upon delivery under the accrual method. Energy
    sales and services that have been delivered but not billed by
    period end are estimated. Gross revenues also includes energy
    revenues from resales of purchased power, which were
    $251 million for the eight-month period ended
    December 31, 2009. These revenues represent a sale of
    excess supply to third parties in the market.

As of December 31, 2009, Reliant Energy recorded unbilled
    revenues of $308 million for energy sales and services.
    Accrued unbilled revenues are based on Reliant Energy’s
    estimates of customer usage since the date of the last meter
    reading provided by the independent system operators or electric
    distribution companies. Volume estimates are based on daily
    forecasted volumes and estimated customer usage by class.
    Unbilled revenues are calculated by multiplying these volume
    estimates by the applicable rate by customer class. Estimated
    amounts are adjusted when actual usage is known and billed.

Cost
    of Energy for Reliant Energy

Reliant Energy records cost of energy for electricity sales and
    services to retail customers based on estimated supply volumes
    for the applicable reporting period. A portion of its cost of
    energy ($69 million as of December 31,
    2009) consisted of estimated transmission and distribution
    charges not yet billed by the transmission and distribution
    utilities. In estimating supply volumes, Reliant Energy
    considers the effects of historical customer volumes, weather
    factors and usage by customer class. Reliant Energy estimates
    its transmission and distribution delivery fees using the same
    method that it uses for electricity sales and services to retail
    customers. In addition, Reliant Energy estimates ERCOT ISO fees
    based on historical trends, estimates supply volumes and initial
    ERCOT


ISO settlements. Volume estimates are then multiplied by the
    supply rate and recorded as cost of operations in the applicable
    reporting period.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

NRG accounts for derivative financial instruments under ASC 815,
    which requires the Company to record all derivatives on the
    balance sheet at fair value unless they qualify for a NPNS
    exception. Changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivatives
    are immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair
    value of derivatives accounted for as hedges are either:

•

Recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair
    value of the related hedged assets, liabilities and firm
    commitments; or

•

Deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated OCI until
    the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings.

NRG’s primary derivative instruments are power sales
    contracts, fuels purchase contracts, other energy related
    commodities, and interest rate instruments used to mitigate
    variability in earnings due to fluctuations in market prices and
    interest rates. On an ongoing basis, NRG assesses the
    effectiveness of all derivatives that are designated as hedges
    for accounting purposes in order to determine that each
    derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting
    changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Internal
    analyses that measure the statistical correlation between the
    derivative and the associated hedged item determine the
    effectiveness of such an energy contract designated as a hedge.
    If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly
    effective as a hedge, hedge accounting will be discontinued
    prospectively. Hedge accounting will also be discontinued on
    contracts related to commodity price risk previously accounted
    for as cash flow hedges when it is probable that delivery will
    not be made against these contracts. In this case, the gain or
    loss previously deferred in OCI would be immediately
    reclassified into earnings. If the derivative instrument is
    terminated, the effective portion of this derivative in OCI will
    be frozen until the underlying hedged item is delivered.

Revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify for the NPNS
    exception are recognized when the underlying physical
    transaction is delivered. While these contracts are considered
    derivative financial instruments under ASC 815, they are not
    recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of accounting.
    If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no
    longer meets the scope exception, the fair value of the related
    contract is recorded on the balance sheet and immediately
    recognized through earnings.

NRG’s trading activities are subject to limits in
    accordance with the Company’s Risk Management Policy. These
    contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and
    changes in the fair value of these derivative financial
    instruments are recognized in earnings.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and
    Losses

The local currencies are generally the functional currency of
    NRG’s foreign operations. Foreign currency denominated
    assets and liabilities are translated at

end-of-period

rates of exchange. Revenues, expenses, and cash flows are
    translated at the weighted-average rates of exchange for the
    period. The resulting currency translation adjustments are not
    included in the determination of the Company’s statements
    of operations for the period, but are accumulated and reported
    as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until sale
    or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net
    investment in the foreign entity takes place. Foreign currency
    transaction gains or losses are reported within other
    income/(expense) in the Company’s statements of operations.
    For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    amounts recognized as foreign currency transaction gains
    (losses) were immaterial. The Company’s cumulative
    translation adjustment balances as of December 31, 2009,
    2008, and 2007 were $21 million, $58 million and
    $59 million, respectively.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject NRG to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, trust
    funds, accounts receivable, notes receivable, derivatives, and
    investments in debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and
    funds deposited by counterparties are predominantly held in
    money market funds invested in


treasury securities, treasury repurchase agreements or
    government agency debt. Trust funds are held in accounts managed
    by experienced investment advisors. Certain accounts receivable,
    notes receivable, and derivative instruments are concentrated
    within entities engaged in the energy industry. These industry
    concentrations may impact the Company’s overall exposure to
    credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the
    customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic,
    industry or other conditions. Receivables and other contractual
    arrangements are subject to collateral requirements under the
    terms of enabling agreements. However, NRG believes that the
    credit risk posed by industry concentration is offset by the
    diversification and creditworthiness of the Company’s
    customer base. See Note 5,

Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments,

for a further discussion of derivative
    concentrations.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, funds
    deposited by counterparties, trust funds, receivables, accounts
    payables, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because
    of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying
    amounts of long-term receivables usually approximate fair value,
    as the effective rates for these instruments are comparable to
    market rates at year-end, including current portions. Any
    differences are disclosed in Note 5,

Fair Value of
    Financial Instruments.

The fair value of long-term debt is
    based on quoted market prices for those instruments that are
    publicly traded, or estimated based on the income approach
    valuation technique for non-publicly traded debt. For the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company
    recorded an unrealized gain of $3 million, and impairment
    charges of $23 million and $11 million respectively,
    related to an investment in commercial paper. As of
    December 31, 2009 the net carrying value of the investment
    was $9 million.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

NRG accounts for its asset retirement obligations, or AROs, in
    accordance with ASC

410-20,

Asset

Retirement Obligations,

or ASC

410-20.

Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets
    included within the scope of ASC

410-20

are
    those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws,
    statutes, and written or oral contracts, including obligations
    arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, and for which
    the timing

and/or

method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. ASC

410-20

requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability
    for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred and a
    reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.

Upon initial recognition of a liability for an ARO, NRG
    capitalizes the asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying
    amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount. Over
    time, the liability is accreted to its future value, while the
    capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the
    related asset. See Note 13,

Asset Retirement
    Obligations,

for a further discussion of AROs.

Pensions

NRG offers pension benefits through either a defined benefit
    pension plan or a cash balance plan. In addition, the Company
    provides postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain
    groups of employees. NRG accounts for pension and other
    postretirement benefits in accordance with ASC 715. NRG
    recognizes the funded status of the Company’s defined
    benefit plans in the statement of financial position and records
    an offset to other comprehensive income. In addition, NRG also
    recognizes on an after-tax basis, as a component of other
    comprehensive income, gains and losses as well as all prior
    service costs that have not been included as part of the
    Company’s net periodic benefit cost. The determination of
    NRG’s obligation and expenses for pension benefits is
    dependent on the selection of certain assumptions. These
    assumptions determined by management include the discount rate,
    the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of
    future compensation increases. NRG’s actuarial consultants
    use assumptions for such items as retirement age. The
    assumptions used may differ materially from actual results,
    which may result in a significant impact to the amount of
    pension obligation or expense recorded by the Company.

NRG measures the fair value of its pension assets in accordance
    with ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

, or
    ASC 820.


Stock-Based
    Compensation

NRG accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with
    ASC 718. The fair value of the Company’s non-qualified
    stock options and performance units are estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the Monte
    Carlo valuation model, respectively. NRG uses the Company’s
    common stock price on the date of grant as the fair value of the
    Company’s restricted stock units and deferred stock units.
    Forfeiture rates are estimated based on an analysis of
    NRG’s historical forfeitures, employment turnover, and
    expected future behavior. The Company recognizes compensation
    expense for both graded and cliff vesting awards on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the
    entire award.

Investments
    Accounted for by the Equity Method

NRG has investments in various international and domestic energy
    projects. The equity method of accounting is applied to such
    investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and
    partnerships, because the ownership structure prevents NRG from
    exercising a controlling influence over the operating and
    financial policies of the projects. Under this method, equity in
    pre-tax income or losses of domestic partnerships and,
    generally, in the net income or losses of international
    projects, are reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated
    affiliates.

Issuance
    of Subsidiary’s Stock

The Company accounts for issuance of its subsidiaries’
    stock in accordance with ASC 810, which requires an entity to
    account for a decrease in its ownership interest of a subsidiary
    that does not result in a change of control of the subsidiary as
    an equity transaction. In March 2008, NRG formed NINA, an NRG
    development stage subsidiary focused on developing, financing,
    and investing in nuclear projects in North America. TANE has
    partnered with NRG on the NINA venture, receiving a 12% equity
    ownership in NINA in exchange for $300 million to be
    invested in NINA in six annual installments of $50 million,
    the last three of which are subject to certain restrictions. NRG
    continues to control NINA through its voting interest. Any
    change in NRG’s proportionate share of NINA’s equity
    resulting from cash invested by TANE directly into NINA is
    accounted for by the Company as an equity transaction in
    consolidation, and not a gain on sale, as long as there is no
    change in control of NINA. Accordingly, receipt of TANE’s
    installment contributions results in increases in additional
    paid in capital and noncontrolling interest on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

Gross
    Receipts and Sales Taxes

In connection with its Reliant Energy business, the Company
    records gross receipts taxes on a gross basis in revenues and
    cost of operations in its consolidated statements of operations.
    During the eight-month period ended December 31, 2009,
    Reliant Energy’s revenues and cost of operations included
    gross receipts taxes of $55 million. Additionally, Reliant
    Energy records sales taxes collected from its taxable customers
    and remitted to the various governmental entities on a net
    basis, thus, there is no impact on the Company’s
    consolidated statement of operations.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the
    U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
    the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
    estimates.

In recording transactions and balances resulting from business
    operations, NRG uses estimates based on the best information
    available. Estimates are used for such items as plant
    depreciable lives, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts,
    actuarially determined benefit costs, and the valuation of
    energy commodity contracts, environmental liabilities, and legal
    costs incurred in connection with recorded loss contingencies,
    among others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived
    assets and goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair
    value of impaired assets. As better information becomes
    available or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded
    estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be
    affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.


Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified for
    comparative purposes.

Recent
    Accounting Developments

SFAS 168 —

In June 2009, the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued
    SFAS No. 168,

The FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles

, or SFAS 168. Effective July 1, 2009,
    this guidance establishes the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification, or ASC, as the source of authoritative
    U.S. GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by
    nongovernmental entities. In addition, SFAS 168 also
    specifies that rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under
    authority of federal securities laws are also sources of
    authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. All guidance
    contained in the ASC carries an equal level of authority. The
    Company adopted SFAS 168 for the quarterly reporting period
    ending September 30, 2009. SFAS 168 has been
    incorporated into the ASC as ASC-105,

Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles,

or ASC 105.

Certain U.S. GAAP standards and interpretations were
    adopted by the Company in 2009 prior to the July 1, 2009,
    effective date of the ASC, and were subsequently incorporated
    into one or more ASC topics. Further, certain U.S. GAAP
    standards were ratified by the FASB in 2009 prior to
    July 1, 2009, but are not yet effective and have therefore
    not yet been incorporated into the ASC. This report retains the
    original title of these standards and interpretations, and
    references the ASC topic or topics in which they have been, or
    are expected to be, incorporated.

SFAS 141R —

The Company adopted
    SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

Business
    Combinations

, or SFAS 141R, on January 1, 2009.
    The provisions of SFAS 141R are applied prospectively to
    business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs
    after January 1, 2009. The statement requires an acquirer
    to recognize and measure in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value at the
    acquisition date. It also recognizes and measures the goodwill
    acquired or a gain from a bargain purchase in the business
    combination and determines what information to disclose to
    enable users of an entity’s financial statements to
    evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business
    combination. In addition, transaction costs are required to be
    expensed as incurred. On May 1, 2009, NRG acquired all of
    the Texas electric retail business operations, or Reliant
    Energy, of Reliant Energy, Inc., now known as RRI. As discussed
    in Note 3,

Business Acquisitions

, to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has applied the
    provisions of SFAS 141R to the Reliant Energy acquisition,
    as well as all other business acquisitions completed in 2009. As
    discussed further in Note 19,

Income Taxes

, any
    reductions after January 1, 2009, to existing net deferred
    tax assets or valuation allowances or changes to uncertain tax
    benefits, as they relate to Fresh Start or previously completed
    acquisitions, will be recorded to income tax expense rather than
    additional paid-in capital or goodwill. SFAS 141R has been
    incorporated into ASC-805,

Business Combinations

, or ASC
    805.

FSP

FAS 141R-1 —

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP
    No. FAS 141(R)-1,

Accounting for Assets Acquired
    and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise
    from Contingencies

, or FSP

FAS 141R-1,

which the Company adopted effective January 1, 2009. This
    FSP amends and clarifies SFAS 141R

,

to address
    application issues on initial recognition and measurement,
    subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets
    and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business
    combination. The provisions of FSP

FAS 141R-1

are applied prospectively to assets or liabilities arising from
    contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition
    date occurs after January 1, 2009. Accordingly, the Company
    has applied the provisions of FSP

FAS 141R-1

to the Reliant Energy acquisition as well as all other business
    acquisitions completed in 2009. The provisions of FSP

FAS 141R-1

have been incorporated into ASC 805.

SFAS 160 —

The Company adopted
    SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements-an amendment of ARB
    No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements

, or
    SFAS 160, on January 1, 2009. SFAS 160
    establishes accounting and reporting standards for the minority
    interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
    subsidiary. It also amends certain of ARB No. 51’s
    consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements
    of SFAS 141R. This statement is applied prospectively from
    the date of adoption, except for the presentation and disclosure
    requirements, which shall be applied retrospectively.
    Accordingly, the Company has conformed its financial statement
    presentation and disclosures to the requirements of
    SFAS 160. SFAS 160 has been incorporated into ASC-810,

Consolidation

, or ASC 810.


ASU

No. 2010-02 -

In January 2010 the FASB issued ASU

No. 2010-02,

Consolidation (Topic 810): Accounting and Reporting for
    Decreases in Ownership of a Subsidiary—a Scope
    Clarification,

or ASU

2010-02.

ASU

2010-02

amends ASC 810,

Consolidation

to resolve a conflict
    between the consolidation guidance in the Accounting Standards
    Codification and other sections of U.S. GAAP when there is
    a decrease in ownership of a subsidiary. Entities are required
    to apply the amendments in ASU

2010-02

retrospectively for the first reporting period in which they
    applied SFAS 160. Although ASU

2010-02

is
    effective for the Company beginning in the fourth quarter of
    2009, no decrease in ownership transactions resulting in a
    change in control within the scope of ASU

2010-02

and
    related guidance had occurred as of December 31, 2009,
    therefore there was no impact on the Company’s results of
    operations, financial position, or cash flows.

FSP APB

14-1 —

The Company adopted FSP No. APB

14-1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement),

or FSP APB

14-1,

on
    January 1, 2009, applying it retrospectively to all periods
    presented. FSP APB

14-1

clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled
    in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement)
    should separately account for the liability component and the
    equity component represented by the embedded conversion option
    in a manner that will reflect the entity’s nonconvertible
    debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in
    subsequent periods. Upon settlement, the entity shall allocate
    consideration transferred and transaction costs incurred to the
    extinguishment of the liability component and the reacquisition
    of the equity component. The provisions of FSP APB

14-1

have
    been incorporated into ASC-470,

Debt

, or ASC 470, and
    ASC-825,

Financial Instruments

, or ASC 825.

During the third quarter 2006, NRG’s unrestricted
    wholly-owned subsidiaries CSF I and CSF II issued notes and
    preferred interests, or CSF Debt, which included embedded
    derivatives, or CSF CAGRs, requiring NRG to pay to CS at
    maturity, either in cash or stock at NRG’s option, the
    excess of NRG’s then current stock price over a threshold
    price. The CSF Debt and CSF CAGRs are accounted for under the
    guidance in ASC 470. Upon adoption of FSP APB

14-1,

the
    fair value of the CSF CAGRs at the date of issuance was
    determined to be $32 million and has been recorded as a
    debt discount to the CSF Debt, with a corresponding credit to
    Additional Paid-in Capital. This debt discount will be amortized
    over the terms of the underlying CSF Debt. The cumulative effect
    of the change in accounting principle for periods prior to
    December 31, 2006, was recorded as a $28 million
    decrease to Long-Term Debt, a $32 million increase to
    Additional Paid-In Capital, and a $4 million decrease to
    Retained Earnings on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as
    of December 31, 2006. In addition, in August 2008 the
    Company paid $45 million to CS for the benefit of CSF I to
    early settle the CSF CAGR in the Company’s CSF I notes and
    preferred interests, which was reclassified from interest
    expense to Additional Paid-In Capital upon the adoption of FSP
    APB

14-1.

The following table summarizes the effect of the adoption of FSP
    APB

FSP

FAS 157-4 —

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 157-4,

Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity
    for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and
    Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly,

or FSP

FAS 157-4.

FSP

FAS 157-4

provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in
    accordance with ASC-820,

Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosure

, or ASC 820, when the volume and level of
    activity for the asset or liability have significantly
    decreased, includes guidance on identifying circumstances that
    indicate a transaction is not orderly, and requires disclosures
    about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair
    value. This FSP applies to all assets and liabilities within the
    scope of accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair
    value measurements. FSP

FAS 157-4

is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending
    after


June 15, 2009, and is applied prospectively. The
    Company’s adoption of FSP

FAS 157-4

beginning with the interim reporting period ended June 30,
    2009, did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The
    provisions of FSP

FAS 157-4

have been incorporated into ASC 820.

FSP

FAS 107-1

and APB

28-1 —

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 107-1

and APB

28-1,

Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments,

or

FSP 107-1

and APB

28-1.

This
    FSP requires disclosures about fair value of financial
    instruments for interim and annual reporting periods of publicly
    traded companies ending after the FSP’s effective date of
    June 15, 2009. The Company’s adoption of FSP

FAS 107-1

and APB

28-1

beginning with the interim period ended June 30, 2009, did
    not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations,
    financial position, or cash flows. The provisions of FSP

FAS 107-1

and APB

28-1

have been incorporated in ASC-270,

SFAS 165 —

In May 2009, the FASB issued

Subsequent Events

, or
    SFAS 165. SFAS 165 incorporates the accounting and
    disclosure requirements related to subsequent events found in
    auditing standards into U.S. GAAP, effectively making
    management directly responsible for subsequent events accounting
    and disclosures. SFAS 165 also requires disclosure of the
    date through which subsequent events have been evaluated.
    SFAS 165 is effective for interim and annual reporting
    periods ending after June 15, 2009, and shall be applied
    prospectively. The Company’s adoption of SFAS 165
    beginning with the interim period ended June 30, 2009, did

SFAS 167/ASU

No. 2009-17 —

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167,

Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)

, or
    SFAS 167. This guidance amends ASC 810 by altering how a
    company determines when an entity that is insufficiently
    capitalized or not controlled through its voting interests
    should be consolidated. The previous ASC 810 guidance required a
    quantitative analysis of the economic risk/rewards of a VIE to
    determine the primary beneficiary. FAS 167 now specifies
    that a qualitative analysis be performed, requiring the primary
    beneficiary to have both the power to direct the activities of a
    VIE that most significantly impact the entities’ economic
    performance, as well as either the obligation to absorb losses
    or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be
    significant to the VIE. In December 2009 the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-17

,
    Consolidations: Improvements to Financial Reporting by
    Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities

, or ASU

2009-17.

ASU

2009-17

formally incorporates the provisions of SFAS 167 into ASC
    810 and is effective for NRG as of January 1, 2010. The
    Company’s adoption of ASU

2009-17

on
    January 1, 2010 did not have an impact on its results of
    operations, financial position, or cash flows.

ASU

2009-15/EITF 09-1 —

In July 2009, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

No. 09-1,

Accounting for Own-Share Lending Arrangements in
    Contemplation of Convertible Debt Issuance or Other Financing,

or

EITF 09-1.

This Issue applies to equity-classified share lending
    arrangements on an entity’s own shares, when executed in
    contemplation of a convertible debt offering or other financing.

EITF 09-1

addresses how to account for the share-lending arrangement and
    the effect, if any, that the loaned shares have on

earnings-per-share

calculations. The share lending arrangement is required to be
    measured at fair value and recognized as an issuance cost
    associated with the convertible debt offering or other
    financing.

Earnings-per-share

calculations would not be affected by the loaned shares unless
    the share borrower defaults on the arrangement and does not
    return the shares. If counterparty default is probable, the
    share lender is required to recognize an expense equal to the
    then fair value of the unreturned


shares, net of the fair value of probable recoveries. The
    Company will apply

EITF 09-1

for share lending agreements entered into after June 15,
    2009, and will apply

EITF 09-1

on a retrospective basis for arrangements outstanding as of
    January 1, 2010. This statement did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial
    position and cash flows. In October 2009, the FASB issued
    Accounting Standards Update, or ASU

No. 2009-15,

Accounting for Own-Share Lending Arrangements in
    Contemplation of Convertible Debt Issuance or Other

This
    ASU, which amends ASC 820 and ASC 825, provides clarification on
    measuring liabilities at fair value when a quoted price in an
    active market is not available. The Company’s adoption of
    ASU

No. 2010-06,

Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures: Improving Disclosures
    about Fair Value Measurements

, or ASU

2010-6,

intending to improve disclosures about fair value measurements.
    The guidance requires entities to disclose significant transfers
    in and out of fair value hierarchy levels and the reasons for
    the transfers and to present information about purchases, sales,
    issuances and settlements separately in the reconciliation of
    fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs
    (Level 3). Additionally, the guidance clarifies that a
    reporting entity should provide fair value measurements for each
    class of assets and liabilities and disclose the inputs and
    valuation techniques used for fair value measurements using
    significant other observable inputs (Level 2) and
    significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). This guidance is
    effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
    December 15, 2009 except for the disclosures about
    purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the Level 3
    reconciliation, which will be effective for interim and annual
    periods beginning after December 15, 2010. As this guidance
    provides only disclosure requirements, the adoption of this
    standard will not impact the Company’s results of
    operations, cash flows or financial position.

Business
    Acquisitions

Acquisition
    of Reliant Energy

General

On May 1, 2009, NRG, through its wholly-owned subsidiary
    NRG Retail LLC, acquired Reliant Energy, which consisted of the
    entire Texas electric retail business operations of RRI,
    including the exclusive use of the trade name
    “Reliant” and related branding rights. Reliant Energy
    arranges for the transmission and delivery of electricity to
    customers, bills customers, collects payments for electricity
    sold and maintains call centers to provide customer service.
    Reliant Energy is the second largest electricity provider to
    Mass customers in Texas, with approximately 1.5 million
    Mass customers as of December 31, 2009. Reliant Energy is
    also the largest electricity and energy services provider, based
    on load, to C&I customers in Texas with approximately
    0.1 million C&I customers, based on metered locations
    as of December 31, 2009. These customers include
    refineries, chemical plants, manufacturing facilities,
    hospitals, universities, government agencies, restaurants, and
    other facilities.

With its complementary generation portfolio, the Texas region is
    a supplier of power to Reliant Energy, thereby creating the
    potential for a more stable, reliable and competitive business
    that benefits Texas consumers. By backing Reliant Energy’s
    load-serving requirements with NRG’s generation and risk
    management practices, the need to sell and buy power from other
    financial institutions and intermediaries that trade in the
    ERCOT market may be reduced, resulting in reduced transaction
    costs and credit exposures. This combination of generation and
    retail allows for a reduction in actual and contingent
    collateral, initially through offsetting transactions and over
    time by reducing the need to hedge the retail power supply
    through third parties. In addition, with Reliant Energy’s
    base of retail customers, NRG now has a customer interface with
    the scale that is important to the successful deployment of
    consumer facing energy technologies and services.

Credit
    Support

On May 1, 2009, NRG arranged with Merrill Lynch
    Commodities, Inc. and certain of its affiliates, or Merrill
    Lynch, the former credit provider of RRI, to provide continuing
    credit support to Reliant Energy after closing the acquisition.
    In connection with entering into a transitional credit sleeve
    facility, or CSRA, NRG contributed $200 million of cash to
    Reliant Energy. In conjunction with the CSRA, NRG Power
    Marketing LLC, or PML, and Reliant Energy Power Supply LLC, or
    REPS, wholly-owned subsidiaries of NRG, modified or novated
    certain transactions with counterparties to transfer PML’s

in-the-money

transactions to REPS and moved $522 million of cash
    collateral held by NRG to Merrill Lynch, thereby reducing
    Merrill Lynch’s actual and contingent collateral supporting
    Reliant Energy

out-of-money

positions. Through October 5, 2009, these trades with
    counterparties were still open, thus there was no impact on
    NRG’s consolidated financial statements, and NRG continued
    to record unrealized and realized gains/losses for these novated
    trades in its Texas and Northeast segments. The monthly fee for
    the CSRA was 5.875% on an annualized basis of the predetermined
    exposure.

Additionally, on May 1, 2009, NRG entered into a
    $50 million working capital facility with Merrill Lynch in
    connection with the acquisition of Reliant Energy. The facility
    required that the Company comply with all terms of the CSRA. NRG
    initially drew $25 million under the facility, which
    accrued interest at the prime rate. The $25 million
    outstanding under this facility was repaid, and the facility was
    terminated on October 5, 2009. See further discussion below.

Reliant Energy conducts its business through RERH Holdings, LLC
    and subsidiaries, or RERH, Reliant Energy Texas Retail, LLC, and
    Reliant Energy Services Texas, LLC. Through October 5,
    2009, the obligations of Reliant Energy under the CSRA were
    secured by first liens on substantially all of the assets of
    RERH, and the obligations of RERH under the CSRA were
    non-recourse to NRG and its other non-pledgor subsidiaries.

The Company executed an amendment of the existing CSRA with
    Merrill Lynch, or CSRA Amendment, which became effective
    October 5, 2009. In connection with the CSRA Amendment, the
    Company recorded refinancing expense of $20 million in its
    results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    primarily related to the write-off of previously deferred
    financing costs. The CSRA Amendment removed the first liens
    associated with the CSRA, and RERH subsequently became a
    guarantor of the Company’s obligations under its Senior
    Notes. See Note 29,

Condensed Consolidating Financial
    Information

, for further discussion of NRG’s guarantees
    under its Senior Notes.


In connection with the CSRA Amendment, NRG net settled certain
    REPS transactions with counterparties and received
    $165 million in net cash consideration. Merrill Lynch
    returned $250 million of previously posted cash collateral
    and released liens on $322 million of unrestricted cash
    held at Reliant Energy. See Note 6,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, for the
    accounting impact of these settlements.

Pursuant to the CSRA Amendment, the Company was required to post
    collateral for any net liability derivatives and other static
    margin associated with supply for Reliant Energy. In connection
    with this amendment, NRG posted $366 million of cash
    collateral to Merrill Lynch and other counterparties, returned
    $53 million of counterparty collateral, issued letters of
    credit of $206 million, and received $45 million in
    counterparty collateral. The funds posted by the Company were
    sourced from a portion of the proceeds from the June 5,
    2009 issuance of the 2019 Senior Notes. See Note 12,

Debt and Capital Leases

, for further discussion of the
    2019 Senior Notes.

Under the amended CSRA, the parties had agreed to settle any
    outstanding wholesale obligations under the CSRA Amendment by
    January 29, 2010. As of that date, there was one remaining
    wholesale counterparty, for which NRG provided Merrill Lynch
    with a $10 million letter of credit to protect them from
    any potential liability. The parties continue to work to settle
    all outstanding obligations, including C&I counterparties,
    by April 30, 2010.

Acquisition
    method of accounting

The acquisition of Reliant Energy is accounted for under the
    acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805.
    Accordingly, NRG has conducted an assessment of net assets
    acquired and has recognized provisional amounts for identifiable
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated
    acquisition date fair values, while transaction and integration
    costs associated with the acquisition are expensed as incurred.
    The initial accounting for the business combination is not
    complete because the evaluations necessary to assess the fair
    values of certain net assets acquired and the amount of goodwill
    (if any) to be recognized are still in process. The provisional
    amounts recognized are subject to revision until the evaluations
    are completed and to the extent that additional information is
    obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of
    the acquisition date. Any changes to the fair value assessments
    will affect the final balance of goodwill.

NRG paid RRI $287.5 million in cash at closing, funded from
    NRG’s cash on hand. NRG also made payments to RRI of
    $78 million as remittances of acquired net working capital.
    In addition, the Company expects to remit approximately
    $4 million of acquired net working capital to RRI by the
    second quarter 2010, bringing the total cash consideration to
    approximately $370 million. NRG also recognized a
    $31 million non-cash gain on the settlement of a
    pre-existing relationship, representing the

in-the-money

value to NRG of an agreement that permits Reliant Energy to call
    on certain NRG gas plants when necessary for Reliant Energy to
    meet its load obligations. NRG has recorded this gain within
    Operating Revenues in its consolidated statement of operations.
    This non-cash gain is considered a component of consideration in
    accordance with ASC 805, and together with cash consideration,
    brings total consideration to approximately $401 million.

The following table summarizes the provisional values assigned
    to the net assets acquired, including cash acquired of
    $6 million, as of the acquisition date:

Current assets include accounts receivable with a preliminary
    fair value of $569 million and gross contractual amounts of
    $589 million at the time of acquisition. The Company has
    collected substantially all of the fair value of the contractual
    cash flows; any difference between fair value and the amount
    collected will be an adjustment to the acquired working capital
    payment due to RRI.

The Company, through its acquisition of Reliant Energy, is
    subject to material contingencies relating to Excess Mitigation
    Credits (see Note 22,

Commitments and Contingencies

)
    and Retail Replacement Reserve (see Note 23,

Regulatory
    Matters

). Due to the number of variables and assumptions
    involved in assessing the possible outcome of these matters,
    sufficient information does not exist to reasonably estimate the
    fair value of these contingent liabilities. These material
    contingencies have been evaluated in accordance with ASC-450,

Contingencies,

or ASC 450, and related guidance, and no
    provisional amounts for these matters have been recorded at the
    acquisition date. In addition, NRG provided certain indemnities
    in connection with the acquisition. See Note 26,

Guarantees,

for further discussion.

Fair
    value measurements

The provisional fair values of the intangible assets/liabilities
    and property, plant and equipment at the acquisition date were
    measured primarily based on significant inputs that are not
    observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3
    measurement as defined in ASC 820. Significant inputs were as
    follows:

•

Customer contracts

— The fair values of the
    customer contracts, representing those with Reliant
    Energy’s C&I customers, were estimated based on the
    present value of the above/below market cash flows attributable
    to the contracts based on contract type, discounted utilizing a
    current market interest rate consistent with the overall credit
    quality of the portfolio. The fair values also accounted for
    Reliant Energy’s historical costs to acquire customers. The
    above/below market cash flows were estimated by comparing the
    expected cash flows to be generated based on existing contracted
    prices and expected volumes with the cash flows from estimated
    current market contract prices for the same expected


volumes. The estimated current market contract prices were
    derived considering current market costs, such as price of
    energy, transmission and distribution costs, and miscellaneous
    fees, plus a normal profit margin. The customer contracts are
    amortized to revenues, over a weighted average amortization
    period of five years, based on expected volumes to be delivered
    for the portfolio.

•

Customer relationships

— The customer
    relationships, reflective of Reliant Energy’s Mass customer
    base, were valued using a variation of the income approach.
    Under this approach, the Company estimated the present value of
    expected future cash flows resulting from the existing customer
    relationships, considering attrition and charges for
    contributory assets (such as net working capital, fixed assets,
    software, workforce and trade names) utilized in the business,
    discounted at an independent power producer peer group’s
    weighted average cost of capital. The customer relationships are
    amortized to depreciation and amortization expense, over a
    weighted-average amortization period of eight years, based on
    the expected discounted future net cash flows by year.

•

Trade names

— The trade names were valued using
    a “relief from royalty” method, an approach under
    which fair value is estimated to be the present value of
    royalties saved because NRG owns the intangible asset and
    therefore does not have to pay a royalty for its use. The trade
    names were valued in two parts based on Reliant Energy’s
    two primary customer segments — Mass customers and
    C&I customers. The avoided royalty revenues were discounted
    at an independent power producer peer group’s weighted
    average cost of capital. The remaining useful life of the trade
    names were determined by considering various factors, such as
    turnover and name changes in the independent power producer and
    utility industries, the current age of the Reliant brand,
    management’s intent to continue using the name at the
    current time, and feedback from external consultants regarding
    their experience with similar trade names. The trade names are
    amortized to depreciation and amortization expense, on a
    straight-line basis, over 15 years.

•

Energy supply contracts

— The fair values of
    the in-market and

out-of-market

energy supply contracts were determined in accordance with ASC
    820. These contracts are amortized over periods ranging through
    2016, based on the expected delivery under the respective
    contracts.

•

Property, plant and equipment

— The fair value
    of property, plant and equipment was valued using a cost
    approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost
    of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic
    utility. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the
    estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the property,
    less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation.

The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities as of the
    acquisition date were determined in accordance with ASC 820. The
    breakdown of Level 1, 2 and 3 is as follows:

    recognized on sales as discontinued operations for businesses
    that were sold or have met the required criteria for such
    classification. ASC 360 requires that discontinued operations be
    valued on an

asset-by-asset

basis at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs
    to sell. In applying the provisions of ASC 360, the
    Company’s management considers cash flow analyses, bids,
    and offers related to those assets and businesses. In accordance
    with the provisions of ASC 360, assets held by discontinued
    operations are not depreciated commencing with their
    classification as such.

NRG’s discontinued operations reflect the disposal of
    ITISA, reported in the Company’s international segment. On
    April 28, 2008, NRG completed the sale of its 100% interest
    in Tosli Acquisition B.V, which held all NRG’s interest in
    ITISA, to Brookfield Renewable Power Inc. (previously Brookfield
    Power Inc.), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Asset
    Management Inc. In addition, the purchase price adjustment
    contingency under the sale agreement was resolved on
    August 7, 2008. In connection with the sale, NRG received
    $300 million of cash proceeds from Brookfield, and removed
    $163 million of assets, including $59 million of cash,
    $122 million of liabilities, including $63 million of
    debt, and $15 million in foreign currency translation
    adjustment from its 2008 consolidated balance sheet. The Company
    recorded a pre-tax gain on the disposal of ITISA of
    $273 million in the


year ended December 31, 2008. Summarized results of ITISA,
    reflected within discontinued operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, and 2007, were as follows:

MIBRAG

— On June 10, 2009, NRG completed
    the sale of its 50% ownership interest in Mibrag B.V. to a
    consortium of Severoćeské doly Chomutov, a member of
    the CEZ Group, and J&T Group. Mibrag B.V.’s principal
    holding was MIBRAG, which was jointly owned by NRG and
    URS Corporation. As part of the transaction,
    URS Corporation also entered into an agreement to sell its
    50% stake in MIBRAG.

For its share, NRG received EUR 203 million
    ($284 million at an exchange rate of 1.40 U.S.$/EUR), net
    of transaction costs. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, NRG recognized an after-tax gain of $128 million.
    Prior to completion of the sale, NRG continued to record its
    share of MIBRAG’s operations to Equity in earnings of
    unconsolidated affiliates.

In connection with the transaction, NRG entered into a foreign
    currency forward contract to hedge the impact of exchange rate
    fluctuations on the sale proceeds. The foreign currency forward
    contract had a fixed exchange rate of 1.277 and required NRG to
    deliver EUR 200 million in exchange for
    $255 million on June 15, 2009. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, NRG recorded an exchange loss of
    $24 million on the contract within Other (loss)/income,
    net. NRG provided certain indemnities in connection with its
    share of the transaction. See Note 26,

Guarantees

,
    for further discussion.

Red Bluff and Chowchilla

— On January 3,
    2007, NRG completed the sale of the Company’s Red Bluff and
    Chowchilla II power plants to an entity controlled by
    Wayzata Investment Partners LLC. These power plants, located in
    California, are fueled by natural gas, with generating capacity
    of 45 MW and 49 MW, respectively.

For cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by
    counterparties, restricted cash, and cash collateral paid and
    received in support of energy risk management activities, the
    carrying amount approximates fair value because of the
    short-term maturity of those instruments. The fair value of
    marketable securities is based on quoted market prices for those
    instruments. Trust fund investments are comprised of various
    U.S. debt and equity securities carried at fair market
    value.

The fair value of notes receivable, debt securities and certain
    long-term debt are based on expected future cash flows
    discounted at market interest rates. The fair value of long-term
    debt is based on quoted market prices for these instruments that
    are publicly traded, or estimated based on the income approach
    valuation technique for non-publicly traded debt using current
    interest rates for similar instruments with equivalent credit
    quality.

Fair
    Value Accounting under ASC 820

ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the
    inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into
    three levels as follows:

•

Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has
    the ability to access as of the measurement date. NRG’s
    financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs
    include active exchange-traded securities, energy derivatives,
    and trust fund investments.

•

Level 2 — inputs other than quoted prices
    included within Level 1 that are directly observable for
    the asset or liability or indirectly observable through
    corroboration with observable market data. NRG’s financial
    assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include
    fixed income securities, exchange-based derivatives, and over
    the counter derivatives such as swaps, options and forwards.

•

Level 3 — unobservable inputs for the asset or
    liability only used when there is little, if any, market
    activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
    NRG’s financial assets and liabilities utilizing
    Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded,
    non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds,
    and are measured using present value pricing models.

In accordance with ASC 820, the Company determines the level in
    the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value
    measurement in its entirety falls, based on the lowest level
    input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its
    entirety.


Recurring
    Fair Value Measurements

Non-derivative
    fair value measurements

NRG’s investment in debt securities are classified as
    Level 3 and consist of non-traded debt instruments that are
    valued based on third-party market value assessments.


The trust fund investments are held primarily to satisfy
    NRG’s nuclear decommissioning obligations. These trust fund
    investments hold debt and equity securities directly and equity
    securities indirectly through commingled funds. The fair values
    of equity securities held directly by the trust funds are based
    on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized in
    Level 1. In addition, U.S. Treasury securities are
    categorized as Level 1 because they trade in a highly
    liquid and transparent market. The fair values of fixed income
    securities, excluding U.S. Treasury securities, are based
    on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information,
    such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted
    for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2.
    Commingled funds, which are analogous to mutual funds, are
    maintained by investment companies and hold certain investments
    in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The fair
    value of commingled funds are based on net asset values per fund
    share (the unit of account), derived from the quoted prices in
    active markets of the underlying equity securities. However,
    because the shares in the commingled funds are not publicly
    quoted, not traded in an active market and are subject to
    certain restrictions regarding their purchase and sale, the
    commingled funds are categorized in Level 3. See also
    Note 7,

Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund.

Derivative
    fair value measurements

A small portion of NRG’s contracts are exchange-traded
    contracts with readily available quoted market prices. The
    majority of NRG’s contracts are non-exchange-traded
    contracts valued using prices provided by external sources,
    primarily price quotations available through brokers or

over-the-counter

and on-line exchanges. For the majority of NRG markets, the
    Company receives quotes from multiple sources. To the extent
    that NRG receives multiple quotes, the Company’s prices
    reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices obtained
    from all sources that NRG believes provide the most liquid
    market for the commodity. If the Company receives one quote,
    then the mid-point of the bid-ask spread for that quote is used.
    The terms for which such price information is available vary by
    commodity, region and product. A significant portion of the fair
    value of the Company’s derivative portfolio is based on
    price quotes from brokers in active markets who regularly
    facilitate those transactions and the Company believes such
    price quotes are executable. The Company does not use third
    party sources that derive price based on proprietary models or
    market surveys. The remainder of the assets and liabilities
    represents contracts for which external sources or observable
    market quotes are not available. These contracts are valued
    based on various valuation techniques including but not limited
    to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market
    and extrapolation of observable market data with similar
    characteristics. Contracts valued with prices provided by models
    and other valuation techniques make up 3% of the total fair
    value of all derivative contracts. The fair value of each
    contract is discounted using a risk free interest rate. In
    addition, the Company applies a credit reserve to reflect credit
    risk which is calculated based on published default
    probabilities. To the extent that NRG’s net exposure under
    a specific master agreement is an asset, the Company uses the
    counterparty’s default swap rate. If the exposure under a
    specific master agreement is a liability, the Company uses
    NRG’s default swap rate. The credit reserve is added to the
    discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market
    participant would be willing to receive to assume NRG’s
    liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay
    for NRG’s assets. As of December 31, 2009, the credit
    reserve resulted in a $1 million increase in fair value
    which is composed of a $1 million loss in OCI and a
    $2 million gain in derivative revenue and cost of
    operations.

The fair values in each category reflect the level of forward
    prices and volatility factors as of December 31, 2009, and
    may change as a result of changes in these factors. Management
    uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity
    and derivative contracts NRG holds and sells. These estimates
    consider various factors including closing exchange and

over-the-counter

price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit
    exposure. It is possible, however, that future market prices
    could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities
    from energy marketing and trading activities and such variations
    could be material.

Under the guidance of ASC 815, entities may choose to offset
    cash collateral paid or received against the fair value of
    derivative positions executed with the same counterparties under
    the same master netting agreements. The Company has chosen not
    to offset positions as defined in ASC 815. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company recorded $361 million
    of cash collateral paid and $177 million of cash collateral
    received on its balance sheet.


Concentration
    of Credit Risk

In addition to the credit risk discussion as disclosed in
    Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

,
    the following item is a discussion of the concentration of
    credit risk for the Company’s financial instruments. Credit
    risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance
    or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their
    contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit
    risk through credit policies that include: (i) an
    established credit approval process; (ii) a daily
    monitoring of counterparties’ credit limits; (iii) the
    use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral,
    credit derivatives, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric
    limits (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and
    (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the
    netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts
    associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding
    counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the
    amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to
    mitigate counterparty risk with a diversified portfolio of
    counterparties, including nine participants under its first and
    second lien structure. The Company also has credit protection
    within various agreements to call on additional collateral
    support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held
    at NRG to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until
    positions settle.

Since the credit crisis began in late 2008, NRG has taken
    several additional steps to mitigate credit risk including the
    use of netting arrangements, entering contracts with collateral
    thresholds, setting volumetric limits with certain
    counterparties and restricting trading relationships with
    counterparties where exposure was high or where credit quality
    of the counterparty had deteriorated. NRG avoids concentration
    of counterparties whenever possible and applies credit policies
    that include an evaluation of counterparties’ financial
    condition, collateral requirements and the use of standard
    agreements that allow for netting and other security.

As of December 31, 2009, total credit exposure to
    substantially all counterparties was $1.3 billion and NRG
    held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those
    positions of $186 million resulting in a net exposure of
    $1.1 billion. Total credit exposure is discounted at the
    risk free rate.

The following table highlights the credit quality and the net
    counterparty credit exposure by industry sector. Net
    counterparty credit exposure is defined as the aggregate net
    asset position for NRG with counterparties where netting is
    permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash
    flow,

mark-to-market

and NPNS, and non-derivative transactions. The exposure is shown
    net of collateral held, includes amounts net of receivables or
    payables.

Credit exposure excludes California
    tolling, uranium, coal transportation, New England RMR, certain
    cooperative load contracts, and Texas Westmoreland coal
    contracts. The aforementioned exposures were excluded for
    various reasons including regulatory support or liens held
    against the contracts which serve to reduce the risk of loss, or
    credit risks for certain contracts are not readily measurable
    due to a lack of market reference prices.

NRG has credit risk exposure to certain counterparties
    representing more than 10% of total net exposure and the
    aggregate of such counterparties was $351 million.
    Approximately 82% of NRG’s positions relating to credit
    risk roll-off by the end of 2012. Changes in hedge positions and
    market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty
    concentration. Given the credit quality, diversification and
    term of the exposure in the portfolio, NRG


does not anticipate a material impact on the Company’s
    financial position or results of operations from nonperformance
    by any of NRG’s counterparties.

NRG is exposed to retail credit risk through its competitive
    electricity supply business, which serves C&I customers and
    the Mass market in Texas. Retail credit risk results when a
    customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses could be
    incurred from nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and any

in-the-money

forward value. NRG manages retail credit risk through the use of
    established credit policies that include monitoring of the
    portfolio, and the use of credit mitigation measures such as
    deposits or prepayment arrangements.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company’s credit exposure
    to C&I customers was diversified across many customers and
    various industries. No one customer represented more than 2% of
    total exposure and the majority of the customers have investment
    grade credit quality, as determined by NRG.

NRG is also exposed to credit risk relating to its
    1.5 million Mass customers, which may result in a write-off
    of a bad debt. The current economic conditions may affect the
    Company’s customers’ ability to pay bills in a timely
    manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead
    to an increase in bad debt expense.

Note 6 —

Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

ASC 815 requires NRG to recognize all derivative instruments on
    the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and to measure
    them at fair value each reporting period unless they qualify for
    a Normal Purchase Normal Sale, or NPNS, exception. If certain
    conditions are met, NRG may be able to designate certain
    derivatives as cash flow hedges and defer the effective portion
    of the change in fair value of the derivatives to OCI until the
    hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings. The
    ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is immediately
    recognized in earnings.

For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets
    or liabilities, the changes in fair value of both the derivative
    and the hedged transaction are recorded in current earnings. The
    ineffective portion of a hedging derivative instrument’s
    change in fair value is immediately recognized into earnings.

For derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges or
    do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in
    the fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Under
    the guidelines established per ASC 815, certain derivative
    instruments may qualify for the NPNS exception and are therefore
    exempt from fair value accounting treatment. ASC 815 applies to
    NRG’s energy related commodity contracts, interest rate
    swaps, and foreign exchange contracts.

As the Company engages principally in the trading and marketing
    of its generation assets and retail business, some of NRG’s
    commercial activities qualify for hedge accounting under the
    requirements of ASC 815. In order for the generation assets to
    qualify, the physical generation and sale of electricity should
    be highly probable at inception of the trade and throughout the
    period it is held, as is the case with the Company’s
    baseload plants. For this reason, many trades in support of
    NRG’s baseload units normally qualify for NPNS or cash flow
    hedge accounting treatment, and trades in support of NRG’s
    peaking units’ asset optimization will generally not
    qualify for hedge accounting treatment, with any changes in fair
    value likely to be reflected on a

mark-to-market

basis in the statement of operations. Most of the retail load
    contracts either qualify for the NPNS exception or fail to meet
    the criteria for a derivative and the majority of the supply
    contracts are recorded under

mark-to-market

accounting. All of NRG’s hedging and trading activities are
    in accordance with the Company’s Risk Management Policy.

Energy-Related
    Commodities

To manage the commodity price risk associated with the
    Company’s competitive supply activities and the price risk
    associated with wholesale and retail power sales from the
    Company’s electric generation facilities, NRG may enter
    into a variety of derivative and non-derivative hedging
    instruments, utilizing the following:

•

Forward contracts, which commit NRG to sell or purchase energy
    commodities or purchase fuels in the future.

•

Futures contracts, which are exchange-traded standardized
    commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial
    instrument.


•

Swap agreements, which require payments to or from
    counter-parties based upon the differential between two prices
    for a predetermined contractual, or notional, quantity.

•

Option contracts, which convey the right or obligation to
    purchase or sell a commodity.

•

Weather and hurricane derivative products used to mitigate a
    portion of Reliant Energy’s lost revenue due to weather.

The objectives for entering into derivative contracts designated
    as hedges include:

•

Fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity
    sales through the use of various derivative instruments
    including gas collars and swaps at a level that provides an
    acceptable return on the Company’s electric generation
    operations.

•

Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for
    the operation of NRG’s power plants.

•

Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated energy purchases to
    supply Reliant Energy’s customers.

NRG’s trading activities are subject to limits in
    accordance with the Company’s Risk Management Policy. These
    contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and
    changes in the fair value of these derivative financial
    instruments are recognized in earnings.

As of December 31, 2009, NRG had hedge and non-hedge
    energy-related derivative financial instruments, and other
    energy-related contracts that did not qualify as derivative
    financial instruments extending through December 2026. As of
    December 31, 2009, NRG’s derivative assets and
    liabilities consisted primarily of the following:

•

Forward and financial contracts for the purchase/sale of
    electricity and related products economically hedging NRG’s
    generation assets’ forecasted output or NRG’s retail
    load obligations through 2015.

•

Forward and financial contracts for the purchase of fuel
    commodities relating to the forecasted usage of NRG’s
    generation assets into 2017.

Also, as of December 31, 2009, NRG had other energy-related
    contracts that qualified for the NPNS exception and were
    therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment under the
    guidelines established by ASC 815 as follows:

•

Power sales and capacity contracts extending to 2025.

Also, as of December 31, 2009, NRG had other energy-related
    contracts that did not qualify as derivatives under the
    guidelines established by ASC 815 as follows:

•

Load-following forward electric sale contracts extending through
    2026;

•

Power Tolling contracts through 2029;

•

Lignite purchase contract through 2018;

•

Power transmission contracts through 2015;

•

Natural gas transportation contracts and storage agreements
    through 2018; and

•

Coal transportation contracts through 2016.

Interest
    Rate Swaps

NRG is exposed to changes in interest rates through the
    Company’s issuance of variable and fixed rate debt. In
    order to manage the Company’s interest rate risk, NRG
    enters into interest-rate swap agreements. As of
    December 31, 2009, NRG had interest rate derivative
    instruments extending through June 2019, all of which had been
    designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.


Volumetric
    Underlying Derivative Transactions

The following table summarizes the net notional volume
    buy/(sell) of NRG’s derivative transactions broken out by
    commodity, excluding those derivatives that qualified for the
    NPNS exception as of December 31, 2009. Option contracts

Fair
    Value of Derivative Instruments

The Company has elected to disclose derivative assets and
    liabilities on a

trade-by-trade

Credit
    Risk Related Contingent Features

Certain of the Company’s hedging agreements contain
    provisions that require the Company to post additional
    collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been
    deterioration in credit quality, generally termed “adequate
    assurance” under the agreements. Other agreements contain
    provisions that require the Company to post additional
    collateral if there was a one notch downgrade in the
    Company’s credit rating. The collateral required for

out-of-the-money

positions and net accounts payable for contracts that have
    adequate assurance clauses that are in a net liability position
    as of December 31, 2009, was $80 million. The
    collateral required for

out-of-the-money

positions and net accounts payable for contracts with credit
    rating contingent features that are in a net liability position
    as of December 31, 2009, was $49 million. The Company
    is also a party to certain marginable agreements where NRG has a
    net liability position but the counterparty has not called for
    the collateral due, which is approximately $3 million as of
    December 31, 2009.

As of January 29, 2010, Merrill Lynch was no longer
    providing credit support for any wholesale energy supply
    contracts relating to the retail business. Merrill Lynch
    continues to provide guaranties to certain C&I customers as
    part of the credit sleeve arrangement. If Merrill Lynch were to
    default, NRG would be required to post guaranties to replace
    Merrill.

As of December 31, 2009, the net balance in OCI relating to
    ASC 815 was an unrecognized gain of approximately
    $406 million, which is net of $247 million in income
    taxes. As of December 31, 2008, the net balance in OCI
    relating to ASC 815 was an unrecognized gain of approximately
    $315 million, which was net of $194 million in income
    taxes.

Accounting guidelines require a high degree of correlation
    between the derivative and the hedged item throughout the period
    in order to qualify as a cash flow hedge. As of July 31,
    2008, the Company’s regression analysis for natural gas
    prices to ERCOT power prices, while positively correlated, did
    not meet the required threshold for cash flow hedge accounting
    for calendar years 2012 and 2013. As a result, the Company
    de-designated its 2012 and 2013 ERCOT cash flow hedges as of
    July 31, 2008 and prospectively marked these derivatives to
    market. On April 1, 2009, the required correlation
    threshold for cash flow hedge accounting was achieved for these
    transactions, and accordingly, these hedges were re-designated
    as cash flow hedges.

As discussed in Note 3,

Business Acquisitions

, in
    conjunction with the CSRA, PML and REPS modified or novated
    certain transactions with counterparties. The novated
    transactions are financial sales of natural gas to the
    counterparties covering the period from 2009 through 2012 to
    hedge NRG’s Texas baseload generation. A portion of these
    transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
    effective portion of the fair value of these transactions
    recorded in OCI was approximately $247 million. On the date
    of novation, NRG elected to de-designate these cash flow hedges
    and to recognize future changes in value in earnings
    prospectively. As the underlying baseload power generation is
    still probable, the gains through the date of novation related
    to the cash flow hedges remain frozen in OCI and will be
    amortized into income when the underlying power is generated.
    Approximately $240 million of the fair values of these
    transactions at the novation date were accounted for as

mark-to-market

transactions through the income statement both before and after
    the novations.

As also discussed in Note 3,

Business Acquisitions

,
    on October 5, 2009, the Company amended the CSRA with
    Merrill Lynch. In connection with the CSRA amendment, NRG net
    settled certain REPS’

out-of-money

supply transactions with Merrill Lynch and paid
    $104 million in consideration. In addition, NRG net settled
    certain

in-the-money

REPS transactions with Morgan and received $269 million in
    consideration. As noted above, the

in-the-money

transaction was previously novated by NRG’s wholly owned
    subsidiary PML to REPS. As these transactions were net settled,
    the $245 million in OCI will continue to be frozen and will
    be amortized into income when the underlying power from the
    baseload plants are generated and the balance of
    $24 million of previously recorded unrealized revenue was
    recorded as a loss of $24 million in unrealized derivative
    revenue and a $24 million gain in realized or financial
    revenue. The net settlement on the Merrill Lynch transactions
    resulted in a realized loss of $104 million and an
    unrealized gain of $104 million due to the reversal of an
    unrealized loss.


Statement
    of Operations

In accordance with ASC 815, unrealized gains and losses
    associated with changes in the fair value of derivative
    instruments not accounted for as cash flow hedge derivatives and
    ineffectiveness of hedge derivatives are reflected in current
    period earnings.

The following table summarizes the pre-tax effects of economic
    hedges that did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting,
    ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges, and trading activity on
    NRG’s statement of operations. These amounts are included
    within operating revenues and cost of operations.

The $22 million gain from economic hedge positions includes
    a gain of $217 million recognized in earnings from
    previously deferred amounts in OCI as the Company discontinued
    cash flow hedge accounting for certain 2009 transactions in
    Texas and New York due to lower expected generation, offset by a
    loss of $29 million resulting from discontinued NPNS
    designated coal purchases due to expected lower coal consumption
    and accordingly could not assert taking physical delivery and a
    $166 million decrease in value of forward purchases and
    sales of natural gas, electricity and fuel due to decrease in
    forward power and gas prices.

The Reliant Energy’s loss positions were acquired as of
    May 1, 2009, and valued using forward prices on that date.
    The $656 million roll-off amounts were offset by realized
    losses at the settled prices and are reflected in revenue and
    cost of operations during the same period.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the unrealized gain
    associated with changes in the fair value of derivative
    instruments not accounted for as hedge derivatives of
    $525 million was comprised of $524 million of fair
    value increases in forward sales of electricity and fuel, a
    $24 million loss due to the ineffectiveness associated with
    financial forward contracted electric and gas sales,
    $70 million from the reversal of

mark-to-market

gains which ultimately settled as financial and physical
    revenues of which $38 million was related to economic
    hedges and $32 million was related to trading activity.
    These decreases were partially offset by $95 million of
    gains associated with open positions related to trading activity.

Discontinued Hedge Accounting

- During the first half of
    2009, a relatively sharp decline in commodity prices resulted in
    falling power prices and lower power generation for the
    remainder of 2009. As such, NRG discontinued cash flow hedge
    accounting for certain 2009 contracts previously accounted for
    as cash flow hedges. These contracts


were originally entered into as hedges of forecasted sales by
    baseload plants in Texas and Northeast. As a result,
    $217 million of gain previously deferred in OCI was
    recognized in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Discontinued Normal Purchase and Sale for Coal Purchases

- Due to lower coal-fired generation during the first
    quarter 2009, the Company’s coal consumption was lower than
    forecasted. The Company net settled some of its coal purchases
    under NPNS designation and thus was no longer able to assert
    physical delivery under these coal contracts. The forward
    positions previously treated as accrual accounting have been
    reclassified into

mark-to-market

accounting during the first quarter and prospectively. The
    impact of discontinuance of coal NPNS designated transactions
    resulted in a derivative loss of $29 million that is
    reflected in the cost of operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Note 7 —

Nuclear
    Decommissioning Trust Fund

NRG’s nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets, which are
    for the decommissioning of STP, are comprised of securities
    classified as

available-for-sale

and recorded at fair value based on actively quoted market
    prices. Although NRG is responsible for managing the
    decommissioning of its 44% interest in STP, the predecessor
    utilities that owned STP are authorized by the PUCT to collect
    decommissioning funds from their ratepayers to cover
    decommissioning costs on behalf of NRG. NRC requirements
    determine the decommissioning cost estimate which is the minimum
    required level of funding. In the event that funds from the
    ratepayers that accumulate in the nuclear decommissioning trust
    are ultimately determined to be inadequate to decommission the
    STP facilities, the utilities will be required to collect
    through rate base all additional amounts, with no obligation
    from NRG, provided that NRG has complied with PUCT rules and
    regulations regarding decommissioning trusts. Following
    completion of the decommissioning, if surplus funds remain in
    the decommissioning trusts, any excess will be refunded to the
    respective ratepayers of the utilities.

NRG accounts for the nuclear decommissioning trust fund in
    accordance with ASC 980 —

Regulated Operations

,
    or ASC 980 because the Company’s nuclear decommissioning
    activities are subject to approval by the PUCT, with regulated
    rates that are designed to recover all decommissioning costs and
    that can be charged to and collected from the ratepayers per
    PUCT mandate. Since the Company is in compliance with PUCT rules
    and regulations regarding decommissioning trusts and the cost of
    decommissioning is the responsibility of the Texas ratepayers,
    not NRG, all realized and unrealized gains or losses (including

other-than-temporary

impairments) related to the Nuclear Decommissioning
    Trust Fund are recorded to the Nuclear Decommissioning
    Trust Liability to the ratepayers and are not included in
    net income or accumulated other comprehensive income, consistent
    with regulatory treatment.

The following table summarizes the aggregate fair values and
    unrealized gains and losses (including

other-than-temporary

impairments) for the securities held in the trust funds as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, as well as information about
    the contractual maturities of those securities. The cost of
    securities sold is determined on the specific identification

Goodwill
    and Other Intangibles

Goodwill

—

NRG’s goodwill arose in
    connection with the acquisitions of Texas Genco and Padoma Wind
    Power LLC. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, goodwill was
    approximately $1.7 billion. In accordance with ASC 805,
    goodwill associated with the Texas Genco acquisition decreased
    by $68 million during 2008 due to an adjustment to deferred
    tax liabilities originally established under the 2006 purchase
    price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized but instead tested
    for impairment in accordance with ASC 350 at the

reporting-unit

level. Goodwill is tested annually, typically during the fourth
    quarter, or more often if events or circumstances, such as
    adverse changes in the business climate, indicate there may be
    impairment. As of December 31, 2009, there was no
    impairment to goodwill. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    NRG had approximately $721 million and $786 million,
    respectively, of goodwill that is deductible for
    U.S. income tax purposes in future periods.

Intangible Assets

—

The Company’s
    intangible assets as of December 31, 2009 reflect
    intangible assets acquired from the acquisition of Bluewater
    Wind and Blythe Solar in November 2009, the acquisition of
    Reliant Energy in May 2009, the acquisition of Texas Genco in
    February 2006 and the adoption of Fresh Start accounting.

For the Reliant Energy acquisition, the intangible assets
    include energy supply contracts, customer contracts, customer
    relationships, trade names, and other. The energy supply
    contracts consist of in-market and

out-of-market

contracts that are amortized based on the expected delivery
    under the respective contracts. The amortization expense
    associated with the energy supply contracts is recorded as part
    of cost of operations. The customer contracts are amortized to
    revenues, based on expected volumes to be delivered for the
    portfolio. The customer relationships are amortized to
    depreciation and amortization expense, based on the expected
    discounted future cash flow by year. The trade names are
    amortized to depreciation and amortization expense on a straight
    line basis over the estimated useful life.

The intangible assets established with the Texas Genco
    acquisition and upon the adoption of Fresh Start reporting
    include
    SO


and
    NO

x

emission allowances and certain in-market power, fuel (coal,
    gas, and nuclear) and water contracts. The emission allowances
    are amortized and recorded as a part of the cost of operations,
    with
    NO

x

emission allowances amortized on a straight line basis and
    SO


emission allowances amortized based on units of production. The
    power contracts are amortized based on contracted volumes over
    the life of each contract and the fuel contracts are amortized
    over expected volumes over the life of each contract. The power
    contracts are amortized and recorded as part of revenues, while
    fuel and water contracts are amortized and recorded as part of
    the cost of operations.

In 2009, NRG began purchasing RGGI emission allowance credits,
    which are amortized based on units of production and recorded as
    a part of the costs of operations.

Intangible assets held for sale

— NRG records
    the Company’s bank of emission allowances

held-for-use

as part of the Company’s intangible assets. From time to
    time, management may authorize the transfer from the
    Company’s emission bank to intangible assets

held-for-sale.

Emission allowances

held-for-sale

are included in other non current assets on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet and are not amortized, but rather
    expensed as sold. As of December 31, 2009, the value of
    emission allowances

held-for-sale

is $7 million and is managed within the Corporate segment.
    Once transferred to

held-for-sale,

these emission allowances are prohibited from moving back to

held-for-use.

Out-of-market

contracts —

Due to Fresh Start accounting, as well
    as the acquisition of Blythe Solar, Reliant Energy and Texas
    Genco, NRG acquired certain

out-of-market

contracts. These are primarily customer contracts, energy
    supply, power, gas swaps, and certain coal contracts and are
    classified as non-current liabilities on NRG’s consolidated
    balance sheet. The gas swap, power and customer contracts are
    amortized to revenues, while the energy supply and coal
    contracts are amortized to cost of operations.

The following table summarizes the estimated amortization
    related to NRG’s

Senior
    Notes

NRG has four outstanding issuances of senior notes, or Senior
    Notes, under an Indenture, dated February 2, 2006, or the
    Indenture, between NRG and Law Debenture Trust Company of
    New York, as trustee:

(i) 7.25% senior notes, issued February 2, 2006
    and due February 1, 2014, or the 2014 Senior Notes;

(ii) 7.375% senior notes, issued February 2, 2006
    and due February 1, 2016, or the 2016 Senior Notes;

(iii) 7.375% senior notes, issued November 21,
    2006 and due January 15, 2017, or the 2017 Senior
    Notes; and

(iv) 8.5% senior notes, issued June 5, 2009 and
    due June 15, 2019, or the 2019 Senior Notes.

Supplemental indentures to the series of notes have been issued
    to add newly formed or acquired subsidiaries as guarantors.

The Indentures and the form of notes provide, among other
    things, that the Senior Notes will be senior unsecured
    obligations of NRG. The Indentures also provide for customary
    events of default, which include, among others: nonpayment of
    principal or interest; breach of other agreements in the
    Indentures; defaults in failure to pay certain other
    indebtedness; the rendering of judgments to pay certain amounts
    of money against NRG and its subsidiaries; the failure of
    certain guarantees to be enforceable; and certain events of
    bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default
    occurs, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal
    amount of the then outstanding series of Senior Notes may
    declare all of the Senior Notes of such series to be due and
    payable immediately.

The terms of the Indentures, among other things, limit
    NRG’s ability and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability
    to:

•

return capital to shareholders;

•

grant liens on assets to lenders; and

•

incur additional debt.

Interest is payable semi-annually on the Senior Notes until
    their maturity dates. In addition, the Company entered into a
    fixed to floating interest rate swap in 2004 with a notional
    amount as of December 31, 2009 of $400 million and a
    maturity date of December 15, 2013.

Prior to February 1, 2010, NRG may redeem all or a portion
    of the 2014 Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the
    principal amount plus a premium and accrued interest. The
    premium is the greater of: (i) 1% of the principal amount
    of the note, or (ii) the excess of the principal amount of
    the note over the following: the present value of 103.625% of
    the note, plus interest payments due on the note from the date
    of redemption through February 1, 2010, discounted at a
    Treasury rate plus 0.50%. On or after February 1, 2010, NRG
    may redeem some or all of the notes at redemption prices
    expressed as percentages of principal amount as set forth below,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes redeemed to the
    applicable redemption date:

Senior
    Credit Facility

As of December 31, 2009, NRG has a Senior Credit Facility
    which is comprised of a senior first priority secured term loan,
    or the Term Loan Facility, a $1.0 billion senior first
    priority secured revolving credit facility, or the Revolving
    Credit Facility, and a $1.3 billion senior first priority
    secured synthetic letter of credit facility, or the Synthetic
    Letter of Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility was last
    amended on June 8, 2007 which resulted in a charge of
    $35 million which was recorded to the Company’s
    results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    primarily related to the write-off of previously deferred
    financing costs. The pricing on the Company’s Term Loan
    Facility and Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility is also subject
    to further reductions upon the achievement of certain financial
    ratios.

As of December 31, 2009, NRG had issued $717 million
    of letters of credit under the Synthetic Letter of Credit
    Facility, leaving $583 million available for future
    issuances. Under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility as
    of


December 31, 2009, NRG had issued letters of credit
    totaling $95 million, leaving $905 million available
    for borrowings, of which approximately $805 million could
    be used to issue additional letters of credit.

The Term Loan Facility matures on February 1, 2013, and
    amortizes in twenty-seven consecutive equal quarterly
    installments of 0.25% term loan commitments, beginning
    June 30, 2006, with the balance payable on the seventh
    anniversary thereof. The full amount of the Revolving Credit
    Facility will mature on February 2, 2011. The Synthetic
    Letter of Credit Facility will mature on February 1, 2013,
    and no amortization will be required in respect thereof. NRG has
    the option to prepay the Senior Credit Facility in whole or in
    part at any time.

NRG must annually offer a portion of its excess cash flow (as
    defined in the Senior Credit Facility) to its first lien lenders
    under the Term Loan Facility. The percentage of the excess cash
    flow offered to these lenders is dependent upon the
    Company’s consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the
    Senior Credit Facility) at the end of the preceding year. Of the
    amount offered, the first lien lenders must accept 50%, while
    the remaining 50% may either be accepted or rejected at the
    lenders’ option. The 2010 mandatory offer related to 2009
    is expected to be $430 million, against which the Company
    made a prepayment of $200 million in December 2009. Based
    on current credit market conditions, the Company expects that
    its lenders will accept in full the 2010 mandatory offer related
    to 2009, and, as such, the Company has reclassified
    approximately $230 million of Term Loan Facility maturity
    from a non-current to a current liability as of
    December 31, 2009. The 2009 mandatory offer and prepayment
    related to 2008 paid in March 2009 was $197 million.

The Senior Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of
    NRG’s existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries,
    with certain customary or

agreed-upon

exceptions for unrestricted foreign subsidiaries, project
    subsidiaries, and certain other subsidiaries. The capital stock
    of substantially all of NRG’s subsidiaries, with certain
    exceptions for unrestricted subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries,
    and project subsidiaries, has been pledged for the benefit of
    the Senior Credit Facility’s lenders.

The Senior Credit Facility is also secured by first-priority
    perfected security interests in substantially all of the
    property and assets owned or acquired by NRG and its
    subsidiaries, other than certain limited exceptions. These
    exceptions include assets of certain unrestricted subsidiaries,
    equity interests in certain of NRG’s project affiliates
    that have non-recourse debt financing, and voting equity
    interests in excess of 66% of the total outstanding voting
    equity interest of certain of NRG’s foreign subsidiaries.

The Senior Credit Facility contains customary covenants, which,
    among other things, require NRG to meet certain financial tests,
    including minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage
    ratio on a consolidated basis, and limit NRG’s ability to:

•

incur indebtedness and liens and enter into sale and lease-back
    transactions;

•

make investments, loans and advances; and

•

return capital to shareholders.

Interest Rate Swaps

— In May 2009, NRG entered
    into a series of forward-starting interest rate swaps. These
    interest rate swaps become effective on April 1, 2011, and
    are intended to hedge the risks associated with floating
    interest rates. For each of the interest rate swaps, the Company
    will pay its counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest
    payment on a predetermined notional value, and NRG receives the
    monthly equivalent of a floating interest payment based on a

1-month

LIBOR calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate
    swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made monthly and
    the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period. The
    total notional amount of these swaps, which mature on
    February 1, 2013, is $900 million.

In 2006 in connection with the Senior Credit Facility, NRG
    entered into another series of forward-setting interest rate
    swaps which are intended to hedge the risks associated with
    floating interest rates. For each of the interest rate swaps,
    the Company pays its counterparty the equivalent of a fixed
    interest payment on a predetermined notional value, and NRG
    receives quarterly the equivalent of a floating interest payment
    based on a

3-month

LIBOR calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate
    swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made quarterly,
    and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period.
    While the


notional value of each of the swaps does not vary over time, the
    swaps are designed to mature sequentially. The notional amounts
    and maturities of each tranche of these swaps as of
    December 31, 2009, are as follows:

Dunkirk
    Power LLC Tax-Exempt Bonds

On April 15, 2009, NRG executed a $59 million
    tax-exempt bond financing, or the Dunkirk bonds, through its
    wholly-owned subsidiary, Dunkirk Power LLC. The bonds were
    issued by the County of Chautauqua Industrial Development Agency
    and will be used for construction of emission control equipment
    on the Dunkirk Generating Station in Dunkirk, NY. The bonds
    initially bear weekly interest based on the Securities Industry
    and Financial Markets Association, or SIFMA, rate, have a
    maturity date of April 1, 2042, and are enhanced by a
    letter of credit under the Company’s Revolving Credit
    Facility covering amounts drawn on the facility. The proceeds
    received through December 31, 2009 were $52 million,
    with the remaining balance being released over time as
    construction costs are paid. On February 1, 2010, the
    Company fixed the rate on the Dunkirk bonds at 5.875%. Interest
    will be payable semiannually. In addition, the $59 million
    letter of credit issued by NRG in support of the bonds was
    cancelled and replaced with a parent guarantee.

NRG
    Non-Recourse Debt

Debt
    Related to Capital Allocation Program

In 2006, the Company formed CSF I and II, two wholly-owned
    unrestricted subsidiaries that are both consolidated by NRG.
    Their purpose was to repurchase an aggregate of
    $500 million in shares of NRG’s common stock in the
    public markets or in privately negotiated transactions in
    connection with the Company’s Capital Allocation Program.
    These subsidiaries were funded with a combination of cash from
    NRG, and a mix of notes and preferred interests issued to CS, or
    the CSF Debt. Both the notes and the preferred interests are
    non-recourse debt to NRG or any of its restricted subsidiaries,
    with the debt collateralized by the NRG common stock held by CSF
    I and II. In addition, the assets of CSF I and II are not
    available to the creditors of NRG or the Company’s other
    subsidiaries.

From inception through July 2008, the notes and preferred
    interests of CSF I contained a feature considered an embedded
    derivative, which required NRG to pay to CS at maturity, either
    in cash or stock at NRG’s option, the excess of NRG’s
    then current stock price over a Threshold Price. From inception
    through November 24, 2009, the notes and preferred
    interests of CSF II also contained a feature considered an
    embedded derivative with terms similar to the CSF I embedded
    derivative. The Threshold Price is the price of NRG’s stock
    in excess of a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 20%
    beyond the volume-weighted average share price of the stock at
    the time of repurchase. Although this feature was considered a
    derivative, it was exempt from derivative accounting under the
    guidance of ASC 815, and was only recognized upon settlement. As
    a result of the early settlement in August 2008 by the CSF I
    extension and the unwinding of the CSF II debt in November 2009,
    both described below, there were no notes or preferred interests
    containing an embedded derivative feature as of
    December 31, 2009.

CSF I Extension

— In March 2008, the Company
    executed an arrangement with CS to extend the notes and
    preferred interest maturities of the CSF I Debt from October
    2008 to June 2010. In addition, the settlement date of the
    embedded derivative, or CSF I CAGR, was extended 30 days to
    early December 2008. As part of this extension arrangement, the
    Company contributed 795,503 treasury shares to CSF I as
    additional collateral to maintain a blended interest rate in the
    CSF I facility of approximately 7.5%. The amount due at maturity
    in June 2010, including accrued interest, for the CSF I Debt
    will be $249 million. In August 2008, the Company amended
    the CSF I Debt to early settle the CSF I CAGR. Accordingly, NRG
    made a cash payment of $45 million to CS for the benefit of
    CSF I, which was recorded to additional paid in capital on
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2008. See further discussion below regarding
    the adoption of FSP APB

14-1.

Share Lending Agreements

— On February 20,
    2009, CSF I and II entered into Share Lending Agreements,
    or SLAs, with affiliates of CS relating to the shares of NRG
    common stock currently held by CSF I and II in connection
    with the CSF Debt. The Company entered into the SLAs due to a
    lack of liquidity in the stock borrow


market for NRG shares that existed at that time and in order to
    maintain the intended economic benefits of the CSF Debt
    agreements. The SLAs permitted affiliates of CS to borrow up to
    the total number of shares of NRG common stock held by CSF I and
    II. CSF I and II loaned affiliates of CS 6,600,000 and
    5,400,000 shares, respectively, of NRG common stock under
    the SLAs.

Shares borrowed by affiliates of CS under the SLAs were used to
    replace shares borrowed by affiliates of CS from third parties
    in connection with CS hedging activities related to the
    financing agreements. The shares are expected to be returned
    upon the termination of the financing agreements. Until the
    shares are returned, the shares will be treated as outstanding
    for corporate law purposes, and accordingly, the holders of the
    borrowed shares will have all of the rights of a holder of the
    Company’s outstanding shares, including the right to vote
    the shares on all matters submitted to a vote of the
    Company’s stockholders. However, because the CS affiliates
    must return all borrowed shares (or identical shares), the
    borrowed shares are not considered outstanding for the purpose
    of computing and reporting the Company’s basic or diluted
    earnings per share.

CSF II Debt Maturity

— On November 24,
    2009, the Company completed the unwinding of the CSF II Debt,
    remitting a cash payment to CS of the $181 million
    outstanding principal and interest, while CS returned
    5,400,000 shares of NRG common stock borrowed under the
    SLAs, and then released all 9,528,930 common shares held as
    collateral for the CSF II Debt. The CSF II Debt contained an
    embedded derivative feature, or CFS II CAGR, which could have
    required NRG to pay CS at maturity, either in cash or stock at
    NRG’s option, the excess of NRG’s then current stock
    price over a Threshold Price of $40.80 per share. On
    November 24, 2009, it was determined that no payment was
    required on the CSF II CAGR at which point the CSF II CAGR
    expired.

At December 31, 2009, CSF I held 12,441,973 shares of
    NRG common stock of which 6,600,000 shares lent to
    affiliates of CS under the SLAs, with a fair value of
    $156 million, are considered outstanding and
    5,841,973 shares are reflected within treasury stock on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

Notes

— As of December 31, 2009, CSF I had
    a total of $137 million in notes in connection with Phase I
    of the Capital Allocation Program which mature in June 2010,
    plus accrued interest at an annual rate of 5.45%. As of
    December 31, 2008, CSF I and II had a total of
    $249 million in notes outstanding in connection with Phase
    I.

Preferred Interests

— As of December 31,
    2009, CSF I had a total of $53 million in preferred
    interests issued and outstanding which mature in June 2010, plus
    accrued interest at an annual rate of 12.65%. As of
    December 31, 2008, CSF I and II had a total of
    $84 million in preferred interests issued and outstanding.
    The preferred interests are classified as a liability per ASC
    480,

Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,

or ASC 480,
    because they embody a fixed unconditional obligation that the
    unrestricted subsidiaries must settle.

    $40 million, respectively. The effective interest rate as
    of December 31, 2009, was 11.4% for the CSF I debt. The
    effective interest rate as of December 31, 2008, was 11.4%
    for the CSF I debt and 12.1% for the CSF II debt.


Project
    Financings

The following are descriptions of certain indebtedness of
    NRG’s project subsidiaries that remain outstanding as of
    December 31, 2009. The indebtedness described below is
    non-recourse to NRG, unless otherwise noted.

TANE
    Facility

On February 24, 2009, Nuclear Innovation North America LLC,
    or NINA, executed an EPC agreement with Toshiba American Nuclear
    Energy Corporation, or TANE, which specifies the terms under
    which STP Units 3 and 4 will be constructed. Concurrent with the
    execution of the EPC agreement, NINA and TANE entered into a
    credit facility, or the TANE Facility, wherein TANE has
    committed up to $500 million to finance purchases of
    long-lead materials and equipment for the construction of STP
    Units 3 and 4. The TANE Facility matures on February 24,
    2012, subject to two renewal periods, and provides for customary
    events of default, which include, among others: nonpayment of
    principal or interest; default under other indebtedness; the
    rendering of judgments; and certain events of bankruptcy or
    insolvency. Outstanding borrowings will accrue interest at LIBOR
    plus 3%, subject to a ratings grid, and are secured by
    substantially all of the assets of and membership interests in
    NINA and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2009, no
    amounts have been borrowed under the TANE Facility.

GenConn
    Energy LLC related financings

On April 27, 2009, NRG Connecticut Peaking LLC, a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG, closed on an equity bridge loan
    facility, or EBL, in the amount of $121.5 million from a
    syndicate of banks. The purpose of the EBL is to fund the
    Company’s proportionate share of the project construction
    costs required to be contributed into GenConn Energy LLC, or
    GenConn, a 50% equity method investment of the Company. The EBL,
    which is fully collateralized with a letter of credit issued
    under the Company’s Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility
    covering amounts drawn on the facility, will bear interest at a
    rate of LIBOR plus 2% on drawn amounts. The EBL will mature on
    the earlier of Middletown’s commercial operations date or
    July 26, 2011. The EBL also requires mandatory prepayment
    of the portion of the loan utilized to pay costs of the Devon
    project, of approximately $54 million, on the earlier of
    Devon’s commercial operations date, currently anticipated
    to be June 2010, or January 27, 2011. The proceeds of the
    EBL received through December 31, 2009, were
    $108 million and the remaining amounts will be drawn as
    necessary.

Borrowings of an equity method investment

— In
    April 2009, GenConn, a variable interest entity, secured
    financing for 50% of the Devon and Middletown project
    construction costs through a

7-year

term
    loan facility, and also entered into a

5-year

revolving working capital loan and letter of credit facility,
    which collectively with the term loan is referred to as the
    GenConn Facility. The aggregate credit amount secured under the
    GenConn Facility, which is non-recourse to NRG, is
    $291 million, including $48 million for the revolving
    facility. In August 2009, GenConn began to draw under the
    GenConn Facility to cover costs related to the Devon project and
    as of December 31, 2009, has drawn $48 million.

Other

In 2008, NINA and NRG Repowering Holdings LLC, or NRG
    Repowering, each obtained a $20 million revolving credit
    facility to provide working capital which permits NINA and NRG
    Repowering to make cash draws or issue letters of credit. The
    facilities mature on April 30, 2010, for NINA and
    August 12, 2011, for NRG Repowering. The facilities provide
    for customary events of default, which include, among others:
    nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of other agreements
    in the facility; the rendering of judgments to pay certain
    amounts of money against NINA or NRG Repowering and their
    subsidiaries; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.
    Borrowings under the facilities accrue interest at LIBOR or a
    base rate, plus a spread and are supported by a letter of credit
    issued by NRG. As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, NINA had
    borrowed approximately $20 million and $10 million,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, NRG
    Repowering had borrowed approximately $19 million and
    $10 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009,
    NRG Repowering also had outstanding approximately
    $1 million in letters of credit.


Peakers

In June 2002, NRG Peaker Finance Company LLC, or Peakers, an
    indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $325 million in
    floating rate bonds due June 2019. Peakers subsequently swapped
    such floating rate debt for fixed rate debt at an all-in cost of
    6.67% per annum. Principal, interest, and swap payments were
    originally guaranteed by Syncora Guarantee Inc., successor in
    interest to XL Capital Assurance, through a financial guaranty
    insurance policy. In 2009, Assured Guaranty Mutual Corp assumed
    the responsibility as the bond insurer and controlling party.
    Syncora Guarantee Inc. continues to be the swap insurer. These
    notes are also secured by, among other things, substantially all
    of the assets of and membership interests in Bayou Cove Peaking
    Power LLC, Big Cajun I Peaking Power LLC, NRG Sterlington Power
    LLC, NRG Rockford LLC, NRG Rockford II LLC, and NRG
    Rockford Equipment LLC. As of December 31, 2009,
    approximately $251 million in principal remained
    outstanding on these bonds. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, NRG
    issued a $36 million letter of credit to the Peakers’
    collateral agent. The letter of credit may be drawn if the
    project is unable to meet principal or interest payments. There
    are no provisions requiring NRG to replenish the letter of
    credit if it is drawn. On December 10, 2009, the collateral
    agent drew approximately $0.6 million on the letter of
    credit to meet the debt service requirements.

NRG
    Thermal

NRG owns and operates its thermal business through a
    wholly-owned subsidiary holding company, NRG Thermal LLC, or NRG
    Thermal. In 1993, the predecessor entity to NRG Thermal’s
    largest subsidiary, NRG Energy Center Minneapolis LLC, or NRG
    Thermal Minneapolis, issued $84 million of
    7.31% senior secured notes due June 2013, of which
    approximately $25 million remained outstanding as of
    December 31, 2009. In 2002, NRG Thermal Minneapolis issued
    an additional $55 million of 7.25% Series A notes due
    August 2017, of which approximately $37 million remained
    outstanding as of December 31, 2009, and $20 million
    of 7.12% Series B notes due August 2017, of which
    approximately $13 million remained outstanding as of
    December 31, 2009. This indebtedness is secured by
    substantially all of the assets of NRG Thermal Minneapolis. NRG
    Thermal has guaranteed the indebtedness, and its guarantee is
    secured by a pledge of the equity interests in all of NRG
    Thermal’s subsidiaries.

Capital
    Leases

Saale
    Energie GmbH

Saale Energie GmbH, or SEG, an NRG wholly-owned subsidiary, has
    a 41.9% participation in Schkopau through NRG’s interest in
    the Kraftwerke Schkopau GbR, or KSGbR, partnership. Under the
    terms of a Use and Benefit Fee Agreement, SEG and the other
    partner to the project, E.ON Kraftwerke GmbH, are required to
    fund debt service and certain other costs resulting from the
    construction and financing of Schkopau. The Use and Benefit Fee
    Agreement is treated as a capital lease under U.S. GAAP.
    Calls for funds are made to the partners based on their
    participation interest as cash is needed. As of
    December 31, 2009, the capital lease obligation at SEG was
    approximately $123 million.

The KSGbR issued debt to fund Schkopau pursuant to multiple
    facilities totaling approximately €785 million. As of
    December 31, 2009, approximately €141 million
    (approximately $202 million) remained outstanding at
    Schkopau. Interests on the individual loans accrue at fixed
    rates averaging 4.26% per annum, with maturities occurring
    between 2010 and 2015. SEG remains liable to the lenders as a
    partner in KSGbR, but there is no recourse to NRG.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

NRG’s AROs are primarily related to the future
    dismantlement of equipment on leased property and environmental
    obligations related to nuclear decommissioning, ash disposal,
    site closures, and fuel storage facilities. In addition, NRG has
    also identified conditional AROs for asbestos removal and
    disposal, which are specific to certain power generation
    operations.

See Note 7,

Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund,

for a further discussion of NRG’s nuclear
    decommissioning obligations. Consequently, accretion for the
    nuclear decommissioning ARO and amortization of the related ARO
    asset are recorded to the Nuclear Decommissioning
    Trust Liability to the ratepayers and are not included in
    net income, consistent with regulatory treatment.

The following table represents the balance of ARO obligations as
    of December 31, 2009, and 2008, along with the additions,

Benefit
    Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

NRG sponsors and operates three defined benefit pension and
    other postretirement plans. The NRG Plan for Bargained Employees
    and the NRG Plan for Non-bargained Employees are maintained
    solely for eligible legacy NRG participants. A third plan, the
    Texas Genco Retirement Plan, is maintained for participation by
    eligible Texas based employees. NRG expects to contribute
    approximately $18 million to the Company’s three
    pension plans in 2010.

NRG Plans for Bargained and Non-bargained
    Employees

— Substantially all employees hired
    prior to December 5, 2003, were eligible to participate in
    NRG’s legacy defined benefit pension plans. The Company
    initiated a noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan
    effective January 1, 2004, with credit for service from
    December 5, 2003. In addition, the Company provides
    postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain groups of
    employees. Generally, these are groups that were acquired prior
    to 2004 and for whom prior benefits are being continued (at
    least for a certain period of time or as required by union
    contracts). Cost sharing provisions vary by acquisition group
    and terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements.

Texas Genco Retirement Plan

— The Texas
    region’s pension plan is a noncontributory defined benefit
    pension plan that provides a final average pay benefit or cash
    balance benefit, where the participant receives the more
    favorable of the two formulas, based on all years of service. In
    addition, employees who were hired prior to 1999 are also
    eligible for grandfathered benefits under a final average pay
    formula. In most cases, the benefits under the grandfathered
    formula were frozen on December 31, 2008. NRG’s Texas
    region employees are also covered under an unfunded
    postretirement health and welfare plan. Each year, employees
    receive a fixed credit of $750 to their account plus interest.
    Certain grandfathered employees will receive additional credits
    through 2008. At retirement, the employees may use their
    accounts to purchase retiree medical and dental benefits from
    NRG. NRG’s costs are limited to the amounts earned in the
    employee’s account; all other costs are paid by the
    participant.

NRG uses December 31 of each respective year as the measurement
    date for the Company’s pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans. The Company sets the discount rate assumptions on
    an annual basis for each of NRG’s retirement related
    benefit plans at their respective measurement date. This rate is
    determined by NRG’s Investment Committee based on
    information provided by the Company’s actuary. The discount
    rate assumptions reflect the current rate at which the
    associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end
    of the year. The discount rate assumptions used to determine
    future pension obligations as of December 31, 2009, and
    2008 were based on the Hewitt Yield Curve, or HYC, which was
    designed by Hewitt Associates to provide a means for plan
    sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement
    benefit plans. The HYC is a hypothetical yield curve represented
    by a series of annualized individual discount rates. Each bond
    issue underlying the HYC is required to have a rating of Aa or
    better by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. or a rating of AA
    or better by Standard & Poor’s.

NRG employs a total return investment approach, whereby a mix of
    equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the
    long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
    Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of
    plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial
    condition. The target allocation of plan assets is 63% to 77%
    invested in equity securities of which 50% to 60% invested in
    U.S. equity securities, with the remainder invested in
    fixed income securities. The Investment Committee reviews the
    asset mix periodically and as the plan assets increase in future
    years, the Investment Committee may examine other asset classes
    such as real estate or private equity. NRG employs a building
    block approach to determining the long-term rate of return for
    plan assets, with proper consideration given to diversification
    and rebalancing. Historical markets are studied and long-term
    historical relationships between equities and fixed income are
    preserved, consistent with the widely accepted capital market
    principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater
    return over the long run. Current factors such as inflation and
    interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market
    assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are
    reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

Plan assets are currently invested in a diversified blend of
    equity and fixed-income investments. Furthermore, equity
    investments are diversified across U.S. and

non-U.S. equities,

as well as among growth, value, small and large capitalization
    stocks.

NRG’s pension plan assets weighted average allocation as of
    December 31, 2009, and 2008 were as follows:

STP
    Defined Benefit Plans

NRG has a 44% undivided ownership interest in STP, as discussed
    further in Note 27,

Jointly Owned Plants

. STPNOC,
    who operates and maintains STP, provides its employees a defined
    benefit pension plan as well as postretirement health and
    welfare benefits. Although NRG does not sponsor the STP plan, it
    reimburses STPNOC for 44% of the contributions made towards its
    retirement plan obligations. For the years ending
    December 31, 2009, and 2008, NRG reimbursed STPNOC
    approximately $5 million and $6 million, respectively,
    towards its defined benefit plans. In 2010, NRG expects to
    reimburse STPNOC approximately $4 million for its
    contributions towards the plans.

The Company has recognized the following in its statement of

Capital Allocation Plan

— In December 2007, the
    Company initiated its 2008 Capital Allocation Plan, with the
    repurchase of 2,037,700 shares of NRG common stock during
    that month for approximately $85 million. In February 2008,
    the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an additional
    $200 million in common share repurchases that raised the
    total 2008 Capital Allocation Plan to approximately
    $300 million. During 2008, the Company repurchased a total
    of 4,691,883 shares for approximately $185 million. As
    of December 31, 2008, NRG had repurchased a total of
    6,729,583 shares of NRG common stock at a cost of
    approximately $270 million as part of its 2008 Capital
    Allocation Plan.

In the third quarter 2009, to complete its remaining
    $30 million planned share re-purchase under the 2008
    Capital Allocation plan and to initiate its 2009 Capital
    Allocation Plan, the Company repurchased 8,919,100 shares
    of NRG common stock for approximately $250 million. In the
    fourth quarter 2009, the Company repurchased an additional
    10,386,400 shares of NRG common stock for approximately
    $250 million. For 2009, NRG repurchased a total of
    19,305,500 shares of NRG common stock at a cost of
    approximately $500 million under its share repurchase
    program.

Retirement of Treasury Stock

— On May 22,
    2007, NRG retired 14,094,962 shares of treasury stock.
    These retired shares are now included in the Company’s pool
    of authorized but unissued shares. The retired stock had a
    carrying value of approximately $447 million. The
    Company’s accounting policy upon the formal retirement of


treasury stock is to deduct its par value from Common Stock and
    to reflect any excess of cost over par value as a deduction from
    Additional Paid-in Capital.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

— In May 2008, NRG
    shareholders approved the adoption of the NRG Energy, Inc.
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, pursuant to which
    eligible employees may elect to withhold up to 10% of their
    eligible compensation to purchase shares of NRG common stock at
    85% of its fair market value on the exercise date. An exercise
    date occurs each June 30 and December 31. The initial six
    month employee withholding period began July 1, 2008 and
    the first issuance of common stock under the ESPP occurred in
    2009. As of December 31, 2009, there remained
    418,468 shares of treasury stock reserved for issuance
    under the ESPP, and in January 2010, 54,845 shares of
    common stock were issued to employee accounts from treasury
    stock.

Share Lending Agreements

— As discussed in
    Note 12,

Debt and Capital Leases

, under

Debt
    Related to Capital Allocation Program,

CSF I and CSF II
    loaned 12,000,000 shares of NRG common stock to affiliates
    of CS in the first quarter 2009, and in the fourth quarter 2009,
    CS returned 5,400,000 of these shares in connection with the
    maturity of the CSF II Debt.

Preferred
    Stock

As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, the Company had
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s preferred stock
    consisted of two series: the 4% Convertible Perpetual
    Preferred Stock, or 4% Preferred Stock; and the
    3.625% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, which is
    treated as Redeemable Preferred Stock, or 3.625% Preferred Stock.

5.75%
    Preferred Stock

On February 2, 2006, NRG completed the issuance of
    2,000,000 shares of 5.75% Preferred Stock, for net proceeds
    of $486 million, reflecting an offering price of $250 per
    share and the deduction of offering expenses and discounts of
    approximately $14 million. Dividends on the 5.75% Preferred
    Stock were $14.375 per share per year, and were due and payable
    on a quarterly basis beginning on March 15, 2006.

Certain holders of the Company’s 5.75% Preferred Stock
    elected to convert their preferred shares into NRG common shares
    prior to the mandatory conversion date of March 16, 2009 at
    the minimum conversion rate of 8.2712. As of March 16,
    2009, each remaining outstanding share of the 5.75% Preferred
    Stock automatically converted into shares of common stock at a
    rate of 10.2564, based upon the applicable market value of
    NRG’s common stock. These conversions resulted in a
    decrease in preferred stock of $447 million, and a
    corresponding increase in Additional Paid-in Capital. The
    following table summarizes the conversion of the 5.75% Preferred
    Stock into NRG Common Stock:

4%
    Preferred Stock

As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, 154,057 and
    420,000 shares of the Company’s 4% Preferred Stock
    were issued and outstanding at a liquidation value, net of
    issuance costs, of $149 million and $406 million,
    respectively. The 4% Preferred Stock has a liquidation
    preference of $1,000 per share. Holders of the 4% Preferred
    Stock are entitled to receive, when declared by NRG’s Board
    of Directors, cash dividends at the rate of 4% per annum, or
    $40.00 per share per year, payable quarterly in arrears
    commencing on March 15, 2005. The 4% Preferred Stock is
    convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time into
    shares of NRG’s common stock at an initial conversion price
    of $20.00 per share. In addition, NRG had the ability to redeem,
    on or after December 20, 2009, and subject to


certain limitations, some or all of the 4% Preferred Stock with
    cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation
    preference, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends, including
    liquidated damages, if any, to the redemption date.

During the first half of 2009, 413 shares of 4% Preferred
    Stock were converted, at the option of the holder, into
    20,650 shares of common stock. In addition, in November
    2009, NRG notified the holders of the Company’s intention
    to redeem approximately 50% of the outstanding 4% Preferred
    Stock and 265,457 shares of the 4% Preferred Stock were
    converted, at the option of the holder, into
    13,272,850 shares of common stock in December 2009 in
    response to this notification. These conversions resulted in a
    decrease in preferred stock of $257 million, and a
    corresponding increase in Additional Paid-in Capital. The
    following table summarizes all 4% Preferred Stock conversions
    and redemptions for the year ended December 31, 2009:

    Stock on January 21, 2010. As of January 21, 2010, the
    Company completed the redemption of the remaining shares of 4%
    Preferred Stock, with holders converting 154,029 shares to
    7,701,450 shares of common stock and the Company redeeming
    28 shares for $28,000 cash.

Redeemable
    Preferred Stock

3.625%
    Preferred Stock

On August 11, 2005, NRG issued 250,000 shares of
    3.625% Preferred Stock, which is treated as Redeemable Preferred
    Stock, to CS in a private placement. As of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, 250,000 shares of the 3.625% Preferred Stock
    were issued and outstanding at a liquidation value, net of
    issuance costs, of $247 million. The 3.625% Preferred Stock
    amount is located after the liabilities but before the
    stockholders’ equity section on the balance sheet, due to
    the fact that the preferred shares can be redeemed in cash by
    the shareholder. The 3.625% Preferred Stock has a liquidation
    preference of $1,000 per share. Holders of the 3.625% Preferred
    Stock are entitled to receive, out of legally available funds,
    cash dividends at the rate of 3.625% per annum, or $36.25 per
    share per year, payable in cash quarterly in arrears commencing
    on December 15, 2005.

Each share of the 3.625% Preferred Stock is convertible during
    the

90-day

period beginning August 11, 2015 at the option of NRG or
    the holder. Holders tendering the 3.625% Preferred Stock for
    conversion shall be entitled to receive, for each share of
    3.625% Preferred Stock converted, $1,000 in cash and a number of
    shares of NRG common stock equal to the product of (a) the
    greater of (i) the difference between the average closing
    share price of NRG common stock on each of the 20 consecutive
    scheduled trading days starting on the date 30 exchange business
    days immediately prior to the conversion date, or the Market
    Price, and $29.54 and (ii) zero, times (b) 50.77. The
    number of NRG common stock to be delivered under the conversion
    feature is limited to 16,000,000 shares. If upon
    conversion, the Market Price is less than $19.69, then the
    Holder will deliver to NRG cash or a number of shares of NRG
    common stock equal in value to the product of (i) $19.69
    minus the Market Price, times (ii) 50.77. NRG may elect to
    make a cash payment in lieu of delivering shares of NRG common
    stock in connection with such


conversion, and NRG may elect to receive cash in lieu of shares
    of common stock, if any, from the Holder in connection with such
    conversion. The conversion feature is considered an embedded
    derivative per ASC 815 that is exempt from derivative accounting
    as it is excluded from the scope pursuant to ASC 815.

If a fundamental change occurs, the holders will have the right
    to require NRG to repurchase all or a portion of the 3.625%
    Preferred Stock for a period of time after the fundamental
    change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the liquidation
    preference, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The 3.625%
    Preferred Stock is senior to all classes of common stock, on
    parity with the Company’s 4% Preferred Stock, and junior to
    all of the Company’s existing and future debt obligations
    and all of NRG subsidiaries’ existing and future
    liabilities and capital stock held by persons other than NRG or
    its subsidiaries.

Investments
    Accounted for by the Equity Method

NRG accounts for the Company’s significant investments
    using the equity method of accounting. NRG’s carrying value
    of equity investments can be impacted by impairments, unrealized
    gains and losses on derivatives and movements in foreign
    currency exchange rates, as well as other adjustments.

The following table summarizes NRG’s equity method
    investments, as of December 31, 2009:

MIBRAG

— On June 10, 2009, NRG
    completed the sale of its 50% ownership in Mibrag B.V. See
    further discussion in Note 4,

Discontinued Operations
    and Dispositions

.

Sherbino I Wind Farm LLC

— NRG owns a
    50% interest in Sherbino, a joint venture with BP Wind Energy
    North America Inc. Sherbino is a 150MW wind farm consisting of
    50 Vestas 3MW wind turbine generators, which commenced
    commercial operations in October 2008. NRG contributed
    approximately $84 million to its equity investment in
    Sherbino in 2008. NRG’s equity loss from Sherbino was
    insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2009, and for
    the year ended December 31, 2008, NRG posted equity
    earnings from Sherbino of $8 million.

Saguaro Power Company

— NRG owns a 50%
    interest in the Saguaro plant, a cogeneration plant with
    dual-fuel capability, natural gas and oil. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, NRG’s equity income from Saguaro
    was $10 million. NRG posted equity losses in 2008 and 2007
    of $2 million and $3 million, respectively.

GenConn Energy LLC

— NRG owns a 50%
    interest in GenConn, a limited liability company formed in
    February 2008 by NRG and The United Illuminating Company, or UI,
    for the construction and operation of two 200 MW peaking
    facilities in Connecticut through GenConn’s wholly-owned
    subsidiaries, GenConn Devon, LLC, or Devon, and GenConn
    Middletown LLC, or Middletown. Devon and Middletown have each
    entered into

30-year

cost
    of service type contracts with CL&P as mandated by the
    DPUC, commencing when the facilities reach commercial
    operations, currently expected to be 2010 and 2011, respectively.

The project is expected to be funded through equity
    contributions from the owners and non-recourse, project level
    debt. As of December 31, 2009, NRG has made a nominal
    equity investment in GenConn. In addition, as discussed in
    Note 9,

Capital Leases and Notes Receivable

, in 2008
    NRG entered into a short-term $45 million note receivable
    facility with GenConn to fund NRG’s proportionate
    share of project liquidity needs which was repaid in 2009.
    NRG’s maximum exposure to loss is limited to its equity
    investments and note receivable.

On April 27, 2009, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG, NRG
    Connecticut Peaking LLC, closed on an equity bridge loan
    facility, or EBL, in the amount of $121.5 million from a
    syndicate of banks. For a detailed discussion on the facility,
    see Note 12

— Debt and Capital Leases

.
    GenConn had borrowed $108 million under this facility as of
    December 31, 2009.


As discussed in Note 21,

Related Party Transactions

,
    NRG has entered into construction management agreements with
    Devon and Middletown, and recognized approximately
    $7 million and $1 million of revenue for the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In
    addition, NRG earned interest income of $2 million in 2009
    from GenConn on an outstanding note receivable as discussed in
    Note 9,

Capital Leases and Notes Receivable

.

GenConn is considered a VIE under ASC 810, but NRG is not the
    primary beneficiary of GenConn and accounts for its 50% interest
    under the equity method. GenConn is a development stage entity,
    and is not expected to begin generating revenues until 2010;
    therefore NRG recognized no equity earnings from the joint
    venture for the years ended December 31, 2008 or 2009.

Gladstone

— Through a joint venture, NRG
    owns a 37.5% interest in Gladstone, a 1,613 megawatt coal-fueled
    power generation facility in Queensland, Australia. The power
    generation facility is managed by the joint venture participants
    and the facility is operated by NRG. Operating expenses incurred
    in connection with the operation of the facility are funded by
    each of the participants in proportion to their ownership
    interests. Coal is sourced from local mines in Queensland. NRG
    and the joint venture participants receive their respective
    share of revenues directly from the off takers in proportion to
    the ownership interests in the joint venture. Power generated by
    the facility is primarily sold to an adjacent aluminum smelter,
    with excess power sold to the Queensland Government owned
    utility under long term supply contracts. For the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, NRG’s equity
    earnings from Gladstone were approximately $17 million,
    $21 million and $21 million, respectively.

The undistributed earnings from equity investments as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, were $132 million and
    $116 million, respectively.

Note 17 —

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net
    income less accumulated preferred stock dividends by the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Shares
    issued and treasury shares repurchased during the year are
    weighted for the portion of the year that they were outstanding.
    Diluted earnings per share is computed in a manner consistent
    with that of basic earnings per share while giving effect to all
    potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during
    the period.

Dilutive effect for equity compensation

— The
    outstanding non-qualified stock options, non-vested restricted
    stock units, deferred stock units and performance units are not
    considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings
    per share. However, these instruments are included in the
    denominator for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share
    under the treasury stock method.

Dilutive effect for other equity instruments

—
    NRG’s outstanding 4% Preferred Stock and 5.75% Preferred
    Stock are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing
    basic earnings per share. However, these instruments are
    considered for inclusion in the denominator for purposes of
    computing diluted earnings per share under the if-converted
    method. The if-converted method is also used to determine the
    dilutive effect of embedded derivatives in the Company’s
    3.625% Preferred Stock, and CSF preferred interests and notes.


The reconciliation of NRG’s basic earnings per common share
    to diluted earnings per share for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is shown in the following

Segment
    Reporting

NRG’s segment structure reflects core areas of operation
    which are primarily segregated based on the Company’s
    wholesale power generation, retail, thermal and chilled water
    business, and corporate activities. In May 2009, NRG’s
    segment structure changed to reflect the Company’s
    acquisition of Reliant Energy and has been incorporated as a
    separate reporting segment as per ASC 280,

Segment
    Reporting

. Within NRG’s wholesale power generation
    operations, there are distinct components with separate
    operating results and management structures for the following
    geographical regions: Texas, Northeast, South Central, West and
    International. The Company’s corporate activities include
    wind, solar and nuclear development.

In the second quarter 2009, management changed its method for
    allocating corporate general and administrative expenses to the
    segments. Corporate general and administrative expenses had been
    allocated based on budgeted segment revenues. Beginning in the
    second quarter 2009, corporate general and administrative
    expenses have been allocated based on forecasted
    earnings/(losses) before interest expense, income taxes,
    depreciation and amortization expense.

As of December 31, 2009, there were no customers from whom
    the Company derived more than 10% of the Company’s
    consolidated revenues. The following table summarizes customers
    from whom NRG derived more than 10% of the Company’s
    consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008

The effective income tax rate for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 differs from the
    U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to changes in the valuation
    allowance as a result of capital gain or losses generated


during the period. In addition, the current earnings in foreign
    jurisdictions are taxed at rates lower than the
    U.S. statutory rate, including the sale of the MIBRAG in
    2009 which resulted in minimal tax due to the local jurisdiction.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, NRG’s state
    effective income tax rate has been reduced to 3%, which is lower
    than its 2008 rate of 6%, due to increased operational
    activities within the state of Texas in the current year. This
    decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of Reliant Energy
    which operates in the state of Texas.

The temporary differences, which gave rise to the Company’s
    deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2009
    and 2008, consisted of the following:

Tax
    Receivable and Payable

As of December 31, 2009, NRG recorded a current tax payable
    of approximately $32 million that represents a tax
    liability due for domestic state taxes of approximately
    $20 million, as well as foreign taxes payable of
    approximately $12 million. In addition, NRG has a domestic
    tax receivable of $153 million, of which $102 million
    is federal cash grant receivable on Blythe Solar and Langford
    plants.

Deferred
    tax assets and valuation allowance

Net deferred tax balance

— As of
    December 31, 2009, and 2008, NRG recorded a net deferred
    tax liability of $1,747 million and $1,032 million,
    respectively. However, due to an assessment of positive and
    negative evidence, including projected capital gains and
    available tax planning strategies, NRG believes that it is more
    likely than not that a benefit will not be realized on
    $233 million and $359 million of tax assets, thus a
    valuation allowance has remained, resulting in a net deferred
    tax liability of $1,980 million and $1,391 million as
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. NRG believes
    it is more likely than not that future earnings will be
    sufficient to utilize the Company’s deferred tax assets,
    net of the existing valuation allowances at December 31,
    2009.

NOL carryforwards

— At December 31, 2009,
    and 2008, the Company had cumulative state net operating losses,
    or NOLs, of $28 million. These NOLs will expire starting
    2010. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, NRG has
    cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $280 million of
    which $82 million will expire starting 2011 through 2017
    and of which $198 million do not have an expiration date.

Valuation allowance

— As of December 31,
    2009, the Company’s valuation allowance was reduced by
    $249 million as result of the expiration of unused capital
    loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance was increased by
    $123 million primarily for certain derivative contracts
    that are eligible for capital loss treatment for tax purposes
    resulting in a net reduction of $126 million.

Uncertain
    tax benefits

NRG has identified unrecognized tax benefits whose after-tax
    value was $643 million that if recognized, would impact the
    Company’s income tax expense.

As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, NRG has recorded a
    non-current tax liability of $347 and $208 million,
    respectively, for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from
    taxable earnings for the period for which there are no NOLs
    available to offset for financial statement purposes. The
    Company recognizes interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the
    years ended December 31, 2009, and 2008, the Company
    recognized approximately $9 million, and $8 million,
    respectively, in interest and penalties. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the Company incurred an immaterial
    amount of interest and penalties related to its unrecognized tax
    benefit. As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, NRG had accrued
    interest and penalties related to these unrecognized tax
    benefits of approximately $17 and $8 million, respectively.

Tax jurisdictions

— NRG is subject to
    examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed
    in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and
    foreign jurisdictions including major operations located in
    Germany and Australia. The Company is no longer subject to
    U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to
    2002. With few exceptions, state and local income tax
    examinations are no longer open for years before 2003. The
    Company’s significant foreign operations are also no longer
    subject to examination by local jurisdictions for years prior to
    2000.

The Company continues to be under examination by the Internal
    Revenue Service, or IRS, for years 2004 through 2006. It is
    possible that the IRS examination may conclude during 2010 but
    because of a possible extension, an estimate of the range of
    reasonably possible changes in unrecognized tax benefits cannot
    be made.

Sale of ITISA

— On April 28, 2008, NRG
    completed the sale of its 100% interest in Tosli Acquisition
    B.V., or Tosli, which held all NRG’s interest in ITISA, to
    Brookfield Renewable Power Inc. (previously Brookfield Power
    Inc.), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management
    Inc. In addition, the purchase price adjustment contingency
    under the sale agreement was resolved on August 7, 2008. In
    connection with the sale, NRG recorded a capital gain of
    $218 million which further reduced the Company’s
    uncertain tax benefits.


The following table reconciles the total amounts of unrecognized
    tax benefits at the beginning and end of the respective periods:

Included in the balance at December 31, 2009, are
    $43 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of
    the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and
    penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period
    would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would
    accelerate the payment of cash or use of net operating loss
    carryforwards to an earlier period.

German
    Tax Reform Act 2008

On July 6, 2007, the German government passed the Tax
    Reform Act of 2008, which reduces the German statutory and
    resulting effective tax rates on earnings from approximately 36%
    to approximately 27% effective January 1, 2008. Due to this
    reduction in the statutory and resulting effective tax rate in
    2007, NRG recognized a $29 million tax benefit and as of
    December 31, 2007, NRG had a German net deferred tax
    liability of approximately $84 million which includes the
    impact of this tax rate change.

Note 20 —

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Long-Term
    Incentive Plan, or LTIP

As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, a total of
    16,000,000 shares of NRG common stock were authorized for
    issuance under the LTIP, subject to adjustments in the event of
    reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock
    split, stock dividend, and a combination of shares, merger or
    similar change in NRG’s structure or outstanding shares of
    common stock. There were 5,129,593 and 6,798,074 shares of
    common stock remaining available for grants under NRG’s
    LTIP as of December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Non-Qualified
    Stock Options, or NQSO’s

NQSO’s granted under the LTIP typically have a three-year
    graded vesting schedule beginning on the grant date and become
    exercisable at the end of the requisite service period. NRG
    recognizes compensation costs for NQSO’s on a straight-line
    basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
    The maximum contractual term is ten years for approximately
    1.1 million of NRG’s outstanding NQSO’s, and six
    years for the remaining 3.7 million NQSO’s.

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted
    during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
    $8.64, $10.33, and $8.28, respectively. The total intrinsic
    value of options exercised during the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $1.4 million,
    $14 million and $11 million, respectively and cash
    received from the exercise of these options was $2 million,
    $9 million and $7 million, respectively.

The fair value of the Company’s NQSO’s is estimated on
    the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
    Significant assumptions used in the fair value model for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 with respect
    to the Company’s NQSO’s are summarized below:




Expected volatility

44.36%-48.29%

26.75%-44.00%

25.88%-27.28%

Expected term (in years)




Risk free rate

1.43%-1.93%

1.33%-3.09%

4.58%-4.68%

For 2009, 2008, and 2007, expected volatility is calculated
    based on NRG’s historical stock price volatility data over
    the period commensurate with the expected term of the stock
    option. Typically, the expected term for the Company’s
    NQSO’s is based on the simple average of the contractual
    term and vesting term. The Company uses this simplified method
    as it does not have sufficient historical exercise data to
    provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected
    term.

Restricted
    Stock Units, or RSU’s

Typically, RSU’s granted under the Company’s LTIP
    fully vest three years from the date of issuance. Fair value of
    the RSU’s is based on the closing price of NRG common stock
    on the date of grant. The following table summarizes the
    Company’s non-vested RSU awards as of December 31,
    2009, and changes during the year then ended:

    $22 million and $40 million, respectively. The
    weighted average grant date fair value of RSU’s granted
    during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
    $26.13, $39.84 and $38.61, respectively.


Deferred
    Stock Units, or DSU’s

DSU’s represent the right of a participant to be paid one
    share of NRG common stock at the end of a deferral period
    established under the terms of the award. DSU’s granted
    under the Company’s LTIP are fully vested at the date of
    issuance. Fair value of the DSU’s, which is based on the
    closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant, is
    recorded as compensation expense in the period of grant.

The following table summarizes the Company’s outstanding
    DSU awards as of December 31, 2009, and changes during the

    respectively. The aggregate intrinsic values for DSU’s
    converted to common stock for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007 were $0.5 million, $1.5 million
    and $1.2 million, respectively. The weighted average grant
    date fair value of DSU’s granted during the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $22.77, $35.12 and
    $44.43, respectively.

Performance
    Units, or PU’s

PU’s granted under the Company’s LTIP fully vest three
    years from the date of issuance. PU’s granted prior to
    January 1, 2009, are paid out upon vesting if the closing
    price of NRG’s common stock on the vesting date, or the
    Measurement Price, is equal to or greater than the Target Price.
    PU’s granted after January 1, 2009, are paid out upon
    vesting if the Measurement Price is equal to or greater than
    Threshold Price. The Threshold Price, Target Price and Maximum
    Price are determined on the date of issuance. The payout for
    each PU will be equal to: (i) a pro-rata amount between 0.5
    and 1 share of common stock, if the Measurement Price is
    equal to or greater than the target Threshold Price but less
    than the Target Price, for grants made after January 1,
    2009; (ii) one share of common stock, if the Measurement
    Price equals the Target Price; (iii) a pro-rata amount
    between one and two shares of common stock, if the Measurement
    Price is greater than the Target Price but less than the Maximum
    Price; and (iv) two shares of common stock, if the
    Measurement Price is equal to, or greater than, the Maximum
    Price.

The fair value of PU’s is estimated on the date of grant
    using a Monte Carlo simulation model and expensed over the
    service period, which equals the vesting period. Significant
    assumptions used in the fair value model for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 with respect to the
    Company’s PU’s are summarized below:

For 2009, 2008, and 2007, expected volatility is calculated
    based on NRG’s historical stock price volatility data over
    the period commensurate with the expected term of the PU, which
    equals the vesting period.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Operating
    Lease Commitments

NRG leases certain Company facilities and equipment under
    operating leases, some of which include escalation clauses,
    expiring on various dates through 2040. NRG also has certain
    tolling arrangements to purchase power which qualifies as
    operating leases. Certain operating lease agreements over their
    lease term include provisions such as scheduled rent increases,
    leasehold incentives, and rent concessions. The Company
    recognizes the effects of these scheduled rent increases,
    leasehold incentives, and rent concessions on a straight-line
    basis over the lease term unless another systematic and rational
    allocation basis is more representative of the time pattern in
    which the leased property is physically employed. Lease expense
    under operating leases was approximately $102 million,
    $54 million, and $40 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Other

As a result of the acquisition of Reliant Energy, the Company
    acquired the naming rights, including advertising and other
    benefits, for a football stadium and other convention and
    entertainment facilities included in the stadium complex in
    Houston, Texas. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company is
    required to pay $10 million per year through 2031.


Lignite
    Contract with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co.

The lignite used to fuel the Texas region’s Limestone
    facility is obtained from a surface mine, or the Jewett mine,
    adjacent to the Limestone facility under a long-term contract
    with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co., or TWCC. The contract is based
    on a cost-plus arrangement with incentives and penalties to
    ensure proper management of the mine. NRG has the flexibility to
    increase or decrease lignite purchases from the mine within
    certain ranges, including the ability to suspend or terminate
    lignite purchases with adequate notice. The mining period was
    extended through 2018 with an option to extend the mining period
    by two five-year intervals.

TWCC is responsible for performing ongoing reclamation
    activities at the mine until all lignite reserves have been
    produced. When production is completed at the mine, NRG will be
    responsible for final mine reclamation obligations. The Railroad
    Commission of Texas has imposed a bond obligation of
    approximately $83 million on TWCC for the reclamation of
    this lignite mine. Pursuant to the contract with TWCC, an
    affiliate of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. has guaranteed
    $107 million of this obligation and approximately
    $32 million of such amount is supported by letters of
    credit posted by NRG. Under the terms of the cost plus agreement
    with TWCC, NRG is required to maintain a corporate guarantee of
    TWCC’s bond obligation in the amount of $50 million
    when CenterPoint Energy, Inc.’s obligation lapses in April
    2010, or pay the costs of obtaining replacement performance
    assurance. Additionally, NRG is required to provide additional
    performance assurance over TWCC’s current bond obligations
    if required by the Commission. On January 14, 2010, NRG
    made a filing with the Railroad Commission of Texas to provide a
    corporate guaranty and indemnity in the amount of
    $50 million in support of TWCC’s bond obligation.
    NRG’s corporate guaranty and indemnity will become
    effective on April 14, 2010, upon acceptance by the Texas
    Railroad Commission.

First
    and Second Lien Structure

NRG has granted first and second liens to certain counterparties
    on substantially all of the Company’s assets. NRG uses the
    first or second lien structure to reduce the amount of cash
    collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be
    required to post from time to time to support its obligations
    under

out-of-the-money

hedge agreements for forward sales of power or MWh equivalents.
    To the extent that the underlying hedge positions for a
    counterparty are

in-the-money

to NRG, the counterparty would have no claim under the lien
    program. The lien program limits the volumes that can be hedged,
    not the value of underlying

out-of-the

money positions. The first lien program does not require NRG to
    post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. Within
    the first and second lien structure, the Company can hedge up to
    80% of its baseload capacity and 10% of its non-baseload assets
    with these counterparties for the first 60 months and then
    declining thereafter. Net exposure to a counterparty on all
    trades must be positively correlated to the price of the
    relevant commodity for the first lien to be available to that
    counterparty. The first and second lien structure is not subject
    to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a
    counterparty and has no stated maturity date.

NRG’s lien counterparties may have a claim on the
    Company’s assets to the extent market prices exceed the
    hedged price. As of December 31, 2009, and February 9,
    2010, all hedges under the first and second liens were

in-the-money

on a counterparty aggregate basis.

RepoweringNRG
    Initiatives

NRG has capitalized $33 million through December 31,
    2009, for the repowering of its El Segundo generating facility
    in California. Air permitting litigation unrelated to the El
    Segundo project has delayed receipt of certain required permits
    and prevented, the El Segundo project from meeting its original
    completion date of June 1, 2011. The Company is working
    with the counterparty to consider certain PPA modifications
    including the commercial operations date currently expected to
    be the summer of 2013.

Contingencies

Set forth below is a description of the Company’s material
    legal proceedings. The Company believes that it has valid
    defenses to these legal proceedings and intends to defend them
    vigorously. Pursuant to the requirements of ASC 450 and related
    guidance, NRG records reserves for estimated losses from
    contingencies when information available indicates that a loss
    is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be
    reasonably estimated. In


addition legal costs are expensed as incurred. Management has
    assessed each of the following matters based on current
    information and made a judgment concerning its potential
    outcome, considering the nature of the claim, the amount and
    nature of damages sought, and the probability of success. Unless
    specified below, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of
    these legal proceedings or reasonably estimate the scope or
    amount of any associated costs and potential liabilities. As
    additional information becomes available, management adjusts its
    assessment and estimates of such contingencies accordingly.
    Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and
    unfavorable rulings or developments, it is possible that the
    ultimate resolution of the Company’s liabilities and
    contingencies could be at amounts that are different from its
    currently recorded reserves and that such difference could be
    material.

In addition to the legal proceedings noted below, NRG and its
    subsidiaries are party to other litigation or legal proceedings
    arising in the ordinary course of business. In management’s
    opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will
    not materially adversely affect NRG’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

California
    Department of Water Resources

This matter concerns, among other contracts and other
    defendants, the CDWR and its wholesale power contract with
    subsidiaries of WCP (Generation) Holdings, Inc., or WCP. The
    case originated with a February 2002 complaint filed by the
    State of California alleging that many parties, including WCP
    subsidiaries, overcharged the State of California. For WCP, the
    alleged overcharges totaled approximately $940 million for
    2001 and 2002. The complaint demanded that the or FERC abrogate
    the CDWR contract and sought refunds associated with revenues
    collected under the contract. In 2003, the FERC rejected this
    complaint, denied rehearing, and the case was appealed to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit where oral
    argument was held on December 8, 2004. On December 19,
    2006, the Ninth Circuit decided that in the FERC’s review
    of the contracts at issue, the FERC could not rely on the

Mobile-Sierra

standard presumption of just and reasonable
    rates, where such contracts were not reviewed by the FERC with
    full knowledge of the then existing market conditions. WCP and
    others sought review by the U.S. Supreme Court. WCP’s
    appeal was not selected, but instead held by the Supreme Court.
    In the appeal that was selected by the Supreme Court, on
    June 26, 2008 the Supreme Court ruled: (i) that the

Mobile-Sierra

public interest standard of review applied
    to contracts made under a seller’s market-based rate
    authority; (ii) that the public interest “bar”
    required to set aside a contract remains a very high one to
    overcome; and (iii) that the

Mobile-Sierra

presumption of contract reasonableness applies when a
    contract is formed during a period of market dysfunction unless
    (a) such market conditions were caused by the illegal
    actions of one of the parties or (b) the contract
    negotiations were tainted by fraud or duress. In this related
    case, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the Ninth
    Circuit’s decision agreeing that the case should be
    remanded to the FERC to clarify the FERC’s 2003 reasoning
    regarding its rejection of the original complaint relating to
    the financial burdens under the contracts at issue and to
    alleged market manipulation at the time these contracts were
    formed. As a result, the U.S. Supreme Court then reversed
    and remanded the WCP CDWR case to the Ninth Circuit for
    treatment consistent with its June 26, 2008 decision in the
    related case. On October 20, 2008, the Ninth Circuit asked
    the parties in the remanded CDWR case, including WCP and the
    FERC, whether that Court should answer a question the
    U.S. Supreme Court did not address in its June 26,
    2008, decision; whether the

Mobile-Sierra

doctrine
    applies to a third-party that was not a signatory to any of the
    wholesale power contracts, including the CDWR contract, at issue
    in that case. Without answering that reserved question, on
    December 4, 2008, the Ninth Circuit vacated its prior
    opinion and remanded the WCP CDWR case back to the FERC for
    proceedings consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court’s
    June 26, 2008 decision. On December 15, 2008, WCP and
    the other seller-defendants filed with the FERC a Motion for
    Order Governing Proceedings on Remand. On January 14, 2009,
    the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California filed
    an Answer and Cross Motion for an Order Governing Procedures on
    Remand, and on January 28, 2009, WCP and the other
    seller-defendants filed their reply.

At this time, while NRG cannot predict with certainty whether
    WCP will be required to make refunds for rates collected under
    the CDWR contract or estimate the range of any such possible
    refunds, a reconsideration of the CDWR contract by the FERC with
    a resulting order mandating significant refunds could have a
    material adverse impact on NRG’s financial position,
    statement of operations, and statement of cash flows. As part of
    the 2006 acquisition of Dynegy’s 50% ownership interest in
    WCP, WCP and NRG assumed responsibility for any risk of loss


arising from this case, unless any such loss was deemed to have
    resulted from certain acts of gross negligence or willful
    misconduct on the part of Dynegy, in which case any such loss
    would be shared equally between WCP and Dynegy.

On January 14, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its
    decision in an unrelated proceeding involving the

Mobile-Sierra

doctrine that will affect the standard of
    review applied to the CDWR contract on remand before the FERC.
    In

NRG Power Marketing v. Maine Public Utilities
    Commission

, the Supreme Court held that the

Mobile-Sierra

presumption regarding the reasonableness of contract rates
    does not depend on the identity of the complainant who seeks a
    FERC investigation/refund. The Supreme Court proceeding arose
    following an appeal by the Attorneys General of the State of
    Connecticut and of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts regarding
    the settlement establishing the New England Forward Capacity
    Market. The settlement, filed with the FERC on March 7,
    2006, provides for interim capacity transition payments for all
    generators in New England for the period from December 1,
    2006 through May 31, 2010 and for the Forward Capacity
    Market auction rates thereafter. The Court of Appeals for the DC
    Circuit, or DC Circuit, had rejected all substantive challenges
    to the settlement, but had sustained one procedural argument
    relating to the applicability of the

Mobile-Sierra

doctrine to third parties. The Supreme Court reversed the DC
    Circuit on this point, and remanded the case for further
    consideration of whether the transition payments and auction
    rates qualify as contract rates.

Louisiana
    Generating, LLC

On February 11, 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice
    acting at the request of the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency, or U.S. EPA, commenced a lawsuit against Louisiana
    Generating, LLC in federal district court in the Middle District
    of Louisiana alleging violations of the Clean Air Act, or CAA,
    at the Big Cajun II power plant. This is the same matter
    for which Notices of Violation, or NOVs, were issued to
    Louisiana Generating, LLC on February 15, 2005, and on
    December 8, 2006. Specifically, it is alleged that in the
    late 1990’s, several years prior to NRG’s acquisition
    of the Big Cajun II power plant from the Cajun Electric
    bankruptcy and several years prior to the NRG bankruptcy,
    modifications were made to Big Cajun II Units 1 and 2 by
    the prior owners without appropriate or adequate permits and
    without installing and employing the best available control
    technology, or BACT, to control emissions of nitrogen oxides

and/or

sulfur dioxides. The relief sought in the complaint includes a
    request for an injunction to: (i) preclude the operation of
    Units 1 and 2 except in accordance with the CAA; (ii) order
    the installation of BACT on Units 1 and 2 for each pollutant
    subject to regulation under the CAA; (iii) obtain all
    necessary permits for Units 1 and 2; (iv) order the
    surrender of emission allowances or credits; (v) conduct
    audits to determine if any additional modifications have been
    made which would require compliance with the CAA’s
    Prevention of Significant Deterioration program; (vi) award
    to the Department of Justice its costs in prosecuting this
    litigation; and (vii) assess civil penalties of up to
    $27,500 per day for each CAA violation found to have occurred
    between January 31, 1997, and March 15, 2004, up to
    $32,500 for each CAA violation found to have occurred between
    March 15, 2004, and January 12, 2009, and up to
    $37,500 for each CAA violation found to have occurred after
    January 12, 2009.

On April 27, 2009, Louisiana Generating, LLC made several
    filings. It filed an objection in the Cajun Electric Cooperative
    Power, Inc.’s bankruptcy proceeding in the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Louisiana
    to seek to prevent the bankruptcy from closing. It also filed a
    complaint in the same bankruptcy proceeding in the same court
    seeking a judgment that: (i) it did not assume liability
    from Cajun Electric for any claims or other liabilities under
    environmental laws with respect to Big Cajun II that arose,
    or are based on activities that were undertaken, prior to the
    closing date of the acquisition; (ii) it is not otherwise
    the successor to Cajun Electric; and (iii) Cajun Electric

and/or

the
    Bankruptcy Trustee are exclusively liable for the violations
    alleged in the February 11, 2009, lawsuit to the extent
    that such claims are determined to have merit. On June 8,
    2009, the parties filed a joint status report setting forth
    their views of the case and proposing a trial schedule. On
    June 18, 2009, Louisiana Generating, LLC filed a motion to
    bifurcate the Department of Justice lawsuit into separate
    liability and remedy phases, and on June 30, 2009, the
    Department of Justice filed its opposition. On August 24,
    2009, Louisiana Generating, LLC filed a motion to dismiss this
    lawsuit, and on September 25, 2009, the Department of
    Justice filed its opposition to the motion to dismiss. A new
    federal bankruptcy judge was appointed on October 9, 2009.


On February 18, 2010, the LDEQ filed  a motion to intervene
    in the above lawsuit and a complaint against Louisiana
    Generating LLC for alleged violations of Louisiana’s PSD
    regulations and Louisiana’s Title V operating permit
    program. LDEQ seeks similar relief to that requested by the
    Department of Justice. Specifically, LDEQ seeks injunctive
    relief to: (1) preclude the operation of Units 1 and 2 except in
    accordance with the CAA; (2) order the installation of BACT on
    Units 1 and 2 for each pollutant subject to regulation under the
    CAA; (3) obtain all necessary permits for Units 1 and 2 pursuant
    to the requirements of PSD and the Louisiana Title V operating
    permits program; (4) conduct audits to determine if any
    additional modifications have occurred which would require it to
    meet the requirements of PSD and report the results of the audit
    to the LDEQ and EPA; (5) order the surrender of emission
    allowances or credits; (6) take other appropriate actions to
    remedy, mitigate and offset the harm to public health and the
    environment caused by violations of the CAA; (7) assess civil
    penalties; and (8) award to the LDEQ its costs in prosecuting
    the litigation. On February 19, 2010, the district court
    granted LDEQ’s motion to intervene.

Nuclear
    Innovation North America, LLC

On December 6, 2009, CPS commenced a lawsuit against two
    NINA entities asking the court to declare the rights,
    obligations, and remedies of the parties pursuant to the 1997
    and 2007 agreements between the parties should CPS unilaterally
    withdraw from the proposed STP Units 3 and 4 Project. On
    December 23, 2009, CPS amended its original December 6
    complaint adding NRG, Toshiba Corporation, and NINA LLC as
    defendants and not only continued to request that the Court
    declare the rights, obligations, and remedies of the parties
    under the two operative governing agreements, but also sought
    $32 billion in damages. CPS amended its complaint again on
    December 28, 2009.

On January 6, 2010, CPS amended its complaint for the third
    time. In addition to requesting immediate injunctive relief, the
    amended complaint alleges that NRG, Toshiba, and NINA have been
    involved in a conspiracy to defraud CPS, that they purposefully
    misled CPS in inducing it to be a partner in the STP Units 3 and
    4 Project, that they maliciously interfered with CPS contracts
    and business relationships, and that they willfully disparaged
    CPS. It sought declarations that: (i) owner consensus is
    required for all development decisions; (ii) there is a
    right to voluntary withdrawal, after which no further
    obligations accrue but undiluted ownership continues;
    (iii) both the partition waiver and forfeiture provisions
    are unenforceable against CPS under Texas law if they did apply;
    and (iv) CPS is not currently in breach. In addition, CPS
    sought relief among the following alternatives: partition by
    sale; an order forcing NRG and NINA to buy CPS’ undiluted
    share at an independent valuation; an order requiring NRG to
    compensate CPS $350 million investment and fair value for
    the site; an order granting CPS twelve months following
    withdrawal to sell its stake in the project; or an order that no
    further development take place without consensus of all project
    owners. This case was removed and remanded to and from federal
    court on three separate occasions. On January 19, 2010, CPS
    dismissed Toshiba from the lawsuit.

The parties agreed to a January 25, 2010, phased trial
    wherein all other claims would be reserved for an undetermined
    future phase II date and a trial would go forward in phase
    I only on CPS’ request for declaratory relief to determine
    the respective rights, obligations, and remedies of the parties
    under the two operative governing agreements should CPS withdraw
    from the STP Units 3 and 4 Project. On January 25, 2010,
    the parties argued the NINA entities and NRG’s Motion for
    Summary Judgment which was denied on January 26, 2010.
    After a

two-day

trial, the court issued its ruling on January 29, 2010,
    making a number of findings. It ruled that as of
    January 29, 2010, CPS and NINA were each 50% equity owners
    as tenants in common under Texas law in the STP Units 3 and 4
    Project. The court found that while a withdrawing party does not
    forfeit its 50% interest upon a withdrawal, the governing
    agreements are silent as to whether that withdrawing party can
    recoup its sunk costs upon withdrawal. Finally, the court noted
    that for CPS to remain a 50% equity owner, it must pay all
    appropriate costs. Failure to do so, the court determined, would
    result in a complete loss of CPS’ equity share. On
    February 17, 2010, an agreement in principle was reached
    with CPS for NINA to acquire a controlling interest in the STP
    Units 3 and 4 Project through a settlement of all pending
    litigation between the parties. As part of that agreement, all
    litigation would be dismissed with prejudice, including all
    phase II claims, thereby ending this matter. The parties
    continue to negotiate terms regarding final documentation of the
    agreement in principle.


Dunkirk
    Construction Litigation

In 2005, NRG entered into a Consent Decree with the New York
    State Department of Environmental Conservation whereby it agreed
    to reduce certain emissions generated by its Huntley and Dunkirk
    power plants. Pursuant to the Consent Decree, on
    November 21, 2007, Clyde Bergemann EEC, or CBEEC, and NRG
    entered into a firm fixed price contract for the supply of
    equipment, material and services for six fabric filters for
    NRG’s Dunkirk Electric Power Generating Station. Subsequent
    to contracting with NRG, CBEEC subcontracted with Hohl
    Industrial Services, Inc., or Hohl, to perform steel erection
    and equipment installation at Dunkirk.

On August 28, 2009, Hohl filed its original complaint
    against NRG, its subsidiary Dunkirk Power LLC, or Dunkirk Power,
    and CBEEC among others for claims of breach of contract, quantum
    meruit, unjust enrichment and foreclosure of mechanics’
    liens. As part of CBEEC’s contractual obligation to NRG,
    CBEEC agreed to defend, under a reservation of rights,
    NRG’s interest in this lawsuit. CBEEC filed an answer to
    the above complaint on behalf of itself, NRG and Dunkirk Power
    on October 5, 2009. On December 16, 2009, CBEEC filed
    a Motion for Summary Judgment on behalf of itself, NRG, and
    Dunkirk Power, which has yet to be decided.

On February 1, 2010, NRG and Dunkirk Power filed a Motion
    for Leave to file an Amended Answer with Cross-Claims against
    CBEEC. NRG asserted breach of contract claims seeking liquidated
    damages for the delays caused by CBEEC. NRG also retained its
    own counsel to represent its interest in the cross-claims and
    reserved its rights to seek reimbursement from CBEEC. On
    February 17, 2010, CBEEC filed an Amended Answer with
    Affirmative Defenses, Counterclaims and Cross-Claims against
    NRG. CBEEC is seeking approximately $30 million alleging
    breach of contract, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and
    foreclosure of two mechanic’s liens, as a result of alleged
    delays caused by NRG and Dunkirk Power. A court ordered hearing
    and settlement conference is scheduled for February 23,
    2010.

Excess
    Mitigation Credits

From January 2002 to April 2005, CenterPoint Energy applied
    excess mitigation credits, or EMCs, to its monthly charges to
    retail electric providers as ordered by the PUCT. The PUCT
    imposed these credits to facilitate the transition to
    competition in Texas, which had the effect of lowering the
    retail electric providers’ monthly charges payable to
    CenterPoint Energy. As indicated in its Petition for Review
    filed with the Supreme Court of Texas on June 2, 2008,
    CenterPoint Energy has claimed that the portion of those EMCs
    credited to Reliant Energy Retail Services, LLC, or RERS, a
    retail electric provider and NRG subsidiary acquired from RRI,
    totaled $385 million for RERS’s “Price to
    Beat” Customers. It is unclear what the actual number may
    be. “Price to Beat” was the rate RERS was required by
    state law to charge residential and small commercial customers
    that were transitioned to RERS from the incumbent integrated
    utility company commencing in 2002. In its original stranded
    cost case brought before the PUCT on March 31, 2004,
    CenterPoint Energy sought recovery of all EMCs that were
    credited to all retail electric providers, including RERS, and
    the PUCT ordered that relief in its Order on Rehearing in Docket
    No. 29526, on December 17, 2004. After an appeal to
    state district court, the court entered a final judgment on
    August 26, 2005, affirming the PUCT’s order with
    regard to EMCs credited to RERS. Various parties filed appeals
    of that judgment with the Court of Appeals for the Third
    District of Texas with the first such appeal filed on the same
    date as the state district court judgment and the last such
    appeal filed on October 10, 2005. On April 17, 2008,
    the Court of Appeals for the Third District reversed the lower
    court’s decision ruling that CenterPoint Energy’s
    stranded cost recovery should exclude only EMCs credited to RERS
    for its “Price to Beat” customers. On June 2,
    2008, CenterPoint Energy filed a Petition for Review with the
    Supreme Court of Texas and on June 19, 2009, the Court
    agreed to consider the CenterPoint Energy appeal as well as two
    related petitions for review filed by other entities. Oral
    argument occurred on October 6, 2009.

In November 2008, CenterPoint Energy and RRI, on behalf of
    itself and affiliates including RERS, agreed to suspend
    unexpired deadlines, if any, related to limitations periods that
    might exist for possible claims against REI and its affiliates
    if CenterPoint Energy is ultimately not allowed to include in
    its stranded cost calculation those EMCs previously credited to
    RERS. Regardless of the outcome of the Texas Supreme Court
    proceeding, NRG believes that any possible future CenterPoint
    Energy claim against RERS for EMCs credited to RERS would lack
    legal merit. No such claim has been filed.

Regulatory
    Matters

NRG operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to
    regulation by various federal and state agencies. As such, NRG
    is affected by regulatory developments at both the federal and
    state levels and in the regions in which NRG operates. In
    addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures and
    protocols of the various ISO markets in which NRG participates.
    These power markets are subject to ongoing legislative and
    regulatory changes that may impact NRG’s wholesale and
    retail businesses.

In addition to the regulatory proceedings noted below, NRG and
    its subsidiaries are a party to other regulatory proceedings
    arising in the ordinary course of business or have other
    regulatory exposure. In management’s opinion, the
    disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially
    adversely affect NRG’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows.

PJM —

On June 18, 2009, FERC denied
    rehearing of its order dated September 19, 2008, dismissing
    a complaint filed by the Maryland Public Service Commission, or
    MDPSC, together with other load interests, against PJM
    challenging the results of the RPM transition Base Residual
    Auctions for installed capacity, held between April 2007 and
    January 2008. The complaint had sought to replace the
    auction-determined results for installed capacity for the
    2008/2009, 2009/2010, and 2010/2011 delivery years with
    administratively-determined prices. On August 14, 2009, the
    MDPSC and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities filed an
    appeal of FERC’s orders to the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the Fourth Circuit, and a successful appeal could disrupt
    the auction-determined results and create a refund obligation
    for market participants. The case has been transferred to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.

Retail (Replacement Reserve) —

On
    November 14, 2006, Constellation Energy Commodities Group,
    or Constellation, filed a complaint with the PUCT alleging that
    ERCOT misapplied the Replacement Reserve Settlement, or RPRS,
    Formula contained in the ERCOT protocols from April 10,
    2006, through September 27, 2006. Specifically,
    Constellation disputed approximately $4 million in
    under-scheduling charges for capacity insufficiency asserting
    that ERCOT applied the wrong protocol. Reliant Energy Power
    Supply, or REPS, other market participants, ERCOT, and PUCT
    staff opposed Constellation’s complaint. On
    January 25, 2008, the PUCT entered an order finding that
    ERCOT correctly settled the capacity insufficiency charges for
    the disputed dates in accordance with ERCOT protocols and denied
    Constellation’s complaint. On April 9, 2008,
    Constellation appealed the PUCT order to the Civil District
    Court of Travis County, Texas and on June 19, 2009, the
    court issued a judgment reversing the PUCT order, finding that
    the ERCOT protocols were in irreconcilable conflict with each
    other. On July 20, 2009, REPS filed an appeal to the Third
    Court of Appeals in Travis County, Texas, thereby staying the
    effect of the trial court’s decision. If all appeals are
    unsuccessful, on remand to the PUCT, it would determine the
    appropriate methodology for giving effect to the trial
    court’s decision. It is not known at this time whether only
    Constellation’s under-scheduling charges, the
    under-scheduling charges of all other QSEs that disputed REPS
    charges for the same time frame, the entire market, or some
    other approach would be used for any resettlement.

Under the PUCT ordered formula, Qualified Scheduling Entities,
    or QSEs, who under-scheduled capacity within any of ERCOT’s
    four congestion zones were assessed under-scheduling charges
    which defrayed the costs incurred by ERCOT for RPRS that would
    otherwise be spread among all load-serving QSEs. Under the
    Court’s decision, all RPRS costs would be assigned to all
    load-serving QSEs based upon their load ratio share without
    assessing any separate charge to those QSEs who under-scheduled
    capacity. If under-scheduling charges for capacity insufficient
    QSEs were not used to defray RPRS costs, REPS’s share of
    the total RPRS costs allocated to QSEs would increase.

Environmental
    Matters

The construction and operation of power projects are subject to
    stringent environmental and safety protection and land use laws
    and regulation in the U.S. If such laws and regulations
    become more stringent, or new laws, interpretations or
    compliance policies apply and NRG’s facilities are not
    exempt from coverage, the Company could be required to make
    modifications to further reduce potential environmental impacts.
    New legislation and regulations to mitigate the effects of GHG
    including
    CO


from power plants, are under consideration at the federal and
    state levels. In general, the effect of such future laws or
    regulations is expected to require the addition of pollution
    control equipment or the imposition of restrictions or
    additional costs on the Company’s operations.


Environmental
    Capital Expenditures

Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated
    that environmental capital expenditures from 2010 through 2014
    to meet NRG’s environmental commitments will be
    approximately $0.9 billion and are primarily associated
    with controls on the Company’s Big Cajun and Indian River
    facilities. These capital expenditures, in general, are related
    to installation of particulate,
    SO


,
    NOx, and mercury controls to comply with federal and state air
    quality rules and consent orders, as well as installation of
    “Best Technology Available” under the Phase II
    316(b) Rule. NRG continues to explore cost effective
    alternatives that can achieve desired results. This estimate
    reflects anticipated schedules and controls related to the CAIR,
    MACT for mercury, and the Phase II 316(b) Rule which are
    under remand to the U.S. EPA, and, as such, the full impact
    on the scope and timing of environmental retrofits from any new
    or revised regulations cannot be determined at this time.

Northeast
    Region

In January 2006, NRG’s Indian River Operations, Inc.
    received a letter of informal notification from the DNREC
    stating that it may be a potentially responsible party with
    respect to Burton Island Old Ash Landfill, a historic captive
    landfill located at the Indian River facility. On
    October 1, 2007, NRG signed an agreement with the DNREC to
    investigate the site through the Voluntary

Clean-up

Program. On February 4, 2008, the DNREC issued findings
    that no further action is required in relation to surface water
    and that a previously planned shoreline stabilization project
    would adequately address shore line erosion. The landfill itself
    will require a further Remedial Investigation and Feasibility
    Study to determine the type and scope of any additional work
    required. Until the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study
    are completed, the Company is unable to predict the impact of
    any required remediation.

On May 29, 2008, the DNREC requested that NRG’s Indian
    River Operations, Inc. participate in the development and
    performance of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment, or NRDA, at
    the Burton Island Old Ash Landfill. NRG is currently working
    with the DNREC and other trustees to close out the assessment
    phase.

South
    Central Region

On February 11, 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice
    acting at the request of the U.S. EPA commenced a lawsuit
    against Louisiana Generating, LLC in federal district court in
    the Middle District of Louisiana alleging violations of the CAA
    at the Big Cajun II power plant. This is the same matter
    for which NOVs were issued to Louisiana Generating, LLC on
    February 15, 2005, and on December 8, 2006. Further
    discussion on this matter can be found in Item 3

Guarantees

NRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that
    include indemnification and guarantee provisions as a routine
    part of the Company’s business activities. Examples of
    these contracts include asset purchases and sale agreements,
    commodity sale and purchase agreements, retail contracts, joint
    venture agreements, EPC agreements, operation and maintenance
    agreements, service agreements, settlement agreements, and other
    types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third
    parties, as well as affiliates. These contracts generally
    indemnify the counterparty for tax, environmental liability,
    litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of
    representations, warranties and covenants set forth in these
    agreements. The Company is also obligated with respect to
    customer deposits associated with Reliant Energy. In some cases,
    NRG’s maximum potential liability cannot be estimated,
    since the underlying agreements contain no limits on potential
    liability. In accordance with ASC 460, NRG has estimated that
    the current fair value for issuing these guarantees was
    approximately $8.0 million as of December 31, 2009,
    and the liability in this amount is included in the
    Company’s non-current liabilities.

Letters of credit and surety bonds —

As of
    December 31, 2009, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries
    were contingently obligated for a total of approximately
    $814 million under letters of credit and surety bonds. Most
    of these letters of credit and surety bonds are issued in
    support of the Company’s obligations to perform under
    commodity agreements, financing or other arrangements. A
    majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds expire
    within one year of issuance, and it is typical for the Company
    to renew them on similar terms.

Asset sale guarantees —

NRG is typically
    requested to provide certain assurances to the counter-parties
    of the Company’s asset sale agreements. Such assurances may
    take the form of a guarantee issued by the Company on behalf of
    a directly or indirectly held majority-owned subsidiary which
    include certain indemnifications to a third party, usually the
    buyer, as described below. Due to the inter-company nature of
    such arrangements, NRG is essentially guaranteeing its own
    performance, and the nature of the guarantee being provided. It
    is not the Company’s policy to recognize the value of such
    an obligation in its consolidated financial statements. Most of
    these guarantees provide an explicit cap on the Company’s
    maximum liability, as well as an expiration period, exclusive of
    breach of representations and warranties.

In connection with the agreement to sell its 50% ownership
    interest in Mibrag B.V., NRG executed an agreement guaranteeing
    the performance of its subsidiary Lambique Beheer under the
    purchase and sale agreement. This agreement indemnifies the
    buyer for tax, environmental liability and other matters, as
    well as breaches of representations and warranties and is
    limited to EUR 206 million.

Commercial sales arrangements —

In connection
    with the purchase and sale of fuel, emission allowances and
    power generation products to and from third parties with respect
    to the operation of some of NRG’s generation facilities in
    the U.S., the Company may be required to guarantee a portion of
    the obligations of certain of its subsidiaries. These
    obligations may include liquidated damages payments or other
    unscheduled payments.

Other guarantees —

NRG has issued guarantees of
    obligations that its subsidiaries may incur as a provision for
    environmental site remediation, payment of debt obligations,
    rail car leases, performance under purchase, EPC and


operating and maintenance agreements. NRG has executed
    guarantees with related parties for one of its subsidiary’s
    obligations as construction manager under EPC contracts for the
    construction of the two peaking power plants at GenConn’s
    Devon and Middletown sites. See Note 16,

Investments
    Accounted for by the Equity Method,

for more information on
    this equity investment. The Company does not believe that it
    will be required to perform under these guarantees.

NRG signed a guarantee agreement on behalf of its subsidiary NRG
    Retail, LLC guaranteeing the payment and performance of its
    obligations under the LLC Membership Interest Purchase Agreement
    and related agreements with RRI in connection with the purchase
    of its retail business, including purchase price and acquired
    net working capital. In accordance with the LLC Membership
    Interest Purchase Agreement, on May 1, 2009, NRG signed an
    agreement guaranteeing payments up to $85 million related
    to the Restated Power Purchase Agreement with FPL Energy Upton
    Wind II, LLC. NRG has no reason to believe that the Company
    currently has any material liability relating to such routine
    indemnification obligations.

In connection with the October 5, 2009, amendment of the
    CSRA, NRG signed guarantee agreements on behalf of its
    subsidiary NRG Retail, LLC guaranteeing performance under power
    purchase and sales contracts. See Note 3, Business
    Acquisitions, for more information on the amendment of the CSRA.

The material indemnities, within the scope of ASC 460, are as
    follows:

Asset purchases and divestitures

— The purchase
    and sale agreements which govern NRG’s asset or share
    investments and divestitures customarily contain
    indemnifications of the transaction to third parties. The
    contracts indemnify the parties for liabilities incurred as a
    result of a breach of a representation or warranty by the
    indemnifying party, or as a result of a change in tax laws.
    These obligations generally have a discrete term and are
    intended to protect the parties against risks that are difficult
    to predict or estimate at the time of the transaction. In
    several cases, the contract limits the liability of the
    indemnifier. For those indemnities in which liability is capped,
    the maximum exposures range from $1 million to
    $300 million. NRG has no reason to believe that the Company
    currently has any material liability relating to such routine
    indemnification obligations.

Other indemnities —

Other indemnifications NRG
    has provided cover operational, tax, litigation and breaches of
    representations, warranties and covenants. NRG has also
    indemnified, on a routine basis in the ordinary course of
    business, consultants or other vendors who have provided
    services to the Company. NRG’s maximum potential exposure
    under these indemnifications can range from a specified dollar
    amount to an indeterminate amount, depending on the nature of
    the transaction. Total maximum potential exposure under these
    indemnifications is not estimable due to uncertainty as to
    whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved. NRG
    does not have any reason to believe that the Company will be
    required to make any material payments under these indemnity
    provisions.

Because many of the guarantees and indemnities NRG issues to
    third parties and affiliates do not limit the amount or duration
    of its obligations to perform under them, there exists a risk
    that the Company may have obligations in excess of the amounts
    described above. For those guarantees and indemnities that do
    not limit the Company’s liability exposure, it may not be
    able to estimate what the Company’s liability would be,
    until a claim is made for payment or performance, due to the
    contingent nature of these contracts.

Note 27 —

Jointly
    Owned Plants

Certain NRG subsidiaries own undivided interests in
    jointly-owned plants, described below. These plants are
    maintained and operated pursuant to their joint ownership
    participation and operating agreements. NRG is responsible for
    its subsidiaries’ share of operating costs and direct
    expense and includes its proportionate share of the facilities
    and related revenues and direct expenses in these jointly-owned
    plants in the corresponding balance sheet and income statement
    captions of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The non-guarantor subsidiaries include all of NRG’s foreign
    subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries. NRG conducts
    much of its business through and derives much of its income from
    its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company’s ability to make
    required payments with respect to its indebtedness and other
    obligations depends on the financial results and condition of
    its subsidiaries and NRG’s ability to receive funds from
    its subsidiaries. Except for NRG Bayou Cove, LLC, which is
    subject to certain restrictions under the Company’s Peaker
    financing agreements, there are no restrictions on the ability
    of any of the guarantor subsidiaries to transfer funds to NRG.
    In addition, there may be restrictions for certain non-guarantor
    subsidiaries.

The following condensed consolidating financial information
    presents the financial information of NRG Energy, Inc., the
    guarantor subsidiaries and the non-guarantor subsidiaries in
    accordance with

Rule 3-10

under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s

Regulation S-X.

The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of
    results of operations or financial position had the guarantor
    subsidiaries or non-guarantor subsidiaries operated as
    independent entities.

In this presentation, NRG Energy, Inc. consists of parent
    company operations. Guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor
    subsidiaries of NRG are reported on an equity basis. For
    companies acquired, the fair values of the assets and
    liabilities acquired have been presented on a push-down
    accounting basis.
