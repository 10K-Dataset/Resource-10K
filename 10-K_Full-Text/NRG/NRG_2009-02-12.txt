PART I

Item 1 —

Business

General

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a wholesale power
    generation company with a significant presence in major
    competitive power markets in the United States. NRG is engaged
    in the ownership, development, construction and operation of
    power generation facilities, the transacting in and trading of
    fuel and transportation services, and the trading of energy,
    capacity and related products in the regional markets in the US
    and select international markets where its generating assets are
    located.

As of December 31, 2008, NRG had a total global portfolio
    of 189 active operating fossil fuel and nuclear generation
    units, at 48 power generation plants, with an aggregate
    generation capacity of approximately 24,005 MW, and
    approximately 550 MW under construction which includes
    partners’ interests of 275 MW. In addition, NRG has
    ownership interests in two wind farms representing an aggregate
    generation capacity of 270 MW, which includes partner
    interests of 75 MW. Within the US, NRG has one of the
    largest and most diversified power generation portfolios in
    terms of geography, fuel-type and dispatch levels, with
    approximately 22,925 MW of fossil fuel and nuclear
    generation capacity in 177 active generating units at 43 plants
    and ownership interests in two wind farms representing
    195 MW of wind generation capacity. These power generation
    facilities are primarily located in Texas (approximately
    11,010 MW, including the 195 MW from the two wind
    farms), the Northeast (approximately 7,020 MW), South
    Central (approximately 2,845 MW), and West (approximately
    2,130 MW) regions of the US, and approximately 115 MW
    of additional generation capacity from the Company’s
    thermal assets.

NRG’s principal domestic power plants consist of a mix of
    natural gas-, coal-, oil-fired, nuclear and wind facilities,
    representing approximately 45%, 33%, 16%, 5% and 1% of the
    Company’s total domestic generation capacity, respectively.
    In addition, 15% of NRG’s domestic generating facilities
    have dual or multiple fuel capacity, which allows plants to
    dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option.

NRG’s domestic generation facilities consist of
    intermittent, baseload, intermediate and peaking power
    generation facilities, the ranking of which is referred to as
    Merit Order, and include thermal energy production plants. The
    sale of capacity and power from baseload generation facilities
    accounts for the majority of the Company’s revenues and
    provides a stable source of cash flow. In addition, NRG’s
    generation portfolio provides the Company with opportunities to
    capture additional revenues by selling power during periods of
    peak demand, offering capacity or similar products to retail
    electric providers and others, and providing ancillary services
    to support system reliability.

NRG’s
    Business Strategy

NRG’s business strategy is designed to enhance the
    Company’s position as a leading wholesale power generation
    company in the US. NRG will continue to utilize its asset base
    as a platform for growth and development and as a source of cash
    flow generation which can be used for the return of capital to
    debt and equity holders. The Company’s strategy is focused
    on: (i) top decile operating performance of its existing
    operating assets and enhanced operating performance of the
    Company’s commercial operations and hedging program;
    (ii) repowering of power generation assets at existing
    sites and development of new power generation projects; and
    (iii) investment in energy-related new businesses and new
    technologies where such investments create low to no carbon.
    This strategy is supported by the Company’s five major
    initiatives (

FOR

NRG,

Repowering

NRG, econrg, Future
    NRG and NRG Global Giving) which are designed to enhance the
    Company’s competitive advantages in these strategic areas
    and allow the Company to surmount the challenges faced by the
    power industry in the coming years. This strategy is being
    implemented by focusing on the following principles:



Operational Performance

—

The
    Company is focused on increasing value from its existing assets.
    Through the

FOR

NRG

initiative, NRG will continue
    to focus on extracting value from its portfolio by improving
    plant performance, reducing costs and harnessing the
    Company’s advantages of scale in the procurement of fuels
    and other commodities, parts and services, and in doing so
    improving the Company’s return on invested capital, or
    ROIC.

FOR

NRG is a companywide effort designed to increase
    ROIC through operational performance improvements to the
    Company’s asset fleet, along with a range of initiatives at
    plants and at corporate offices to reduce costs, or in some
    cases, monetize or reduce excess working capital and other
    assets. The

FOR

NRG accomplishments include both recurring
    and one-time improvements measured from a prior base year. For
    plant operations, the program measures cumulative current year
    benefits using current gross margins multiplied by the change in
    baseline levels of certain key performance indicators. The plant
    performance benefits include both positive and negative results
    for plant reliability, capacity, heat rate and station service.

In addition to the

FOR

NRG initiative, the Company seeks
    to maximize profitability and manage cash flow volatility
    through the Company’s commercial operations strategy. The
    Company will continue to execute asset-based risk management,
    hedging, marketing and trading strategies within well-defined
    risk and liquidity guidelines in order to manage the value of
    the Company’s physical and contractual assets. The
    Company’s marketing and hedging philosophy is centered on
    generating stable returns from its portfolio of baseload power
    generation assets while preserving an ability to capitalize on
    strong spot market conditions and to capture the extrinsic value
    of the Company’s intermediate and peaking facilities and
    portions of its baseload fleet. NRG believes that it can
    successfully execute this strategy by leveraging its
    (i) expertise in marketing power and ancillary services,
    (ii) its knowledge of markets, (iii) its balanced
    financial structure and (iv) its diverse portfolio of power
    generation assets.

Finally, NRG remains focused on cash flow and maintaining
    appropriate levels of liquidity, debt and equity in order to
    ensure continued access to capital for investment, to enhance
    risk-adjusted returns and to provide flexibility in executing
    NRG’s business strategy during business downturns,
    including a regular return of capital to its shareholders. NRG
    will continue to focus on maintaining operational and financial
    controls designed to ensure that the Company’s financial
    position remains strong.

Development

—

NRG is favorably
    positioned to pursue growth opportunities through expansion of
    its existing generating capacity and development of new
    generating capacity at its existing facilities. NRG intends to
    invest in its existing assets through plant improvements,
    repowerings, brownfield development and site expansions to meet
    anticipated requirements for additional capacity in NRG’s
    core markets. Through the

Repowering

NRG

initiative, NRG will continue to develop, construct and
    operate new and enhanced power generation facilities at its
    existing sites, with an emphasis on new baseload capacity that
    is supported by long-term power sales agreements and financed
    with limited or non-recourse project financing.

Repowering

NRG is a comprehensive portfolio redevelopment
    program designed to develop, construct and operate new
    multi-fuel, multi-technology, highly efficient and
    environmentally responsible generation capacity over the next
    decade. Through this initiative, the Company anticipates
    retiring certain existing units and adding new generation to
    meet growing demand in the Company’s core markets, with an
    emphasis on new capacity that is expected to be supported by
    long-term hedging programs, including Power Purchase Agreements,
    or PPAs, and financed with limited or non-recourse project
    financing. NRG expects that these efforts will provide one or
    more of the following benefits: improved heat rates; lower
    delivered costs; expanded electricity production capability; an
    improved ability to dispatch economically across the regional
    general portfolio; increased technological and fuel diversity;
    and reduced environmental impacts, including facilities that
    either have near zero greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions or can
    be equipped to capture and sequester GHG emissions.

New Businesses and New
    Technology

—

NRG is focused on the
    development and investment in energy-related new businesses and
    new technologies where the benefits of such investments
    represent significant commercial opportunities and create a
    comparative advantage for the Company, including low or no GHG
    emitting energy generating sources, such as nuclear, wind, solar
    thermal, photovoltaic, “clean’’ coal and gas, and
    the employment of post-combustion carbon capture technologies.
    In 2008, the Company began to increase its focus on ways to
    invest in or support the development of new energy-related
    businesses and technologies that could advance its multi-fuel,
    multi-technology growth strategy and look for new ways to reduce
    carbon emissions from its overall fleet, and we expect to
    continue to do so in the future. Furthermore, the Company
    intends to capitalize on the high growth opportunities presented
    by government-mandated renewable portfolio standards, tax
    incentives and loan



guaranties for renewable energy projects and new technologies
    and expected future carbon regulation. A primary focus of this
    strategy is supported by the

econrg

initiative whereby
    NRG is pursuing investments in new generating facilities and
    technologies that will be highly efficient and will employ no
    and low carbon technologies to limit
    CO


emissions and other air emissions. econrg represents NRG’s
    commitment to environmentally responsible power generation by
    addressing the challenges of climate change, clean air and
    water, and conservation of our natural resources while taking
    advantage of business opportunities that may inure to NRG as a
    result of our demonstration and deployment of “green”
    technologies. Within NRG, econrg builds upon a foundation in
    environmental compliance and embraces environmental initiatives
    for the benefit of our communities, employees and shareholders,
    such as encouraging investment in new environmental
    technologies, pursuing activities that preserve and protect the
    environment and encouraging changes in the daily lives of the
    Company’s employees.

Company-Wide Initiatives

—

In
    addition, the Company’s overall strategy is also supported
    by

Future NRG

and

NRG Global Giving

initiatives.
    Future NRG is the Company’s workforce planning and
    development initiative and represents NRG’s strong
    commitment to planning for future staffing requirements to meet
    the on-going needs of the Company’s current operations in
    addition to the Company’s

Repowering

NRG initiatives.
    Future NRG encompasses analyzing the demographics, skill set and
    size of the Company’s workforce in addition to the
    organizational structure with a focus on succession planning,
    training, development, staffing and recruiting needs. Included
    under the Future NRG umbrella is NRG University, which provides
    leadership, managerial, supervisory and technical training
    programs and individual skill development courses. NRG Global
    Giving is designed to enhance respect for the community, which
    is one of NRG’s core values. Our Global Giving Program
    invests NRG’s resources to strengthen the communities where
    we do business and seeks to make community investments in four
    focus areas: community and economic development, education,
    environment and human welfare.

Finally, NRG will continue to pursue selective acquisitions,
    joint ventures and divestitures to enhance its asset mix and
    competitive position in the Company’s core markets. NRG
    intends to concentrate on opportunities that present attractive
    risk-adjusted returns. NRG will also opportunistically pursue
    other strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions or
    divestitures.

Competition
    and Competitive Strengths

Competition —

Wholesale power generation is a
    capital-intensive, commodity-driven business with numerous
    industry participants. NRG competes on the basis of the location
    of its plants and ownership of multiple plants in various
    regions, which increases the stability and reliability of its
    energy supply. Wholesale power generation is basically a local
    business that is currently highly fragmented relative to other
    commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure.
    As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities,
    resources, nature and identity of the companies NRG competes
    with depending on the market.

Scale and diversity of assets —

NRG has one of
    the largest and most diversified power generation portfolios in
    the US, with approximately 22,925 MW of fossil fuel and
    nuclear generation capacity in 177 active generating units at 43
    plants and ownership interests in two wind farms representing
    195 MW of wind generation capacity, as of December 31,
    2008. The Company’s power generation assets are diversified
    by fuel-type, dispatch level and region, which help mitigate the
    risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand
    cycles. NRG’s US baseload facilities, which consist of
    approximately 8,715 MW of generation capacity measured as
    of December 31, 2008, provide the Company with a
    significant source of stable cash flow, while its intermediate
    and peaking facilities, with approximately 14,210 MW of
    generation capacity as of December 31, 2008, provide NRG
    with opportunities to capture the significant upside potential
    that can arise from time to time during periods of high demand.
    In addition, approximately 15% of the Company’s domestic
    generation facilities have dual or multiple fuel capability,
    which allows most of these plants to dispatch with the lowest
    cost fuel option. In 2008, NRG completed the construction of the
    Sherbino (150 MW including partner’s interests of
    75 MW) and Elbow Creek (120 MW) wind farms which
    provide electricity to the Company’s core region.



The following chart demonstrates the diversification of
    NRG’s domestic power generation assets as of
    December 31, 2008:

Reliability of future cash flows

— NRG has
    hedged a significant portion of its expected baseload generation
    capacity with decreasing hedged levels through 2014. NRG also
    has cooperative load contract obligations in South Central
    region which expire over various dates through 2026. The Company
    has the capacity and intent to enter into additional hedges when
    market conditions are favorable. In addition, as of
    December 31, 2008, the Company had purchased fuel forward
    under fixed price contracts, with contractually-specified price
    escalators, for approximately 51% of its expected baseload coal
    generation output from 2009 to 2014. The hedge percentage is
    reflective of the current agreement of the Jewett mine in which
    NRG has the contractual ability to adjust volumes in future
    years. These forward positions provide a stable and reliable
    source of future cash flow for NRG’s investors, while
    preserving a portion of its generation portfolio for
    opportunistic sales to take advantage of market dynamics.

Favorable cost dynamics for baseload power plants —

In 2008, approximately 91% of the Company’s domestic
    generation output was from plants fueled by coal or nuclear
    fuel. In many of the competitive markets where NRG operates, the
    price of power is typically set by the marginal costs of natural
    gas-fired and oil-fired power plants that currently have
    substantially higher variable costs than solid fuel baseload
    power plants. As a result of NRG’s lower marginal cost for
    baseload coal and nuclear generation assets, the Company expects
    the baseload assets in the Electric Reliability Council of
    Texas, or ERCOT, to generate power majority of the time they are
    available.

Locational advantages —

Many of NRG’s
    generation assets are located within densely populated areas
    that are characterized by significant constraints on the
    transmission of power from generators outside the particular
    region. Consequently, these assets are able to benefit from the
    higher prices that prevail for energy in these markets during
    periods of transmission constraints. NRG has generation assets
    located within New York City, southwestern Connecticut, Houston
    and the Los Angeles and San Diego load basins; all areas,
    which experience from

time-to-time

and to varying degrees of constraints on the transmission of
    electricity. This gives the Company the opportunity to capture
    additional revenues by offering capacity to retail electric
    providers and others, selling power at prevailing market prices
    during periods of peak demand and providing ancillary services
    in support of system reliability. Also, these facilities are
    often ideally situated for repowering or the addition of new
    capacity, because their location and existing infrastructure
    give them significant advantages over developed sites in their
    regions that do not have process infrastructure.

In understanding NRG’s business, the Company believes that
    certain performance metrics are particularly important. These
    are industry statistics defined by the North American Electric
    Reliability Council, or NERC, and are more fully described below:

Annual Equivalent Availability Factor, or EAF —

Measures the percentage of maximum generation available over
    time as the fraction of net maximum generation that could be
    provided over a defined period of time after all types of
    outages and deratings, including seasonal deratings, are taken
    into account.

Gross heat rate —

The gross heat rate for the
    Company’s fossil-fired power plants represents the average
    amount of fuel in a BTU required to generate one kWh of
    electricity divided by the generator output.

Net Capacity Factor —

The net amount of
    electricity that a generating unit produces over a period of
    time divided by the net amount of electricity it could have
    produced if it had run at full power over that time period. The
    net amount of electricity produced is the total amount of
    electricity generated minus the amount of electricity used
    during generation.



The tables below present the North American power generation
    performance metrics for the Company’s power plants
    discussed above for the years ended December 31, 2008 and

    agreements. During 2008, the Company did not experience any
    labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of its facilities.



Generation
    Asset Overview

NRG has a significant power generation presence in major
    competitive power markets of the US as set forth in the map
    below:

(1)

Includes 115 MW as part of
    NRG’s Thermal assets. For combined scale, approximately
    3,450 MW is dual-fuel capable. Reflects only domestic
    generation capacity as of December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company’s power
    generation assets consisted of approximately 10,495 MW of
    gas-fired; 7,540 MW of coal-fired; 3,715 MW of
    oil-fired; 1,175 MW of nuclear; and 195 MW of wind
    generating capacity in the US. In addition, NRG also owns
    approximately 115 MW of thermal capacity domestically as
    well as 1,080 MW of power generation capacity overseas. The
    Company’s US power generation portfolio by dispatch level
    is comprised of approximately 38% baseload, 36% intermediate,
    25% peaking and 1% intermittent units.

The following is a discussion of NRG’s generation assets by
    segment for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Texas Region

— As of December 31,
    2008, NRG’s generation assets in the Texas region consisted
    of approximately 5,340 MW of baseload generation assets,
    approximately 195 MW of intermittent wind generation
    assets, excluding partner interests of 75 MW, in addition
    to approximately 5,475 MW of intermediate and peaking
    natural gas-fired assets. NRG realizes a substantial portion of
    its revenue and cash flow from the sale of power from the
    Company’s three baseload power plants located in the ERCOT
    market that use solid fuel: W.A. Parish which uses coal,
    Limestone which use lignite and coal, and an undivided 44%
    interest in two nuclear generating units at South Texas Project,
    or STP. In 2008, NRG announced the completion of the
    construction of two wind farms, Sherbino Wind Farm and Elbow
    Creek Wind Farm, which are also located in the ERCOT market.
    Power plants are generally dispatched in order of lowest
    operating cost and as of May 2008 approximately 64% of the net
    generation capacity in the ERCOT market was natural gas-fired.
    In the current natural gas price environment, NRG’s three
    solid fuel baseload facilities and two wind farms have
    significantly lower operating costs than gas plants. NRG expects
    these three solid-fuel facilities to operate the majority of the
    time when available, subject to planned and forced outages.



Northeast Region

— As of
    December 31, 2008, NRG generation assets in the Northeast
    region of the US consisted of approximately 7,020 MW
    generation capacity from the Company’s power plants within
    the control areas of the New York Independent System Operator,
    or NYISO, the Independent System Operator —
    New England, or ISO-NE, and the PJM Interconnection LLC, or
    PJM. Certain of these assets are located in transmission
    constrained areas, including approximately 1,415 MW of
    in-city New York City generation capacity and approximately
    575 MW of southwest Connecticut generation capacity. As of
    December 31, 2008, NRG’s generation assets in the
    Northeast region consisted of approximately 1,870 MW of
    baseload generation assets and approximately 5,150 MW of
    intermediate and peaking assets.

South Central Region

— As of
    December 31, 2008, NRG generation assets in the South
    Central region of the US consisted of approximately
    2,845 MW of generation capacity, making NRG the third
    largest generator in the Southeastern Electric Reliability
    Council/Entergy, or SERC-Entergy, region. The Company’s
    generation assets in Louisiana consist of its primary asset, Big
    Cajun II, a coal-fired plant located near Baton Rouge, Louisiana
    which has approximately 1,490 MW of baseload capacity and
    905 MW of intermediate and peaking assets. A significant
    portion of the region’s generation capacity has been sold
    to eleven cooperatives within the region through 2026. From time
    to time, the Company may contract for intermediate generation
    capacity to support its load obligations. In addition, the
    region also operates 450 MW of peaking generation in
    Rockford, Illinois under the PJM region.

West Region

— As of December 31,
    2008, NRG generation assets in the West region of the US
    consisted of approximately 2,130 MW of generation capacity,
    primarily located in the California Independent System Operator,
    or CAISO, control area. The Company’s generation assets in
    the West region are predominately intermediate and peaking duty
    natural gas-fired plants located in southern California. In
    addition, the region owns 50% interest in a 90 MW baseload,
    gas-fired plant located in Nevada.

International Region

— As of
    December 31, 2008, NRG had net ownership in approximately
    1,080 MW of power generating capacity in Australia and
    Germany. In addition to traditional power generation facilities,
    NRG also owns equity interests in certain coal mines in Germany.

Thermal

— NRG owns thermal and chilled
    water businesses that generate approximately 1,020 MW
    thermal equivalents. In addition, NRG’s thermal segment
    owns certain power plants with approximately 115 MW of
    power generating capacity located in Delaware and Pennsylvania.

Commercial
    Operations Overview

NRG seeks to maximize profitability and manage cash flow
    volatility through the marketing, trading and sale of energy,
    capacity and ancillary services into spot, intermediate and
    long-term markets and through the active management and trading
    of emissions allowances, fuel supplies and
    transportation-related services. The Company’s principal
    objectives are the realization of the full market value of its
    asset base, including the capture of its extrinsic value, the
    management and mitigation of commodity market risk and the
    reduction of cash flow volatility over time.

NRG enters into power sales and hedging arrangements via a wide
    range of products and contracts, including power purchase
    agreements, fuel supply contracts, capacity auctions, natural
    gas swap agreements and other financial instruments. The PPAs
    that NRG enters into require the Company to deliver MWh of power
    to its counterparties. In addition, because changes in power
    prices in the markets where NRG operates are generally
    correlated to changes in natural gas prices, NRG uses hedging
    strategies which may include power and natural gas forward sales
    contracts to manage the commodity price risk primarily
    associated with the Company’s base load generation assets.
    The objective of these hedging strategies is to stabilize the
    cash flow generated by NRG’s portfolio of assets.

Fuel
    Supply and Transportation

NRG’s fuel requirements consist primarily of nuclear fuel
    and various forms of fossil fuel including oil, natural gas and
    coal, including lignite. The prices of oil, natural gas and coal
    are subject to macro- and micro-economic forces that can change
    dramatically in both the short- and long-term. The Company
    obtains its oil, natural gas and coal from multiple suppliers
    and transportation sources. Although availability is generally
    not an issue, localized shortages, transportation availability
    and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur. The
    preceding factors related to the sources and availability of raw
    materials are fairly uniform across the Company’s business
    segments.

Coal

— The Company is largely hedged for
    its domestic coal consumption over the next few years. Coal
    hedging is dynamic and is based on forecasted generation and
    market volatility. As of December 31, 2008, NRG had
    purchased forward contracts to provide fuel for approximately
    51% of the Company’s requirements from 2009 through 2014.
    NRG arranges for the purchase, transportation and delivery of
    coal for the Company’s baseload coal plants via a variety
    of coal purchase agreements, rail/barge transportation
    agreements and rail car lease arrangements. The Company
    purchased approximately 35 million tons of coal in 2008, of
    which 94% is Power River Basin coal and lignite. The Company is
    one of the largest coal purchasers in the US.



The following table shows the percentage of the Company’s
    coal and lignite requirements from 2009 through 2014 that have
    been purchased forward:

(a)

The hedge percentages reflect the
    current plan for the Jewett mine. NRG has the contractual
    ability to change volumes and may do so in the future.

As of December 31, 2008, NRG had approximately 6,349
    privately leased or owned rail cars in the Company’s
    transportation fleet. NRG has entered into rail transportation
    agreements with varying tenures that provide for substantially
    all of the Company’s rail transportation requirements up to
    the next ten years.

Natural Gas

— NRG operates a fleet of
    natural gas plants in the Texas, Northeast, South Central and
    West regions which are primarily comprised of peaking assets
    that run in times of high power demand. Due to the uncertainty
    of their dispatch, the fuel needs are managed on a spot basis as
    it is not prudent to forward purchase fixed price natural gas
    for units that may not run. The Company contracts for natural
    gas storage services as well as natural gas transportation
    services to ensure delivery of natural gas when needed.

Nuclear Fuel

— STP’s owners satisfy
    STP’s fuel supply requirements by (i) acquiring
    uranium concentrates and contracting for conversion of the
    uranium concentrates into uranium hexafluoride,
    (ii) contracting for enrichment of uranium hexafluoride,
    and (iii) contracting for fabrication of nuclear fuel
    assemblies. NRG is party to a number of long-term forward
    purchase contracts with many of the world’s largest
    suppliers covering STP requirements for uranium and conversion
    services for the next five years, and with substantial portions
    of STP’s requirements procured thereafter. NRG is party to
    long-term contracts to procure STP’s requirements for
    enrichment services and fuel fabrication for the life of the
    operating license.

Seasonality
    and Price Volatility

Annual and quarterly operating results can be significantly
    affected by weather and energy commodity price volatility.
    Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas,
    interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels
    of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power
    price volatility. NRG derives a majority of its annual revenues
    in the months of May through October, when demand for
    electricity is at its highest in the Company’s core
    domestic markets. Further, power price volatility is generally
    higher in the summer months, traditionally NRG’s most
    important season. The Company’s second most important
    season is the winter months of December through March when
    volatility and price spikes in underlying delivered fuel prices
    have tended to drive seasonal electricity prices. The preceding
    factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly
    uniform across the Company’s business segments.

Operations
    Overview

NRG provides support services to the Company’s generation
    facilities to ensure that high-level performance goals are
    developed, best practices are shared and resources are
    appropriately balanced and allocated to maximize results for the
    Company. NRG sets performance goals for equivalent forced outage
    rates, or EFOR, availability, procurement costs, operating
    costs, safety and environmental compliance.

Support services include safety, security, and systems. These
    services also include operations planning and the development
    and dissemination of consistent policies and practices relating
    to plant operations.



To support

Repowering

NRG environmental capital
    expenditures and all major capital expenditure projects
    initiatives, the Company organized its project execution process
    into one centralized group consisting of Engineering,
    Procurement and Construction, or EPC. This group combines
    regional engineering functions with development project
    engineering, project management, procurement and construction
    functions to provide a consistent approach to the major capital
    projects. This has enabled NRG to leverage both the procurement
    of major equipment as well as outside engineering resources
    through standardized work processes and work packaging. This
    process has led to identifying commonality in major equipment
    that can be procured from Original Equipment Manufacturers, or
    OEMs, as well as design processes. As a result, NRG achieves
    cost savings by minimizing the number of outside engineering and
    construction resources, which provide detailed design and
    construction services required to complete projects, in addition
    to and by ensuring a consistent engineering and construction
    approach across all projects.

FOR

NRG
    Update

In 2007, the Company announced the acceleration and planned
    conclusion of the

FOR

NRG 1.0 program by bringing forward
    the previously announced 2009 target of $250 million to
    2008. Improvements in reliability throughout the baseload fleet
    were the drivers of the year-to-date program performance. In
    2008, the Company achieved $259 million of implemented

FOR

NRG 1.0 improvements which exceeded the established
    $250 million goal. The

FOR

NRG 1.0 program was
    measured from a 2004 baseline, with the exception of the Texas
    region where benefits were measured using 2005 as the base year.

Beginning in January 2009, the Company transitioned to

FOR

NRG 2.0 to target an incremental 100 basis point
    improvement to the Company’s ROIC by 2012. The initial
    targets for

FOR

NRG 2.0 were based upon improvements in
    the Company’s ROIC as measured by increased cash flow. The
    economic goals of

FOR

NRG 2.0 will focus on:
    (i) revenue enhancement, (ii) cost savings, and
    (iii) asset optimization, including reducing excess working
    capital and other assets. The

FOR

NRG 2.0 program will
    measure its progress towards the

FOR

NRG 2.0 goals by
    using the Company’s 2008 financial results as a baseline,
    while plant performance calculations will be based upon the
    average full-year plant key performance indicators for years the

2006-2008.

Environmental
    Capital Expenditures

Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated
    that environmental capital expenditures to be incurred from 2009
    through 2013 to meet NRG’s environmental commitments will
    be approximately $1.2 billion. These capital expenditures,
    in general, are related to installation of particulate,
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury controls to comply with federal and state air
    quality rules and consent orders, as well as installation of
    “Best Technology Available” under the Phase II
    316(b) rule. NRG continues to explore cost effective
    alternatives that can achieve desired results. While this
    estimate reflects schedules and controls to meet anticipated
    reduction requirements, the full impact on the scope and timing
    of environmental retrofits cannot be determined until issuance
    of final rules by the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency, or USEPA.

NRG’s current contracts with the Company’s rural
    electrical customers in the South Central region allow for
    recovery of a significant portion of the capital costs, along
    with a capital return incurred by complying with new laws,
    including interest over the asset life of the required
    expenditures. Actual recoveries will depend, among other things,
    on the duration of the contracts.



Carbon
    Update

There is a marked shift towards federal action to address
    climate change under the Obama administration, which has made
    clear its intention to make climate change policy a priority for
    the US through legislation, regulation, and global leadership.
    President Obama reiterated this commitment in his inaugural
    address. Congressman Waxman, who sees aggressive action on
    climate change as a major priority, was elected chair of the
    House Energy and Commerce Committee and announced that a climate
    change bill would be delivered out of committee before Memorial
    Day.

The fossil-fuel based electric generators contribute to GHG
    emissions. In 2008, in the course of producing approximately
    80 million MWh of electricity, NRG’s power plants
    emitted approximately 68 million tonnes
    of CO


,
    of which approximately 61 million tonnes were emitted in
    the US, approximately 4 million tonnes in Germany, and
    approximately 3 million tonnes in Australia.

The Company has a multifold strategy with respect to climate
    change and related GHG regulation. First, the Company is seeking
    to shape public policy as it emerges at various levels of
    government in order to ensure that such legislation is fair and
    effective in reducing GHG emissions. To ensure such
    effectiveness, NRG believes it is particularly important that
    legislation effectively support the development, demonstration
    and deployment of low and no
    CO


power generation technologies, and that it sets out a
    transitional allocation approach that buffers initial net
    compliance costs while transitioning to a full auction. The
    Company is carrying out its efforts to influence public policy
    on its own and as part of various collective efforts. For
    example in January 2009, NRG joined with other members of the
    United States Climate Action Partnership, or USCAP, to issue the
    “Blueprint for Legislative Action,” a detailed
    framework for legislation to slow, stop and reverse the growth
    of GHG emissions to achieve an 80% reduction from 2005 levels by
    2050.

Second, the Company is actively pursuing investments in new
    generating facilities and technologies that will be highly
    efficient and will employ technologies to minimize
    CO


emissions and other air emissions through its

Repowering

NRG program. The Company anticipates that these
    investments will result in significant long-term GHG intensity
    reductions in its generating portfolio. The most notable of
    these projects in terms of the potential impact on the GHG
    intensity of the Company’s portfolio is the 2,700 MW
    STP units 3 and 4 nuclear project in Texas. NRG has formed
    Nuclear Innovation North America, or NINA, a joint venture with
    the Toshiba American Nuclear Energy Corporation, to facilitate
    the development of STP 3 and 4 as well as additional nuclear
    projects. Further, in 2008, NRG’s subsidiary, Padoma Wind
    Power, LLC, or Padoma, brought 270 MW of wind generating
    capacity on-line in west Texas at two facilities: (i) the
    150 MW Sherbino I Wind Farm LLC, or Sherbino, a 50/50 joint
    venture with a subsidiary of BP Alternative Energy North America
    Inc., or BP, and (ii) the wholly-owned, 120 MW Elbow
    Creek Wind Power LLC facility. The Company is actively
    developing low and no GHG emitting wind, solar, biomass and
    natural gas projects. The extent to which these projects, and
    the remaining coal projects under development, impact the
    Company’s overall climate change exposure will depend on
    the Company’s ability to complete development of these
    projects, the nature and geographic reach of any GHG regulation
    which goes into effect and the extent to which the climate
    change risk associated with our development projects is
    allocated between the Company and any offtakers under power
    purchase agreements or similar arrangements.

Third, the Company is seeking to demonstrate through its econrg
    program the large scale viability of post-combustion
    CO


capture technologies. NRG is exploring a variety of
    technologies, including one or more scaled up demonstrations at
    a Company facility in Texas. The captured
    CO


would be sequestered through use for enhanced oil recovery or
    otherwise in suitable geological formations.

Fourth, the Company is preparing for the commercial operations
    activities which will be required as part of any climate change
    regulatory scheme that is implemented, including managing a
    portfolio of GHG offsets and
    CO


allowances. For example, the Company is a member of the Chicago
    Climate Exchange, a
    CO


emissions reduction, registry and trading system, and has been
    active in both RGGI auctions to date.

Fifth, and finally, the Company has for the past year, and will
    going forward, factor into its capital investment decision
    making process assumptions regarding the costs of complying with
    anticipated climate change regulations. As a result, all
    decisions with respect to acquisitions, repowerings, project
    development and further investment in



our existing facilities will be made on the assumption that
    there will be a cost associated with GHG emissions in the future.

Nuclear
    Innovation North America

In March 2008, NRG formed NINA, an NRG subsidiary focused on
    marketing, siting, developing, financing and investing in new
    advanced design nuclear projects in select markets across North
    America, including the planned STP units 3 and 4 that NRG is
    developing on a 50/50 basis with City of San Antonio’s
    agent City Public Service Board of San Antonio, or CPS
    Energy, at the STP nuclear power station site. NRG’s rights
    to develop STP units 3 and 4 have been contributed to special
    purpose subsidiaries of NINA. NINA will focus only on the
    development of new projects and will not be involved in the
    operations of the existing STP units 1 and 2.

Toshiba American Nuclear Energy Corporation, or TANE, a wholly
    owned subsidiary of Toshiba Corporation, will serve as the prime
    contractor on NINA’s projects and is a minority shareholder
    with NRG in the NINA venture. TANE is currently prime contractor
    of the STP units 3 and 4 project and is providing licensing
    support and leading all engineering and scheduling activities,
    which ultimately will lead to responsibility for constructing
    the project. TANE received a 12% equity ownership in NINA in
    exchange for $300 million invested in NINA in six annual
    installments of $50 million, the first of which was
    received in 2008 and the last three of which are subject to
    certain conditions. Half of this investment will be to fund
    development activities related to STP units 3 and 4. The other
    half will be targeted towards developing and deploying
    additional Advanced Boiling Water Reactor, or ABWR, projects in
    North America with other potential partners. TANE is also
    extending pre-negotiated EPC terms to NINA for two additional

two-unit

nuclear projects similar to the terms being offered for the STP
    unit 3 and 4 development.

NINA intends to use the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC,
    certified ABWR design, with only a limited number of changes to
    enhance safety and construction schedules. On November 30,
    2007, the NRC accepted the Company’s Combined Construction
    and Operating License Application, or COLA, which was filed
    September 24, 2007, together with San Antonio’s
    CPS Energy and South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company, or
    STPNOC, to build and operate two new nuclear units at the STP
    nuclear power station site. On September 30, 2008, NINA
    filed a revision to the COLA to list Toshiba as the primary
    vendor. NINA received the combined license review schedule from
    the NRC on February 11, 2009. Issuing the schedule marks
    the continuation of NRC’s review of the STP expansion
    application as amended on September 2008. The Company expects to
    achieve commercial operation for Unit 3 in 2015 and commercial
    operation for Unit 4 approximately 12 months thereafter.
    The total rated capacity of the new units, STP units 3 and 4, is
    expected to equal or exceed 2,700 MW.

In October 2007, NRG and the City of San Antonio, acting
    through CPS Energy, entered into an interim agreement whereby
    the parties agreed to be equal partners in the development of
    the two new units, and, in the event either party chooses at any
    time not to proceed, gives the other party the right to proceed
    with the project on its own.

Repowering

NRG
    Update

NRG has a comprehensive portfolio redevelopment program,
    referred to as

Repowering

NRG, which involves the
    development, construction and operation of new multi-fuel,
    multi-technology generation capacity at NRG’s existing
    domestic sites to meet the growing demand in the Company’s
    core markets. Through this initiative, the Company anticipates
    retiring certain existing units and adding new generation, with
    an emphasis on new baseload capacity that is expected to be
    supported by long-term PPAs and financed with limited or
    non-recourse project financing. NRG continues to expect that
    these repowering investments will provide one or more of the
    following benefits: improved heat rates; lower delivered costs;
    expanded electricity production capability; an improved ability
    to dispatch economically across the Merit Order; increased
    technological and fuel diversity; and reduced environmental
    impacts. The Company anticipates that the

Repowering

NRG
    program will also result in indirect benefits, including the
    continuation of operations and retention of key personnel at its
    existing facilities.

A critical aspect of the

Repowering

NRG program is the
    extent to which the Company is actively pursuing investments in
    new generating facilities that will be highly efficient and will
    employ no

and/or

low
    carbon technologies to limit
    CO


emissions and other air emissions. The Company anticipates that
    these investments will result in long-term GHG intensity
    reductions in its generating portfolio.



The Company expects that the overall capital expenditures in
    connection with the program will be substantial. The Company
    plans to mitigate the capital cost of the program through equity
    partnerships and public-private partnerships, as well as through
    the reimbursement of development fees for certain projects. To
    further mitigate the investment risks, NRG anticipates entering
    into long-term PPAs and EPC contracts. In addition, the proposed
    increase in generation capacity and capital costs resulting from

Repowering

NRG could change as proposed projects are
    included or removed from the program due to a number of factors,
    including successfully obtaining required permits, long-term
    PPAs, availability of financing on favorable terms, and
    achieving targeted project returns. The projects that have been
    identified as part of the

Repowering

NRG program are also
    subject to change as NRG refines the program to take into
    account the success rate for completion of projects, changes in
    the targeted minimum return thresholds, and evolving market
    dynamics.

Currently, NRG has various projects in certain stages of
    development that includes a new biomass project at Montville
    Generating Station and the repowering of Big Cajun I and El
    Segundo sites. As a result of permitting delays related to the
    on-going Natural Resource Defense Council claims, the El Segundo
    project is unlikely to reach its original completion date of
    June 1, 2011.

The following is a summary of repowering projects that have
    either been completed or are under construction. In addition,
    NRG continues to participate in active bids in response to
    requests for proposals in markets in which it operates,
    particularly in the West and Northeast regions.

Plants
    Completed and Operating

Cos Cob

— On June 26, 2008, NRG
    announced the completion of the repowering of its Cos Cob
    generating station in Fairfield County, Connecticut which added
    40 MW of power to the site. The Company funded and
    developed this project which added two new gas turbine units,
    between the existing three units, bringing total site output to
    100 MW. All five units were retrofitted to use water
    injection technology for NOx, resulting in a 50% net station
    reduction in
    NO

x

.
    The site also converted to burn ultra-low sulfur distillated oil
    resulting in a 97% reduction in
    SO


emissions.

Sherbino Wind Farm

— On October 22,
    2008, NRG and its 50/50 joint venture partner, BP, announced the
    completion of its Sherbino project in Pecos County, Texas. The
    wind farm was developed by NRG’s subsidiary Padoma together
    with BP. Padoma managed the construction, which began in late
    2007. BP will operate and dispatch the facility. Sherbino is a
    150 MW wind farm consisting of 50 Vestas wind turbine
    generators, each capable of generating up to 3 MW of power.
    Since NRG has a 50 percent ownership, Sherbino will provide
    the Company a net capacity of 75 MW.

Elbow Creek Wind Farm

— On
    December 29, 2008, NRG, through Padoma, announced the
    completion of its Elbow Creek project, a wholly-owned
    120 MW wind farm in Howard County near Big Spring, Texas.
    The Company funded and developed this wind farm which consists
    of 53 Siemens wind turbine generators, each capable of
    generating up to 2.3 MW of power.

Cedar Bayou Generating Station

— In
    August 2007, NRG Cedar Bayou Development Company LLC, or NRG
    Cedar Bayou, a subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc., and EnergyCo
    Cedar Bayou 4, LLC, or EnergyCo Cedar Bayou, a subsidiary of
    Optim Energy, LLC, formally EnergyCo, LLC, which is a joint
    venture between PNM Resources Inc. and a subsidiary of Cascade
    Investment, LLC, agreed to jointly develop, construct, operate
    and own, on a 50/50 undivided interest basis, a new 550 MW
    combined cycle natural gas turbine generating plant at
    NRG’s Cedar Bayou Generating Station in Chambers County,
    Texas. On July 26, 2007, the Texas Commission on
    Environmental Air Quality, or TCEQ, granted an air permit
    required for construction and operation of the new plant, and on
    August 1, 2007, NRG Cedar Bayou and EnergyCo Cedar Bayou
    entered into an EPC agreement with Zachry Construction
    Corporation. NRG provides construction management services and
    will also provide various ongoing services related to plant
    operations and maintenance, and use of existing NRG facilities
    in return for a fixed fee plus reimbursement of the
    Company’s costs. NRG will also provide plant operations and
    maintenance services and access to certain existing
    infrastructure at the site on a cost reimbursement basis plus a
    fixed fee. The construction of the project is on schedule and
    the plant is expected to begin commercial operations in mid-2009.



GenConn Energy LLC

— In a procurement
    process conducted by the Department of Public Utility Control,
    or DPUC, and finalized in 2008, GenConn Energy LLC, or GenConn,
    a 50/50 joint venture of NRG and The United Illuminating
    Company, secured contracts in 2008 with Connecticut
    Light & Power, or CL&P, for the construction and
    operation of two 200 MW peaking facilities, at NRG’s
    Devon and Middletown sites in Connecticut. The contracts, which
    are structured as contracts for differences for the full output
    of the new power plants, have a

30-year

term
    and call for commercial operation of the Devon project by
    June 1, 2010 and the Middletown project by June 1,
    2011. GenConn has secured all state permits required for the
    projects and has entered into contracts for engineering and for
    the procurement of the 8 GE LM6000 combustion turbines required
    for the projects. GenConn expects to close on financing for the
    projects in the first half of 2009.

Regional
    Business Descriptions

NRG is organized into business units, with each of the
    Company’s core regions operating as a separate business
    segment as discussed below.

TEXAS

NRG’s largest business segment is located in Texas and is
    comprised of investments in generation facilities located in the
    physical control areas of the ERCOT market. These assets were
    acquired on February 2, 2006, as part of the acquisition of
    Texas Genco LLC, or Texas Genco.

Operating
    Strategy

The Company’s business in Texas is comprised of four sets
    of assets: a nuclear plant, solid-fuel baseload plants,
    gas-fired plants located in and around Houston, and wind farms.
    NRG’s operating strategy to maximize value and opportunity
    across these assets is to (i) ensure the availability of
    the baseload plants to fulfill their commercial obligations
    under long-term forward sales contracts already in place,
    (ii) manage the natural gas assets for profitability while
    ensuring the reliability and flexibility of power supply to the
    Houston market, (iii) take advantage of the skill sets and
    market or regulatory knowledge to grow the business through
    incremental capacity uprates and repowering development of
    solid-fuel baseload and gas-fired units, and (iv) play a
    leading role in the development of the ERCOT market by active
    membership and participation in market and regulatory issues.

NRG’s strategy is to sell forward a majority of its
    solid-fuel baseload capacity in the ERCOT market under long-term
    contracts or to enter into hedges by using natural gas as a
    proxy for power prices. Accordingly, the Company’s primary
    focus will be to keep these solid-fuel baseload units running
    efficiently. With respect to gas-fired assets, NRG will continue
    contracting forward a significant portion of gas-fired capacity
    one to two years out while holding a portion for

back-up

in
    case there is an operational issue with one of the baseload
    units and to provide upside for expanding heat rates. For the
    gas-fired capacity sold forward, the Company will offer a range
    of products specific to customers needs. For the gas-fired
    capacity that NRG will continue to sell commercially into the
    market, the Company will focus on making this capacity available
    to the market whenever it is economical to run.

The following is a description of NRG’s most significant
    revenue generating plants in the Texas region:

W.A. Parish —

NRG’s W.A. Parish plant is
    one of the largest fossil-fired plants in the US based on total
    MWs of generation capacity. This plant’s power generation
    units include four coal-fired steam generation units with an
    aggregate generation capacity of 2,475 MW as of
    December 31, 2008. Two of these units are 645 MW and
    650 MW steam units that were placed in commercial service
    in December 1977 and December 1978, respectively. The other two
    units are 570 MW and 610 MW steam units that were
    placed in commercial service in June 1980 and December 1982,
    respectively. Each of the four coal-fired units have
    low-NO

x

burners and Selective Catalytic Reductions, or SCRs, installed
    to reduce
    NO

x

emissions and baghouses to reduce particulates. In addition,
    W.A. Parish Unit 8 has a scrubber installed to reduce
    SO


emissions.

Limestone

— NRG’s Limestone plant is a
    lignite and coal-fired plant located approximately
    140 miles northwest of Houston. This plant includes two
    steam generation units with an aggregate generation capacity of
    1,690 MW as of December 31, 2008. The first unit is an
    830 MW steam unit that was placed in commercial service in
    December 1985. The second unit is an 860 MW steam unit that
    was placed in commercial service in December 1986. Limestone
    burns lignite from an adjacent mine, but also burns low sulfur
    coal and petroleum coke. This serves to lower average fuel costs
    by eliminating fuel transportation costs, which can represent up
    to two-thirds of



delivered fuel costs for plants of this type. Both units have
    installed
    low-NO

x

burners to reduce
    NO

x

emissions and scrubbers to reduce
    SO


emissions.

NRG owns the mining equipment and facilities and a portion of
    the lignite reserves located at the adjacent mine. Mining
    operations are conducted by Texas Westmoreland Coal Co., a
    single purpose, wholly-owned subsidiary of Westmoreland Coal
    Company and the owner of a substantial portion of the remaining
    lignite reserves. The contract, entered into August 1999, ended
    on December 31, 2007. Effective January 1, 2008, NRG
    entered into an agreement with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co. to
    continue to supply lignite from the same surface mine adjacent
    to the facility for a nominal term of ten years with an option
    for future year supply purchases. This is a
    “cost-plus” arrangement under which NRG will pay all
    of Westmoreland’s agreed upon production costs, capital
    expenditures, and a per ton mark up. The annual volume demand is
    determined by NRG. The agreement ensures lignite supply to NRG
    and confirms NRG’s responsibility for the final reclamation
    at the mine.

South Texas Project Electric Generating Station —

STP is one of the newest and largest nuclear-powered
    generation plants in the US based on total megawatts of
    generation capacity. This plant is located approximately
    90 miles south of downtown Houston, near Bay City, Texas
    and consists of two generation units each representing
    approximately 1,335 MW of generation capacity. STP’s
    two generation units commenced operations in August 1988 and
    June 1989, respectively. For the year ended December 31,
    2008, STP had a zero percent forced outage rate and a 98% net
    capacity factor.

STP is currently owned as a tenancy in common between NRG and
    two other co-owners. NRG owns a 44%, or approximately
    1,175 MW, interest in STP, the City of San Antonio
    owns a 40% interest and the City of Austin owns the remaining
    16% interest. Each co-owner retains its undivided ownership
    interest in the two nuclear-fueled generation units and the
    electrical output from those units. Except for certain plant
    shutdown and decommissioning costs and NRC licensing
    liabilities, NRG is severally liable, but not jointly liable,
    for the expenses and liabilities of STP. The four original
    co-owners of STP organized STPNOC to operate and maintain STP.
    STPNOC is managed by a board of directors composed of one
    director appointed by each of the three co-owners, along with
    the chief executive officer of STPNOC. STPNOC is the
    NRC-licensed operator of STP. No single owner controls STPNOC
    and most significant commercial as well as asset investment
    decisions for the existing units must be approved by two or more
    owners who collectively control more than 60% of the interests.

The two STP generation units operate under licenses granted by
    the NRC that expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively. These
    licenses may be extended for additional

20-year

terms if the project satisfies NRC requirements. Adequate
    provisions exist for long-term

on-site

storage of spent nuclear fuel throughout the remaining life of
    the existing STP plant licenses.

Market
    Framework

The ERCOT market is one of the nation’s largest and
    historically fastest growing power markets. It represents
    approximately 85% of the demand for power in Texas and covers
    the entire state, with the exception of the far west
    (El Paso), a large part of the Texas Panhandle and two
    small areas in the eastern part of the state. For the past ten
    years, peak hourly demand in the ERCOT market grew at a compound
    annual rate of 2.2%, compared to a compound annual rate of
    growth of 1.9% in the US for the same period. For 2008, hourly
    demand ranged from a low of 19,665 MW to a high of
    62,190 MW. The ERCOT market has limited interconnections
    compared to other markets in the US — currently
    limited to 1,106 MW of generation capacity, and wholesale
    transactions within the ERCOT market are not subject to
    regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC.
    Any wholesale producer of power that qualifies as a power
    generation company under the Texas electric restructuring law
    and that accesses the ERCOT electric power grid is allowed to
    sell power in the ERCOT market at unregulated rates.

The ERCOT market has experienced significant construction of new
    generation plants, with over 36,000 MW of new generation
    capacity added to the market since 1999. As of December 31,
    2008, installed generation capacity of approximately
    83,000 MW existed in the ERCOT market, including
    5,000 MW of generation that has suspended operations, or
    been “mothballed”. Natural gas-fired generation
    represents approximately 53,000 MW, or 64%. Approximately
    22,400 MW, or 27%, was lower marginal cost generation
    capacity such as coal, lignite and nuclear plants. NRG’s
    coal and nuclear fuel baseload plants represent approximately
    5,340 MW net, or 24%, of the total



solid fuel baseload net generation capacity in the ERCOT market.
    Additionally, NRG commenced commercial operations of the
    Sherbino Wind Farm and Elbow Creek Wind Farm which represents
    approximately 195 MW generation capacity for the Company.
    Both Sherbino and Elbow Creek Wind Farms are located in the
    physical control areas of the ERCOT market.

The ERCOT market has established a target equilibrium reserve
    margin level of approximately 12.5%. The reserve margin for 2008
    was 14% forecast to increase to 16% for 2009 per ERCOT’s
    latest Capacity Demand and Reserve Report. There are currently
    plans being considered by the Public Utility Commission of
    Texas, or PUCT, to build a significant amount of transmission
    from west Texas and continuing across the state to enable wind
    generation to reach load. The ultimate impact on the reserve
    margin and wholesale dynamics from these plans are unknown.

In the ERCOT market, buyers and sellers enter into bilateral
    wholesale capacity, power and ancillary services contracts or
    may participate in the centralized ancillary services market,
    including balancing energy, which the ERCOT administers.
    Published in August 2008, the “2007 State of the Market
    Report for the ERCOT Wholesale Electricity Markets” from
    the Independent Market Monitor indicated that natural gas prices
    were the primary driver of the trends in electricity prices from
    2003 to 2007. As a result of NRG’s lower marginal cost for
    baseload coal and nuclear generation assets, the Company expects
    these ERCOT assets to generate power nearly 100% of the time
    they are available.

The ERCOT market is currently divided into four regions or
    congestion zones, namely: North, Houston, South and West, which
    reflect transmission constraints that are commercially
    significant and which have limits as to the amount of power that
    can flow across zones. NRG’s W.A. Parish plant, STP, and
    all its natural gas-fired plants are located in the Houston
    zone. NRG’s Limestone plant is located in the North zone
    while the Sherbino and Elbow Creek wind farms are located in the
    West Zone.

The ERCOT market operates under the reliability standards set by
    the North American Electric Reliability Council. The PUCT has
    primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure the
    adequacy and reliability of power supply across Texas’s
    main interconnected power transmission grid. The ERCOT is
    responsible for facilitating reliable operations of the bulk
    electric power supply system in the ERCOT market. Its
    responsibilities include ensuring that power production and
    delivery are accurately accounted for among the generation
    resources and wholesale buyers and sellers. Unlike power pools
    with independent operators in other regions of the country, the
    ERCOT market is not a centrally dispatched power pool and the
    ERCOT does not procure power on behalf of its members other than
    to maintain the reliable operations of the transmission system.
    The ERCOT also serves as an agent for procuring ancillary
    services for those who elect not to provide their own ancillary
    services.

Power sales or purchases from one location to another may be
    constrained by the power transfer capability between locations.
    Under the current ERCOT protocol, the commercially significant
    constraints and the transfer capabilities along these paths are
    reassessed every year and congestion costs are directly assigned
    to those parties causing the congestion. This has the potential
    to increase power generators’ exposure to the congestion
    costs associated with transferring power between zones.

The PUCT has adopted a rule directing the ERCOT to develop and
    implement a wholesale market design that, among other things,
    includes a day-ahead energy market and replaces the existing
    zonal wholesale market design with a nodal market design that is
    based on locational marginal prices for power. See also

Regional Regulatory Developments — Texas Region.

One of the stated purposes of the proposed market
    restructuring is to reduce local (intra-zonal) transmission
    congestion costs. The market redesign project is now proposed to
    take effect in December 2010. NRG expects that implementation of
    any new market design will require modifications to its existing
    procedures and systems. Although NRG does not expect the
    Company’s competitive position in the ERCOT market to be
    materially adversely affected by the proposed market
    restructuring, the Company does not know for certain how the
    planned market restructuring will affect its revenues, and some
    of NRG’s plants in the ERCOT may experience adverse pricing
    effects due to their location on the transmission grid.



NORTHEAST

NRG’s second largest asset base is located in the Northeast
    region of the US and is comprised of investments in generation
    facilities primarily located in the physical control areas of
    NYISO, the ISO-NE and PJM.

Operating
    Strategy

The Northeast region’s strategy is focused on optimizing
    the value of NRG’s broad and varied generation portfolio in
    the three interconnected and actively traded competitive
    markets: the NYISO, the ISO-NE and the PJM. In the Northeast
    markets, load-serving entities generally lack their own
    generation capacity, with much of the generation base aging and
    the current ownership of the generation highly disaggregated.
    Thus, commodity prices are more volatile on an as-delivered
    basis than in other NRG regions due to the distance and
    occasional physical constraints that impact the delivery of fuel
    into the region. In this environment, NRG seeks both to enhance
    its ability to be the low cost wholesale generator capable of
    delivering wholesale power to load centers within the region
    from multiple locations using multiple fuel sources, and to be
    properly compensated for delivering such wholesale power and
    related services.

The generation performance by fuel-type for the recent
    three-year period is as shown below:

NRG’s Northeast region assets are located in or near load
    centers and inside chronic transmission constraints such as New
    York City, southwestern Connecticut and the Delmarva Peninsula.
    Assets in these areas tend to attract higher capacity revenues
    and higher energy revenues and thus present opportunities for
    repowering these sites. The Company has benefited from the
    introduction of capacity market reforms in both the New England
    Power Pool, or NEPOOL, and PJM. The Locational Forward Reserve
    Markets, or LFRM, in the NEPOOL, became effective
    October 1, 2006, and the transition capacity payments were
    effective December 1, 2006. In all five LFRM auctions to
    date, the market has cleared at the administratively set price
    of $14/kw month reflecting the shortage of peaking generation
    especially in the Connecticut zone. The LFRM and interim
    capacity payments serve as a prelude to the full implementation
    of the Forward Capacity Market, or FCM, which begins
    June 1, 2010. PJM’s Reliability Pricing Model, or RPM,
    became effective June 1, 2007, and the Company has
    participated in auctions providing capacity price certainty
    through May 2012.

RMR Agreements

— Several of the Northeast
    region’s Connecticut assets are located in

transmission-constrained

load pockets and have been designated as required to be
    available to ISO-NE to ensure reliability. These assets are
    subject to Reliability-Must-Run, or RMR, agreements, which are
    contracts under which NRG agrees to maintain its facilities to
    be available to run when needed, and are paid to provide these
    capability services based on the Company’s costs. During
    2008, Middletown, Montville and Norwalk Power (units 1 and
    2) were covered by RMR agreements. Unless terminated
    earlier, these agreements will terminate on June 1, 2010,
    which coincides with the commencement of the FCM in NEPOOL.

Generation
    Facilities

As of December 31, 2008, NRG’s generation facilities
    in the Northeast region consisted of approximately 7,020 MW
    of generation capacity, including assets located in transmission
    constrained areas, such as New York City —
    1,415 MW, and Southwest Connecticut — 575 MW.

Somerset had previously entered
    into an agreement with the Massachusetts Department of
    Environmental Protection, or MADEP, to retire or repower the
    remaining coal-fired unit at Somerset by the end of 2009. In
    connection with a repowering proposal approved by the MADEP, the
    date for the shut-down of the unit was extended to
    September 30, 2010.

The following is a description of NRG’s most significant
    revenue generating plants in the Northeast region:

Arthur Kill

— NRG’s Arthur Kill plant is a
    natural gas-fired power plant consisting of three units and is
    located on the west side of Staten Island, New York. The plant
    produces an aggregate generation capacity of 865 MW from
    two intermediate load units (Units 20 and 30) and one peak
    load unit (Unit GT-1). Unit 20 produces an aggregate generation
    capacity of 350 MW and was installed in 1959. Unit 30
    produces an aggregate generation capacity of 505 MW and was
    installed in 1969. Both Unit 20 and Unit 30 were converted from
    coal-fired to natural gas-fired facilities in the early 1990s.
    Unit GT-1 produces an aggregate generation capacity of
    10 MW and is activated when Consolidated Edison issues a
    maximum generation alarm on hot days and during thunderstorms.

Astoria Gas Turbine

— Located in Astoria,
    Queens, New York, the NRG Astoria Gas Turbine facility occupies
    approximately 15 acres within the greater Astoria
    Generating complex which includes several competing generating
    facilities. NRG’s Astoria Gas Turbine facility has an
    aggregate generation capacity of approximately 550 MW from
    19 operational combustion turbine generators classified into
    three types of turbines. The first group consists of 12
    gas-fired Pratt & Whitney GG-4 Twin Packs in Buildings
    2, 3 and 4, which have a net generation capacity of 145 MW
    per building. The second group consists of Westinghouse
    Industrial Combustion Turbines #191A in Buildings 5, 7 and
    8 that fire on liquid distillate with a net generation capacity
    of approximately 12 MW per building. The third group
    consists of Westinghouse Industrial Gas Turbines #251GG
    located in Buildings 10, 11, 12 and 13 and fired on liquid
    distillate with a net generation capacity of 20 MW per
    building. The Astoria units also supply Black Start Service to
    the NYISO. The site also contains tankage for distillate fuel
    with a capacity of 86,000 barrels.

Dunkirk

— The Dunkirk plant is a coal-fired
    plant located on Lake Erie in Dunkirk, New York. This plant
    produces an aggregate generation capacity of 530 MW from
    four baseload units. Units 1 and 2 produce up to 75 MW each
    and were put in service in 1950, and Units 3 and 4 produce
    approximately 190 MW each and were put in service in 1959
    and 1960, respectively. In a settlement agreement reached with
    the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, or
    NYSDEC, in January 2005, NRG committed to reducing
    SO


emissions from



Dunkirk and Huntley stations by 86.8% below baseline emissions
    of 107,144 by 2013 and
    NO

x

emissions by 80.9% below baseline emission of 17,005 by 2012. In
    order to comply with the NYSDEC settlement agreement, as well as
    with various federal and state emissions standards, the Company
    is in the process of installing back-end control facilities at
    Dunkirk that are anticipated to be completed in the fall 2009.

Huntley

— The Huntley plant is a coal-fired
    plant consisting of six units and is located in Tonawanda,
    New York, approximately three miles north of Buffalo. The
    plant has a net generation capacity of 380 MW from two
    baseload units (Units 67 and 68). Units 67 and 68 generate a net
    capacity of approximately 190 MW each, and were put in
    service in 1957 and 1958, respectively. Units 63 and 64 are
    inactive and were officially retired in May 2006. To comply with
    the January 2005 NYSDEC settlement agreement referenced above,
    NRG retired Units 65 and 66 effective June 3, 2007, and as
    of January 2009, has completed Huntley’s back-end control
    facilities.

Indian River

— The Indian River Power plant is
    a coal-fired plant located in southern Delaware on a
    1,170 acre site. The plant consists of four coal-fired
    electric steam units (units 1 through 4) and one 15 MW
    combustion turbine, bringing total plant capacity to
    approximately 740 MW. Units 1 and 2 are each 80 MW of
    capacity and were placed in service in 1957 and 1959,
    respectively. Unit 3 is 155 MW of capacity and was placed
    in service in 1970, while Unit 4 is 410 MW of capacity and
    was placed in service in 1980. Units 1, 2, 3 and 4 are equipped
    with selective non-catalytic reduction systems, for the
    reduction of
    NO

x

emissions. All four units are equipped with electrostatic
    precipitators to remove fly ash from the flue gases as well as
    low
    NO

x

burners with over fired air to control
    NO

x

emissions and activated carbon injection systems to control
    mercury. Units 1, 2 and 3 are fueled with eastern bituminous
    coal, while Unit 4 is fueled with low sulfur compliance coal.
    Pursuant to a consent order dated September 25, 2007,
    between NRG and the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and
    Environmental Control, or DNREC, NRG agreed to operate the units
    in a manner that would limit the emissions of
    NO

x

,
    SO


and mercury. Further, the Company agreed to mothball unit 2 by
    May 1, 2010, and unit 1 by May 1, 2011, and has
    notified PJM of the plan to mothball these units. In the absence
    of the appropriate control technology installed at this
    facility, Units 3 and 4 totaling approximately 565 MW,
    could not operate beyond December 31, 2011, per terms of
    the consent order.

Market
    Framework

Although each of the three Northeast Independent Systems
    Operators, or ISOs, and their respective energy markets are
    functionally, administratively and operationally independent,
    they all follow, to a certain extent, similar market designs.
    Each ISO dispatches power plants to meet system energy and
    reliability needs, and settles physical power deliveries at
    Locational Marginal Prices, or LMPs, which reflect the value of
    energy at a specific location at the specific time it is
    delivered. This value is determined by an ISO-administered
    auction process, which evaluates and selects the least costly
    supplier offers or bids to create a reliable and least-cost
    dispatch. The ISO-sponsored LMP energy markets consist of two
    separate and characteristically distinct settlement time frames.
    The first is a financially firm, day-ahead unit commitment
    market. The second is a financially settled, real-time dispatch
    and balancing market. Prices paid in these LMP energy markets,
    however, are affected by, among other things, market mitigation
    measures, which can result in lower prices associated with
    certain generating units that are mitigated because they are
    deemed to have locational market power.

SOUTH
    CENTRAL

As of December 31, 2008, NRG owned approximately
    2,845 MW of generating capacity in the South Central region
    of the US. The region lacks a regional transmission organization
    or ISO and, therefore, remains a bilateral market, which is not
    able to take advantage of the large scale economic dispatch of
    an ISO-administered energy market. NRG operates the LaGen
    Control Area which encompasses the generating facilities and the
    Company’s cooperative load. As a result, the LaGen control
    area is capable of providing control area services, in addition
    to



wholesale power, that allows NRG to provide full requirement
    services to load-serving entities, thus making the LaGen Control
    Area a competitive alternative to the integrated utilities
    operating in the region.

Operating
    Strategy

The South Central region maximizes its strategic position as a
    significant coal-fired generator in a market that is highly
    dependent on natural gas for power generation. South Central
    also has long-term full service contracts with eleven rural
    cooperatives serving load across Louisiana and makes incremental
    wholesale energy sales when its coal-fired capacity exceeds the
    cooperative contract requirements. The South Central region
    works to expand its customer base within and beyond Louisiana
    and works within the confines of the Entergy Transmission System
    to obtain paths for incremental sales as well as secure
    transmission service for long-term sales or expansions.

    New Roads, Louisiana, which is referred to as Big Cajun II, and
    also includes the Sterlington, Rockford, Bayou Cove and Big
    Cajun peaking facilities.

Big Cajun II —

NRG’s Big Cajun II
    plant is a coal-fired, sub-critical baseload plant located along
    the banks of the Mississippi River, near Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
    This plant includes three coal-fired generation units (Units 1,
    2 and 3) with an aggregate generation capacity of
    1,730 MW. The plant uses coal supplied from the Powder
    River Basin and was commissioned between 1981 and 1983. NRG owns
    100% of Units 1 and 2 and a 58% undivided interest in Unit 3 for
    an aggregate owned capacity of 1,490 MW of the plant. All
    three units have been upgraded with advanced low-NOx burners and
    overfire air systems.

Market
    Framework

NRG’s assets in the South Central region are located within
    the franchise territories of vertically integrated utilities,
    primarily Entergy Corp., or Entergy. In the South Central
    region, all power sales and purchases are consummated
    bilaterally between individual counterparties. Transacting
    counterparties are required to procure transmission service from
    the relevant transmission owners at their FERC-approved tariff
    rates.

As of December 31, 2008, NRG had long-term all-requirements
    contracts with eleven Louisiana distribution cooperatives with
    initial terms ranging from five to twenty-five years. The South
    Central region has seven contracts in the region that expire in
    2025, with the remaining four contracts expiring between 2009
    and 2014. In addition, NRG also has certain long-term contracts
    with the Municipal Energy Authority of Mississippi, South
    Mississippi Electric Power Association, Southwestern Electric
    Power Company and CLECO, which collectively comprised an
    additional 10% of the region’s contract load requirement.

During limited peak demand periods, the load requirements of
    these contract customers exceed the baseload capacity of
    NRG’s coal-fired Big Cajun II plant. During such peak
    demand periods, NRG either employs its owned or leased gas-fired
    assets or purchases power from external sources, frequently at
    higher prices than can be recovered under the Company’s
    contracts. As the load of the region’s customers grows and
    until certain of these load obligations expire, the Company can
    expect this imbalance to worsen, unless NRG is successful in
    renegotiating the terms of these long-term contracts or
    purchasing other low-cost generation to meet demand. NRG has to
    date successfully prevented the addition of large industrial or
    municipal loads at below-market contract rates. Also, to
    minimize this risk during the peak summer and winter seasons,
    the Company has been successful in entering into structured
    agreements to reduce or eliminate the need for spot market
    purchases.

WEST

NRG’s portfolio in the West region currently consists of
    the Long Beach Generating Station, the El Segundo Generating
    Station, the Encina Generating Station and Cabrillo II, which
    consists of 12 combustion turbines located in San Diego
    County. In addition, NRG owns a 50% interest in the Saguaro
    power plant located in Nevada.

Operating
    Strategy

NRG’s West region strategy is focused on maximizing the
    cash flow and value associated with its generating plants and
    the development of repowering projects that leverage off of
    existing assets and sites, as well as the preservation and
    ultimate realization of the commercial value of the underlying
    real estate. There are three principal components to this
    strategy: (1) capturing the value of the portfolio’s
    generation assets through a combination of forward contracts and
    market sales of capacity, energy, and ancillary services;
    (2) leveraging existing site control and emission
    allowances to permit new, more efficient generating units at
    existing sites; and (3) optimizing the value of the
    region’s coastal property for other purposes.

The Company’s Encina Generating Station has sold all energy
    and capacity, 965 MW, in the aggregate, to a load-serving
    entity through 2009, on a tolling basis, and recovers its
    operating costs plus a capacity payment. The tolling agreement
    includes the sale of station’s Resource Adequacy, or RA,
    capacity and consequently the RMR contract with the CAISO on the
    Encina units was terminated effective December 31, 2007.
    For calendar year 2008, the El Segundo station has entered into
    a combination of tolling and RA contracts with multiple
    load-serving entities and power marketers. The RA contacts
    covered 387 MW of the available 670 MW and the tolls
    covered 670 MWs during all available months. For calendar
    year 2009, El Segundo station entered into approximately
    548 MWs RA contracts and is placing the capacity in the
    market through a portfolio of forward contracts.
    Cabrillo II sold 28 MW of RA capacity for calendar
    year 2008, 188 MW of RA capacity for calendar year 2009,
    and for the



period January 1, 2010 through November 30, 2013,
    88 MW. The Cabrillo II RMR agreement was terminated on
    December 31 2008. Units with RA contracts also sell into energy
    and ancillary services markets consistent with unit availability.

The Saguaro power plant is located in Henderson, Nevada, and is
    contracted to Nevada Power and two steam hosts. The Saguaro
    plant is contracted to Nevada Power through 2022, one steam
    host, referred to as Olin (formerly known as Pioneer), whose
    contract was extended in 2007 for an additional two years, and a
    steam off-taker, Ocean Spray, whose contract runs through 2015.
    Saguaro Power Company, LP, the project company, procures fuel in
    the open market. NRG manages its share of any fuel price risk
    through NRG’s commodity price risk strategy.

The following are descriptions of the Company’s most
    significant revenue generating plants in the West region:

Encina —

The Encina Station is located in
    Carlsbad, California and has a combined generating capacity of
    965 MW from five fossil-fuel steam-electric generating
    units and one combustion turbine. The five fossil-fuel
    steam-electric units provide intermediate load services and use
    natural gas. Also located at the Encina Station is a combustion
    turbine that provides peaking and black-start services of
    15 MW. Units 1, 2 and 3 each have a generation capacity of
    approximately 107 MW and were installed in 1954, 1956 and
    1958, respectively. Units 4 and 5 have a generation capacity of
    approximately 300 MW and 330 MW respectively, and were
    installed in 1973 and 1978. The combustion turbine was installed
    in 1966. Low NOx burner modifications and SCR equipment have
    been installed on all the steam units.

El Segundo —

The El Segundo plant is located in
    El Segundo, California and produces an aggregate generation
    capacity of 670 MW from two gas-fired intermediate load
    units (Units 3 and 4). These units, which have a generation
    capacity of 335 MW each, were installed in 1964 and 1965,
    respectively. SCR equipment has been installed on Units 3 and 4.

Long Beach —

On August 1, 2007, the
    Company successfully completed and commissioned the repowering
    of 260 MW of gas-fired generating capacity at its Long
    Beach Generating Station. Generation from Long Beach provides
    needed support for the summer peak and during transmission
    contingencies to load serving entities and the California
    Independent System Operator. This project is backed by a

10-year

PPA
    executed with SCE in November 2006 and effective through
    July 31, 2017. The new generation consists of refurbished
    gas turbines with SCR equipment.

Cabrillo II —

Cabrillo II consists of 12
    combustion turbines located on 4 sites throughout San Diego
    County with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately
    190 MW. The combustion turbines were installed between 1968
    and 1972 and are operated under a license agreement with
    SDG&E through 2013. The combustion turbines provide peaking
    services and serve a reliability function for the CAISO.



Market
    Framework

Except for the Saguaro facility, NRG’s generation assets in
    the West region operate within the balancing authority of CAISO.
    CAISO’s current market allows NRG’s CAISO assets to
    serve multiple load serving entities, or LSEs, and operates a
    zonal balancing market and congestion clearing mechanism. CAISO
    also has a locational capacity requirement, which requires LSEs
    to procure a significant portion of load from defined local
    reliability areas. All of NRG’s CAISO assets are in the Los
    Angeles or San Diego local reliability areas. It is
    expected that on April 1, 2009, CAISO’s new market,
    known as Market Redesign and Technology Upgrade, or MRTU, will
    become operational. MRTU will establish a day-ahead market for
    energy and ancillary services and will settle prices
    locationally. NRG’s CAISO assets are all peaking and
    intermediate in nature and are well positioned to capitalize on
    the higher locational prices that may result from LMPs in
    location constrained areas and will continue to satisfy local
    distribution company capacity requirements. Longer term,
    NRG’s California portfolio’s locational advantage may
    be impacted by new transmission, which may affect load pocket
    procurement requirements. So far, however, the impacts of
    increasing demand and need for flexible cycling capability
    combined with delays in the online date of new transmission have
    muted the impact of this long-term threat.

California’s resource mix will be significantly shaped in
    the years ahead by California’s renewable portfolio
    standard and its greenhouse gas reduction rules promulgated
    pursuant to Assembly Bill 32 — California Global
    Warming Solutions Act of 2006, or AB32. In particular, the
    state’s renewable portfolio standard is currently targeted
    at 20% for 2010 and has been set for 33% by 2020 via Executive
    Order. While the target requires ratification via legislation,
    the goal has been widely supported and is expected to create
    greater demand for low emission resources. The intermittent and
    remote nature of most renewable resources will still leave a
    strong demand for flexible load pocket resources. NRG’s
    California portfolio may also be impacted by any mechanism, such
    as cap-and-trade, that places a price on incremental carbon
    emissions. NRG’s expectation is that the emission costs
    will be reflected in the market price of power and that the net
    cost to our existing portfolio of intermediate and peaking
    resources will be manageable.

California’s investor-owned utilities are sponsoring
    competitive solicitations for new fossil and renewable
    generating capacity. NRG has submitted offers for new generation
    capacity to be constructed at the El Segundo and Encina sites.
    The new projects are in the process of obtaining necessary
    permits by the California Energy Commission and their respective
    regional air districts, and are supported by air emissions
    credits that have been banked after the retirement of older
    generating units. While neither project will be constructed
    without a long-term off-take agreement with a credit worthy
    counter-party, both projects have cost and location advantages
    that enhance their competitive prospects.

INTERNATIONAL

As of December 31, 2008, NRG, through certain foreign
    subsidiaries, had investments in power generation projects
    located in Australia and Germany with approximately
    1,080 MW of generation capacity. In addition, NRG owns
    interests in coal mines located in Germany. The Company’s
    strategy is to maximize its return on investment and concentrate
    on contract management; monitoring of its facility operators to
    ensure safe, profitable and sustainable operations; management
    of cash flow and finances; and growth of its businesses through
    investments in projects related to current businesses.

Australia

— The Gladstone power station is
    owned by an unincorporated joint venture. As a member of the
    venture, the Company owns an undivided 37.5% interest in assets
    of the power station and a 37.5% interest in its output. A
    wholly owned subsidiary, NRG Gladstone Operating Services,
    serves as the station’s sole operator. Because NRG is
    neither the majority owner nor the joint venture manager, NRG
    does not have unilateral control over the operation,
    maintenance, and management of this asset. Gladstone
    station’s output is fully contracted through 2029 to Boyne
    Smelter Limited and Stanwell Corporation Limited. Boyne Smelter
    is owned by a consortium whose members include all the members
    of the Gladstone joint venture other than NRG. Its business is
    to refine alumina into aluminum. Stanwell is a state owned
    corporation that generates power, purchases power from other
    generators such as Gladstone, trades power in the Australian
    National Electricity Market, and delivers power to retail
    customers.

On June 8, 2006, NRG announced the sale of the
    Company’s 37.5% interest in the joint venture and its 100%
    interest in NRG Gladstone Operating Services to Transfield
    Services Infrastructure B.V, or Transfield Services, of
    Australia. On October 9, 2008, Transfield Services
    terminated the Gladstone sale and purchase agreement at no cost
    or expense to the parties, other than transaction costs which
    are immaterial as to NRG, because of its inability to achieve
    necessary third party consents. Subsequent negotiations over a
    plan to reorganize the Gladstone project to facilitate
    NRG’s exit stalled due to a precipitous decline in aluminum
    prices and asset prices in the second half of 2008. With
    aluminum demand predicted by some to show little or no growth in
    2009 and asset prices showing no signs of recovery, NRG’s
    stay in Australia may be extended. Fortunately, the long term
    off-take agreements will insulate the Gladstone project from the
    effects of the recession. The Company will aggressively pursue
    other options to preserve, protect and enhance the value of this
    investment.

Germany —

NRG’s interests in Germany
    include a 50% equity interest in Mitteldeutsche
    Braunkohlengesellschaft mbH, or MIBRAG, which mines
    approximately 19 million metric tonnes of lignite per year
    and owns 150 MW of electric generation capacity, and a
    41.9% interest in Schkopau, a 900 MW generating plant
    fueled with lignite from MIBRAG. NRG does not have direct
    operational control of either of these facilities.

Approximately 82% of MIBRAG’s revenues is generated from
    lignite sales. MIBRAG’s generation capacity comprises three
    plants, 33% of their output is used to power MIBRAG’s
    mining operations and the balance is sold, either under a
    contract or at spot, primarily to EnviaM, the local distribution
    utility. NRG, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Saale Energie
    GmbH, or SEG, owns 400 MW of the Schkopau plant’s
    electric capacity which is sold under a long-term contract to
    Vattenfall Europe Generation, AG.

Brazil

— On April 28, 2008, NRG completed
    the sale of its 100% interest in Tosli Acquisition B.V., or
    Tosli, which held all NRG’s 99.2% voting equity interest in
    a 156 MW hydroelectric power plant through Itiquira
    Energetica S.A., or ITISA, to Brookfield Renewable Power Inc.
    (previously Brookfield Power Inc.), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Brookfield Asset Management Inc. In addition, the purchase price
    adjustment contingency under the sale agreement was resolved on
    August 7, 2008. In connection with the sale, NRG received
    $300 million of cash proceeds from Brookfield, and removed
    $163 million of assets, including $59 million of cash,
    $122 million of liabilities, including $63 million of
    debt, and $15 million in foreign currency translation
    adjustment from its 2008 consolidated balance sheet. As
    discussed in Item 15 — Note 3,

Discontinued Operations Business Acquisitions and
    Dispositions

, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
    activities of Tosli and ITISA has been classified as
    discontinued operations.

THERMAL

Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NRG Thermal LLC, or NRG
    Thermal, the Company owns thermal and chilled water businesses
    that have a steam and chilled water capacity of approximately
    1,020 megawatts thermal equivalent, or MWt. As of
    December 31, 2008, NRG Thermal provided steam heating to
    approximately 505 customers and chilled water to 100
    customers in five cities in the US. The Company’s thermal
    businesses in Pittsburgh, Harrisburg and San Francisco are
    regulated by their respective state Public Utility Commission.
    The other thermal businesses are subject to contract terms with
    their customers. In addition, NRG Thermal owns and operates a
    thermal project that serves an industrial customer with
    high-pressure steam. NRG Thermal also owns an 88 MW
    combustion turbine peaking generation facility and a 15 MW
    coal-fired cogeneration facility in Dover,



Delaware as well as a 12 MW gas-fired project in
    Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Approximately 39% of NRG
    Thermal’s revenues are derived from its district heating
    and chilled water business in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Regulatory
    Matters

As operators of power plants and participants in wholesale
    energy markets, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation
    by various federal and state government agencies. These include
    the CFTC, FERC, NRC, PUCT and other public utility commissions
    in certain states where NRG’s generating or thermal assets
    are located. In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules,
    procedures, and protocols of the various ISO markets in which it
    participates. NRG must also comply with the mandatory
    reliability requirements imposed by the North American Electric
    Reliability Corporation, or NERC, and the regional reliability
    councils in the regions where the Company operates.

The operations of, and wholesale electric sales from, NRG’s
    Texas region are not subject to rate regulation by the FERC, as
    they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and
    not in interstate commerce. As discussed below, these operations
    are subject to regulation by PUCT, as well as to regulation by
    the NRC with respect to the Company’s ownership interest in
    STP.

Commodities
    Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC

The CFTC, among other things, has regulatory oversight authority
    over the trading of electricity and gas commodities, including
    financial products and derivatives, under the Commodity Exchange
    Act, or CEA. Specifically, under existing statutory authority,
    CFTC has the authority to commence enforcement actions and seek
    injunctive relief against any person, whenever that person
    appears to be engaged in the communication of false or
    misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market
    information or conditions that affected or tended to affect the
    price of natural gas, a commodity in interstate commerce, or
    actions intended to or attempting to manipulate commodity
    markets. The CFTC also has the authority to seek civil monetary
    penalties, as well as the ability to make referrals to the
    Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, in connection
    with any conduct that violates the CEA. Proposals are pending in
    Congress to expand CFTC oversight of the over-the-counter
    markets and bilateral financial transactions.

Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission

The FERC, among other things, regulates the transmission and the
    wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the
    authority of the Federal Power Act, or FPA. In addition, under
    existing regulations, the FERC determines whether an entity
    owning a generation facility is an Exempt Wholesale Generator,
    or EWG, as defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
    2005, or PUHCA of 2005. The FERC also determines whether a
    generation facility meets the ownership and technical criteria
    of a Qualifying Facility, or QF, under Public Utility Regulatory
    Policies Act of 1978, or PURPA. Each of NRG’s US generating
    facilities has either been determined by the FERC to qualify as
    a QF, or the subsidiary owning the facility has been determined
    to be a EWG.

Federal Power Act —

The FPA gives the FERC
    exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over the wholesale sale of
    electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate
    commerce. Under the FPA, the FERC, with certain exceptions,
    regulates the owners of facilities used for the wholesale sale
    of electricity or transmission in interstate commerce as public
    utilities. The FPA also gives the FERC jurisdiction to review
    certain transactions and numerous other activities of public
    utilities. NRG’s QFs are currently exempt from the
    FERC’s rate regulation under Sections 205 and 206 of
    the FPA to the extent that sales are made pursuant to a state
    regulatory authority’s implementation of PURPA.

Public utilities under the FPA are required to obtain the
    FERC’s acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA,
    of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity.
    All of NRG’s non-QF generating and power marketing
    companies in the US make sales of electricity pursuant to
    market-based rates authorized by the FERC. The FERC’s
    orders that grant NRG’s generating and power marketing
    companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to
    revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently
    determines that NRG can exercise market power, create barriers
    to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In
    addition, NRG’s market-based sales are subject to certain
    market behavior rules and, if any of its generating or power
    marketing companies were deemed to have violated any one of
    those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of
    profits associated



with the violation

and/or

suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority,
    as well as criminal and civil penalties. As a condition to the
    orders granting NRG market-based rate authority, every three
    years NRG is required to file a market update to demonstrate
    that it continues to meet the FERC’s standards with respect
    to generating market power and other criteria used to evaluate
    whether its entities qualify for market-based rates. NRG is also
    required to report to the FERC any material changes in status
    that would reflect a departure from the characteristics that the
    FERC relied upon when granting NRG’s various generating and
    power marketing companies market-based rates. If NRG’s
    generating and power marketing companies were to lose their
    market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to
    obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate
    schedule and could become subject to the accounting,
    record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on
    utilities with cost-based rate schedules.

On June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2008, NRG filed with
    the FERC its updated market power analyses for its Northeast and
    South Central assets, respectively. Such updates are a
    requirement of the Commission’s grant of market-based rate
    authority. The Company’s updates remain pending.

Section 203 of the FPA requires the FERC’s prior
    approval for the transfer of control of assets subject to the
    FERC’s jurisdiction. Section 204 of the FPA gives the
    FERC jurisdiction over a public utility’s issuance of
    securities or assumption of liabilities. However, the FERC
    typically grants blanket approval for future securities
    issuances and the assumption of liabilities to entities with
    market-based rate authority. In the event that one of NRG’s
    generating and power marketing companies were to lose its
    market-based rate authority, such company’s future
    securities issuances or assumption of liabilities could require
    prior approval from the FERC.

In compliance with Section 215 of the Energy Policy Act of
    2005, or EPAct of 2005, the FERC has approved the NERC as the
    national Energy Reliability Organization, or ERO. As the ERO,
    NERC is responsible for the development and enforcement of
    mandatory reliability standards for the wholesale electric power
    system. NRG is responsible for complying with the standards in
    the regions in which it operates. As the ERO, NERC has the
    ability to assess financial penalties for non-compliance. In
    addition to complying with NERC requirements, each NRG entity
    must comply with the requirements of the regional reliability
    council for the region in which it is located.

Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 —

PUHCA of 2005 provides the FERC with certain authority over
    and access to books and records of public utility holding
    companies not otherwise exempt by virtue of their ownership of
    EWGs, QFs, and Foreign Utility Companies, or FUCOs. NRG is a
    public utility holding company, but because all of the
    Company’s generating facilities have QF status or are owned
    through EWGs, it is exempt from the accounting, record
    retention, and reporting requirements of the PUHCA of 2005.

Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act —

PURPA
    was passed in 1978 in large part to promote increased energy
    efficiency and development of independent power producers. PURPA
    created QFs to further both goals, and the FERC is primarily
    charged with administering PURPA as it applies to QFs. As
    discussed above, under current law, some categories of QFs may
    be exempt from regulation under the FPA as public utilities.
    PURPA incentives also initially included a requirement that
    utilities must buy and sell power to QFs. Among other things,
    EPAct of 2005 provides for the elimination of the obligation
    imposed on certain utilities to purchase power from QFs at an
    avoided cost rate under certain conditions. However, the
    purchase obligation is only eliminated if the FERC first finds
    that a QF has non-discriminatory access to wholesale energy
    markets having certain characteristics, including
    nondiscriminatory transmission and interconnection services
    provided by a regional transmission entity in certain
    circumstances. Existing contracts entered into under PURPA are
    not expected to be impacted. NRG currently owns only one QF,
    Saguaro Power Company, a Limited Partnership, which is
    interconnected to and has a contract with Nevada Power Company.
    Nevada Power Company is not located in a region with an ISO
    market.

Nuclear
    Regulatory Commission, or NRC

The NRC is authorized under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
    amended, or the AEA, among other things, to grant licenses for,
    and regulate the operation of, commercial nuclear power
    reactors. As a holder of an ownership interest in STP, NRG is an
    NRC licensee and is subject to NRC regulation. The NRC license
    gives the Company the right to only possess an interest in STP
    but not to operate it. Operating authority under the NRC
    operating license for STP is held by STPNOC. NRC regulation
    involves licensing, inspection, enforcement, testing,
    evaluation, and modification of all aspects of plant design and
    operation including the right to order a plant shutdown,
    technical and



financial qualifications, and decommissioning funding assurance
    in light of NRC safety and environmental requirements. In
    addition, NRC’s written approval is required prior to a
    licensee transferring an interest in its license, either
    directly or indirectly. As a possession-only licensee, i.e.,
    non-operating co-owner, the NRC’s regulation of NRG is
    primarily focused on the Company’s ability to meet its
    financial and decommissioning funding assurance obligations. In
    connection with the NRC license, the Company and its
    subsidiaries have a support agreement to provide up to
    $120 million to support operations at STP.

Decommissioning Trusts

— Upon expiration of the
    operation licenses for the two generating units at STP,
    currently scheduled for 2027 and 2028, the co-owners of STP are
    required under federal law to decontaminate and decommission the
    STP facility. Under NRC regulations, a power reactor licensee
    generally must pre-fund the full amount of its estimated NRC
    decommissioning obligations unless it is a rate-regulated
    utility, or a state or municipal entity that sets its own rates,
    or has the benefit of a state-mandated non-bypassable charge
    available to periodically fund the decommissioning trust such
    that the trust, plus allowable earnings, will equal the
    estimated decommissioning obligations by the time the
    decommissioning is expected to begin.

As a result of the acquisition of Texas Genco, NRG, through its
    44% ownership interest, has become the beneficiary of
    decommissioning trusts that have been established to provide
    funding for decontamination and decommissioning of STP.
    CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, or CenterPoint, and
    American Electric Power, or AEP, collect, through rates or other
    authorized charges to their electric utility customers, amounts
    designated for funding NRG’s portion of the decommissioning
    of the facility. See also Item 15 — Note 6,

Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund,

to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

In the event that the funds from the trusts are ultimately
    determined to be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities,
    the original owners of the Company’s STP interests,
    CenterPoint and AEP, each will be required to collect, through
    their PUCT-authorized non-bypassable rates or other charges to
    customers, additional amounts required to fund NRG’s
    obligations relating to the decommissioning of the facility.
    Following the completion of the decommissioning, if surplus
    funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, those excesses will
    be refunded to the respective rate payers of CenterPoint or AEP,
    or their successors.

Public
    Utility Commission of Texas, or PUCT

NRG’s Texas generation subsidiaries are registered as power
    generation companies with PUCT. The companies within the Texas
    region are also regulated as a Qualified Scheduling Entity. PUCT
    also has jurisdiction over power generation companies with
    regard to their sales in the wholesale markets, the
    implementation of measures to address undue market power or
    price volatility, and the administration of nuclear
    decommissioning trusts. The PUCT exercises its jurisdiction both
    directly, and indirectly, through its oversight of the ERCOT,
    the regional transmission organization. NRG Power Marketing,
    LLC, or PMI, is registered as a power marketer with the PUCT and
    thus is also subject to the jurisdiction of the PUCT with
    respect to its sales in the ERCOT.

Regional
    Regulatory Developments

In New England, New York, the Mid-Atlantic region, the Midwest
    and California, the FERC has approved regional transmission
    organizations, also commonly referred to as ISOs. Most of these
    ISOs administer a wholesale centralized bid-based spot market in
    their regions pursuant to tariffs approved by the FERC and
    associated ISO market rules. These tariffs/market rules dictate
    how the capacity and energy markets operate, how market
    participants may make bilateral sales with one another, and how
    entities with market-based rates are compensated within those
    markets. The ISOs in these regions also control access to and
    the operation of the transmission grid within their regions. In
    Texas, pursuant to a 1999 restructuring statute, the PUCT
    granted similar responsibilities to the ERCOT.

NRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO
    regions. The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power
    markets have in the past imposed, and may in the future continue
    to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms to address
    market power or volatility in these markets. These types of
    price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may adversely
    affect the profitability of NRG’s generation facilities
    that sell capacity and energy into the wholesale power markets.
    In addition, new approaches to the sale of electric power are
    being



implemented, and it is not clear whether they will operate
    effectively or whether they will provide adequate compensation
    to generators over the long-term.

Texas
    Region

The ERCOT has adopted “Texas Nodal Protocols” that
    will revise the wholesale market design to incorporate
    locational marginal pricing (in place of the current ERCOT zonal
    market). Major elements of the Texas Nodal Protocols include the
    continued capability for bilateral contracting of energy and
    ancillary services, a financially binding day-ahead market,
    resource-specific energy and ancillary service bid curves, the
    direct assignment of all congestion rents, nodal energy prices
    for resources, aggregation of nodal to zonal energy prices for
    loads, congestion revenue rights (including pre-assignment for
    public power entities), and pricing safeguards. The PUCT
    approved the Texas Nodal Protocols on April 5, 2006, and
    full implementation of the new market design was scheduled to
    begin in 2008. On May 20, 2008, the ERCOT announced that it
    would delay the implementation of the Texas Nodal Protocols, and
    is now targeting a December 2010 implementation.

In May 2008, the ERCOT real-time energy market experienced
    periods of high prices as a result of limited intervals during
    which two zonal constraints were simultaneously binding, and
    this congestion was irresolvable through the dispatch of
    available resources. In response, the ERCOT enacted revised
    protocols, effective June 9, 2008, for addressing such
    zonal congestion, providing the ERCOT with greater authority to
    manage such congestion through the use of out-of-market
    mechanisms towards the goal of lowering prices. In addition, on
    June 17, 2008, the ERCOT enacted revisions to its price cap
    procedures in order to further dampen the volatility and high
    prices. Thus, it is unlikely that the circumstances contributing
    to the price spikes of May 2008 will be repeated.

On July 17, 2008, as part of its determination of
    Competitive Renewable Energy Zones, or CREZ, the PUCT approved a
    significant transmission expansion plan to provide for the
    delivery of approximately 18,500 MW of energy from the
    western region of Texas, primarily wind generation. The schedule
    for construction of the transmission upgrades (approximately
    2,300 miles of new 345 kV lines and 42 miles of new
    138 kV lines) will be determined in subsequent PUCT proceedings.
    If completed as currently approved, the transmission upgrades
    and associated wind generation could impact wholesale energy and
    ancillary service prices in the ERCOT. The PUCT issued its
    written order on August 15, 2008.

Northeast
    Region

New England —

NRG’s Middletown and
    Montville facilities continue to be operated pursuant to RMR
    agreements that were accepted by the Commission on
    February 1, 2006 (effective January 1, 2006). Unless
    terminated earlier, the Middletown and Montville RMR agreements
    will terminate upon the commencement of the FCM as discussed
    below. NRG’s Norwalk Power facility units 1 and 2 continue
    to be operated pursuant to an RMR agreement that was accepted by
    the Commission on July 16, 2007 (effective June 19,
    2007). On December 4, 2008, Norwalk Power filed a
    Settlement Agreement resolving the RMR agreement eligibility and
    rate issues. The Settlement Agreement provides for an Annual
    Fixed Revenue Requirement of $34 million for 2008 and
    $32 million for 2009, continuing at a rate of
    $32 million per year until FCM is implemented on
    June 1, 2010. The FERC accepted the Settlement Agreement on
    December 30, 2008. In the FCM auction for delivery year
    2010/2011, the Company sought to de-list Norwalk Power’s
    units 1 and 2. ISO-NE declined to accept that de-list bid on the
    grounds these units were needed for reliability. The FERC has
    determined that the units should be compensated at their de-list
    bid of $5.99 per kW-month. The Company did not seek to de-list
    Norwalk Power’s units 1 and 2 in the FCM auction for
    delivery year 2011/2012.

On December 28, 2006, the Attorneys General of the State of
    Connecticut and Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed in the US
    Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, or D.C., Circuit
    an appeal of the FERC orders accepting the settlement of the New
    England capacity market design. The settlement, filed
    March 7, 2006, by a broad group of New England market
    participants, provides for interim capacity transition payments
    for all generators in New England for the period starting
    December 1, 2006 through May 31, 2010, and the
    establishment of a FCM commencing May 31, 2010. On
    June 16, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting the
    settlement, which was reaffirmed on rehearing by order dated
    October 31, 2006. Interim capacity transition payments
    provided for under the FCM settlement commenced December 1,
    2006, as scheduled. The first FCM



auction for the 2010/2011 delivery year was concluded on
    February 6, 2008, and bidding reached the minimum floor
    price of $4.50 per kW-month. A successful appeal by the
    Attorneys General could disturb the settlement and create a
    refund obligation of interim capacity transition payments. Oral
    arguments were held on February 14, 2008.

On October 20, 2008, Northeast Utilities Service Company,
    or NU, the parent company of CL&P filed an application with
    the Connecticut Siting Council for the Greater Springfield
    Reliability component of the New England East-West
    Solution, or NEEWS, transmission project, four distinct projects
    that together represent a significant reinforcement of the 345
    kV transmission system. If constructed, the NEEWS projects will
    increase the import capacity into Connecticut by approximately
    1,100 MW.

New York —

On March 7, 2008, the FERC
    issued an order accepting the NYISO’s proposed market
    reforms to the in-city Installed Capacity, or ICAP, market, with
    only minor modifications. The NYISO proposal retains the
    existing ICAP market structure, but imposes additional market
    power mitigation on the current owners of Consolidated
    Edison’s divested generation units in New York City (which
    include NRG’s Arthur Kill and Astoria facilities), who are
    deemed to be pivotal suppliers. Specifically, the NYISO proposal
    imposes a new reference price on pivotal suppliers and requires
    bids to be submitted at or below the reference price. The new
    reference price is derived from the expected clearing price
    based upon the intersection of the supply curve and the ICAP
    Demand Curve if all suppliers bid as price-takers. The
    NYISO’s proposed reforms became effective March 27,
    2008.

The state-wide Installed Reserve Margin, or IRM, is set annually
    by the New York State Reliability Council, or NYSRC, and affects
    the overall demand for capacity in the New York market. The
    NYSRC approved a 2009 IRM of 16.5%, which is an increase of 1.5%
    from the 2008 requirement and should have a modest positive
    effect on capacity prices. Additionally, on January 29,
    2008, the FERC accepted the NYISO’s installed capacity
    demand curves for 2008/2009, 2009/2010, and 2010/2011. The
    demand curves are a critical determinant of capacity market
    prices, and these revised curves will contribute to the
    continuation of the current depressed prices, all other factors
    remaining constant.

PJM —

On December 12, 2008, PJM filed with
    the FERC a number of proposed revisions to the RPM capacity
    market design. PJM has proposed to implement many of the more
    significant changes in the next RPM Base Residual Auction,
    scheduled for May 2009 for planning year 2012/2013. On
    February 9, 2009 PJM filed an Offer of Settlement revising
    its December 12, 2008 filing with respect to the
    determination of several of the key inputs for the RPM auctions.

West
    Region

California has transitioned to a market structure where LSEs
    have an obligation to procure a portion of their Resource
    Adequacy, or RA, capacity requirements in
    transmission-constrained areas. All of NRG’s California
    assets operate in one or more of these constrained areas. This
    local procurement obligation is leading to a phase-out of RMR
    agreements with the CAISO. Cabrillo Power II LLC terminated
    its RMR agreement with CAISO effective December 31, 2008.
    See also the

Regional Business Description

for a
    discussion of the contracting activities that have occurred on
    the units pursuant to the state’s RA program.

CAISO has indicated that MRTU is scheduled to commence
    April 1, 2009. Significant components of the MRTU include:
    (i) locational marginal pricing of energy; (ii) a more
    effective congestion management system; (iii) a day-ahead
    market; and (iv) an increase to the existing bid caps. NRG
    considers these market reforms to be a positive development for
    its assets in the region. On October 18, 2008, the FERC
    accepted the CAISO’s Interim Capacity Procurement
    Mechanism, scheduled to go into effect contemporaneously with
    the implementation of MRTU. This mechanism is not a capacity
    market, but rather allows the CAISO to acquire generation
    capacity if LSEs do not satisfy their Resource Adequacy
    Obligations.

On October 22, 2008, the FERC issued a definitive order
    regarding the provision of station power in California. The
    FERC’s order reaffirmed the right of generators to engage
    in monthly netting of their station power needs and, further,
    clarified that local transmission-owning utilities are preempted
    from imposing state-based charges on such generators. This order
    should allow the Company to engage in monthly netting and thus
    avoid buying power at retail for many of its stations and,
    further, to avoid the other charges that the local
    transmission-owning utilities have been



imposing. The Company has submitted a station power plan to the
    California Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC, and expects to
    realize savings in operation costs as a result of this order.

See also Item 15 — Note 22,

Regulatory
    Matters,

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    further discussion.

Environmental
    Matters

NRG is subject to a wide range of environmental regulations
    across a broad number of jurisdictions in the development,
    ownership, construction and operation of domestic and
    international projects. These laws and regulations generally
    require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained
    before construction and during operation of power plants.
    Environmental laws have become increasingly stringent in recent
    years, especially around the regulation of air emissions from
    power generators. Such laws generally require regular capital
    expenditures for power plant upgrades, modifications and the
    installation of certain pollution control equipment. In general,
    future laws and regulations are expected to require the addition
    of emission controls or other environmental quality equipment or
    the imposition of certain restrictions on the operations of the
    Company’s facilities. NRG expects that future liability
    under, or compliance with, environmental requirements could have
    a material effect on the Company’s operations or
    competitive position.

Federal
    Environmental Initiatives

Air

— On May 18, 2005, the USEPA
    published the Clean Air Mercury Rule, or CAMR, and the Clean Air
    Interstate Rule, or CAIR, market-based

cap-and-trade

programs to reduce mercury,
    SO


and NOx emissions from coal-fired power plants. On
    February 8, 2008, the US Court of Appeals for the D.C.
    Circuit vacated the USEPA’s rule delisting coal- and
    oil-fired electric generating units on which CAMR was based.
    Power plant mercury emissions are now subject to
    Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, or CAA, which requires
    installation of maximum achievable control technology, or MACT,
    to reduce emissions. On October 17, 2008, the USEPA filed a
    petition with the US Supreme Court to reconsider the vacatur
    which was immediately followed by a petition to force EPA to
    issue the MACT standard from environmental groups. Certain
    states in which NRG operates coal plants, such as the states of
    Delaware, Massachusetts and New York, adopted state
    implementation plans in lieu of the CAMR federal implementation
    plan. These state rules remain unchanged by the Court’s
    ruling and are likely to meet any new standard for MACT
    requirements at existing generating units.

CAIR applied to 28 eastern states and D.C., and capped both
    SO


and NOx emissions from power plants in two phases. CAIR applies
    to most of the Company’s power plants in the states of New
    York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana, Illinois,
    Pennsylvania, Maryland and Texas. Following a finding to vacate
    CAIR in its entirety in July 2008, the D.C. Circuit Court
    reversed its opinion in December 2008 and remanded CAIR to the
    USEPA without vacatur. As a result, the effective date for the
    CAIR NOx trading program remains January 1, 2009.
    NRG’s
    SO


and NOx control plans are driven primarily by state requirements
    and consent orders. NRG’s estimate for environmental
    capital expenditures reflects changes in schedule and design
    related to the current status of both CAIR and CAMR. The timing
    and substantive provisions of any ensuing revised or replacement
    regulations or legislation may alter the composition

and/or

rate
    of spending for environmental retrofits at the Company’s
    facilities.

In a ruling on December 22, 2006, the D.C. Circuit
    overturned portions of the USEPA’s Phase I implementation
    rule for the new

8-hour

ozone
    standard. Specifically, the court ruled that the USEPA could
    revoke the

1-hour

standard as long as there was no backsliding from more stringent
    control measures. This ruling could result in the imposition of
    fees under Section 185 of the CAA on volatile organic
    carbon, or VOC, and NOx emissions in severe non-attainment
    areas. The fees could be as high as $7,700/ton for emissions
    above 80% of baseline emissions levels. Depending on the
    determination of baseline emission levels, this could materially
    impact NRG’s operations in Los Angeles, New York City Area
    and Houston.

The USEPA strengthened the primary and secondary ground level
    ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards, or NAAQS, (eight
    hour average) from 0.08 ppm to 0.075 ppm on
    March 12, 2008. The USEPA plans to finalize ozone
    non-attainment regions by March 2010 and states would likely
    submit plans to come into attainment



by 2013. The Company is unable to predict with certainty the
    impact of the states’ future recommendations on NRG’s
    operations.

In the 1990s, the USEPA commenced an industry-wide investigation
    of coal-fired electric generators to determine compliance with
    environmental requirements under the CAA associated with
    repairs, maintenance, modifications and operational changes made
    to facilities over the years. As a result, the USEPA and several
    states filed suits against a number of coal-fired power plants
    in mid-western and southern states alleging violations of the
    CAA New Source Review, or NSR, and Prevention of Significant
    Deterioration, or PSD, requirements. The USEPA has issued a
    Notice of Violation, or NOV, against NRG’s Big
    Cajun II plant alleging that NRG’s predecessors had
    undertaken projects that triggered requirements under the PSD
    program, including the installation of emission controls. NRG
    has evaluated the claims and believes they have no merit.
    Nonetheless, NRG has had discussions with the USEPA about
    resolving the claims. See the South Central region below for a
    further discussion.

Climate Change

— At the national level
    and at various regional and state levels, policies are under
    development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively
    putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial
    incentives to reduce them. In addition, earlier this year, the
    US Supreme Court found that
    CO


,
    the most common GHG, could be regulated as a pollutant and that
    the USEPA, under the CAA, could regulate
    CO


emissions from mobile sources and by extension, stationary
    sources. The USEPA gathered input from stakeholders in the fall
    of 2008, but has not taken any action to regulate
    CO


under the CAA. Since power plants, particularly coal-fired
    plants, are a significant source of GHG emissions both in the US
    and globally, it is almost certain that GHG legislative or
    regulatory actions will encompass power plants as well as other
    GHG emitting stationary sources.

In 2008, in the course of producing approximately
    80 million MWh of electricity, NRG’s power plants
    emitted 68 million tonnes of
    CO


,
    of which 61 million tonnes were emitted in the US,
    4 million tonnes in Germany and 3 million tonnes in
    Australia. The impact from federal, regional or state regulation
    of GHGs on the Company’s financial performance will depend
    on a number of factors, including the overall level of GHG
    reductions required under any such regulations, the price and
    availability of offsets, and the extent to which NRG would be
    entitled to receive
    CO


emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an
    auction or on the open market. Thereafter, under any such
    legislation or regulation, the impact on NRG would depend on the
    Company’s level of success in developing and deploying low
    and no carbon technologies such as those being pursued as part
    of the

Repowering

NRG and econrg initiatives.
    Additionally, NRG’s current contracts with its South
    Central region’s cooperative customers allows for the
    recovery of emission-based costs.

Water

— In July 2004, the USEPA
    published rules governing cooling water intake structures at
    existing power facilities commonly referred to as the
    Phase II 316(b) rules. These rules specify standards for
    cooling water intake structures at existing power plants using
    the largest amounts of cooling water. These rules will require
    implementation of the Best Technology Available, or BTA, for
    minimizing adverse environmental impacts unless a facility shows
    that such standards would result in very high costs or little
    environmental benefit. On January 25, 2007, the Second
    Circuit Court of Appeals made its decision in the

Riverkeeper
    vs. USEPA

appeal over the Phase II 316(b) regulation.

Riverkeeper

prevailed on nearly all issues and the
    decision essentially remands all of the important aspects of the
    rule back to the USEPA for reconsideration. In July 2007, the
    USEPA suspended the rule, except for the requirement that
    permitting agencies develop best professional judgment controls
    for existing facility cooling water intake structures that
    reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse
    environmental impact. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals
    decision has been challenged in the US Supreme Court. The
    Phase II 316(b) rule affects a number of NRG’s plants,
    specifically those with once-through cooling systems. While NRG
    has included the capital costs associated with the rule within
    the Company’s estimated environmental capital expenditures
    based on good faith estimates, until the USEPA has concluded its
    reconsideration of the Phase II 316(b) rules, it is not
    possible to estimate with certainty the capital costs that will
    be required for compliance with the Phase II 316(b) rules.

Nuclear Waste

— Under the US Nuclear
    Waste Policy Act of 1982, the federal government must remove and
    ultimately dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level
    radioactive waste from nuclear plants. Consistent with the US
    Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, owners of nuclear plants,
    including the owners of STP, entered into contracts setting out
    the obligations of the owners and the US Department of Energy,
    or DOE, including the fees to be paid by the owners for
    DOE’s services. Since 1998, the DOE has been in default on
    its obligations to begin removing spent



nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from reactors. On
    January 28, 2004, the owners of STP filed a breach of
    contract suit against the DOE in order to protect against the
    running of a statute of limitations.

Under the federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of
    1980, as amended, the state of Texas is required to provide,
    either on its own or jointly with other states in a compact, for
    the disposal of all low-level radioactive waste generated within
    the state. In 2003, the state of Texas enacted legislation
    allowing a private entity to be licensed to accept low-level
    radioactive waste for disposal. NRG intends to continue to ship
    low-level waste material from STP offsite for as long as an
    alternative disposal site is available. Should existing off-site
    disposal become unavailable, the low-level waste material will
    then be stored

on-site.

STP’s

on-site

storage capacity is expected to be adequate for STP’s needs
    until other off-site facilities become available.

Regional
    US Environmental Initiatives

Northeast
    Region

NRG operates electric generating units located in Connecticut,
    Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York which are
    subject to RGGI. These units will have to surrender one
    allowance for every US ton of
    CO


emitted with true up for

2009-2011

occurring in 2012. Allowances will be partially allocated in the
    state of Delaware only. In 2008, NRG emitted approximately
    12 million tonnes of
    CO


in RGGI states.

West
    Region

Under AB32, which was enacted in 2007, the state of California
    will launch a multi sector climate change program which likely
    will include, among other things, a phased

cap-and-trade

approach starting in 2012 and an increased use of renewable
    energy. The AB32 scoping document, adopted by the California Air
    Resources Board or CARB in December 2008 is consistent with the
    trading approach of the Western Climate Initiative or WCI, made
    up of seven states and four Canadian Provinces. NRG does not
    expect any implementation of

cap-and-trade

under AB32 in California to have a significant adverse financial
    impact on the Company for a variety of reasons, including the
    fact that NRG’s California portfolio consists of natural
    gas-fired peaking facilities and will likely be able to pass
    through any costs of purchasing allowances in power prices.

South
    Central Region

On January 27, 2004, NRG’s Louisiana Generating, LLC
    and the Company’s Big Cajun II plant received a
    request under Section 114 of the CAA from the USEPA seeking
    information primarily related to physical changes made at the
    Big Cajun II plant, and subsequently received a NOV on
    February 15, 2005, alleging that NRG’s predecessors
    had undertaken projects that triggered requirements under the
    Prevention of Significant Deterioration program, including the
    installation of emission controls. NRG submitted multiple
    responses commencing February 27, 2004 and ending on
    October 20, 2004. On May 9, 2006, these entities
    received from the Department of Justice, or DOJ, a Notice of
    Deficiency related to their responses, to which NRG responded on
    May 22, 2006. A document review was conducted at NRG’s
    Louisiana Generating, LLC offices by the DOJ during the week of
    August 14, 2006. On December 8, 2006, the USEPA issued
    a supplemental NOV updating the original February 15,
    2005 NOV. NRG has evaluated the original and subsequent
    claims and believes they have no merit. Nonetheless, NRG has had
    discussions with the USEPA about resolving the claims and the
    Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome of this matter.

Domestic
    Site Remediation Matters

Under certain federal, state and local environmental laws and
    regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of any
    facility, including an electric generating facility, may be
    required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened
    releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products
    at the facility. NRG may also be held liable to a governmental
    entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury
    and investigation and remediation costs incurred by a party in
    connection with hazardous material releases or threatened
    releases. These laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, as
    amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of
    1986, or SARA, impose liability without regard to whether the
    owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous
    substances, and the



courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict
    (without fault) and joint and several. Cleanup obligations can
    often be triggered during the closure or decommissioning of a
    facility, in addition to spills or other occurrences during its
    operations.

In January 2006, NRG’s Indian River Operations, Inc.
    received a letter of informal notification from the DNREC
    stating that it may be a potentially responsible party with
    respect to a historic captive landfill. On October 1, 2007,
    NRG signed an agreement with the DNREC to investigate the site
    through the Voluntary

Clean-up

Program. On February 4, 2008, the DNREC issued findings
    that no further action is required in relation to surface water
    and that a previously planned shoreline stabilization project
    would adequately address shore line erosion. The landfill itself
    will require a further Remedial Investigation and Feasibility
    Study to determine the type and scope of any additional work
    required. Until the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study
    are completed, the Company is unable to predict the impact of
    any required remediation.

On May 29, 2008, the DNREC issued an invitation to
    NRG’s Indian River Operations, Inc. to participate in the
    development and performance of a Natural Resource Damage
    Assessment, or NRDA, at the Burton Island Old Ash Landfill. NRG
    is currently working with the DNREC and other Trustees to close
    out the property.

    Remediation obligations can be found in Item 15 —

, to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

International
    Environmental Matters

Most of the foreign countries in which NRG owns or may acquire
    or develop independent power projects have environmental and
    safety laws or regulations relating to the ownership or
    operation of electric power generation facilities. These laws
    and regulations, like those in the US, are constantly evolving
    and have a significant impact on international wholesale power
    producers. In particular, NRG’s international power
    generation facilities will likely be affected by emissions
    limitations and operational requirements imposed by the Kyoto
    Protocol, an international treaty related to greenhouse gas
    emissions enacted on February 16, 2005, as well as
    country-based restrictions pertaining to global climate change
    concerns.

NRG retains appropriate advisors in foreign countries and seeks
    to design its international asset management strategy to comply
    with each country’s environmental and safety laws and
    regulations. There can be no assurance that changes in such laws
    or regulations will not adversely affect the Company’s
    international operations.

MIBRAG/Schkopau, Germany

— Under the German
    National
    CO


Allocation Plan 2008 — 2012, MIBRAG was granted
    CO


allocations that are less than the needs of its three generating
    plants. MIBRAG has minimized the impact of the short allocation
    by coordinated forward selling of electricity and purchase of
    CO


certificates at times when the
    CO


/ electricity
    spread is profitable. Additionally, MIBRAG has submitted an
    application under the hardship clause of the law to receive a
    higher allocation of the
    CO


allowances. The cost of compliance with the
    CO


regulation for NRG’s Schkopau plant is passed through to
    its off-taker of energy under terms of its existing PPA.

Gladstone, Australia —

On December 3,
    2007, Australia ratified the Kyoto Protocol that commits to
    targets for GHG reductions. Australia also set a target to
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 60% of 2000 levels by 2050.
    The government is establishing a single national system for
    reporting of GHG, abatement actions, and energy consumption and
    generation starting July 1, 2008. This will underpin the
    Australian Emissions Trading Scheme, currently in the early
    stages of design that will be operational no later than 2010.

Item 1A —

Risk
    Factors Related to NRG Energy, Inc.

Many
    of NRG’s power generation facilities operate, wholly or
    partially, without long-term power sale
    agreements.

Many of NRG’s facilities operate as “merchant”
    facilities without long-term power sales agreements for some or
    all of their generating capacity and output, and therefore are
    exposed to market fluctuations. Without the benefit of long-term
    power sales agreements for these assets, NRG cannot be sure that
    it will be able to sell any or all of the power generated by
    these facilities at commercially attractive rates or that these
    facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead
    to future impairments of the Company’s property, plant and
    equipment or to the closing of certain of its facilities,
    resulting in economic losses and liabilities, which could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations, financial condition or cash flows.

NRG’s
    financial performance may be impacted by changing natural gas
    prices, significant and unpredictable price fluctuations in the
    wholesale power markets and other market factors that are beyond
    the Company’s control.

A significant percentage of the Company’s domestic revenues
    are derived from baseload power plants that are fueled by coal.
    In many of the competitive markets where NRG operates, the price
    of power typically is set by natural gas-fired power plants that
    currently have substantially higher variable costs than
    NRG’s coal-fired baseload power plants. This allows the
    Company’s baseload coal generation assets to earn
    attractive operating margins compared to plants fueled by
    natural gas. A decrease in natural gas prices could result in a
    corresponding decrease in the market price of power that could
    significantly reduce the operating margins of the Company’s
    baseload generation assets and materially and adversely impact
    its financial performance.

In addition, because changes in power prices in the markets
    where NRG operates are generally correlated with changes in
    natural gas prices, NRG’s hedging portfolio includes
    natural gas derivative instruments to hedge power prices for its
    baseload generation. If this correlation between power prices
    and natural gas prices is not maintained and a change in gas
    prices is not proportionately offset by a change in power
    prices, the Company’s natural gas hedges may not fully
    cover this differential. This could have a material adverse
    impact on the Company’s cash flow and financial position.

Market prices for power, capacity and ancillary services tend to
    fluctuate substantially. Unlike most other commodities, electric
    power can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally
    must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, power
    prices are subject to significant volatility from supply and
    demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead and spot markets.
    Long- and short-term power prices may also fluctuate
    substantially due to other factors outside of the Company’s
    control, including:

•

changes in generation capacity in the Company’s markets,
    including the addition of new supplies of power from existing
    competitors or new market entrants as a result of the
    development of new generation plants, expansion of existing
    plants or additional transmission capacity;

•

electric supply disruptions, including plant outages and
    transmission disruptions;

•

changes in power transmission infrastructure;

•

fuel transportation capacity constraints;

•

weather conditions;

•

changes in the demand for power or in patterns of power usage,
    including the potential development of demand-side management
    tools and practices;

•

development of new fuels and new technologies for the production
    of power;

•

regulations and actions of the ISOs; and

•

federal and state power market and environmental regulation and
    legislation.



These factors have caused the Company’s operating results
    to fluctuate in the past and will continue to cause them to do
    so in the future.

NRG’s
    costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows
    could be adversely impacted by disruption of its fuel
    supplies.

NRG relies on coal, oil and natural gas to fuel a majority of
    its power generation facilities. Delivery of these fuels to the
    facilities is dependent upon the continuing financial viability
    of contractual counterparties as well as upon the infrastructure
    (including rail lines, rail cars, barge facilities, roadways,
    and natural gas pipelines) available to serve each generation
    facility. As a result, the Company is subject to the risks of
    disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at its
    generation facilities if a counterparty fails to perform or if
    there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.

NRG has sold forward a substantial portion of its baseload power
    in order to lock in long-term prices that it deemed to be
    favorable at the time it entered into the forward sale
    contracts. In order to hedge its obligations under these forward
    power sales contracts, the Company has entered into long-term
    and short-term contracts for the purchase and delivery of fuel.
    Many of the forward power sales contracts do not allow the
    Company to pass through changes in fuel costs or discharge the
    power sale obligations in the case of a disruption in fuel
    supply due to force majeure events or the default of a fuel
    supplier or transporter. Disruptions in the Company’s fuel
    supplies may therefore require it to find alternative fuel
    sources at higher costs, to find other sources of power to
    deliver to counterparties at a higher cost, or to pay damages to
    counterparties for failure to deliver power as contracted. Any
    such event could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial performance.

NRG also buys significant quantities of fuel on a short-term or
    spot market basis. Prices for all of the Company’s fuels
    fluctuate, sometimes rising or falling significantly over a
    relatively short period of time. The price NRG can obtain for
    the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate, or may not
    rise at all, to match a rise in fuel or delivery costs. This may
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    performance. Changes in market prices for natural gas, coal and
    oil may result from the following:

•

weather conditions;

•

seasonality;

•

demand for energy commodities and general economic conditions;

•

disruption or other constraints or inefficiencies of
    electricity, gas or coal transmission or transportation;

•

additional generating capacity;

•

availability and levels of storage and inventory for fuel stocks;

•

natural gas, crude oil, refined products and coal production
    levels;

•

changes in market liquidity;

•

federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and
    legislation; and

•

the creditworthiness and liquidity and willingness of fuel
    suppliers/transporters to do business with the Company.

NRG’s plant operating characteristics and equipment,
    particularly at its coal-fired plants, often dictate the
    specific fuel quality to be combusted. The availability and
    price of specific fuel qualities may vary due to supplier
    financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions
    and force majeure. At times, coal of specific quality may not be
    available at any price, or the Company may not be able to
    transport such coal to its facilities on a timely basis. In this
    case, the Company may not be able to run the coal facility even
    if it would be profitable. Operating a coal facility with
    different quality coal can lead to emission or operating
    problems. If the Company had sold forward the power from such a
    coal facility, it could be required to supply or purchase power
    from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. This could have a
    material adverse impact on the financial results of specific
    plants and on the Company’s results of operations.



There
    may be periods when NRG will not be able to meet its commitments
    under forward sale obligations at a reasonable cost or at
    all.

A substantial portion of the output from NRG’s baseload
    facilities has been sold forward under fixed price power sales
    contracts through 2014, and the Company also sells forward the
    output from its intermediate and peaking facilities when its
    deems it commercially advantageous to do so. Because the
    obligations under most of these agreements are not contingent on
    a unit being available to generate power, NRG is generally
    required to deliver power to the buyer, even in the event of a
    plant outage, fuel supply disruption or a reduction in the
    available capacity of the unit. To the extent that the Company
    does not have sufficient lower cost capacity to meet its
    commitments under its forward sale obligations, the Company
    would be required to supply replacement power either by running
    its other, higher cost power plants or by obtaining power from
    third-party sources at market prices that could substantially
    exceed the contract price. If NRG fails to deliver the
    contracted power, it would be required to pay the difference
    between the market price at the delivery point and the contract
    price, and the amount of such payments could be substantial.

In the South Central region, NRG has long-term contracts with
    rural cooperatives that require it to serve all of the
    cooperatives’ requirements at prices that generally reflect
    the costs of coal-fired generation. At times, the output from
    NRG’s coal-fired Big Cajun II facility has been and
    will continue to be inadequate to serve these obligations, and
    when that happens the Company has typically purchased power from
    other power producers, often at a loss. NRG’s financial
    returns from its South Central region could deteriorate over
    time if the rural cooperatives significantly grow their customer
    base during the remaining terms of these contracts unless the
    Company is able to amend or renegotiate its contracts with the
    cooperatives or add generating capacity.

NRG’s
    trading operations and the use of hedging agreements could
    result in financial losses that negatively impact its results of
    operations.

The Company typically enters into hedging agreements, including
    contracts to purchase or sell commodities at future dates and at
    fixed prices, in order to manage the commodity price risks
    inherent in its power generation operations. These activities,
    although intended to mitigate price volatility, expose the
    Company to other risks. When the Company sells power forward, it
    gives up the opportunity to sell power at higher prices in the
    future, which not only may result in lost opportunity costs but
    also may require the Company to post significant amounts of cash
    collateral or other credit support to its counterparties. The
    Company also relies on counterparty performance under its
    hedging agreements and is exposed to the credit quality of its
    counterparties under those agreements. Further, if the values of
    the financial contracts change in a manner that the Company does
    not anticipate, or if a counterparty fails to perform under a
    contract, it could harm the Company’s business, operating
    results or financial position.

NRG does not typically hedge the entire exposure of its
    operations against commodity price volatility. To the extent it
    does not hedge against commodity price volatility, the
    Company’s results of operations and financial position may
    be improved or diminished based upon movement in commodity
    prices.

NRG may engage in trading activities, including the trading of
    power, fuel and emissions allowances that are not directly
    related to the operation of the Company’s generation
    facilities or the management of related risks. These trading
    activities take place in volatile markets and some of these
    trades could be characterized as speculative. The Company would
    expect to settle these trades financially rather than through
    the production of power or the delivery of fuel. This trading
    activity may expose the Company to the risk of significant
    financial losses which could have a material adverse effect on
    its business and financial condition.

NRG
    may not have sufficient liquidity to hedge market risks
    effectively.

The Company is exposed to market risks through its power
    marketing business, which involves the sale of energy, capacity
    and related products and the purchase and sale of fuel,
    transmission services and emission allowances. These market
    risks include, among other risks, volatility arising from
    location and timing differences that may be associated with
    buying and transporting fuel, converting fuel into energy and
    delivering the energy to a buyer.



NRG undertakes these marketing activities through agreements
    with various counterparties. Many of the Company’s
    agreements with counterparties include provisions that require
    the Company to provide guarantees, offset of netting
    arrangements, letters of credit, a first or second lien on
    assets

and/or

cash
    collateral to protect the counterparties against the risk of the
    Company’s default or insolvency. The amount of such credit
    support that must be provided typically is based on the
    difference between the price of the commodity in a given
    contract and the market price of the commodity. Significant
    movements in market prices can result in the Company being
    required to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in
    very large amounts. The effectiveness of the Company’s
    strategy may be dependent on the amount of collateral available
    to enter into or maintain these contracts, and liquidity
    requirements may be greater than the Company anticipates or will
    be able to meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital
    to post as collateral in support of performance guarantees or as
    a cash margin, the Company may not be able to manage price
    volatility effectively or to implement its strategy. An increase
    in the amount of letters of credit or cash collateral required
    to be provided to the Company’s counterparties may
    negatively affect the Company’s liquidity and financial
    condition.

Further, if any of NRG’s facilities experience unplanned
    outages, the Company may be required to procure replacement
    power at spot market prices in order to fulfill contractual
    commitments. Without adequate liquidity to meet margin and
    collateral requirements, the Company may be exposed to
    significant losses, may miss significant opportunities, and may
    have increased exposure to the volatility of spot markets.

The
    accounting for NRG’s hedging activities may increase the
    volatility in the Company’s quarterly and annual financial
    results.

NRG engages in commodity-related marketing and price-risk
    management activities in order to financially hedge its exposure
    to market risk with respect to electricity sales from its
    generation assets, fuel utilized by those assets and emission
    allowances.

NRG generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical and
    financial purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract
    volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations
    through the use of financial and physical derivative contracts.
    These derivatives are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities,

as amended, or SFAS 133, which
    requires the Company to record all derivatives on the balance
    sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value resulting
    from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices immediately
    recognized in earnings, unless the derivative qualifies for cash
    flow hedge accounting treatment. Whether a derivative qualifies
    for cash flow hedge accounting treatment depends upon it meeting
    specific criteria used to determine if the cash flow hedge is
    and will remain appropriate for the term of the derivative. All
    economic hedges may not necessarily qualify for cash flow hedge
    accounting treatment. As a result, the Company’s quarterly
    and annual results are subject to significant fluctuations
    caused by changes in market prices.

Competition
    in wholesale power markets may have a material adverse effect on
    NRG’s results of operations, cash flows and the market
    value of its assets.

NRG has numerous competitors in all aspects of its business, and
    additional competitors may enter the industry. Because many of
    the Company’s facilities are old, newer plants owned by the
    Company’s competitors are often more efficient than
    NRG’s aging plants, which may put some of these plants at a
    competitive disadvantage to the extent the Company’s
    competitors are able to consume the same or less fuel as the
    Company’s plants consume. Over time, the Company’s
    plants may be squeezed out of their markets, or may be unable to
    compete with these more efficient plants.

In NRG’s power marketing and commercial operations, it
    competes on the basis of its relative skills, financial position
    and access to capital with other providers of electric energy in
    the procurement of fuel and transportation services, and the
    sale of capacity, energy and related products. In order to
    compete successfully, the Company seeks to aggregate fuel
    supplies at competitive prices from different sources and
    locations and to efficiently utilize transportation services
    from third-party pipelines, railways and other fuel transporters
    and transmission services from electric utilities.

Other companies with which NRG competes with may have greater
    liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial
    resources, lower cost structures, more effective risk management
    policies and procedures, greater ability



to incur losses, longer-standing relationships with customers,
    greater potential for profitability from ancillary services or
    greater flexibility in the timing of their sale of generation
    capacity and ancillary services than NRG does.

NRG’s competitors may be able to respond more quickly to
    new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote
    greater resources to the construction, expansion or
    refurbishment of their power generation facilities than NRG can.
    In addition, current and potential competitors may make
    strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships
    among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is
    possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new
    competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market
    share. There can be no assurance that NRG will be able to
    compete successfully against current and future competitors, and
    any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flow.

Operation
    of power generation facilities involves significant risks and
    hazards customary to the power industry that could have a
    material adverse effect on NRG’s revenues and results of
    operations. NRG may not have adequate insurance to cover these
    risks and hazards.

The ongoing operation of NRG’s facilities involves risks
    that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes,
    performance below expected levels of output or efficiency and
    the inability to transport the Company’s product to its
    customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission
    capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including
    extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or
    other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk
    of the Company’s business. Unplanned outages typically
    increase the Company’s operation and maintenance expenses
    and may reduce the Company’s revenues as a result of
    selling fewer MWh or require NRG to incur significant costs as a
    result of running one of its higher cost units or obtaining
    replacement power from third parties in the open market to
    satisfy the Company’s forward power sales obligations.
    NRG’s inability to operate the Company’s plants
    efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs, and generate
    earnings and cash flow from the Company’s asset-based
    businesses could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations, financial condition or
    cash flows. While NRG maintains insurance, obtains warranties
    from vendors and obligates contractors to meet certain
    performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties
    or performance guarantees may not be adequate to cover the
    Company’s lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated
    damages payments should the Company experience equipment
    breakdown or non-performance by contractors or vendors.

Power generation involves hazardous activities, including
    acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large
    pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to
    transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural
    risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind,
    other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and
    machinery failure are inherent risks in the Company’s
    operations. These and other hazards can cause significant
    personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and
    destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of,
    or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The
    occurrence of any one of these events may result in NRG being
    named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for
    substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs,
    personal injury and property damage and fines

and/or

penalties. NRG maintains an amount of insurance protection that
    it considers adequate, but the Company cannot provide any
    assurance that its insurance will be sufficient or effective
    under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities
    to which it may be subject. A successful claim for which the
    Company is not fully insured could hurt its financial results
    and materially harm NRG’s financial condition. Further, due
    to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets,
    NRG cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage
    will continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms
    similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by
    insurance could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Maintenance,
    expansion and refurbishment of power generation facilities
    involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power
    outages or reduced output and could have a material adverse
    effect on NRG’s results of operations, cash flow and
    financial condition.

Many of NRG’s facilities are old and require periodic
    upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including
    failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any
    unanticipated capital expenditures could result in reduced
    profitability.



NRG cannot be certain of the level of capital expenditures that
    will be required due to changing environmental and safety laws
    and regulations (including changes in the interpretation or
    enforcement thereof), needed facility repairs and unexpected
    events (such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks). The
    unexpected requirement of large capital expenditures could have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and
    financial condition.

If NRG makes any major modifications to its power generation
    facilities, the Company may be required to install the best
    available control technology or to achieve the lowest achievable
    emission rates as such terms are defined under the new source
    review provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Any such
    modifications would likely result in substantial additional
    capital expenditures.

The
    Company may incur additional costs or delays in the construction
    and operation of new plants, improvements to existing plants, or
    the implementation of environmental control equipment at
    existing plants and may not be able to recover their investment
    or complete the project.

The Company is in the process of constructing new generation
    facilities, improving its existing facilities and adding
    environmental controls to its existing facilities. The
    construction, expansion, modification and refurbishment of power
    generation facilities involve many additional risks, including:

•

delays in obtaining necessary permits and licenses;

•

environmental remediation of soil or groundwater at contaminated
    sites;

•

interruptions to dispatch at the Company’s facilities;

•

supply interruptions;

•

work stoppages;

•

labor disputes;

•

weather interferences;

•

unforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems;

•

unanticipated cost overruns;

•

exchange rate risks; and

•

performance risks.

Any of these risks could cause NRG’s financial returns on
    new investments to be lower than expected, or could cause the
    Company to operate below expected capacity or availability
    levels, which could result in lost revenues, increased expenses,
    higher maintenance costs and penalties. Insurance is maintained
    to protect against these risks, warranties are generally
    obtained for limited periods relating to the construction of
    each project and its equipment in varying degrees, and
    contractors and equipment suppliers are obligated to meet
    certain performance levels. The insurance, warranties or
    performance guarantees, however, may not be adequate to cover
    increased expenses. As a result, a project may cost more than
    projected and may be unable to fund principal and interest
    payments under its construction financing obligations, if any. A
    default under such a financing obligation could result in losing
    the Company’s interest in a power generation facility.

If the Company is unable to complete the development or
    construction of a facility or environmental control, or decides
    to delay or cancel such project, it may not be able to recover
    its investment in that facility or environmental control.
    Furthermore, if construction projects are not completed
    according to specification, the Company may incur liabilities
    and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs and
    reduced net income.

The
    Company’s RepoweringNRG program is subject to financing
    risks that could adversely impact NRG’s financial
    performance.

While NRG currently intends to develop and finance the more
    capital intensive, solid fuel-fired projects included in the

Repowering

NRG program on a non-recourse or limited
    recourse basis through separate project financed entities, and
    intends to seek additional investments in most of these projects
    from third parties, NRG



anticipates that it will need to make significant equity
    investments in these projects. NRG may also decide to develop
    and finance some of the projects, such as smaller gas-fired and
    renewable projects, using corporate financial resources rather
    than non-recourse debt, which could subject NRG to significant
    capital expenditure requirements and to risks inherent in the
    development and construction of new generation facilities. In
    addition to providing some or all of the equity required to
    develop and build the proposed projects, NRG’s ability to
    finance these projects on a non-recourse basis is contingent
    upon a number of factors, including the terms of the EPC
    contracts, construction costs, PPAs and fuel procurement
    contracts, capital markets conditions, the availability of tax
    credits and other government incentives for certain new
    technologies. To the extent NRG is not able to obtain
    non-recourse financing for any project or should the credit
    rating agencies attribute a material amount of the project
    finance debt to NRG’s credit, the financing of the

Repowering

NRG projects could have a negative impact on
    the credit ratings of NRG.

As part of the

Repowering

NRG program, NRG may also choose
    to undertake the repowering, refurbishment or upgrade of current
    facilities based on the Company’s assessment that such
    activity will provide adequate financial returns. Such projects
    often require several years of development and capital
    expenditures before commencement of commercial operations, and
    key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an
    investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding
    construction costs, timing, available financing and future fuel
    and power prices.

Supplier
    and/or customer concentration at certain of NRG’s
    facilities may expose the Company to significant financial
    credit or performance risks.

NRG often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small
    number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of
    fuel and other services required for the operation of certain of
    its facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, the Company
    utilizes the marketplace to provide these services. There can be
    no assurance that the marketplace can provide these services as,
    when and where required.

At times, NRG relies on a single customer or a few customers to
    purchase all or a significant portion of a facility’s
    output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account
    for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a
    given facility. The Company has also hedged a portion of its
    exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price
    power sales and natural gas price swap agreements.
    Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable
    to perform their obligations. NRG may not be able to enter into
    replacement agreements on terms as favorable as its existing
    agreements, or at all. If the Company was unable to enter into
    replacement PPA’s, the Company would sell its plants’
    power at market prices. If the Company is unable to enter into
    replacement fuel or fuel transportation purchase agreements, NRG
    would seek to purchase the Company’s fuel requirements at
    market prices, exposing the Company to market price volatility
    and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available
    during certain periods at any price.

The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its
    contractual obligations to NRG could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial results. Consequently,
    the financial performance of the Company’s facilities is
    dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance
    by, suppliers and customers.

NRG
    relies on power transmission facilities that it does not own or
    control and that are subject to transmission constraints within
    a number of the Company’s core regions. If these facilities
    fail to provide NRG with adequate transmission capacity, the
    Company may be restricted in its ability to deliver wholesale
    electric power to its customers and the Company may either incur
    additional costs or forego revenues. Conversely, improvements to
    certain transmission systems could also reduce
    revenues.

NRG depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by
    others to deliver the wholesale power it sells from the
    Company’s power generation plants to its customers. If
    transmission is disrupted, or if the transmission capacity
    infrastructure is inadequate, NRG’s ability to sell and
    deliver wholesale power may be adversely impacted. If a
    region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate,
    the Company’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may
    be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is
    imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient
    incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.
    The Company cannot also predict whether transmission facilities
    will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive
    access to those markets.



In addition, in certain of the markets in which NRG operates,
    energy transmission congestion may occur and the Company may be
    deemed responsible for congestion costs if it schedules delivery
    of power between congestion zones during times when congestion
    occurs between the zones. If NRG were liable for such congestion
    costs, the Company’s financial results could be adversely
    affected.

In the CAISO, NYISO and NE-ISO markets, the Company has a
    significant amount of generation located in load pockets, making
    that generation valuable, particularly with respect to
    maintaining the reliability of the transmission grid. Expansion
    of transmission systems to reduce or eliminate these load
    pockets could negatively impact the value or profitability of
    our existing facilities in these areas.

Because
    NRG owns less than a majority of some of its project
    investments, the Company cannot exercise complete control over
    their operations.

NRG has limited control over the operation of some project
    investments and joint ventures because the Company’s
    investments are in projects where it beneficially owns less than
    a majority of the ownership interests. NRG seeks to exert a
    degree of influence with respect to the management and operation
    of projects in which it owns less than a majority of the
    ownership interests by negotiating to obtain positions on
    management committees or to receive certain limited governance
    rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, the
    Company may not always succeed in such negotiations. NRG may be
    dependent on its co-venturers to operate such projects. The
    Company’s co-venturers may not have the level of
    experience, technical expertise, human resources management and
    other attributes necessary to operate these projects optimally.
    The approval of co-venturers also may be required for NRG to
    receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer the
    Company’s interest in projects.

Future
    acquisition activities may have adverse effects.

NRG may seek to acquire additional companies or assets in the
    Company’s industry. The acquisition of power generation
    companies and assets is subject to substantial risks, including
    the failure to identify material problems during due diligence,
    the risk of over-paying for assets and the inability to arrange
    financing for an acquisition as may be required or desired.
    Further, the integration and consolidation of acquisitions
    requires substantial human, financial and other resources and,
    ultimately, the Company’s acquisitions may not be
    successfully integrated. There can be no assurances that any
    future acquisitions will perform as expected or that the returns
    from such acquisitions will support the indebtedness incurred to
    acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them.

NRG’s
    business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and
    may be adversely affected by legislative or regulatory changes,
    as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply
    with, existing or future regulations or
    requirements.

NRG’s business is subject to extensive foreign, and US
    federal, state and local laws and regulation. Compliance with
    the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may
    cause the Company to incur significant additional costs, and
    failure to comply with such requirements could result in the
    shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens,
    fines,

and/or

civil
    or criminal liability.

Public utilities under the FPA are required to obtain FERC
    acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of
    electricity. All of NRG’s non-qualifying facility
    generating companies and power marketing affiliates in the US
    make sales of electricity in interstate commerce and are public
    utilities for purposes of the FPA. The FERC has granted each of
    NRG’s generating and power marketing companies the
    authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The
    FERC’s orders that grant NRG’s generating and power
    marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the
    right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC
    subsequently determines that NRG can exercise market power in
    transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage
    in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, NRG’s
    market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules,
    and if any of NRG’s generating and power marketing
    companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they
    are subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with
    the violation

and/or

suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority.
    If NRG’s generating and power marketing companies were to
    lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be
    required to obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a
    cost-of-service rate schedule and could become



subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting
    requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate
    schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates NRG
    charges for power from its facilities.

NRG is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as
    well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost
    allocations, and bidding rules that occur in the existing ISOs.
    The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets
    impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation,
    including price limitations, offer caps, and other mechanisms to
    address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of
    market power in these markets. These types of price limitations
    and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on
    the profitability of NRG’s generation facilities that sell
    energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets.

The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power
    industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several
    years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state
    and federal levels. These changes are ongoing and the Company
    cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets
    or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment
    will have on NRG’s business. In addition, in some of these
    markets, interested parties have proposed material market design
    changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price
    mechanism, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets or
    require divestiture by generating companies to reduce their
    market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and
    legislative or other attention to the electric power market
    restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation
    process. If competitive restructuring of the electric power
    markets is reversed, discontinued, or delayed, our business
    prospects and financial results could be negatively impacted.

NRG’s
    ownership interest in a nuclear power facility subjects the
    Company to regulations, costs and liabilities uniquely
    associated with these types of facilities.

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or AEA,
    operation of STP, of which NRG indirectly owns a 44.0% interest,
    is subject to regulation by the NRC. Such regulation includes
    licensing, inspection, enforcement, testing, evaluation and
    modification of all aspects of nuclear reactor power plant
    design and operation, environmental and safety performance,
    technical and financial qualifications, decommissioning funding
    assurance and transfer and foreign ownership restrictions.
    NRG’s 44% share of the output of STP represents
    approximately 1,175 MW of generation capacity.

There are unique risks to owning and operating a nuclear power
    facility. These include liabilities related to the handling,
    treatment, storage, disposal, transport, release and use of
    radioactive materials, particularly with respect to spent
    nuclear fuel, and uncertainties regarding the ultimate, and
    potential exposure to, technical and financial risks associated
    with modifying or decommissioning a nuclear facility. The NRC
    could require the shutdown of the plant for safety reasons or
    refuse to permit restart of the unit after unplanned or planned
    outages. New or amended NRC safety and regulatory requirements
    may give rise to additional operation and maintenance costs and
    capital expenditures. STP may be obligated to continue storing
    spent nuclear fuel if the Department of Energy continues to fail
    to meet its contractual obligations to STP made pursuant to the
    US Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept and dispose of
    STP’s spent nuclear fuel. See also

“Environmental
    Matters — US Federal Environmental
    Initiatives — Nuclear Waste”

in Item 1
    for further discussion. Costs associated with these risks could
    be substantial and have a material adverse effect on NRG’s
    results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. In
    addition, to the extent that all or a part of STP is required by
    the NRC to permanently or temporarily shut down or modify its
    operations, or is otherwise subject to a forced outage, NRG may
    incur additional costs to the extent it is obligated to provide
    power from more expensive alternative sources — either
    NRG’s own plants, third party generators or the
    ERCOT — to cover the Company’s then existing
    forward sale obligations. Such shutdown or modification could
    also lead to substantial costs related to the storage and
    disposal of radioactive materials and spent nuclear fuel.

NRG and the other owners of STP maintain nuclear property and
    nuclear liability insurance coverage as required by law. The
    Price-Anderson Act, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005,
    requires owners of nuclear power plants in the US to be
    collectively responsible for retrospective secondary insurance
    premiums for liability to the public arising from nuclear
    incidents resulting in claims in excess of the required primary
    insurance coverage amount of $300 million per reactor. The
    Price-Anderson Act only covers nuclear liability associated with
    any accident in the course of operation of the nuclear reactor,
    transportation of nuclear fuel to the reactor site, in the
    storage of nuclear fuel and waste at the reactor site and the
    transportation of the spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste



from the nuclear reactor. All other non-nuclear liabilities are
    not covered. Any substantial retrospective premiums imposed
    under the Price-Anderson Act or losses not covered by insurance
    could have a material adverse effect on NRG’s financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.

NRG is
    subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose
    extensive and increasingly stringent requirements on the
    Company’s ongoing operations, as well as potentially
    substantial liabilities arising out of environmental
    contamination. These environmental requirements and liabilities
    could adversely impact NRG’s results of operations,
    financial condition and cash flows.

NRG’s business is subject to the environmental laws and
    regulations of foreign, federal, state and local authorities.
    The Company must comply with numerous environmental laws and
    regulations and obtain numerous governmental permits and
    approvals to operate the Company’s plants. Should NRG fail
    to comply with any environmental requirements that apply to its
    operations, the Company could be subject to administrative,
    civil

and/or

criminal liability and fines, and regulatory agencies could take
    other actions seeking to curtail the Company’s operations.
    In addition, when new requirements take effect or when existing
    environmental requirements are revised, reinterpreted or subject
    to changing enforcement policies, NRG’s business, results
    of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be
    adversely affected.

Environmental laws and regulations have generally become more
    stringent over time, and the Company expects this trend to
    continue. Regulations currently under revision by USEPA,
    including CAIR, MACT, standards to control Mercury and the 316
    (b) rule to mitigate impact by once through cooling, could
    result in tighter standards or reduced compliance flexibility.
    While the NRG fleet employs advanced controls and utilizes
    industry’s best practices, new regulations to address
    tightened National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone and
    PM 2.5 or new rules to further restrict ash handling at
    coal-fired power plants could also further restrict plant
    operations.

Furthermore, certain environmental laws impose strict, joint and
    several liability for costs required to clean up and restore
    sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise
    released. The Company is generally responsible for all
    liabilities associated with the environmental condition of its
    power generation plants, including any soil or groundwater
    contamination that may be present, regardless of when the
    liabilities arose and whether the liabilities are known or
    unknown, or arose from the activities of predecessors or third
    parties.

Policies
    at the national, regional and state levels to regulate GHG
    emissions could adversely impact NRG’s result of
    operations, financial condition and cash flows.

At the national level and at various regional and state levels,
    policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions,
    thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to
    create financial incentive to reduce them. In addition the EPA
    is giving consideration to control of
    CO


emissions from power plants via existing sections of the CAA.
    Since power plants, particularly coal-fired plants, are a
    significant source of GHG emissions both in the US and globally,
    it is almost certain that GHG regulatory actions will encompass
    power plants as well as other GHG emitting stationary sources.
    In 2008, in the course of producing approximately
    80 million MWh of electricity, NRG’s power plants
    emitted 68 million tonnes of
    CO


,
    of which 61 million tonnes were emitted in the US,
    4 million tonnes in Germany and 3 million tonnes in
    Australia.

Federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could
    have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    performance. The actual impact on the Company’s financial
    performance will depend on a number of factors, including the
    overall level of GHG reductions required under any such
    regulations, the price and availability of offsets, and the
    extent to which NRG would be entitled to receive
    CO


emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an
    auction or on the open market.

Of the approximately 61 million tonnes of
    CO


emitted by NRG in the US in 2008, approximately 12 million
    tonnes were emitted from the Company’s generating units in
    Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York
    that are subject to RGGI starting in 2009. The impact of RGGI on
    power prices (and thus on the Company’s financial
    performance), indirectly through generators seeking to pass
    through the cost of their
    CO


emissions, cannot be predicted. However, NRG believes that due
    to the absence of
    CO


allowance allocations under RGGI, the direct financial impact on
    NRG is likely to be negative as the Company will incur costs in
    the course of securing the necessary allowances and offsets at
    auction and in the market.



NRG’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by its unionized
    employees or inability to replace employees as they
    retire.

As of December 31, 2008, approximately 66% of NRG’s
    employees at its US generation plants were covered by collective
    bargaining agreements. In the event that the Company’s
    union employees strike, participate in a work stoppage or
    slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strife or disruption,
    NRG would be responsible for procuring replacement labor or the
    Company could experience reduced power generation or outages.
    NRG’s ability to procure such labor is uncertain. Strikes,
    work stoppages or the inability to negotiate future collective
    bargaining agreements on favorable terms could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, a
    number of our employees at our plants are close to retirement.
    Our inability to replace those workers could create potential
    knowledge and expertise gaps as those workers retire.

Changes
    in technology may impair the value of NRG’s power
    plants.

Research and development activities are ongoing to provide
    alternative and more efficient technologies to produce power,
    including fuel cells, “clean” coal and coal
    gasification, micro-turbines, photovoltaic (solar) cells and
    improvements in traditional technologies and equipment, such as
    more efficient gas turbines. Advances in these or other
    technologies could reduce the costs of power production to a
    level below what the Company has currently forecasted, which
    could adversely affect its cash flow, results of operations or
    competitive position.

Acts
    of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on NRG’s
    financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

NRG’s generation facilities and the facilities of third
    parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist
    activities, as well as events occurring in response to or in
    connection with them, that could cause environmental
    repercussions

and/or

result in full or partial disruption of the facilities ability
    to generate, transmit, transport or distribute electricity or
    natural gas. Strategic targets, such as energy-related
    facilities, may be at greater risk of future terrorist
    activities than other domestic targets. Any such environmental
    repercussions or disruption could result in a significant
    decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or
    remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flow.

NRG’s
    international investments are subject to additional risks that
    its US investments do not have.

NRG has investments in power projects in Australia and Germany.
    International investments are subject to risks and uncertainties
    relating to the political, social and economic structures of the
    countries in which it invests. The likelihood of such
    occurrences and their overall effect upon NRG may vary greatly
    from country to country and are not predictable. Risks
    specifically related to our investments in international
    projects may include:

•

fluctuations in currency valuation;

•

currency inconvertibility;

•

expropriation and confiscatory taxation;

•

restrictions on the repatriation of capital; and

•

approval requirements and governmental policies limiting returns
    to foreign investors.

NRG’s
    level of indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to
    raise additional capital to fund its operations, or return
    capital to stockholders. It could also expose it to the risk of
    increased interest rates and limit its ability to react to
    changes in the economy or its industry.

NRG’s substantial debt could have important consequences,
    including:

•

increasing NRG’s vulnerability to general economic and
    industry conditions;

•

requiring a substantial portion of NRG’s cash flow from
    operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and
    interest on its indebtedness, therefore reducing NRG’s
    ability to pay dividends to holders of its



preferred or common stock or to use its cash flow to fund its
    operations, capital expenditures and future business
    opportunities;

•

limiting NRG’s ability to enter into long-term power sales
    or fuel purchases which require credit support;

•

exposing NRG to the risk of increased interest rates because
    certain of its borrowings, including borrowings under its new
    senior secured credit facility are at variable rates of interest;

•

limiting NRG’s ability to obtain additional financing for
    working capital including collateral postings, capital
    expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and
    general corporate or other purposes; and

•

limiting NRG’s ability to adjust to changing market
    conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared
    to its competitors who have less debt.

The indentures for NRG’s notes and senior secured credit
    facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants that
    may limit the Company’s ability to return capital to
    stockholders or otherwise engage in activities that may be in
    its long-term best interests. NRG’s failure to comply with
    those covenants could result in an event of default which, if
    not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of
    the Company’s indebtedness.

In addition, NRG’s ability to arrange financing, either at
    the corporate level or at a non-recourse project-level
    subsidiary, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on
    numerous factors, including:

•

general economic and capital market conditions;

•

credit availability from banks and other financial institutions;

•

investor confidence in NRG, its partners and the regional
    wholesale power markets;

•

NRG’s financial performance and the financial performance
    of its subsidiaries;

•

NRG’s level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants
    in debt agreements;

•

maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;

•

cash flow; and

•

provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising
    capital.

NRG may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for
    these or other reasons. The failure to obtain additional capital
    from time to time may have a material adverse effect on its
    business and operations.

Goodwill
    and/or other intangible assets not subject to amortization that
    NRG has recorded in connection with its acquisitions are subject
    to mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result, the
    Company could be required to write off some or all of this
    goodwill and other intangible assets, which may adversely affect
    the Company’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
    FASB, Accounting Standard Number 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

, or SFAS 142, goodwill is not
    amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for
    impairment and other intangibles are also reviewed at least
    annually or more frequently, if certain conditions exist, and
    may be amortized. Any reduction in or impairment of the value of
    goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge
    against earnings which could materially adversely affect
    NRG’s reported results of operations and financial position
    in future periods.

Exelon
    Corporation’s unsolicited acquisition proposal and tender
    offer for all the Company’s outstanding common stock is
    disruptive to the Company’s management and business and
    creates uncertainty that may adversely affect our
    business.

On October 19, 2008, the Company received an unsolicited
    proposal from Exelon Corporation to acquire all of the
    outstanding shares of the Company and on November 12, 2008,
    Exelon announced a tender offer, referred to as the Exelon
    tender offer, for all of the Company’s outstanding common
    stock. NRG’s Board of Directors, after carefully reviewing
    the proposal, unanimously concluded that the proposal was not in
    the best interests of the



stockholders and has recommended that NRG stockholders not
    tender their shares. On January 30, 2009 Exelon also
    announced a proposed slate of nine nominees for election to
    NRG’s Board of Directors at the 2009 Annual Meeting of
    Stockholders, together with a proposal to increase the number of
    NRG directors from 12 to 19 with two vacancies, referred to as
    the Exelon proxy contest. The review and consideration of the
    Exelon tender offer and proxy contest, have been, and may
    continue to be, a significant distraction for our management and
    employees and have required, and may continue to require, the
    expenditure of significant time and resources by the Company.
    Exelon’s tender offer and proxy contest have also created
    uncertainty for the Company’s employees and this
    uncertainty may adversely affect the Company’s ability to
    retain key employees and to hire new talent. Exelon’s
    tender offer and proxy contest may also create uncertainty for
    current and potential business partners, which may cause them to
    terminate, or not to renew or enter into, arrangements with the
    Company. In addition, if the Exelon nominees are elected to
    NRG’s Board of Directors, the ability of management to work
    effectively and efficiently with NRG’s Board of Directors
    with respect to the day to day operations and development of the
    Company may be restricted, and as a result, may harm the
    Company’s business. Furthermore, the Company and its Board
    of Directors are defendants in three purported stockholder class
    action complaints relating to the Exelon proposal as more fully
    described in Part I, Item 3 “Legal
    Proceedings” of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

These lawsuits or any future similar or related lawsuits may
    become time consuming and expensive. These consequences, alone
    or in combination, may harm the Company’s business.

Exelon
    Corporation’s proxy contest, board expansion and director
    nominations could result in a Change of Control, as that term is
    used in the Company’s Senior Credit Facility and Senior
    Notes, which may adversely affect our business.

A default under the Company’s Senior Credit Facility and a
    mandatory change in control offer under the Senior Notes may be
    triggered if the Exelon nominees compose a majority of
    NRG’s Board of Directors at any time. A Change of Control
    under the Company’s Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes
    could occur if the two vacancies on NRG’s Board of
    Directors (created only if the Company’s shareholders
    approve Exelon’s proposal to the expand NRG’s Board of
    Directors to 19 members) are not filled by directors
    nominated by the current NRG Board. A Change of Control may also
    be triggered by other future events where the resulting
    composition of NRG’s Board of Directors consists of a
    majority of Exelon nominated directors, such as the retirement
    or death of any non-Exelon nominated Board member. If a Change
    of Control is triggered under the Senior Credit Facility and
    Senior Notes this could have a material and significant impact
    on the Company’s business.

    Proceedings

Exelon Corporation and Exelon Xchange Corporation v.
    Howard E. Cosgrove et al., Court of Chancery of the State of
    Delaware, Case

No. 4155-VCL

(filed November 11, 2008)

—

On November 11, 2008, Exelon
    Corporation, or Exelon, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Exelon
    Xchange, filed a complaint against NRG and NRG’s Board of
    Directors. The complaint alleges, among other things, that
    NRG’s Board of Directors failed to give due consideration
    and to take appropriate action in response to the acquisition
    proposal announced by Exelon on October 19, 2008, in which
    Exelon offered to acquire all of the outstanding shares of NRG
    common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.485 Exelon shares for
    each NRG common share. The complaint seeks, among other things,
    declaratory and injunctive relief: (1) declaring that
    NRG’s Board of Directors has breached its fiduciary duties
    to the NRG stockholders by rejecting and refusing to consider
    Exelon’s acquisition proposal and by failing to exempt the
    proposed transaction from application of Section 203 of the
    Delaware General Corporation Law; (2) compelling NRG’s
    Board of Directors to approve Exelon’s acquisition proposal
    for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General
    Corporations Law; (3) declaring that the adoption of any
    measure that would have the effect of impeding or interfering
    with Exelon’s acquisition proposal constitutes a breach of
    NRG’s Board of Directors fiduciary duties; and
    (4) enjoining the defendants from adopting any measures
    that would have the effect of impeding or interfering with
    Exelon’s acquisition proposal. On November 14, 2008,
    NRG and NRG’s Board of Directors filed a motion to dismiss
    Exelon’s complaint on the grounds that it fails to state a
    claim upon which relief can be granted. On January 28,
    2009, NRG and NRG’s Board of Directors filed their brief in
    support of their motion to dismiss.

    State of Delaware, Case

No. 4193-VCL

(filed November 25, 2008; served
    December 11, 2008)

—

The complaint
    alleges, among other things, that NRG’s Board of Directors
    failed to give due consideration and to take appropriate action
    in response to the acquisition proposal announced by Exelon on
    October 19, 2008, in which Exelon offered to acquire all of
    the outstanding shares of NRG common stock at an exchange ratio
    of 0.485 Exelon shares for each NRG common share. The complaint
    seeks, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief:
    (1) declaring that the action is a class action and
    certifying plaintiff as class plaintiff and plaintiff’s
    counsel as class counsel; (2) declaring that NRG’s
    Board of Directors has breached its fiduciary duties to the NRG
    stockholders by rejecting and refusing to consider Exelon’s
    acquisition proposal; (3) entering a mandatory injunction
    requiring NRG to exempt Exelon’s offer from
    Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; and
    (4) to the extent injunctive relief is not granted,
    awarding compensatory damages in favor of the Plaintiffs and
    other members of the class. On December 23, 2008, NRG and
    NRG’s Board of Directors filed a motion to dismiss the
    complaint on the grounds that it fails to state a claim upon
    which relief can be granted. On January 28, 2009, NRG and
    NRG’s Board of Directors filed their brief in support of
    their motion to dismiss.

Superior
    Court of New Jersey-Law Division, Mercer County, Docket

No. MER-C-137-08

—

Plaintiffs filed three separate
    complaints against NRG and NRG’s Board of Directors
    alleging, among other things, that NRG’s Board of Directors
    breached its fiduciary duties to NRG stockholders by failing to
    take action regarding the acquisition proposal announced by
    Exelon on October 19, 2008, in which Exelon offered to
    acquire all of the outstanding shares of NRG common stock at an
    exchange ratio of 0.485 Exelon shares for each NRG common share.
    On January 6, 2009, the three cases were consolidated and
    transferred to the Law Division of the Mercer County Superior
    Court. On January 21, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an Amended
    Consolidated Complaint in which they allege a single count of
    breach of fiduciary duty against NRG’s Board of Directors
    and seek injunctive relief: (1) declaring that the action
    is a class action and certifying plaintiffs as class plaintiffs
    and counsel as class counsel; (2) declaring that defendants
    breached their fiduciary duties by summarily rejecting the
    Exelon offer; (3) ordering defendants to negotiate with
    respect to the Exelon offer or with respect to another
    transaction to maximize shareholder value; (4) ordering
    defendants to exempt Exelon’s offer from Section 203
    of the Delaware General Corporation Law; (5) awarding
    compensatory damages including interest; (6) awarding
    plaintiffs costs and fees; and (7) granting other relief
    the Court deems proper. A response is due on or before
    February 20, 2009.

This matter concerns, among other
    contracts and other defendants, the California Department of
    Water Resources, or CDWR, and its wholesale power contract with
    subsidiaries of WCP (Generation) Holdings, Inc., or WCP. The
    case originated with a February 2002 complaint filed by the
    State of California alleging that many parties, including WCP
    subsidiaries, overcharged the State of California. For WCP, the
    alleged overcharges totaled approximately $940 million for
    2001 and 2002. The complaint demanded that the FERC abrogate the
    CDWR contract and sought refunds associated with revenues
    collected under the contract. In 2003, the FERC rejected this
    complaint, denied rehearing, and the case was appealed to the US
    Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, or Ninth Circuit, where
    oral argument was held on December 8, 2004. On
    December 19, 2006, the Ninth Circuit decided that in the
    FERC’s review of the contracts at issue, the FERC could not
    rely on the

Mobil-Sierra

standard presumption of just and
    reasonable rates, where such contracts were not reviewed by the
    FERC with full knowledge of the then existing market conditions.
    WCP and others sought review by the US Supreme Court. WCP’s
    appeal was not selected, but instead held by the Supreme Court.
    In the appeal that was selected by the Supreme Court, on
    June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court ruled (1) that the

Mobil-Sierra

public interest standard of review applied
    to contracts made under a seller’s market-based rate
    authority; (2) that the public interest “bar”
    required to set aside a contract remains a very high one to
    overcome; and (3) that the

Mobil-Sierra

presumption
    of contract reasonableness applies when a contract is formed
    during a period of market dysfunction unless (a) such
    market conditions were caused by the illegal actions of one of
    the parties or (b) the contract negotiations were tainted
    by fraud or duress. In this related case, the US Supreme Court
    affirmed the Ninth Circuit’s decision, agreeing that the
    case should be remanded to FERC to clarify FERC’s 2003
    reasoning regarding its rejection of the original complaint
    relating to the financial burdens under the contracts at issue
    and to alleged market manipulation at the time these contracts
    were formed. As a result, the US Supreme Court then reversed and
    remanded the WCP CDWR case to the Ninth Circuit for treatment
    consistent with its June 26, 2008, decision in the related
    case. On October 20, 2008, the Ninth Circuit asked the
    parties in the remanded CDWR case, including WCP and the FERC,
    whether that Court should answer a question the US Supreme Court
    did not address in its June 26, 2008, decision; whether the

Mobil-Sierra

doctrine applies to a third-party that was
    not a signatory to any of the wholesale power contracts,
    including the CDWR contract, at issue in the case. Without
    answering that reserved question, on December 4, 2008, the
    Ninth Circuit vacated its prior opinion and remanded the WCP
    CDWR case back to the FERC for proceedings consistent with the
    US Supreme Court’s June 26, 2008 decision. On
    December 15, 2008, WCP and the other seller-defendants
    filed with FERC a Motion of Order Governing Proceedings on
    Remand. On January 14, 2009, the Public Utilities
    Commission of the State of California filed an Answer and Cross
    Motion for an Order Governing Procedures on Remand, and on
    January 28, 2009, WCP and the other seller-defendants filed
    their reply.

At this time, while NRG cannot predict with certainty whether
    WCP will be required to make refunds for rates collected under
    the CDWR contract or estimate the range of any such possible
    refunds, a reconsideration of the CDWR contract by the FERC with
    a resulting order mandating significant refunds could have a
    material adverse impact on NRG’s financial position,
    statement of operations, and statement of cash flows. As part of
    the 2006 acquisition of Dynegy’s 50% ownership interest in
    WCP, WCP and NRG assumed responsibility for any risk of loss
    arising from this case, unless any such loss was deemed to have
    resulted from certain acts of gross negligence or willful
    misconduct on the part of Dynegy, in which case any such loss
    would be shared equally between WCP and Dynegy.

Additional Litigation —

In addition to
    the foregoing, NRG is party to other litigation or legal
    proceedings. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to
    the legal proceedings and investigations described above and
    intends to defend them vigorously. However, litigation is
    inherently subject to many uncertainties. There can be no
    assurance that additional litigation will not be filed against
    the Company or its subsidiaries in the future asserting similar
    or different legal theories and seeking similar or different
    types of damages and relief. Unless specified above, the Company
    is unable to predict the outcome these legal proceedings and
    investigations may have or reasonably estimate the scope or
    amount of any associated costs and potential liabilities. An
    unfavorable outcome in one or more of these proceedings could
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The
    Company also has indemnity rights for some of these proceedings
    to reimburse the Company for certain legal expenses and to
    offset certain amounts deemed to be owed in the event of an
    unfavorable litigation outcome.



Disputed Claims Reserve —

As part of
    NRG’s plan of reorganization, NRG funded a disputed claims
    reserve for the satisfaction of certain general unsecured claims
    that were disputed claims as of the effective date of the plan.
    Under the terms of the plan, as such claims are resolved, the
    claimants are paid from the reserve on the same basis as if they
    had been paid out in the bankruptcy. To the extent the aggregate
    amount required to be paid on the disputed claims exceeds the
    amount remaining in the funded claims reserve, NRG will be
    obligated to provide additional cash and common stock to satisfy
    the claims. Any excess funds in the disputed claims reserve will
    be reallocated to the creditor pool for the pro rata benefit of
    all allowed claims. The contributed common stock and cash in the
    reserves is held by an escrow agent to complete the distribution
    and settlement process. Since NRG has surrendered control over
    the common stock and cash provided to the disputed claims
    reserve, NRG recognized the issuance of the common stock as of
    December 6, 2003 and removed the cash amounts from the
    balance sheet. Similarly, NRG removed the obligations relevant
    to the claims from the balance sheet when the common stock was
    issued and cash contributed.

On April 3, 2006, the Company made a supplemental
    distribution to creditors under the Company’s
    Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan, totaling $25 million in
    cash and 5,082,000 shares of common stock. On
    December 18, 2008, NRG filed with the US Bankruptcy Courts
    for the Southern District of New York a Closing Report and an
    Application for Final Decree Closing the Chapter 11 Case
    for NRG Energy, Inc. et al and on December 29, 2008,
    the court entered the Final Decree. As of December 21,
    2008, the reserve held $9,776,880 in cash and
    1,282,783 shares of common stock. On December 21,
    2008, the Company issued an instruction letter to The Bank of
    New York Mellon to distribute all remaining cash and stock in
    the Disputed Claims Reserve to NRG’s creditors. On
    January 12, 2009, The Bank of New York Mellon commenced the
    distribution of all remaining cash and stock in the Disputed
    Claim Reserve to the Company’s creditors pursuant to
    NRG’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan.

Consists of NRG Energy, Inc.’s
    Long-Term Incentive Plan, or the LTIP, and NRG Energy,
    Inc.’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP. The LTIP
    became effective upon the Company’s emergence from
    bankruptcy. The LTIP was subsequently approved by the
    Company’s stockholders on August 4, 2004 and was
    amended on April 28, 2006 to increase the number of shares
    available for issuance to 16,000,000, on a post-split basis, and
    again on December 8, 2006 to make technical and
    administrative changes. The LTIP provides for grants of stock
    options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
    performance units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalent
    rights. NRG’s directors, officers and employees, as well as
    other individuals performing services for, or to whom an offer
    of employment has been extended by the Company, are eligible to
    receive grants under the LTIP. The purpose of the LTIP is to
    promote the Company’s long-term growth and profitability by
    providing these individuals with incentives to maximize
    stockholder value and otherwise contribute to the Company’s
    success and to enable the Company to attract, retain and reward
    the best available persons for positions of responsibility. The
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the
    LTIP. There were 6,798,074 and 7,941,758 shares of common
    stock remaining available for grants of awards under NRG’s
    LTIP as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    ESPP was approved by the Company’s stockholders on
    May 14, 2008. There were 500,000 shares reserved from
    the Company’s treasury shares for the ESPP. There were
    500,000 shares remaining under the ESPP as of
    December 31, 2008. In January 2009, 41,706 shares were
    issued to employees accounts from the treasury stock reserve for
    the ESPP.

    Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Price Index, or S&P 500,
    and the Philadelphia Utility Sector Index, or UTY. Upon the
    Company’s emergence from bankruptcy on December 5,
    2003 until March 24, 2004 NRG’s common stock traded on
    the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board. On March 25,
    2004, NRG’s common stock commenced trading on the New York
    Stock Exchange under the symbol “NRG”.

Energy revenue consists of revenues received from third parties
    for sales in the day-ahead and real-time markets, as well as
    bilateral sales. Beginning in 2006, energy revenues also
    included revenues from the settlement of financial instruments
    that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment.

Capacity revenue consists of revenues received from a third
    party at either the market or negotiated contract rates for
    making installed generation capacity available in order to
    satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements. In
    addition, capacity revenue includes revenue received under
    tolling arrangements, which entitle third parties to dispatch
    NRG’s facilities and assume title to the electrical
    generation produced from that facility.

Risk management activities includes fair value changes of
    economic hedges that did not qualify for cash flow hedge
    accounting, ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges and trading
    activities. It also includes the settlement of all derivative
    transactions that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting
    treatment. Prior to 2006, risk management activities included
    the settlement of financial instruments that qualified for cash
    flow hedge accounting treatment.

Thermal revenue consists of revenues received from the sale of
    steam, hot and chilled water generally produced at a central
    district energy plant and sold to commercial, governmental and
    residential buildings for space heating, domestic hot water
    heating and air conditioning. It also includes the sale of
    high-pressure steam produced and delivered to industrial
    customers that is used as part of an industrial process.

Contract amortization revenues consists of acquired power
    contracts, gas swaps, and certain power sales agreements assumed
    at Fresh Start and Texas Genco purchase accounting related to
    the sale of electric capacity and energy in future periods,
    which are amortized into revenue over the term of the underlying
    contracts based on actual generation or contracted volumes.

Hedge Reset is the impact from the net settlement of long-term
    power contracts and gas swaps by negotiating prices to current
    market. This transaction was completed in November 2006. See
    also Item 15 — Note 5,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion.

Other revenue primarily consists of operations and maintenance
    fees, or O&M fees, sale of natural gas and emission
    allowances, and revenue from ancillary services. O&M fees
    consist of revenues received from providing certain
    unconsolidated affiliates with services under long-term
    operating agreements. Ancillary services are comprised of the
    sale of energy-related products associated with the generation
    of electrical energy such as spinning reserves, reactive power
    and other similar products.

Executive
    Summary

Overview

NRG is a wholesale power generation company with a significant
    presence in major competitive power markets in the United
    States. NRG is engaged in the ownership, development,
    construction and operation of power generation facilities, the
    transacting in and trading of fuel and transportation services,
    and the trading of energy, capacity and related products in the
    regional markets in the United States and select international
    markets where its generating assets are located.

As of December 31, 2008, NRG had a total global portfolio
    of 189 active operating fossil fuel and nuclear generation
    units, at 48 power generation plants, with an aggregate
    generation capacity of approximately 24,005 MW, and
    approximately 550 MW under construction which includes
    partners’ interests of 275 MW. In addition, NRG has
    ownership interests in two wind farms representing an aggregate
    generation capacity of 270 MW, which includes partner
    interests of 75 MW. Within the US, NRG has one of the
    largest and most diversified power generation portfolios in
    terms of geography, fuel-type and dispatch levels, with
    approximately 22,925 MW of fossil fuel and nuclear
    generation capacity in 177 active generating units at 43 plants
    and ownership interests in two wind farms representing
    195 MW of wind generation capacity. These power generation
    facilities are primarily located in Texas (approximately
    11,010 MW, including the 195 MW from the two wind
    farms), the Northeast (approximately 7,020 MW), South
    Central (approximately 2,845 MW), and West (approximately
    2,130 MW) regions of the US, and approximately 115 MW
    of additional generation capacity from the Company’s
    thermal assets.



NRG’s principal domestic power plants consist of a mix of
    natural gas-, coal-, oil-fired, nuclear and wind facilities,
    representing approximately 45%, 33%, 16%, 5% and 1% of the
    Company’s total domestic generation capacity, respectively.
    In addition, 15% of NRG’s domestic generating facilities
    have dual or multiple fuel capacity, which allows plants to
    dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option.

NRG’s domestic generation facilities consist of
    intermittent, baseload, intermediate and peaking power
    generation facilities, the ranking of which is referred to as
    Merit Order, and include thermal energy production plants. The
    sale of capacity and power from baseload generation facilities
    accounts for the majority of the Company’s revenues and
    provides a stable source of cash flow. In addition, NRG’s
    generation portfolio provides the Company with opportunities to
    capture additional revenues by selling power during periods of
    peak demand, offering capacity or similar products to retail
    electric providers and others, and providing ancillary services
    to support system reliability.

NRG’s
    Business Strategy

NRG’s business strategy is designed to enhance the
    Company’s position as a leading wholesale power generation
    company in the US. NRG will continue to utilize its asset base
    as a platform for growth and development and as a source of cash
    flow generation which can be used for the return of capital to
    debt and equity holders. The Company’s strategy is focused
    on: (i) top decile operating performance of its existing
    operating assets and enhanced operating performance of the
    Company’s commercial operations and hedging program;
    (ii) repowering of power generation assets at existing
    sites and development of new power generation projects; and
    (iii) investment in energy-related new businesses and new
    technologies where such investments create low to no carbon.
    This strategy is supported by the Company’s five major
    initiatives (

FOR

NRG,

Repowering

NRG, econrg, Future
    NRG and NRG Global Giving) which are designed to enhance the
    Company’s competitive advantages in these strategic areas
    and allow the Company to surmount the challenges faced by the
    power industry in the coming years. This strategy is being
    implemented by focusing on the following principles:

Operational Performance

—

The
    Company is focused on increasing value from its existing assets.
    Through the

FOR

NRG

initiative, NRG will continue
    to focus on extracting value from its portfolio by improving
    plant performance, reducing costs and harnessing the
    Company’s advantages of scale in the procurement of fuels
    and other commodities, parts and services, and in doing so
    improving the Company’s return on invested capital, or
    ROIC.

FOR

NRG is a companywide effort designed to increase
    ROIC through operational performance improvements to the
    Company’s asset fleet, along with a range of initiatives at
    plants and at corporate offices to reduce costs, or in some
    cases, monetize or reduce excess working capital and other
    assets. The

FOR

NRG accomplishments include both recurring
    and one-time improvements measured from a prior base year. For
    plant operations, the program measures cumulative current year
    benefits using current gross margins multiplied by the change in
    baseline levels of certain key performance indicators. The plant
    performance benefits include both positive and negative results
    for plant reliability, capacity, heat rate and station service.

In addition to the

FOR

NRG initiative, the Company seeks
    to maximize profitability and manage cash flow volatility
    through the Company’s commercial operations strategy. The
    Company will continue to execute asset-based risk management,
    hedging, marketing and trading strategies within well-defined
    risk and liquidity guidelines in order to manage the value of
    the Company’s physical and contractual assets. The
    Company’s marketing and hedging philosophy is centered on
    generating stable returns from its portfolio of baseload power
    generation assets while preserving an ability to capitalize on
    strong spot market conditions and to capture the extrinsic value
    of the Company’s intermediate and peaking facilities and
    portions of its baseload fleet. NRG believes that it can
    successfully execute this strategy by leveraging its
    (i) expertise in marketing power and ancillary services,
    (ii) its knowledge of markets, (iii) its balanced
    financial structure and (iv) its diverse portfolio of power
    generation assets.

Finally, NRG remains focused on cash flow and maintaining
    appropriate levels of liquidity, debt and equity in order to
    ensure continued access to capital for investment, to enhance
    risk-adjusted returns and to provide flexibility in executing
    NRG’s business strategy during business downturns,
    including a regular return of capital to its shareholders. NRG
    will continue to focus on maintaining operational and financial
    controls designed to ensure that the Company’s financial
    position remains strong.



Development

—

NRG is favorably
    positioned to pursue growth opportunities through expansion of
    its existing generating capacity and development of new
    generating capacity at its existing facilities. NRG intends to
    invest in its existing assets through plant improvements,
    repowerings, brownfield development and site expansions to meet
    anticipated requirements for additional capacity in NRG’s
    core markets. Through the

Repowering

NRG

initiative, NRG will continue to develop, construct and
    operate new and enhanced power generation facilities at its
    existing sites, with an emphasis on new baseload capacity that
    is supported by long-term power sales agreements and financed
    with limited or non-recourse project financing.

Repowering

NRG is a comprehensive portfolio redevelopment
    program designed to develop, construct and operate new
    multi-fuel, multi-technology, highly efficient and
    environmentally responsible generation capacity over the next
    decade. Through this initiative, the Company anticipates
    retiring certain existing units and adding new generation to
    meet growing demand in the Company’s core markets, with an
    emphasis on new capacity that is expected to be supported by
    long-term hedging programs, including PPAs, and financed with
    limited or non-recourse project financing. NRG expects that
    these efforts will provide one or more of the following
    benefits: improved heat rates; lower delivered costs; expanded
    electricity production capability; an improved ability to
    dispatch economically across the regional general portfolio;
    increased technological and fuel diversity; and reduced
    environmental impacts, including facilities that either have
    near zero greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions or can be equipped
    to capture and sequester GHG emissions.

New Businesses and New Technology

—

NRG is focused on the development and
    investment in energy-related new businesses and new technologies
    where the benefits of such investments represent significant
    commercial opportunities and create a comparative advantage for
    the Company, including low or no GHG emitting energy generating
    sources, such as nuclear, wind, solar thermal, photovoltaic,
    “clean” coal and gas, and the employment of
    post-combustion carbon capture technologies. In 2008, the
    Company began to increase its focus on ways to invest in or
    support the development of new energy-related businesses and
    technologies that could advance its multi-fuel, multi-technology
    growth strategy and look for new ways to reduce carbon emissions
    from its overall fleet, and we expect to continue to do so in
    the future. Furthermore, the Company intends to capitalize on
    the high growth opportunities presented by government-mandated
    renewable portfolio standards, tax incentives and loan
    guaranties for renewable energy projects and new technologies
    and expected future carbon regulation. A primary focus of this
    strategy is supported by the

econrg

initiative whereby
    NRG is pursuing investments in new generating facilities and
    technologies that will be highly efficient and will employ no
    and low carbon technologies to limit
    CO


emissions and other air emissions. econrg represents NRG’s
    commitment to environmentally responsible power generation by
    addressing the challenges of climate change, clean air and
    water, and conservation of our natural resources while taking
    advantage of business opportunities that may inure to NRG as a
    result of our demonstration and deployment of “green”
    technologies. Within NRG, econrg builds upon a foundation in
    environmental compliance and embraces environmental initiatives
    for the benefit of our communities, employees and shareholders,
    such as encouraging investment in new environmental
    technologies, pursuing activities that preserve and protect the
    environment and encouraging changes in the daily lives of the
    Company’s employees.

Company-Wide Initiatives

—

In
    addition, the Company’s overall strategy is also supported
    by

Future NRG

and

NRG Global Giving

initiatives.
    Future NRG is the Company’s workforce planning and
    development initiative and represents NRG’s strong
    commitment to planning for future staffing requirements to meet
    the on-going needs of the Company’s current operations in
    addition to the Company’s

Repowering

NRG initiatives.
    Future NRG encompasses analyzing the demographics, skill set and
    size of the Company’s workforce in addition to the
    organizational structure with a focus on succession planning,
    training, development, staffing and recruiting needs. Included
    under the Future NRG umbrella is NRG University, which provides
    leadership, managerial, supervisory and technical training
    programs and individual skill development courses. NRG Global
    Giving is designed to enhance respect for the community, which
    is one of NRG’s core values. Our Global Giving Program
    invests NRG’s resources to strengthen the communities where
    we do business and seeks to make community investments in four
    focus areas: community and economic development, education,
    environment and human welfare.

Finally, NRG will continue to pursue selective acquisitions,
    joint ventures and divestitures to enhance its asset mix and
    competitive position in the Company’s core markets. NRG
    intends to concentrate on opportunities that present attractive
    risk-adjusted returns. NRG will also opportunistically pursue
    other strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions or
    divestitures.



Business
    Environment

General Industry

— Trends impacting the power
    industry include (i) the continued constrained credit and
    capital markets along with deepening recessionary environment,
    and (ii) increased regulatory and political scrutiny. The
    industry dynamics and external influences that will affect the
    Company and the power generation industry in 2009 and for the
    medium term include:

Financial Credit Market Availability and Domestic
    Recession —

A sharp economic downturn in the US
    and overseas during 2008 was prompted by a combination of
    factors: tight credit markets, speculation and fear regarding
    the health of the US and global financial systems, and weaker
    economic activity including a global economic recession. Power
    generation companies are capital intensive and, as such, rely on
    the credit markets for liquidity and for the financing of power
    generation investments. In addition, economic recessions
    historically result in lower power demand, power prices, and
    fuel prices. NRG has a diversified liquidity program, with
    $3.4 billion in total liquidity, excluding funds deposited
    by counterparties, and a first and second lien structure that
    enables significant strategic hedging while reducing
    requirements for the posting of cash or letters of credit as
    collateral. NRG expects to continue to manage commodity price
    volatility through its strategic hedging program, under which
    the Company expects to hedge revenues and fuel costs. This
    program should provide the Company with the flexibility to enter
    into hedges opportunistically, such as when gas prices are
    increasing, while at the same time protecting NRG against
    longer-term volatility in the commodity markets. The Company
    believes that an economic recession is unlikely to have material
    impact on the Company’s cash generation in the near term
    due to the hedged position of its portfolio. NRG transacts with
    a diversified pool of counterparties and actively manages our
    exposure to any single counterparty. See also Part II,
    Item 7 — Liquidity and Capital Resources, and
    Part II, Item 7a — Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a further
    discussion.

Consolidation

— Over the long-term, industry
    consolidation is expected to occur, with mergers and
    acquisitions activity in the power generation sector likely to
    involve utility-merchant or merchant-merchant combinations.
    There may also be interest by foreign power companies,
    particularly European utilities, in the American power
    generation sector.

Climate Change

— There is a marked shift
    towards federal action to address climate change under the Obama
    administration, which has made clear its intention to make
    climate change policy a priority for the US through legislation,
    regulation, and global leadership. President Obama reiterated
    this commitment in his inaugural address. Congressman Waxman,
    who sees aggressive action on climate change as a major
    priority, was elected chair of the House Energy and Commerce
    Committee and announced that a climate change bill would be
    delivered out of committee before Memorial Day.

Regional efforts have gained momentum as well. The RGGI
    CO


cap-and-trade program for electric generating units went into
    effect on January 1, 2009. California, the Western Climate
    Initiative, and the Midwest GHG Accord continue to develop
    market based programs in their respective jurisdictions.

Since fossil fueled power plants, particularly coal-fired
    plants, are a significant source of GHG emissions both in the US
    and globally, it is almost certain that future GHG legislative
    and regulatory actions will encompass power plants as well as
    other GHG emitting stationary sources. In 2008, in the course of
    producing approximately 80 million MWh of electricity,
    NRG’s power plants emitted 68 million tonnes of
    CO


,
    of which 61 million tonnes were emitted in the US,
    4 million tonnes in Germany, and 3 million tonnes in
    Australia. NRG emissions subject to RGGI were 12 million
    tonnes in 2008. Federal, state or regional regulation of GHG
    emissions could have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial performance. The actual impact on the Company’s
    financial performance will depend on a number of factors,
    including the overall level of GHG reductions required under any
    such regulations, the degree to which offsets may be used for
    compliance and their price and availability, and the extent to
    which NRG would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances
    without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open
    market. Thereafter, the impact would depend on the level of
    success of the Company’s multifold strategy, which includes
    (a) shaping public policy with the objective being
    constructive and effective federal GHG regulatory policy, and
    (b) pursuing its

Repowering

NRG and econrg programs.
    The Company’s multifold strategy is discussed in greater
    detail in Item 1,

Business

under Carbon Update.



Infrastructure Development

— In response to
    record peak power demand, tightening reserve margins, and
    volatile natural gas prices experienced in recent years, the
    power generation industry has added significant capacity for
    both transmission and generation. In addition to traditional
    gas-fired capacity, much of the new generation would be from
    non-fossil fuel sources, including nuclear and renewable
    sources. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created financial
    incentives for non-traditional baseload generation, such as
    advance nuclear and “clean” coal technologies in order
    to reduce reliance on the more traditional pulverized coal
    technologies. During 2007, 18 gigawatts of previously announced
    pulverized coal generation projects were canceled due to
    increasing public and political concern regarding carbon
    emissions limiting the pace of development. During 2008, the
    credit market crisis severely constrained the industry’s
    ability to finance power projects. Despite the challenges
    presented by financing availability and carbon legislation
    constraints, NRG believes the long-term demand for power
    generation will continue to require new generation.

Competition

Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive,
    commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants.
    NRG competes on the basis of the location of its plants and
    owning multiple plants in its regions, which increases the
    stability and reliability of its energy supply. Wholesale power
    generation is basically a local business that is currently
    highly fragmented relative to other commodity industries and
    diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide
    variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and
    identity of the companies NRG competes against depending on the
    market.

Weather

Weather conditions in the different regions of the US influence
    the financial results of NRG’s businesses. Weather
    conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and
    fuels. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price
    of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward
    markets, which may affect the Company’s results in any
    given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity
    is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when
    temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of
    natural gas and oil are higher in the winter. However, all
    regions of North America typically do not experience extreme
    weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG is typically not
    exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its
    business at once.

Other
    Factors

A number of other factors significantly influence the level and
    volatility of prices for energy commodities and related
    derivative products for NRG’s business. These factors
    include:

•

seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand;

•

extreme peak demands;

•

available supply resources;

•

transportation and transmission availability and reliability
    within and between regions;

•

location of NRG’s generating facilities relative to the
    location of its load-serving opportunities;

•

procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical
    electricity system during extreme conditions; and

•

changes in the nature and extent of federal and state
    regulations.

These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices
    in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may
    vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences
    in:

•

weather conditions;

•

market liquidity;

•

capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas
    systems;



•

local transportation systems; and

•

the nature and extent of electricity deregulation.

    the Company’s financial results.

Impact
    of inflation on NRG’s results

Unless discussed specifically in the relevant segment, for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the impact of
    inflation and changing prices (due to changes in exchange rates)
    on NRG’s revenues and income from continuing operations was
    immaterial.

Capital
    Allocation Program

NRG’s capital allocation philosophy includes reinvestment
    in its core facilities, maintenance of prudent debt levels and
    interest coverage, the regular return of capital to shareholders
    and investment in repowering opportunities. Each of these
    components are described further as follows:

•

Reinvestment in existing assets — Opportunities to
    invest in the existing business, including maintenance and
    environmental capital expenditures that improve operational
    performance, ensure compliance with environmental laws and
    regulations, and expansion projects.

•

Management of debt levels — The Company uses several
    metrics to measure the efficiency of its capital structure and
    debt balances, including the Company’s targeted net debt to
    total capital ratio range of 45% to 60% and certain cash flow
    and interest coverage ratios. The Company intends in the normal
    course of business to continue to manage its debt levels towards
    the lower end of the range and may, from time to time, pay down
    its debt balances for a variety of reasons.

•

Return of capital to shareholders — The Company’s
    debt instruments include restrictions on the amount of capital
    that can be returned to shareholders. The Company has in the
    past returned capital to shareholders while maintaining
    compliance with existing debt agreements and indentures. The
    Company expects to regularly return capital to shareholders
    through opportunistic share repurchases, while exploring other
    prospects to increase its flexibility under restrictive debt
    covenants.

•

Repowering, econrg and new build opportunities — The
    Company intends to pursue repowering initiatives that enhance
    and diversify its portfolio and provide a targeted economic
    return to the Company.

On October 30, 2008, the Company announced its 2009 Capital
    Allocation Plan to purchase an additional $300 million in
    common stock, subject to restrictions under the US securities
    laws. As part of the 2009 program, the Company will invest over
    $511 million in maintenance and environmental capital
    expenditures in the existing assets in 2009 and
    $256 million in investment in projects under

Repowering

NRG that are currently under construction or
    for which there exists current obligations. Finally, in addition
    to scheduled debt amortization payment, in the first quarter
    2009 the Company will offer its first lien lenders
    $197 million of its 2008 excess cash flow (as defined in
    the Senior Credit Facility).



Significant
    events during the year ended December 31, 2008

Results
    of Operations and Financial Condition

•

Mark-to-market gains

— The Company’s risk
    management activities recognized $414 million in
    mark-to-market gains driven by lower energy prices due to the
    downward trend in natural gas prices during the second half
    2008. High price volatility in energy related commodities during
    2008 drove the extreme volatility reported in NRG interim
    results of operations and consolidated balance sheets during the
    second and third quarters of 2008, due to the commodities’
    impact on the fair value of our derivative contracts.

•

Liquidity Position

— The Company’s total
    liquidity rose $1.4 billion as the declining natural gas
    prices increased funds deposited by counterparties by
    $754 million. Cash balances grew by $362 million since
    the end of 2007 as $1.4 billion of cash provided by
    operating activities exceeded cash used for all phases of the
    Company’s Capital Allocation Program, including
    $899 million of capital expenditures, $185 million in
    treasury share payments and a $214 million net debt
    reduction.

•

Higher energy prices

— Energy revenues rose 6%
    as a result of strong operating performance at the power plants
    which allowed the Company to sell generation at higher energy
    prices especially in the second quarter 2008.

•

Higher capacity revenues

— Capacity revenues
    rose $163 million as a result of a greater portion of Texas
    baseload contracts having a capacity component.

•

Sale of ITISA

— On April 28, 2008, NRG
    completed the sale of its interest in a 156 MW
    hydroelectric power plant to Brookfield Renewable Power Inc. The
    Company recognized a $164 million after tax gain on the
    sale and received $300 million of cash proceeds. See
    Item 15 — Note 3,

Discontinued
    Operations

,

Business Acquisition and Dispositions,

for a further discussion of the activities of ITISA that
    have been classified as discontinued operations.

•

Reduced development costs

— As of
    January 1, 2008, the company began to capitalize the STP
    units 3 and 4 costs following the docketing of the COLA which
    resulted in decline of development costs of $52 million.

•

Lower other income

— Interest income decreased
    by $25 million as the result of lower market interest rates
    on cash deposits. In addition, the Company recorded an
    impairment charge of $23 million to restructure distressed
    investments in commercial paper.

•

Lower interest expense

— Interest expense
    decreased $69 million as the result of the interest savings
    on the $531 million debt repayments beginning December 2007
    accompanied by a reduction of variable interest rates on
    long-term debt.

Other

•

NINA

— In March 2008, NRG formed NINA, an NRG
    subsidiary focused on marketing, siting, developing, financing
    and investing in new advanced design nuclear projects in select
    markets across North America, including the planned STP units 3
    and 4 that NRG is developing on a 50/50 basis with CPS Energy.
    TANE will serve as the prime contractor on all of NINA’s
    projects, and has partnered with NRG on the NINA venture, and
    received a 12% equity ownership in NINA in exchange for a
    $300 million investment in NINA in six annual installments
    of $50 million, the first of which was received during 2008
    and the last three of which are subject to certain conditions.
    On February 12, 2009, the Company announced that NINA
    completed negotiations for the EPC agreement with TANE to build
    the STP expansion. Concurrent with the execution of the EPC
    agreement, NINA will enter into a $500 million credit
    facility with Toshiba to finance the cost of long-lead materials
    for STP 3 and 4.



•

Unsolicited Exelon Proposal

— On
    October 19, 2008, the Company received an unsolicited
    proposal from Exelon Corporation to acquire all of the
    outstanding shares of the Company and on November 12, 2008,
    Exelon announced a tender offer for all of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock. On January 7, 2009, Exelon
    extended the tender offer to February 25, 2009, and
    indicated that further extensions may follow. NRG’s Board
    of Directors, after carefully reviewing the proposal,
    unanimously concluded that the proposal was not in the best
    interests of the stockholders and has recommended that NRG
    stockholders not tender their shares. In addition, on
    January 30, 2009 Exelon announced a proposed slate of nine
    nominees for election to the NRG Board at the 2009 Annual
    Meeting of Stockholders, together with a proposal to increase
    the number of NRG directors from 12 to 19.

Sherbino Wind Farm

— On October 22, 2008,
    NRG and its 50/50 joint venture partner, BP, announced the
    completion of its 150 MW Sherbino wind farm. Since NRG has
    a 50 percent ownership, Sherbino will provide the Company a
    net capacity of 75 MW.

•

Elbow Creek Wind Farm

— On December 29,
    2008, NRG, through Padoma, announced the completion of its Elbow
    Creek project, a wholly-owned 120 MW wind farm in Howard
    County near Big Spring, Texas. The Company funded and developed
    this wind farm which consists of 53 Siemens wind turbine
    generators, each capable of generating up to 2.3 MW of
    power.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $896 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007. This was due to:

•

Energy revenues

— increased $254 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the
    same period in 2007:

o

Texas

— increased $172 million, with
    $219 million of this increase driven by higher prices,
    offset by $47 million reduced generation. The price
    variance was attributable to a more favorable mix of merchant
    versus contract sales, as well as a 28% increase in merchant
    prices partially offset by a 14% decrease in contract energy
    prices. The 839 thousand MWh or 2% reduction in generation was
    comprised of a 3% reduction from nuclear plant generation, a 14%
    reduction from gas plant generation, offset by a 1% increase in
    coal plant generation. The reduction in gas plant generation was
    attributable to the effects of hurricane Ike in September 2008.

o

Northeast

— decreased $40 million, with
    $66 million reduced generation offset by a $26 million
    increase driven by higher energy prices. The decline due to
    generation was driven by a net 6% reduction in the
    region’s generation, due to a decrease in oil-fired
    generation as a result of higher average oil prices as well as
    decrease in gas-fired generation related to a cooler summer in
    2008 compared to 2007. The increase due to energy prices
    reflects an average 6% rise in merchant energy prices offset by
    lower contract revenue, driven by higher costs required to
    service the PJM contracts, as a result of the increase in market
    energy prices.

o

South Central

— increased $74 million,
    attributable to higher merchant energy revenues. The growth in
    merchant energy revenues reflected 577 thousand more merchant
    MWh sold, as a decrease in contract load MWh allowed more sales
    to the merchant market at higher prices.

o

West

— increased $35 million due to the
    dispatch of the El Segundo plant outside of the tolling
    agreement in 2008. In 2007, no such dispatch occurred.

•

Capacity revenues

— increased $163 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the
    same period in 2007:

o

Texas

— increased $130 million due to a
    greater proportion of base-load contracts, which contain a
    capacity component.

o

Northeast

— increased $13 million
    reflecting $31 million higher capacity revenues in the PJM
    and NEPOOL markets offset by a $18 million reduction in
    capacity revenue in NYISO.

o

South Central

— increased $12 million due
    to a $10 million higher capacity payment from the
    region’s cooperative customers and an $8 million rise
    in RPM capacity payments from the PJM market. These increases
    were offset by a $6 million reduction related to lower
    contract volume to other customers.

o

West

— increased $3 million due to a
    tolling arrangement at Long Beach plant offset by the reduction
    of revenue from the El Segundo tolling arrangement.

•

Contract amortization revenues

— increased
    $36 million during the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to the same period in 2007 due to the volume of
    contracted energy affected by a greater spread between contract
    prices and market prices used in the Texas Genco purchase
    accounting.

•

Other revenues

— increased by $40 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the
    same period in 2007. The increases arose from greater ancillary
    services revenue of $28 million and increased activity in
    the trading of emission allowances and carbon financial
    instruments of $21 million. These increases were offset by
    $14 million in lower gas and coal trading activities.



•

Risk management activities —

revenues from risk
    management activities include economic hedges that did not
    qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, ineffectiveness on cash
    flow hedges and trading activities. Such revenues increased by
    $414 million during the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to the same period in 2007. The breakdown of changes by
    region was as follows:

NRG’s 2008 gain is comprised of $525 million of
    mark-to-market gains and $107 million in settled losses, or
    financial revenue. Of the $525 million of mark-to-market
    gains, the $38 million loss represents the reversal of

mark-to-market

gains recognized on economic hedges and the $32 million
    loss represents the reversal of mark-to-market gains recognized
    on trading activity. Both of these losses ultimately settled as
    financial revenues during 2008. The $500 million gain from
    economic hedge positions included a $524 million increase
    in value of forward sales of electricity as the result of the
    reduction in forward power and gas prices at the close of the
    year-ended December 31, 2008. These hedges are considered
    effective economic hedges that do not receive cash flow hedge
    accounting treatment. In addition there was a $24 million
    loss primarily from hedge accounting ineffectiveness related to
    gas trades in the Texas region which was driven by decreasing
    forward gas prices while forward power prices declined at a
    slower pace. NRG also recognized a $95 million unrealized
    gain associated with the company’s trading activity. This
    gain was primarily due to declining forward electricity and fuel
    prices.

Since these hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk
    of commodity price movements on revenues the changes in such
    results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather should be
    taken together with the effects of pricing and cost changes on
    energy revenues. During and throughout 2008, NRG hedged a
    portion of the Company’s 2008 through 2013 generation.
    Since that time, the settled and forward prices of electricity
    and natural gas have decreased, resulting in the recognition of
    unrealized mark-to-market forward gains.

Cost
    of Operations

Cost of operations increased $220 million during the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in
    2007 but it decreased as a percentage of revenues from 56% for
    the year ended 2007 compared to 52% for the year ended 2008.

•

Cost of energy

— increased $213 million during
    the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in
    2007 and as a percentage of revenue it decreased from 41% for
    2007 as compared to 38% for 2008. This increase was due to :

o

Texas

— Cost of energy increased
    $59 million due to a net increase in fuel expense and
    ancillary service costs offset by reductions in nuclear fuel
    expenses, purchased power expense and amortization of contracts
    cost.



—

Fuel expense

— Natural gas costs rose
    $99 million due to an increase of 28% in average natural
    gas prices, offset by a 14% decrease in gas-fired generation. In
    addition, coal costs increased by $44 million a result of
    higher coal prices and the settlement payment related to a coal
    contract dispute. These increases were offset by a decrease of
    $19 million in nuclear fuel expense as amortization of
    nuclear fuel inventory established under Texas Genco purchase
    accounting ended in early 2008.

—

Purchased energy

— Purchased energy expense
    decreased $26 million as a result of lower forced outage
    rates at the region’s base-load plants.

—

Ancillary service expense

— Ancillary services
    and other costs increased by $14 million as a result of
    higher ERCOT ISO fees offset by reduced purchased ancillary
    services costs.

—

Fuel contract amortization

— Amortized contract
    costs decreased by $59 million due to a $36 million
    decrease in the amortization of water supply contracts which
    ended in 2007. In addition, the amortization of coal contracts
    decreased by a net $22 million as a result of a reduction
    in expense related to in-the-money coal contract amortization.
    These contracts were established under Texas Genco purchase
    accounting.

o

Northeast

— Cost of energy increased
    $54 million due to higher fuel costs. Coal costs increased
    $61 million due to higher coal prices and fuel
    transportation surcharges. Natural gas costs rose
    $22 million as a result of 32% higher average natural gas
    prices, despite 12% lower generation. These increases were
    offset by a $27 million reduction in oil costs as a result
    of 55% lower oil-fired generation.

o

South Central

— Cost of energy increased
    $56 million due to higher fuel costs and increased
    purchased energy expense.

—

Fuel expense

— Coal costs increased
    $16 million resulting from an increase in coal consumption
    and higher fuel transportation surcharges; natural gas costs
    rose by $14 million as the region’s peaker plants ran
    extensively to support transmission system stability after
    hurricane Gustav.

—

Purchased energy

— Higher purchased energy
    expenses of $16 million reflected higher natural gas costs
    for tolling contracts.

—

Transmission costs

— Increased by
    $9 million due to additional point-to-point transmission
    costs driven by an increase in merchant energy sales.

o

West

— Cost of energy increased
    $30 million due to the dispatch of the El Segundo plant
    outside of the tolling agreement in 2008. In 2007, no such
    dispatch occurred.

•

Other operating costs —

increased
    $7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008
    compared to the same period in 2007. This increase was due to:

o

Texas

— increased $30 million due to a
    second planned outage at STP and the acceleration of planned
    outages at the base-load plants.

o

Northeast —

decreased $3 million due to
    $18 million lower operating and maintenance expenses
    resulting from less outage work at the Norwalk plants and Indian
    River plants. This was offset by a $16 million increase in
    utilities cost. The 2007 utilities cost included a benefit of
    $19 million due to a lower than planned settlement of the
    station service agreement with CL&P.

o

South Central —

decreased by $10 million
    due to reduction in major maintenance expense. The 2007 expense
    included more extensive outage work that was performed at Big
    Cajun II plant.

o

West —

decreased by $4 million due to a
    $3 million reduction in lease expenses and an environmental
    liability of $2 million which was recognized in 2007
    related to the El Segundo plant.



General
    and Administrative

NRG’s G&A costs for the year ended December 31,
    2008, increased by $10 million compared to 2007, and as a
    percentage of revenues was 5% in both 2008 and 2007.

•

Wage and benefit costs —

increased
    $19 million attributable to higher wages and related
    benefits cost increases.

•

Consultant cost —

increased by $3 million
    resulting from $8 million spent on Exelon’s exchange
    offer offset by a $5 million reduction in information
    technology consultants.

•

Franchise tax —

The Company’s Louisiana
    state franchise tax decreased by approximately $4 million.
    Prior year franchise tax was assessed based on the
    Company’s total debt and equity that increased
    significantly following the acquisition of Texas Genco.

•

Insurance cost —

decreased by $4 million
    due to favorable rates.

Development
    Costs

NRG’s development costs for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 decreased by $55 million compared to
    2007. These costs were due to the Company’s

Repowering

NRG projects:

•

Texas STP units 3 and 4 projects

— No
    development expense was reflected in results of operations for
    2008 as NRG began to capitalize STP units 3 and 4 development
    costs incurred after January 1, 2008, following the
    NRC’s docketing of the Company’s COLA in late 2007.
    The Company recorded $52 million in development expenses
    during 2007.

•

Wind projects

— The Company incurred
    $21 million in costs related to wind development which is a
    $4 million decrease from the same period in 2007.

•

Other projects

— The Company incurred
    $25 million in development costs related to other domestic

Repowering

NRG projects in 2008, which decreased
    $7 million from the same period in 2007 as a result of the
    capitalization of costs to develop the El Segundo Energy Center
    in 2008.

Gain
    on Sale of Assets

The Company reported no gains on sales of assets for 2008. For
    2007, NRG’s gain on the sale of assets was
    $17 million. On January 3, 2007, NRG completed the
    sale of the Company’s Red Bluff and Chowchilla II
    power plants resulting in a pre-tax gain of $18 million.

Equity
    in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates

NRG’s equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for
    the year ended December 31, 2008, increased by
    $5 million compared to 2007. This increase was due to a
    $9 million mark-to-market unrealized gain on a forward
    contract for a natural gas swap executed to hedge the future
    power generation of Sherbino, offset by a $4 million
    reduction in earnings from international equity investments.

Other
    Income, Net

NRG’s other income, net decreased by $38 million for
    2008 compared to the same period in 2007. The Company recorded a
    further $23 million impairment charge in 2008 to
    restructure distressed investments in commercial paper, for
    which an $11 million impairment charge was taken in the
    fourth quarter of 2007. This 2008 impairment charge, along with
    cash receipts of $2 million, reduced the carrying value of
    the commercial paper to $7 million. In addition, the 2008
    results reflect reduced interest income of $25 million from
    lower market interest rates on cash deposits.



Interest
    Expense

NRG’s interest expense decreased by $69 million for
    2008 compared to the same period in 2007. This decrease was due
    to interest savings on $531 million debt repayments
    accompanied by a reduction on the variable interest rates on
    long-term debt. The debt repayments included a $300 million
    prepayment in December 2007 and an additional payment of
    $143 million in March 2008 of the Term Loan Facility in
    connection with the mandatory offer under the Senior Credit
    Facility. Interest capitalized on

Repowering

NRG projects
    under construction also contributed to this decrease in interest
    expense. Offsetting this decrease was the $45 million
    payment made to the Credit Suisse Group, or CS, for the benefit
    of NRG Common Stock Finance I LLC, or CSF I, in August 2008
    to early settle the embedded derivative in the Company’s
    CSF I notes and preferred interests.

NRG has interest rate swaps with the objective of fixing the
    interest rate on a portion of NRG’s Senior Credit Facility.
    These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under
    SFAS 133, and the impact associated with ineffectiveness
    was immaterial to NRG financial results. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, NRG had a deferred loss of
    $90 million in other comprehensive income compared to a
    deferred loss of $31 million in 2007.

Refinancing
    Expense

There was no refinancing activity in 2008. In 2007, NRG
    completed a $4.4 billion refinancing of the Company’s
    Senior Credit Facility, resulting in a charge of
    $35 million from the write-off of deferred financing costs
    as the lenders for 45% of the Term Loan Facility either exited
    the financing or reduced their holdings and were replaced by
    other institutions.

Income
    Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased by $336 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007. The effective
    tax rate was 41.2% and 39.9% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively

The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to:

•

Increase in income

— pre-tax income increased
    by $783 million, with a corresponding increase of
    $305 million in income tax expense.



•

Permanent differences

— the Company’s
    effective tax rate differs from the US statutory rate of 35% due
    to:

o

Taxable dividends from foreign subsidiaries

— due to the provision of deferred taxes in 2008
    on foreign income no longer expected to be permanently
    reinvested overseas offset by decreased dividends from foreign
    operations in the current year, tax expense increased by
    approximately $6 million as compared to 2007.

o

Non-deductible interest on CAGR Settlement

— the Company’s $45 million settlement
    of the embedded derivative in its CSF I notes and preferred
    interests resulted in an additional income tax expense of
    $16 million in 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007.

o

Change in German tax rate

— as a result of
    revaluing our deferred tax assets, income tax expense benefited
    by $29 million in 2007, with no comparable benefit in 2008.

o

Valuation Allowance

— the Company generated
    capital gains in 2008 primarily due to the sale of ITISA and
    derivative contracts that are eligible for capital treatment for
    tax purposes. These gains enabled NRG to reduce our valuation
    allowance against capital loss carryforwards. In addition,
    applicable changes to the state and local effective tax rate are
    captured in the current period. This resulted in a decrease of
    $18 million income tax expense in 2008 as compared to 2007.

o

Change in state effective tax rate

— the
    Company reduced its domestic state and local deferred income tax
    rate from 7% to 6% in the current period.

The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period
    depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business
    mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances
    in accordance with SFAS 109. These factors and others,
    including the Company’s history of pre-tax earnings and
    losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to
    realize deferred tax assets.

Income
    from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax
    Expense

Discontinued operations included ITISA results for 2008 and the
    same period in 2007. NRG classifies as discontinued operations
    the income from operations and gains/losses recognized on the
    sale of projects that were sold or have met the required
    criteria for such classification pending final disposition. For
    2008 and the same period in 2007, NRG recorded income from
    discontinued operations, net of income tax expense, of
    $172 million and $17 million, respectively. NRG closed
    the sale of ITISA during the second quarter 2008 and recognized
    an after-tax gain of $164 million.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $404 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This was due to:

•

Energy revenues

— Energy revenues increased by
    $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006:

o

Texas

— energy revenues increased by
    $972 million, of which $217 million was due to the
    inclusion of twelve months activity in 2007 compared to eleven
    months in 2006. Of the remaining $755 million increase,
    $449 million was due to the Hedge Reset transaction which
    resulted in higher 2007 average contracted prices of
    approximately $13 per MWh. In addition, revenues from
    8.8 million MWh of generation moved from capacity revenue
    to energy revenue. Prior to the Acquisition, PUCT regulations
    required that Texas sell 15% of its capacity by auction at
    reduced rates. In March 2006, the PUCT accepted NRG’s
    request to no longer participate in these auctions and that
    capacity is now being sold in the merchant market. These
    favorable results were partially offset by lower sales from the
    region’s natural gas-fired units due to a cooler summer
    which resulted in lower generation of approximately
    2.7 million MWh.

o

Northeast

— energy revenues increased by
    approximately $138 million, of which $61 million was
    due to a 6% increase in generation, primarily driven by
    increases at the region’s Arthur Kill, Oswego and Indian
    River plants. The Arthur Kill plant increased generation by 448
    thousand MWh due to transmission constraints around New York
    City, the Oswego plants’ generation increased by 127
    thousand MWh due to a colder winter during 2007 compared to
    2006, and the Indian River plants’ generation increased by
    418 thousand MWh due to stronger pricing and fewer outages
    in the second half of 2007 compared to the second half of 2006.

o

South Central

— energy revenues increased by
    approximately $70 million, due to a new contract which
    increased contract sales volume by approximately
    1.3 million MWh and energy revenues by $69 million.
    Following a contractual fuel adjustment charge, energy revenues
    increased by $11 million from the region’s cooperative
    customers. This was offset by a $12 million decrease in
    merchant energy revenue.

o

West

— energy revenues decreased by
    approximately $72 million, excluding the first quarter
    2007, due to the tolling agreement at the Encina plant that has
    resulted in the receipt of fixed monthly capacity payment in
    return for the right to schedule and dispatch from the plant.
    The Encina tolling agreement replaced an RMR agreement under
    which the plant was called upon to generate and earn energy
    revenues for such dispatch.

•

Capacity revenues

— Capacity revenues decreased
    by $320 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006, due to a decrease in Texas capacity revenues
    that were partially offset by increases in capacity revenues in
    the Northeast, South Central and West regions:

o

Texas

— capacity revenues decreased by
    $486 million due to a reduction of capacity auction sales
    mandated by the PUCT in prior years as previously discussed.

o

Northeast

— capacity revenues increased by
    $81 million of which $39 million of the increase was
    from the region’s NEPOOL assets and $36 million was
    from the region’s PJM assets. The NEPOOL assets benefited
    from the new LFRM market and transition capacity market, both
    introduced in the fourth quarter 2006. Capacity revenues
    increased by $24 million from the LFRM market and
    $18 million from transition capacity payments, which was
    offset by a $3 million reduction in capacity payments due
    to the expiration of the Devon plant’s RMR agreement on
    December 31, 2006. On June 1, 2007, the new RPM
    capacity market became effective in PJM increasing capacity
    revenues by $36 million as compared to 2006.

o

South Central

— capacity revenues increased by
    approximately $22 million. Of this increase,
    $15 million was due to higher billing rates as a result of
    the region’s market setting new summer peaks hit in 2006
    and 2007, $6 million was due to higher contractual
    transmission pass-though costs to the region’s cooperative
    customers and $3 million was due to improved market
    conditions at the region’s Rockford plants. In



August 2007, the region set a new system peak of 2,123 MW
    which will continue to impact capacity revenue in the first half
    of 2008.

o

West

— capacity revenues increased by
    approximately $54 million, of which $26 million was
    related to the inclusion of the first quarter 2007 compared to
    2006. New tolling agreements at the region’s Encina and
    Long Beach plants accounted for the remaining difference, with
    the Encina facility contributing approximately $15 million
    and the newly-repowered Long Beach facility contributing
    approximately $13 million.

•

Contract amortization

— revenues from contract
    amortization decreased by $386 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, as a result of the
    November 2006 Hedge Reset transaction, which resulted in a
    write-off of a large portion of the Company’s out-of-market
    power contracts during the fourth quarter 2006.

•

Other revenues —

Other revenues decreased by
    $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006 due to:

o

Sale of emission allowances

— net sales of
    SO


emission allowances decreased by approximately $33 million.
    In 2006, we sold emissions in lieu of generation due to an
    unseasonably warm first quarter. Since that time the average
    market price for
    SO


allowances decreased by 28%.

o

Physical gas sales

— decreased by
    $7 million due to the lower sales of excess natural gas.

o

Ancillary revenues

— Ancillary services revenue
    increased by approximately $27 million due to a change in
    strategy to actively provide ancillary services in the Texas
    region which increased revenues by $33 million. This was
    partially offset by a $4 million reduction in ancillary
    services in the Northeast region due to higher transmission
    costs following transmission constraints in the New York City
    area.

•

Risk management activities —

Gains/losses from
    risk management activities include economic hedges that do not
    qualify for hedge accounting, ineffectiveness on cash flow
    hedges, and trading activities. Such gains were $4 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007. The breakdown of
    changes by region are as follows:

Risk management activities that did not qualify for hedge
    accounting treatment resulted in a total derivative gain of
    approximately $4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to a $124 million gain for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. NRG’s 2007
    derivative gain was comprised of $77 million mark-to-market
    losses and $81 million in settled gains, or financial
    revenue. Of the $77 million of mark-to-market losses,
    $128 million represents the reversal of mark-to-market
    gains previously recognized on economic hedges and
    $32 million from the reversal of mark-to-market gains
    previously recognized on trading activity. Both of these losses
    ultimately settled as financial revenues during 2007. The
    $34 million gain from economic hedge positions was
    comprised of a $20 million increase in the value of forward
    sales of electricity and fuel due to favorable power and gas
    prices and a



$14 million gain from hedge accounting ineffectiveness.
    This ineffectiveness was primarily related to gas swaps and
    collars in the Texas region due to a change in the correlation
    between natural gas and power prices. NRG also recognized a
    $49 million unrealized gain associated with the
    Company’s trading activity.

Since these hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk
    of commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy
    sold, the changes in such results should not be viewed in
    isolation, but rather taken together with the effects of pricing
    and cost changes on energy revenues. In late 2006 and during the
    course of 2007, NRG hedged a portion of the Company’s 2007
    and 2008 generation. Since that time, the settled and forward
    prices of electricity and natural gas have decreased, resulting
    in the recognition of unrealized mark-to-market forward gains
    and the settlement of realized positions at a gain. In 2006, NRG
    recognized forward mark-to-market gains as forward prices of
    electricity decreased relative to its positions forward; settled
    loss positions were driven by the out-of-market gas swaps
    acquired with the Texas Genco purchase.

Cost
    of Operations

Cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    increased by $113 million compared to 2006, but as a
    percentage of revenues it was 56% for 2007 compared to 58% for
    2006.

•

Cost of energy —

Cost of energy decreased by
    approximately $24 million, to $2,428 million, for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, and as a
    percentage of revenue it decreased from 44% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, to 41% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. This decrease was due to:

o

Texas —

cost of energy decreased by
    $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006. This decrease included an additional
    month’s expense of $96 million in 2007, without which
    cost of energy would have decreased by $191 million. This
    decrease was due to a reduction in natural gas expense and fuel
    contract amortization, partially offset by increased ancillary
    service expense.

—

Fuel expense and purchased power expense

— Natural gas expense decreased by
    $170 million, which excludes January 2007 natural gas
    expense of $27 million. This decrease was due to a
    reduction of 2.7 million MWh in gas-fired generation as a
    result of cooler summer weather, coupled with greater economic
    purchases from the ERCOT and increased baseload generation.
    Despite higher coal-fired generation at the region’s W.A.
    Parish and Limestone plants, the region’s coal expenses,
    excluding January 2007, decreased by $13 million due to a
    9% reduction in average contracted coal prices.

—

Fuel contract amortization

— decreased by
    approximately $43 million, excluding January 2007, due to
    declining forward fuel price curves below the contracted prices
    used at the Acquisition.

—

Purchased ancillary service expense

— increased
    by approximately $34 million due to favorable market prices
    in purchasing this service in the market compared to providing
    the service from internal resources.

o

Northeast

— cost of energy increased by
    $26 million primarily due to $30 million in higher
    natural gas costs related to increased generation at the
    region’s Arthur Kill plant due to its locational advantage
    to New York City following transmission constraints during the
    last three quarters of 2007.

o

South Central

— cost of energy increased by
    $104 million due to increases in purchased energy, coal
    costs and transmission costs.

—

Purchased energy

— increased by approximately
    $69 million due to increased market purchases following
    increased cooperative load requirements and planned maintenance
    at the region’s Big Cajun II facility.

—

Coal costs

— increased by approximately
    $17 million, of which $11 million was related to a 9%
    increase in coal prices and $7 million due to higher coal
    transportation costs.

—

Transmission costs

— increased by approximately
    $16 million of which $6 million was due to contractual
    increases related to network transmission service.
    Point-to-point transmission costs also increased by
    $10 million reflecting more off-system sales.



o

West

— Cost of energy decreased by
    approximately $76 million, excluding the first quarter
    2007, due to new tolling agreement entered into at the Encina
    plant in 2007, which requires the counterparty to supply their
    own fuel. Under the previous arrangement in 2006, the plant
    supplied the fuel.

•

Other operating costs —

Other operating costs
    which include operations and maintenance expenses, or O&M,
    increased by $137 million, to $950 million, for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This
    increase was due to:

o

Texas

— other operating costs increased by
    $75 million, after excluding January 2007 expense of
    $39 million, other operating costs increased by
    $36 million. This $36 million increase was due to
    $25 million in higher O&M expense as a result of
    increased maintenance associated with planned outages and fuel
    handling at the W.A. Parish facility and $10 million in
    higher property tax expenses following an increased valuation
    after the Acquisition.

o

Northeast

— other operating costs increased by
    $18 million due to increased staffing costs and higher
    maintenance costs.

o

South Central —

other operating costs increased
    by approximately $28 million, $19 million of which was
    due to increased maintenance expense primarily related to
    planned outages. Additionally, the region disposed of
    $4 million in assets in conjunction with the outage.

o

Acquisition of WCP —

these results include
    $15 million of WCP expenses that were not included in the
    Company’s results in 2006.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

NRG’s depreciation and amortization expense for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 increased by $68 million
    compared to 2006. This increase was due to:

•

Texas acquisition —

the inclusion of Texas
    results for twelve months in 2007 compared to eleven months in
    2006 resulted in an increase of approximately $38 million.

•

Impact of new environmental legislation —

due
    to new and more restrictive environmental legislation, the
    useful life of certain pollution control equipment has been
    reduced. The Company accelerated depreciation on certain
    equipment in its Northeast region to reflect the remaining
    useful life, resulting in increased depreciation of
    approximately $13 million.

General
    and Administrative

NRG’s G&A costs for the year ended December 31,
    2007 increased by $33 million compared to 2006, and as a
    percentage of revenues was 5% in both 2007 and 2006. This
    increase was due to:

•

Texas and WCP acquisitions —

the inclusion of
    Texas results for twelve months in 2007 compared to eleven
    months in 2006 and the consolidation of WCP for the last three
    quarters of 2006 resulted in an increase of approximately
    $9 million.

•

Wage and benefit costs —

due to the expansion
    of the Company, including

Repowering

NRG initiatives,
    wages and related benefits costs resulted in a $28 million
    increase in G&A. Additionally, information technology and
    other office services to support this expansion increased by
    $8 million.

•

Franchise tax —

the Company’s Louisiana
    state franchise tax increased by approximately $6 million.
    This increase was because the state’s franchise tax was
    assessed based on the Company’s total debt and equity that
    rose significantly following the acquisition of Texas Genco.

•

Non-recurring expenses during 2006 —

for the
    year ended December 31, 2006, G&A included
    non-recurring fees of $20 million of which $6 million
    were related to the unsolicited takeover attempt by Mirant
    Corporation and $14 million associated with the Texas
    integration efforts.



Development
    Costs

NRG’s development costs for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 increased by $65 million. These
    costs were due to the Company’s

Repowering

NRG
    projects:

•

Texas —

on September 24, 2007, NRG filed a
    COLA with the NRC to build and operate two new nuclear units at
    the STP site. During the period, NRG incurred $91 million
    in development costs related to STP units 3 and 4 project in
    2007. These development costs were reduced by a $39 million
    reimbursement related to a partnership agreement signed during
    the fourth quarter 2007.

•

Wind projects —

approximately $13 million
    in development costs related to wind projects primarily in Texas.

•

Other project —

approximately $4 million
    in development costs related to other

Repowering

NRG
    projects in the West region.

Gain
    on Sale of Assets

NRG’s net gain on sale of assets for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, was approximately $17 million. On
    January 3, 2007, NRG completed the sale of the
    Company’s Red Bluff and Chowchilla II power plants
    resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $18 million.

Equity
    in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates

NRG’s equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, decreased by
    $6 million compared to 2006. This decrease was due to the
    sale of multiple equity investments from which the Company
    earned $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Other
    Income, Net

NRG’s other income for the year ended December 31,
    2007, decreased by $101 million compared to 2006. This
    decrease was due to the non-cash settlement during the first
    quarter 2006 where NRG recorded $67 million of other income
    associated with a settlement with an equipment manufacturer
    related to turbine purchase agreements entered into in 1999 and
    2001. The settlement resulted in the reversal of accounts
    payable totaling $35 million resulting from the discharge
    of the previously recorded liability, and an adjustment to write
    up the value of the equipment received to its fair value,
    resulting in income of approximately $32 million.
    Additionally, in 2006, other income was favorably impacted by a
    $13 million non-cash gain associated with the discharge of
    liabilities upon dissolution of an inactive legal entity and a
    $5 million non-cash gain due to a favorable settlement with
    respect to post closing adjustments on the acquisition of the
    Company’s western New York plants.

During 2007, the Company recorded an $11 million impairment
    charge in the fourth quarter related to an investment in
    commercial paper reducing its carrying value to approximately
    $32 million. The Company earned $10 million less in
    interest income in 2007 compared to 2006, due to lower average
    cash balances.

Interest
    Expense

NRG’s interest expense for the year ended December 31,
    2007, increased by $99 million compared to 2006. This
    increase was due to:

•

Refinancing for the acquisition of Texas Genco in February
    2006 —

the Company significantly increased its
    corporate debt facilities from approximately $2 billion as
    of December 31, 2005, to approximately $7 billion as
    of February 2, 2006. This increased interest expense by
    approximately $12 million compared to 2006.

•

Increase of $1.1 billion in debt for Hedge
    Reset —

the Company issued $1.1 billion in
    Senior Notes due 2017 in November 2006 related to the Hedge
    Reset, which increased interest expense by approximately
    $72 million.



•

Capital Allocation Program —

the Company issued
    a total of $330 million of debt to fund Phase I of the
    Capital Allocation Program during the second half of 2006. This
    increased interest expense by $20 million compared to 2006.

In the first quarter 2006, NRG entered into interest rate swaps
    with the objective of fixing the interest rate on a portion of
    NRG’s Senior Credit Facility. These swaps were designated
    as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, and the impact
    associated with ineffectiveness was immaterial to NRG financial
    results. For the year ended December 31, 2007, NRG had a
    deferred loss of $31 million in other comprehensive income
    compared to deferred gains of $16 million in 2006.

Refinancing
    Expense

Refinancing expense decreased by $152 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to higher
    expense for the refinancing of the Company’s corporate debt
    for the acquisition of Texas Genco on February 2, 2006,
    compared to the refinancing of the Company’s Senior Credit
    Facility during 2007.

On June 8, 2007, NRG completed a $4.4 billion
    refinancing of the Company’s Senior Credit Facility
    previously announced on May 2, 2007. The transaction
    resulted in a 0.25% reduction on the spread that the Company
    pays on its Term Loan Facility and Synthetic Letter of Credit
    Facility, a $200 million reduction in the Synthetic Letter
    of Credit Facility to $1.3 billion, and various amendments
    to provide improved flexibility, efficiency for returning
    capital to shareholders, asset repowering and investment
    opportunities. The pricing on the Company’s Term Loan
    Facility and Synthetic Letter of Credit are also subject to
    further reductions upon the achievement of certain financial
    ratios. The refinancing resulted in a charge of approximately
    $35 million to the Company’s results of operations
    that were primarily related to the write-off of deferred
    financing costs as the lenders for approximately 45% of the Term
    Loan Facility either exited the financing or reduced their
    holdings and were replaced by other institutions.

Income
    Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased by $55 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. The effective
    tax rate was 39.9% and 37.2% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to:

•

Increase in profits —

income before tax
    increased by $81 million, with a corresponding increase of
    approximately $32 million in income tax expense.

•

Permanent differences —

the Company’s
    effective tax rate differs from the US statutory rate of 35% due
    to:

o

Change in German tax rate

— due to a reduction
    in the German statutory and resulting effective tax rate, income
    tax expense benefited by $29 million for the year-ended
    2007.

o

Taxable dividends from foreign subsidiaries

— in January 2007, the Company transferred the
    proceeds from the sale of its Flinders assets to the US creating
    additional income tax expense of approximately $25 million.

o

Lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions

— lower income tax rates at the Company’s
    foreign locations resulted in additional income tax expense
    during 2007 compared to 2006 of $8 million.

o

Non-deductible interest

— interest expense from
    the stock buybacks from Phase I of the Company’s Capital
    Allocation Program was non-deductible for income tax purposes,
    thus increasing income tax expense by approximately
    $7 million.

o

Change in state effective tax rate

— the state
    effective tax rate remained unchanged for 2007. This resulted in
    a net decrease in income tax expense of approximately
    $5 million as compared to 2006, after taking into account
    the movement in valuation allowance as a result of the change in
    rate from 2005 to 2006.

o

Subpart F taxable income

— a dividend was
    declared and paid in 2007 by NRGenerating International B.V. As
    result of this dividend, there was no Subpart F income compared
    to 2006. This resulted in a decrease to income tax expense of
    approximately $11 million.

o

Disputed claims reserve

— During 2007 as
    compared to 2006, the Company made no distribution from its
    disputed claims reserve, this increased income tax expense by
    approximately $28 million.

The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period
    depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business
    mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances
    in accordance with SFAS 109. These factors and others,
    including the Company’s history of pre-tax earnings and
    losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to
    realize deferred tax assets.

Income
    from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax
    Expense

For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, NRG
    recorded income from discontinued operations, net of income tax
    expense of $17 million and $78 million, respectively.
    Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,
    2007 were comprised of the results of ITISA. Discontinued
    operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 were
    comprised of the results of ITISA, Flinders, Audrain and
    Resource Recovery. NRG closed on the sale of Flinders during the
    third quarter 2006 and recognized an after-tax gain of
    approximately $60 million from the sale.

    adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period.

Operating
    Income

Operating income increased by $716 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in
    2007, primarily due to:

•

Energy revenues

— increased by
    $172 million due to higher merchant energy revenue as a
    result of higher power prices and sales volumes offset by lower
    contract energy revenue.

•

Capacity revenue

— increased by
    $130 million due to a greater proportion of base-load
    contracts which contain a capacity component.

•

Risk management activities

— an increase of
    $351 million was primarily due to $479 million in
    greater unrealized derivative gains offset by $128 million
    in greater realized losses on settled financial transactions.
    These changes reflect a reduction in forward power and gas
    prices at the close of the year ended December 31, 2008.



These increases were offset by:

•

Cost of energy

— increased by $59 million
    reflecting the effects of increased natural gas and coal prices.

Operating
    Revenues

Total operating revenues from the Texas region increased by
    $739 million during the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to 2007 due to the following:

•

Risk management activities

— gains of
    $318 million were recognized for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to a $33 million loss in
    the same period in 2007. The $318 million included
    $413 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains and
    $95 million in settled losses, or financial revenue. The
    $413 million was the net effect of a $400 million gain
    from economic hedge positions and a $25 million loss on
    reversals of mark-to-market gains on economic hedges. In
    addition, there were $37 million in unrealized
    mark-to-market gains on trading transactions combined with a
    $1 million gain on reversals of mark-to-market losses on
    trading activity. The $400 million gain from economic
    hedges incorporated $424 million in unrealized gains in the
    value of forward sales of electricity and fuel driven by lower
    power and natural gas prices. These hedges were considered
    effective economic hedges that do not receive cash flow hedge
    accounting treatment. The remaining $24 million in losses
    were from hedge ineffectiveness which was driven by decreasing
    gas prices while power prices decreased at a slower pace.

•

Energy revenues

— increased by
    $172 million due to:

o

Energy prices —

increased by $219 million
    due to a more favorable mix of merchant versus contract sales
    resulting in a 28% increase in merchant prices offset by a 14%
    decrease in contract energy prices.

o

Generation —

decreased by 839 thousand MWh or
    2%. This decrease in generation was due to a 3% decline in
    nuclear generation at STP, as a result of additional plant
    outages, and a 14% decline in overall gas plant generation for
    the year ended December 2008. Hurricane Ike in September 2008
    caused major damage to the Houston area transmission grid which
    reduced significantly the demand for power causing a decrease in
    gas-fired generation. These declines were offset by a 1%
    increase in coal generation in 2008.

•

Capacity revenue

— increased by
    $130 million due to a greater proportion of base-load
    contracts which contain a capacity component.

•

Other revenues —

increased by $50 million
    related to a $23 million increase in ancillary services
    revenue in 2008, a $22 million increase of allocations for
    trading of emission allowances and carbon financial instruments,
    and increased activity in trading natural gas and coal of
    $4 million.

•

Contract amortization revenue

— increased by
    $36 million due to the volume of contracted energy being
    positively affected by a greater spread between contract prices
    and market prices used in the Texas Genco purchase accounting.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy for the Texas region increased by
    $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to 2007 due to the following:

•

Natural gas costs

— increased by
    $99 million due to a 28% rise in average gas prices offset
    by a 14% decrease in gas-fired generation.

•

Coal costs

— increased by $44 million due
    to higher coal prices and the settlement of a coal contract
    dispute.

•

Ancillary services

— increased by
    $14 million due to a $16 million rise in ancillary
    service costs purchased through ERCOT, offset by a
    $2 million decrease in other purchased ancillary services
    costs.



These increases were partially offset by:

•

Amortized contract costs

— decreased by
    $59 million due to a $36 million decrease in the
    amortization of water supply contracts which ended in 2007. In
    addition, the amortization of coal contracts decreased by a net
    $22 million as a result of a reduction in expense related
    to in-the-money coal contract amortization. These contracts were
    established under Texas Genco purchase accounting.

•

Nuclear fuel expense

— decreased by
    $19 million as amortization of nuclear fuel inventory
    established under Texas Genco purchase accounting ended in early
    2008.

•

Purchased power

— decreased by $26 million
    due to lower forced outage rates at the region’s baseload
    plants.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses for the Texas region decreased by
    $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to 2007 due to the following:

•

Development costs

— decreased by
    $59 million primarily due to the initial costs for
    developing the nuclear units 3 and 4 at STP associated with the

Repowering

NRG initiative that began in 2007. Costs for
    STP nuclear units 3 and 4 are being capitalized in 2008.

This decrease was primarily offset by:

•

Operations & maintenance expense

— increased by $32 million due to an
    additional planned outage at STP and the acceleration of planned
    outages at the baseload plants.

•

General and Administrative expense

— increased
    by $10 million driven by higher corporate allocations.

For the period February 2,
    2006 to December 31, 2006 only.

Operating
    Income

For the year ended December 31, 2007, operating income
    increased by $88 million compared to 2006; however,
    excluding January 2007 results, operating income increased by
    $21 million. The primary drivers were:

•

Energy Revenues

— for eleven months of 2007
    compared to the same period in 2006 were up by
    $755 million, $449 million of which was due to the
    Hedge Reset transaction, as the average price of the underlying
    power contracts increased by $13 per MWh compared to average
    contract prices prior to the hedge reset. The balance of the
    increase in energy revenues was due to the sale of additional
    output as energy rather than under PUCT mandated capacity
    auctions.

This favorable result was offset by:

•

Capacity Revenues

— reduction in capacity
    auction sales reduced capacity revenues by approximately
    $517 million, excluding January 2007.



•

Contract Amortization

— the Hedge Reset
    transaction decreased contract amortization by approximately
    $498 million, excluding January 2007.

•

Gas-fired Generation —

lower natural gas-fired
    generation of approximately 2.7 million MWh, for the
    comparable eleven month period in 2007, was a result of cooler
    summer weather coupled with increased economic purchases of
    energy and ancillary services from the ERCOT. Lower sales
    revenue for the eleven months was offset by natural lower
    natural gas fuel costs of $170 million and cash flow
    economic hedge improvements.

•

Development Costs

— increased by
    $44 million in 2007 compared to 2006 largely due to the
    development of STP nuclear units 3 and 4 project, including
    $2 million of expenses in January 2007. The
    $44 million increase also includes $39 million in
    reimbursements from a partnership agreement signed in the fourth
    quarter 2007.

Operating
    Revenues

Total operating revenues from the Texas region increased by
    $199 million during the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006. Excluding January 2007, operating revenues
    decreased by $56 million. This decrease was due to:

•

Energy revenues

— energy revenues increased by
    $972 million, of which $217 million was due to the
    inclusion of twelve months activity in 2007 compared to eleven
    months in 2006. Of the remaining $755 million increase,
    $449 million was due to the Hedge Reset transaction which
    resulted in higher 2007 average contracted prices of
    approximately $13 per MWh. In addition, revenues from
    8.8 million MWh of generation moved from capacity revenue
    to energy revenue. Prior to the Acquisition, PUCT regulations
    required that NRG Texas sell 15% of its capacity by auction at
    reduced rates. In March 2006, the PUCT accepted NRG’s
    request to no longer participate in these auctions and that
    capacity is now being sold in the merchant market. These
    favorable results were partially offset by lower sales from
    natural gas-fired units due to a cooler summer which resulted in
    lower natural gas-fired generation of approximately
    2.7 million MWh.

•

Other revenues

— the region’s other
    revenues decreased by $27 million for the eleven months of
    2007 compared to 2006. This was due to a decrease in
    intercompany emission allowance sales of $40 million and a
    $19 million decrease in physical gas sales. This
    $59 million decrease was offset by a $33 million
    increase in ancillary services revenue due to a change in
    strategy to more actively provide ancillary services in the
    Texas region.

•

Capacity revenues

— capacity revenues decreased
    by $517 million, excluding $31 million incurred in
    January 2007. This decrease was due to the reduction of capacity
    auction sales mandated by the PUCT in prior years as described
    above.

•

Contract amortization

— revenues from contract
    amortization excluding January 2007 decreased by
    $405 million primarily due to the write-off of
    out-of-market power contracts during the fourth quarter 2006
    related to the Hedge Reset transaction.

•

Risk management activities

— The Texas region
    recorded a total of $33 million in derivative losses for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to a
    $30 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    The Texas region’s 2007 derivative loss was comprised of
    $66 million of mark-to-market losses and $33 million
    in settled gains, or financial revenue. Of the $66 million
    of mark-to-market losses, $83 million represents the
    reversal of mark-to-market gains previously recognized on
    economic hedges and $1 million from the reversal of
    mark-to-market gains previously recognized on trading activity.
    Both of these losses ultimately settled as financial revenues
    during 2007. The $19 million gain from economic hedge
    positions was comprised of an $8 million increase in the
    value of forward sales of electricity and fuel due to favorable
    power and natural gas prices and a $11 million gain from
    hedge accounting ineffectiveness. This ineffectiveness was
    primarily related to gas swaps and collars due to a change in
    the correlation between natural gas and power prices.



Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy for the Texas region decreased by
    $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006. This included an additional month’s
    expense for January 2007 of $96 million, without which cost
    of energy would have decreased by $191 million. This
    decrease was due to:

•

Fuel expense

— natural gas expense
    decreased by $170 million, excluding the January 2007
    expense of $27 million, due to a decrease of
    2.7 million MWh in natural gas-fired generation as a result
    of cooler summer weather, coupled with greater economic
    purchases of energy and ancillary services from the ERCOT and
    increased baseload generation. Coal expenses, excluding January
    2007, decreased by $13 million due to a 9% reduction in
    average contracted coal prices in 2007, despite a
    1.1 million MWh increase in coal-fired generation at the
    region’s W.A. Parish and Limestone plants.

•

Purchased ancillary service

— increased by
    approximately $34 million due to the favorable market
    prices in purchasing this service in the market compared to
    providing the service from internal resources causing an
    associated decrease in natural gas expense.

•

Fuel contract amortization

— decreased by
    approximately $43 million, excluding January 2007, due to
    declining forward fuel price curves below the contracted prices
    used at acquisition in February 2006.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses for the Texas region increased by
    $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006. This included an additional month’s
    expense for January 2007, of $53 million, without which
    other operating expenses would have increased by
    $97 million. This increase was due to:

•

Development costs

— on September 24, 2007,
    NRG filed a COLA with the NRC. The Company incurred
    $91 million in development costs related to STP nuclear
    unit 3 and 4 project in 2007, including $2 million in
    January 2007, compared to development costs of $14 million
    in 2006. Of the $91 million incurred this year,
    $39 million was reimbursed through a partnership agreement
    in the fourth quarter 2007. Fossil development costs were
    $6 million in 2007.

•

Plant O&M expense

— increased by
    $25 million, excluding January 2007, due to increased
    maintenance associated with planned outages and fuel handling at
    W.A. Parish, increased maintenance related to higher utilization
    in 2006 of the region’s natural gas fleet, and retirement
    of older assets.

•

Corporate allocations

— were higher by
    approximately $16 million.

•

Property tax expense

— increased by
    approximately $10 million related to the Texas acquisition.

Operating
    Income

Operating income decreased by $24 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to:

•

Cost of energy

— increased by $54 million
    due to higher coal costs, increased coal transportation
    surcharges and higher natural gas prices. The increase was
    offset by lower oil costs from lower oil-fired generation.

This unfavorable variance was offset by:

•

Operating revenues —

increased by
    $25 million due to higher capacity revenue and risk
    management revenues partially offset by lower energy revenue.

•

Other operating expenses

— decreased by
    $12 million due to lower major maintenance expenses and
    property taxes offset by higher utilities expense.



Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $25 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to:

•

Risk management activities

— gains of
    $85 million were recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to gains of $27 million
    during the same period in 2007. The $85 million gain
    includes $82 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains and
    $3 million of gains in settled transactions, or financial
    revenue. The $82 million unrealized gains is the net effect
    of a $96 million gain from economic hedge positions, the
    $13 million loss due to the reversal of previously
    recognized mark-to-market gains on economic hedges, the
    $14 million loss due to the reversal of mark-to-market
    gains on trading activity and $13 million in unrealized
    mark-to-market gains on trading activity. Gains are driven by
    increases in power and gas prices.

•

Capacity revenues

— increased by
    $13 million due to:

o

PJM

— capacity revenues increased by
    $20 million reflecting recognition of a year of revenue
    from the RPM capacity market (effective on June 1,
    2007) in 2008 compared to seven months in 2007.

o

NEPOOL

— capacity revenues increased
    $11 million due to increased revenue recognized on the
    Norwalk RMR contract (effective on June 19, 2007) in
    2008 compared to seven months in 2007.

o

NYISO

— capacity revenues decreased by
    $18 million due to unfavorable market prices. The lower
    capacity market prices are a result of NYISO’s reductions
    in Installed Reserve Margins and ICAP in-city mitigation rules
    effective March 2008. These decreases were offset by higher
    capacity contract revenue.

These gains were offset by:

•

Energy revenues —

decreased by $40 million
    due to:

o

Energy prices

— increased by a net
    $26 million.  An average 6% rise in merchant
    energy prices resulted in an increase of $64 million. This
    increase was offset by lower contract revenue of
    $38 million driven by higher net costs incurred to service
    PJM contracts as a result of the increase in market energy
    prices.

o

Generation

— decreased by $66 million due
    to a net 6% decrease in generation. The decrease in
    generation represented a 55% decrease in oil-fired generation as
    these oil-fired plants were not dispatched due to 41% higher
    average oil prices. In addition, there was a 12% decrease in
    gas-fired generation related to a cooler summer in 2008 as
    compared to 2007. Coal generation was flat in 2008 compared to
    2007.

•

Other revenues

— decreased by $6 million
    due to lower allocations of net physical sales in 2008 of
    $17 million offset by higher allocations for trading of
    emission allowances and carbon financial instruments of
    $10 million.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy increased by $54 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, due
    to:

•

Coal costs

— increased by $61 million due
    to higher coal costs and fuel transportation surcharges.

•

Natural gas costs

— increased by
    $22 million, despite 12% lower generation, due to a 32%
    higher average natural gas prices.

These increases were offset by:

•

Oil costs

— decreased by $27 million due
    to lower oil-fired generation of 55% as these plants were not
    dispatched in 2008 due to 41% higher average oil prices.



Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses decreased by $12 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period
    in 2007, due to:

•

Major Maintenance

— decreased $18 million
    as a result of less outage work at the Norwalk and Indian River
    plants.

•

Property taxes

— decreased $10 million due
    to $4 million in property tax credits received in 2008 at
    our New York City plants and higher property credits
    received in 2008 at our Western New York plants.

These decreases were offset by:

•

Utilities expense

— increased by
    $16 million as a result of a $19 million benefit
    included in the 2007 utilities cost due to a lower than planned
    settlement of the station service agreement with CL&P.

Operating
    Income

Operating income decreased by $3 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to:

•

Cost of energy

— increased by approximately
    $26 million due to a 6% increase in generation at the
    region’s coal and natural gas-fired plants.

•

Other operating expenses

— increased by
    $26 million primarily due to increased maintenance and
    staffing costs combined with higher property tax.

•

Depreciation

— increased by $13 million
    reflecting the additional depreciation expense following the
    reduction in estimated useful lives of certain components of the
    region’s power plants as a result of new environmental
    regulation.

•

Offset by higher operating revenues

— of
    approximately $62 million due to increased generation,
    favorable pricing and the favorable impact from new capacity
    markets. This was partially offset by lower gains in the
    region’s risk management activities and lower sales of
    emission allowances due to a 28% reduction in market prices.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $62 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to:

•

Energy revenues —

increased by approximately
    $138 million, of which $61 million was due to
    increased generation, and $88 million due to a 9% increase
    in average realized market prices partially offset by an
    $11 million reduction in contracted bilateral energy
    revenues.

o

Generation

— increased by 6%, primarily driven
    by increases at the region’s Arthur Kill, Oswego and Indian
    River plants. The Arthur Kill plant increased generation by 448
    thousand MWh due to transmission constraints around New York
    City, the Oswego plants’ generation increased by 127
    thousand MWh due to a colder winter during 2007 compared to
    2006, and Indian River plants’ generation increased by 418
    thousand MWh due to stronger pricing and fewer outages.

o

Price

— on average, realized prices in the
    Northeast increased by 9% due to a mix of higher priced
    New York City generation coupled with improved economic
    energy hedge trading resulting in a $37 million increase in
    energy revenues.

•

Capacity revenues

— increased by
    $81 million, of which $39 million was from the
    region’s NEPOOL assets, $36 million from the
    region’s PJM assets and $6 million from the
    region’s New York Rest of State assets.

o

NEPOOL

— The region’s NEPOOL assets
    benefited from the new LFRM market and transition capacity
    market, both of which were introduced in the fourth quarter
    2006. Capacity revenues increased by $24 million from the
    LFRM market and $18 million from transition capacity
    payments, which were partially offset by a $3 million
    reduction due to the expiration of an RMR agreement for the
    region’s Devon plant on December 31, 2006 and by RMR
    payments from the region’s Norwalk plant which began in the
    third quarter 2007.

o

PJM

— On June 1, 2007, the new RPM
    capacity market became effective in PJM increasing capacity
    revenues by approximately $36 million.

o

NYISO

— New York Rest of State capacity prices
    increased by 75% as load requirement growth increased demand for
    capacity. This was coupled with the impact from the new capacity
    markets in NEPOOL which reduced exported supply into the New
    York market that further improved the supply/demand dynamics.



These were partially offset by:

•

Risk management activities

— The Northeast
    region recorded $27 million in derivative gain for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared to a $144 million
    gain for the year ended December 31, 2006. The
    region’s 2007 derivative gain was comprised of
    $16 million of mark-to-market losses and $43 million
    in settled gains, or financial revenue. Of the $16 million
    of mark-to-market losses, $45 million represents the
    reversal of mark-to-market gains previously recognized on
    economic hedges and $12 million from the reversal of
    mark-to-market gains previously recognized on trading activity.
    Both of these losses ultimately settled as financial revenues
    during 2007. The region also recognized a $15 million
    unrealized gain from economic hedge positions which was
    comprised primarily of a $13 million increase in the value
    of forward sales of electricity and fuel due to favorable power
    and gas prices. The region also recognized a $26 million
    unrealized gain associated with the Company’s trading
    activity. The $144 million derivative gain for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 was comprised of a
    $154 million unrealized mark-to-market gain and
    $10 million in settled losses. Most of these unrealized
    gains reversed out in 2007.

•

Other revenues

— decreased by $40 million,
    of which approximately $48 million was due to reduced
    activity in the trading of emission allowances following both an
    increase in generation and a 28% decrease in market prices. This
    decrease was partially offset by an $11 million increase in
    physical gas sales to third parties due to favorable trading
    opportunities in the market.

Cost
    of Energy

•

Cost of energy increased by $26 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to
    $30 million in higher natural gas costs related to
    increased generation at the region’s Arthur Kill plant due
    to its locational advantage to New York City following
    transmission constraints during the last three quarters of 2007.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses increased by $26 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to:

•

Plant O&M spending

— of $15 million
    due to increased plant staffing costs of $7 million,
    increased maintenance costs of $6 million and increased
    environmental remediation costs of $2 million.

•

Property tax

— increased by approximately
    $3 million due to a favorable tax decision in 2006 related
    to NYC assets of $10 million partially offset by a tax law
    change the same year that resulted in a reduction of property
    tax receivable of $5 million in 2006 and a $2 million
    reduction in property taxes at the New England plants in 2007.

•

Regional G&A expenditures

— Regional
    staffing and benefits increased by $3 million primarily
    related to the region’s

Repowering

NRG development
    efforts while corporate allocations increased by $5 million.

Operating
    Income

Operating income increased by $43 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in
    2007, due to:

•

Operating revenues —

increased by
    $88 million due to increases in energy revenue and capacity
    revenue.

•

Cost of energy

— increased by $56 million
    due to higher purchased energy, coal transportation costs,
    natural gas and transmission costs.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $88 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to:

•

Energy revenues

— increased by $74 million
    due to higher merchant energy revenues. A decline in contract
    sales of 577 thousand MWh allowed for increased sales into the
    merchant market at higher prices. Merchant



energy sales increased 573 thousand MWh. Revenue from contract
    load was flat as higher fuel cost pass-through adjustments for
    the region’s cooperative customers were offset by
    reductions in contract volume to other contract customers.

•

Capacity revenues

— increased by
    $12 million. Capacity payments from the region’s
    cooperative customers increased by $10 million due to new
    peak loads set by the region’s cooperative customers and
    increased transmission and environmental pass-through costs.
    Increased RPM capacity payments from the region’s Rockford
    facilities in the PJM market contributed an additional
    $8 million. These increases were offset by a reduction in
    contract volumes to other customers of $6 million.

•

Risk Management Activities

— gains of
    $10 million were recognized during 2008 compared to
    $10 million in gains recognized during the same period in
    2007. Unrealized gains in 2008 of $26 million were offset
    by realized losses of $16 million. The $26 million
    unrealized gain was the net effect of a $45 million
    unrealized mark-to-market gain from trading activities in the
    region offset by the reversal of $19 million loss of
    previously recognized mark-to-market gains on trading activity.
    Unrealized gains were primarily driven by decreases in power and
    gas prices relative to our forward positions.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy increased by $56 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to:

•

Purchased energy

— increased by
    $16 million reflecting a 21% increase in the average cost
    per MWh of purchased energy which reflects higher gas costs
    associated with the region’s tolling agreements. This
    increase was offset by an 8% decrease in purchased MWh as
    increased plant availability and lower contract load
    requirements reduced the need to purchase power.

•

Coal costs

— increased by $16 million due
    to a $2 per ton increase in fuel transportation surcharges
    combined with a 1% increase in coal generation. These increases
    were offset by a $3 million decrease in allocated rail car
    lease fees.

•

Natural gas costs

— increased
    $14 million.  The region’s Bayou Cove and
    Big Cajun I peaker plants ran extensively to support
    transmission system stability after hurricane Gustav in
    September 2008.

•

Transmission costs

— increased by
    $9 million due to additional point-to-point transmission
    costs driven by an increase in merchant energy sales.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses decreased by approximately
    $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to 2007, due to:

•

G&A Expense

— Franchise tax decreased by
    $5 million due to retroactive charges recorded in 2007. The
    Louisiana state franchise tax is assessed on the Company’s
    total debt and equity that significantly increased following the
    Acquisition of Texas Genco. This decrease was offset by
    $6 million in higher corporate allocations in 2008 compared
    to the same period in 2007.

•

Operating and maintenance expense

— Major
    maintenance decreased by $9 million due to more extensive
    spring outage work performed at the Big Cajun II plant in
    2007 compared to the same period in 2008. Normal maintenance
    rose $2 million as a result of increased forced outages and
    higher contractor costs. Asset retirements decreased by
    $4 million reflecting disposals associated with the 2007
    outage work at Big Cajun II.

Operating
    Income

Operating income for the region declined by $48 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to
    higher operating expenses, despite a 1% decrease in generation
    at the region’s Big Cajun II plant.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $88 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to:

•

Energy revenues

— increased by approximately
    $70 million due to a new contract which contributed
    $69 million in contract energy revenues, increasing
    contract sales volume by approximately 1.3 million MWh. A
    contractual change in the fuel adjustment charge for the
    region’s cooperative customers increased energy revenues by
    an additional $11 million. This was offset by a
    $12 million decrease in merchant energy revenue as a result
    of satisfying increasing load requirement from the new contract.



•

Capacity revenues

— increased by approximately
    $22 million, of which $15 million was due to higher
    rates as a result of the region setting new summer peaks in 2006
    and 2007; the new system peak of 2,123 MW set in August
    2007 will continue to impact capacity revenue in the first half
    of 2008. Higher network transmission costs, which are passed
    through to the region’s cooperative customers, also
    increased capacity revenues by $6 million. Improved market
    conditions in PJM resulted in an increase of $3 million in
    merchant capacity revenue from the Rockford plants.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy increased by $104 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to:

•

Purchased energy

— increased by approximately
    $69 million as planned and maintenance outage hours at the
    region’s Big Cajun II facility increased by
    1,209 hours, primarily due to the planned turbine/generator
    outage at the Big Cajun II Unit 3 facility in the fourth
    quarter 2007. These increases were offset by a drop of $2.53/MWh
    in realized purchased power prices.

•

Coal costs

— increased by approximately
    $17 million, of which approximately $11 million was
    due to a 9% increase in coal prices and $7 million due to
    higher coal transportation costs.

•

Transmission costs

— increased by approximately
    $16 million. Network transmission costs, which are
    passed-through to the region’s cooperative customers,
    increased by $6 million due to load growth and increased
    utilization of the Entergy transmission system. Point-to-point
    transmission costs to support off-system sales increased by
    $10 million.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses increased by approximately
    $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006, due to:

•

Maintenance expense

— increased by
    approximately $19 million as the scope of work on planned
    outages were more extensive in 2007. The Big Cajun II Unit
    3 facility incurred a major planned outage in the fourth quarter
    2007, during which the generator was rewound, turbine controls
    were replaced with a modern digital control system, and the
    turbine steam path was replaced with a high-efficiency design.
    Asset disposals in conjunction with the outage added
    $4 million.

•

Franchise tax

— Louisiana state franchise tax
    increased by approximately $6 million due to an increased
    assessment based on the Company’s total debt and equity.
    The Company’s total debt and equity increased significantly
    following the acquisition of Texas Genco.

Operating income increased by $19 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in
    2007, due to:

•

Energy revenues

— increased by $35 million
    due to the 2008 dispatch of the El Segundo plant outside of the
    tolling agreement in 2008. In 2007, no such dispatch occurred.

•

Other operating expense

— decreased by
    $10 million as a result of a $5 million reduction in

Repowering

NRG expenses due to the capitalization of cost
    for the El Segundo Energy Center project in 2008. In addition
    there was a $3 million reduction in lease expenses in 2008
    and the recognition of a $2 million environmental liability
    for the El Segundo plant in 2007.

•

Other revenues

— increased by $6 million
    due to higher allocations for trading of emission allowances in
    2008.



•

Capacity revenues

— increased by
    $3 million primarily due to the tolling agreement at the
    Long Beach plant partially offset by the expiration of a two
    year tolling agreement at the El Segundo facility:

o

Long Beach

— On August 1, 2007, NRG
    successfully completed the repowering of a 260 MW natural
    gas-fueled generating plant at its Long Beach generating
    facility. The plant contributed $15 million in incremental
    capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008.

o

El Segundo

— The expiration of the two year
    tolling agreement at the end of April resulted in a decrease of
    $11 million in capacity revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

Cost of energy —

increased by $30 million
    due to the dispatch of the El Segundo plant outside of the
    tolling agreement in 2008. In 2007, no such dispatch occurred.

•

Depreciation and amortization

— increased by
    $5 million, reflecting depreciation associated with the
    repowered plant at the Long Beach generating facility.

Operating
    Income

Operating income increased by $31 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. Excluding the
    consolidation of WCP’s results following the acquisition of
    Dynegy’s 50% interest on March 31, 2006, operating
    income increased by $24 million, due to:

•

Capacity revenues —

increased by approximately
    $28 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, due to new
    tolling agreements at the region’s Encina and Long Beach
    plants:

o

Encina

— In January 2007, NRG signed a new
    tolling agreement for the region’s Encina plant which
    contributed $15 million in capacity revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

o

Long Beach

— The repowered plant at the Long
    Beach generating facility contributed approximately
    $13 million in capacity revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

•

Cost of energy —

decreased by $76 million,
    excluding the first quarter 2007, due to the new tolling
    agreement entered into at the Encina plant in 2007, which
    required the counterparty to supply its own fuel. Under the
    previous arrangement in 2006, the plant supplied the fuel.

This increase was offset by:

•

Energy revenues

— decreased by approximately
    $72 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, primarily
    due to the tolling agreement at the Encina plant that has
    resulted in the receipt of a fixed monthly capacity payment in
    return for the right to schedule and dispatch from the plant.
    The Encina tolling agreement replaced the RMR agreement under
    which the plant was called upon to generate revenues for such
    dispatch.

•

O&M expense

— increased by approximately
    $6 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, primarily due
    to increases in labor costs, major maintenance and auxiliary
    power.

•

Development expenses

— increased by
    $4 million, reflecting

Repowering

NRG initiatives at
    the region’s El Segundo and Encina sites.

•

Other revenues

— decreased ancillary service
    revenue of $3 million at the Encina plant due to the new
    tolling agreement that consigns ancillary service revenue to the
    counterparty in exchange for a fixed monthly capacity payment.

    support of energy risk management activities, and it is the
    Company’s intention as of December 31, 2008 to limit
    the use of these funds. The increase in these amounts is due to
    the in-the-money position of our transactions following the drop
    in commodity prices since the summer of 2008. Depending on
    market fluctuation and the settlement of the underlying
    contracts, the Company will refund this collateral to the
    counterparties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
    underlying trades. The Company’s balance sheet reflects a
    liability for cash collateral received within current
    liabilities.

Management believes that the Company’s liquidity position
    and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance
    operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund
    dividends to NRG’s preferred shareholders, and other
    liquidity commitments. Management continues to regularly monitor
    the Company’s ability to finance the needs of its
    operating, financing and investing activity in a manner
    consistent with its intention to maintain a net debt to capital
    ratio in the range of

45-60%.

Credit
    Ratings

Credit rating agencies rate a firm’s public debt
    securities. These ratings are utilized by the debt markets in
    evaluating a firm’s credit risk. Ratings influence the
    price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the
    market the Company’s ability to pay principal, interest,
    and preferred dividends. Rating agencies evaluate a firm’s
    industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and hedge profile,
    among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firm’s
    credit risk. As of December 31, 2008, NRG’s credit
    ratings are on positive watch from both S&P and
    Moody’s rating agencies.

SOURCES
    OF FUNDS

The principal sources of liquidity for NRG’s future
    operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived
    from new and existing financing arrangements, asset sales,
    existing cash on hand and cash flows from operations.

Financing
    Arrangements

Senior
    Credit Facility

As of December 31, 2008, NRG has a Senior Credit Facility
    which is comprised of a senior first priority secured term loan,
    or the Term Loan Facility, a $1.0 billion senior first
    priority secured revolving credit facility, or the Revolving
    Credit Facility, and a $1.3 billion senior first priority
    secured synthetic letter of credit facility, or the Synthetic
    Letter of Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility was last
    amended on June 8, 2007. As of December 31, 2008, NRG
    had issued $440 million of letters of credit under the
    Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, leaving $860 million
    available for future issuances. Under the Revolving Credit
    Facility, as of December 31, 2008, NRG had not issued any
    letters of credit.

First
    and Second Lien Structure

NRG has granted first and second liens to certain counterparties
    on substantially all of the Company’s assets. NRG uses the
    first or second lien structure to reduce the amount of cash
    collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be
    required to post from time to time to support its obligations
    under out-of-the-money hedge agreements for forward sales of
    power or MWh equivalents. To the extent that the underlying
    hedge positions for a counterparty are in-the-money to NRG, the
    counterparty would have no claim under the lien program. The
    lien program limits the volume that can be hedged, not the value
    of underlying out-of-the money positions. The first lien program
    does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold
    amount of exposure. Within the first and second lien structure,
    the Company can hedge up to 80% of its baseload capacity and 10%
    of its non-baseload assets with these counterparties for the
    first 60 months and then declining thereafter. Net exposure
    to a counterparty on all trades must be positively correlated to
    the price of the relevant commodity for the first lien to be
    available to that counterparty. The first and second lien
    structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings
    downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.

The Company’s lien counterparties may have a claim on our
    assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged price. As
    of December 31, 2008 and February 2, 2009, the first
    lien exposure of net out-of-the-money positions to
    counterparties on hedges was $88 million and
    $43 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008 and
    February 2, 2009, there was no exposure to out-of-the-money
    positions to counterparties on hedges under the second lien.

The following table summarizes the amount of MWs hedged against
    the Company’s baseload assets and as a percentage relative
    to the Company’s forecasted baseload capacity under the
    first and second lien structure as of February 2, 2009:

Common
    Stock Finance I Debt

The Company’s Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes
    indentures contain restricted payment provisions limiting the
    use of funds for transactions such as common share repurchases.
    To maintain restricted payment capacity under the Senior Notes
    indentures, in March 2008 the Company executed an arrangement
    with CS to extend maturities of CSF I’s notes and preferred
    interests from October 2008 to June 2010. In addition, the
    settlement date of an embedded derivative, or CSF I CAGR, which
    is based on NRG’s share price appreciation above a
    threshold price, was extended 30 days to early December
    2008. As part of this extension arrangement, the Company
    contributed 795,503 treasury shares to CSF I as additional
    collateral to maintain a blended interest rate in the CSF I
    facility of approximately 7.5%. Accordingly, the amount due at
    maturity in June 2010 for the CSF I notes and preferred
    interests will be $248 million. In August 2008, the Company
    amended the CSF I notes and preferred interests to early settle
    the CSF I CAGR. Accordingly, NRG made a cash payment of
    $45 million to CS for the benefit of CSF I, which was
    recorded to interest expense in the Company’s Consolidated
    Statement of Operations.

Asset
    Sales

ITISA

— On April 28, 2008, NRG completed
    the sale of its 100% interest in Tosli, which held all
    NRG’s interest in ITISA, to Brookfield Renewable Power Inc.
    (previously Brookfield Power Inc.), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Brookfield Asset Management Inc. In addition, the purchase price
    adjustment contingency under the sale agreement was resolved on
    August 7, 2008. In connection with the sale, NRG received
    $300 million of cash proceeds from Brookfield, and removed
    $163 million of assets, including $59 million of cash,
    $122 million of liabilities, including $63 million of
    debt, and $15 million in foreign currency translation
    adjustment from its 2008 consolidated balance sheet. As
    discussed in Note 3,

Discontinued Operations, Business
    Acquisitions and Dispositions

, the activities of Tosli and
    ITISA have been classified as discontinued operations.

USES
    OF FUNDS

The Company’s requirements for liquidity and capital
    resources, other than for operating its facilities, can
    generally be categorized by the following: (i) commercial
    operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations;
    (iii) capital expenditures including

Repowering

NRG
    and environmental; and (iv) corporate financial
    transactions including return of capital to shareholders.

Commercial
    Operations

NRG’s commercial operations activities require a
    significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These
    liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin
    and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) initial
    collateral required to establish trading relationships;
    (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e., buying
    fuel before receiving energy revenues); and (iv) initial
    collateral for large structured transactions. As of
    December 31, 2008, commercial operations had total cash
    collateral outstanding of $492 million, and
    $283 million outstanding in letters of credit to third
    parties primarily to support its economic hedging activities. As
    of December 31, 2008, total collateral held from
    counterparties was $788 million, including $6 million
    of restricted cash, and $28 million of letters of credit.

Future liquidity requirements may change based on the
    Company’s hedging activities and structures, fuel
    purchases, and future market conditions, including forward
    prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition,
    liquidity requirements are dependent on NRG’s credit
    ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.

Debt
    Service Obligations

NRG must annually offer a portion of its excess cash flow (as
    defined in the Senior Credit Facility) to its first lien lenders
    under the Term Loan Facility. The percentage of excess cash flow
    offered to these lenders is dependent upon the Company’s
    consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit
    Facility) at the end of the preceding year. Of the amount
    offered, the first lien lenders must accept 50% while the
    remaining 50% may either be accepted or rejected at the
    lenders’ option. Based on current credit market conditions
    the Company expects that its lenders will accept in full the
    mandatory offer required for 2008, and, as such, the Company has
    reclassified approximately



$197 million of Term Loan Facility maturity from a
    non-current to a current liability as of December 31, 2008.
    The mandatory annual offer required for 2007 was
    $446 million, against which the Company made a
    $300 million prepayment in December 2007. With this
    prepayment, the Company met a financial ratio by the end of 2007
    that resulted in a 0.25% reduction in the interest rate on both
    its Term Loan Facility and Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility
    which resulted in approximately $8 million in pre-tax
    interest savings during 2008. Of the remaining
    $146 million, the lenders accepted a repayment of
    $143 million in March 2008. The amount retained by the
    Company was used for investments, capital expenditures and other
    items as defined by the Senior Credit Facility.

As of December 31, 2008, NRG had approximately
    $4.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured
    high yield notes or Senior Notes, had approximately
    $2.6 billion in principal amount outstanding under the Term
    Loan Facility, and had issued $440 million of letters of
    credit under the Company’s $1.3 billion Synthetic
    Letter of Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility matures
    on February 2, 2011 and the Synthetic Letter of Credit
    Facility matures on February 1, 2013.

Principal payments on debt and capital leases as of
    December 31, 2008 are due in the following periods:

Repowering

NRG project capital
    expenditures consisted of approximately $218 million for
    wind turbines and construction related costs for the Elbow Creek
    wind farm project which became commercially operational in
    December 2008 and $180 million in turbine purchases for
    other wind projects currently under development. In addition,
    the Company’s

Repowering

NRG capital expenditures
    included $97 million related to the construction of Cedar
    Bayou Unit 4 in Texas, $101 million related to the
    development of STP Units 3 and 4 in Texas, $30 million for
    the repowering of the El Segundo generating station in
    California, and $19 million for the construction of Cos Cob
    in Connecticut.

The Company’s estimated repowering capital expenditures for
    2009 are expected to be approximately $256 million, of
    which capital expenditures related to STP units 3 and 4 will be
    approximately $145 million, the construction of Cedar Bayou
    Unit 4 anticipated to be approximately $22 million, and the
    balance of the Company’s repowering capital expenditures
    related to the purchase of additional wind turbines. The Company
    also anticipates receiving approximately $145 million in
    third party equity investments related to its

Repowering

NRG projects in 2009.

Related to

Repowering

NRG, the Company contributed equity
    of approximately $84 million to its Sherbino wind farm
    joint venture project with BP in 2008 which became commercially
    operational in October 2008.

Major maintenance and environmental capital
    expenditures

— The Company’s baghouse project
    at its Huntley and Dunkirk plants resulted in environmental
    capital expenditures of $124 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Other capital expenditures included
    $44 million for STP fuel and $71 million in
    maintenance capital expenditures in Texas primarily related to
    the W.A. Parish and Limestone plants.

NRG anticipates funding these maintenance capital projects
    primarily with funds generated from operating activities. The
    Company is also pursuing funding for certain environmental
    expenditures in the Northeast region through Solid Waste
    Disposal Bonds utilizing tax exempt financing, and expects to
    draw upon such funds during 2009.

Loans to affiliates

— During 2008 the Company
    loaned approximately $36 million in funds to GenConn Energy
    LLC, a 50/50 joint venture vehicle of NRG and the United
    Illuminating Company as a part of the Devon and Middletown plant
    projects. These loans, which are in the form of an interest
    bearing note, mature in 2009, at which point GenConn Energy
    LLC’s construction costs are expected to be funded through
    equity of NRG and the United Illuminating Company and
    non-recourse project level financing.



Environmental
    Capital Expenditures

Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated
    that environmental capital expenditures to be incurred from 2009
    through 2013 to meet NRG’s environmental commitments will
    be approximately $1.2 billion. These capital expenditures,
    in general, are related to installation of particulate,
    SO

    NO

,
    and mercury controls to comply with federal and state air
    quality rules and consent orders, as well as installation of
    “Best Technology Available” under the Phase II
    316(b) rule. NRG continues to explore cost effective
    alternatives that can achieve desired results. While this
    estimate reflects schedules and controls to meet anticipated
    reduction requirements, the full impact on the scope and timing
    of environmental retrofits cannot be determined until issuance
    of final rules by the USEPA.

Capital
    Allocation

2008 Capital Allocation Plan —

In December
    2007, the Company initiated its 2008 Capital Allocation Plan,
    with the repurchase of 2,037,700 shares of NRG common stock
    during that month for approximately $85 million. In
    February 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    an additional $200 million in common share repurchases that
    raised the total 2008 Capital Allocation Plan to approximately
    $300 million. In the first quarter 2008, the Company
    repurchased 1,281,600 shares of NRG common stock for
    approximately $55 million. In the third quarter 2008, the
    Company repurchased an additional 3,410,283 of NRG common stock
    in the open market for approximately $130 million. As of
    December 31, 2008, NRG had repurchased a total of
    6,729,583 shares of NRG common stock at a cost of
    approximately $270 million as part of its 2008 Capital
    Allocation Plan.

2009 Capital Allocation Plan —

On
    October 30, 2008, the Company announced its 2009 Capital
    Allocation Plan to purchase an additional $300 million in
    common stock, subject to restrictions under US securities laws.
    As part of the 2009 plan, the Company will invest over
    $511 million in maintenance and environmental capital
    expenditures in existing assets in 2009 and $256 million in
    investment in projects under

Repowering

NRG that are
    currently under construction or for which there exists current
    obligations. Finally, in addition to scheduled debt amortization
    payment, in the first quarter 2009 the Company will offer its
    first lien lenders $197 million of its 2008 excess cash
    flow (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility).

Preferred
    Stock Dividend Payments

For the year ended December 31, 2008, NRG paid
    approximately $29 million, $17 million and
    $9 million in dividend payments to holders of the
    Company’s 5.75%, 4% and 3.625% Preferred Stock.

Benefit
    Plans Obligations

As of December 31, 2008, NRG contributed $99 million
    towards its three defined benefit pension plans to meet the
    Company’s 2008 benefit obligation, $35 million of
    which was to partially fund the plans as a result of the weak
    market performance of plan assets in 2008. Based on the
    Company’s December 31, 2008 measurement of its benefit
    obligation for its three defined benefit pension plans, the
    Company is expected to contribute another $60 million to
    these plans during 2009, $29 million of which also relates
    to the Company’s 2008 benefit obligation.



Cash Flow
    Discussion

    compared to 2007

The following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the
    comparative years; all cash flow categories include the cash
    flows from both continuing operations and discontinued
    operations:

Net Cash
    Provided By Operating Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash provided by
    operating activities decreased by $83 million compared to
    the same period in 2007. The difference was due to:

•

Collateral paid —

In 2008, higher cash
    collateral paid to support the Company’s hedging and
    trading activities decreased cash from operations by
    $292 million as compared to the same period in 2007.

•

Working capital —

In 2008, the cash provided by
    working capital items increased by $196 million. Changes in
    option premiums collected from 2007 to 2008 classified in other
    current liabilities increased as a result of the deferral of
    option premium revenue to 2009 to match revenues with option
    expiration dates. Further, changes to account receivable were
    caused by higher energy revenues in December 2007 as compared to
    December 2008 and changes to accounts payable were caused by
    reduced maintenance expenses incurred in December 2007 as
    compared to December 2008.

Net Cash
    Used By Investing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash used in
    investing activities was approximately $345 million more
    than the same period in 2007. This was due to:

•

Capital expenditures —

NRG’s capital
    expenditures increased by $418 million due to

Repowering

NRG projects, primarily related to
    $398 million for wind turbines and construction activities
    related to Elbow Creek and other wind projects currently under
    development.

•

Sale of discontinued operations —

Proceeds from
    the sale of ITISA, net of cash divested, were $241 million
    in 2008.

•

Asset sales —

The Company received
    $14 million in proceeds primarily from the sale of rail
    cars in 2008 compared to proceeds of $57 million for the
    sale of Red Bluff and Chowchilla II power plants and
    equipment in the same period in 2007 for a net decrease in cash
    of $43 million.

•

Trading of emission allowances —

Net purchases
    and sales of emission allowances resulted in a decrease in cash
    of $44 million for 2008 as compared to 2007.

•

Equity Contribution —

The Company contributed
    approximately $84 million to its equity investment in
    Sherbino.

Net Cash
    Used By Financing Activities

For year ended December 31, 2008, net cash used by
    financing activities decreased by approximately
    $372 million compared to 2007, due to:

•

Term Loan Facility debt payment —

In 2008, the
    Company paid down $174 million of its Term Loan Facility,
    including the payment of excess cash flow, as discussed above
    under

Debt Service Obligations

. The Company paid down
    $332 million of its Term Loan Facility during 2007 for a
    net cash increase of $158 million for the year ended 2008
    compared to the same period in 2007.



•

Share repurchase —

During 2008, the Company
    repurchased approximately $185 million shares of NRG common
    stock, compared to $353 million for 2007 for a net
    $168 million increase to cash for the year ended 2008
    compared to the same period in 2007.

•

Sale of minority interest —

The Company
    received $50 million in proceeds from the sale of minority
    interest in NINA in the first half of 2008.

•

Payment of financing element of acquired
    derivatives —

For 2008, the Company paid
    approximately $43 million for the settlement of gas swaps
    related to the acquisition of Texas Genco in 2006.

•

Issuance of debt —

During 2008 the Company
    received $20 million in proceeds from borrowings made by
    its subsidiaries.

NOL’s,
    Deferred Tax Assets and FIN 48 Implications

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had generated total
    domestic pre-tax book income of $1,644 million and foreign
    continuing pre-tax book income of $85 million. In addition,
    NRG has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of
    $239 million, of which $41 million will expire
    starting in 2011 through 2017 and of which $198 million do
    not have an expiration date.

In addition to these amounts, the Company has $527 million
    of tax effected unrecognized tax benefits which relate primarily
    to net operating losses for tax return purposes but have been
    classified as capital loss carryforwards for financial
    statements purposes and for which a full valuation allowance has
    been established. As a result of the Company’s tax
    position, and based on current forecasts, we anticipate income
    tax payments of up to $100 million in 2009.

However, as the position remains uncertain, of the
    $527 million of tax effected unrecognized tax benefits, the
    Company has recorded a non-current tax liability of
    $208 million and may accrue the remaining balance as an
    increase to non-current liabilities until final resolution with
    the related taxing authority. The $208 million non-current
    tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits is due to taxable
    earnings for the period which there are no NOLs available to
    offset for financial statement purposes.

The Company has been contacted for examination by the Internal
    Revenue Service for years 2004 through 2006. The audit commenced
    during the third quarter 2008 and is expected to continue for
    approximately 18 to 24 months.

On July 6, 2007, the German government passed the Tax
    Reform Act of 2008, which reduces the German statutory and
    resulting effective tax rates on earnings from approximately 36%
    to approximately 27% effective January 1, 2008. Due to this
    reduction in the statutory and resulting effective tax rate in
    2007, NRG recognized a $29 million tax benefit and as of
    December 31, 2007, NRG had a German net deferred tax
    liability of approximately $84 million which includes the
    impact of this tax rate change.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Obligations
    under Certain Guarantee Contracts

NRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee
    arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate
    commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements
    include financial and performance guarantees, stand-by letters
    of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications.

    discussion.

Retained
    or Contingent Interests

NRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests
    in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.



Derivative
    Instrument Obligations

On August 11, 2005, NRG issued 3.625% Preferred Stock that
    includes a feature which is considered an embedded derivative
    per SFAS 133. Although it is considered an embedded
    derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting as it is
    excluded from the scope pursuant to paragraph 11(a) of
    SFAS 133. As of December 31, 2008, based on the
    Company’s stock price, the embedded derivative was
    out-of-the-money and had no redemption value. See also
    Item 15 — Note 13,

Capital Structure,

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    discussion.

On October 13, 2006, NRG, through its unrestricted
    wholly-owned subsidiaries CSF I and CSF II issued notes and
    preferred interests for the repurchase of NRG’s common
    stock. Included in each agreement was a feature considered an
    embedded derivative per SFAS 133. Although it is considered
    a derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting as it is
    excluded from the scope pursuant to paragraph 11(a) of
    SFAS 133. In August 2008, the Company amended the CSF I
    notes and preferred interests to early settle the CSF I embedded
    derivative. Accordingly, NRG made a cash payment of
    $45 million to CS for the benefit of CSF I, which was
    recorded to interest expense in the Company’s Consolidated
    Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2008, based on
    the Company’s stock price, the CSF II embedded derivative
    was out-of-the-money and had no redemption value. See also

Obligations
    Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated
    Entity

Variable interest in Equity investments

— As of
    December 31, 2008, NRG has several investments with an
    ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and
    energy-related entities that are accounted for under the equity
    method of accounting. One of these investments, GenConn Energy
    LLC, is a variable interest entity for which NRG is not the
    primary beneficiary. NRG’s pro-rata share of non-recourse
    debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately
    $135 million as of December 31, 2008. This
    indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to
    issue dividends or distributions to NRG. See also

Letter of Credit Facilities

— The
    Company’s $1.3 billion Synthetic Letter of Credit
    Facility is unfunded by NRG and is secured by a
    $1.3 billion cash deposit at Deutsche Bank AG, New York
    Branch that was funded using proceeds from the Term Loan
    Facility investors who participated in the facility syndication.
    Under the Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, NRG is allowed to
    issue letters of credit for general corporate purposes including
    posting collateral to support the Company’s commercial
    operations activities.

Fair
    Value of Derivative Instruments

NRG may enter into long-term power sales contracts, fuel
    purchase contracts and other energy-related financial
    instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to
    fluctuations in spot market prices, to hedge fuel requirements
    at generation facilities and protect fuel inventories. In
    addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated
    with the issuance of the Company’s variable rate and fixed
    rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements.

NRG’s trading activities include contracts entered into to
    profit from market price changes as opposed to hedging an
    exposure, and are subject to limits in accordance with the
    Company’s risk management policy. These contracts are
    recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the
    fair value of these derivative financial



instruments are recognized in earnings. These trading activities
    are a complement to NRG’s energy marketing portfolio.

The tables below disclose the activities that include both
    exchange and non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair
    value. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and
    unrealized changes in fair value; identify changes in fair value
    attributable to changes in valuation techniques; disaggregate
    estimated fair values at December 31, 2008, based on
    whether fair values are determined by quoted market prices or
    more subjective means; and indicate the maturities of contracts
    at December 31, 2008.

A small portion of NRG’s contracts are exchange-traded
    contracts with readily available quoted market prices. The
    majority of NRG’s contracts are non exchange-traded
    contracts valued using prices provided by external sources,
    primarily price quotations available through brokers or
    over-the-counter and on-line exchanges. For the majority of NRG
    markets, the Company receives quotes from multiple sources. To
    the extent that NRG receives multiple quotes, the Company’s
    prices reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices
    obtained from all sources that NRG believes provide the most
    liquid market for the commodity. If the Company receives one
    quote then the mid point of the bid-ask spread for that quote is
    used. The terms for which such price information is available
    vary by commodity, region and product. The remainder of the
    assets and liabilities represent contracts for which external
    sources or observable market quotes are not available. These
    contracts are valued based on various valuation techniques
    including but not limited to internal models based on a
    fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of
    observable market data with similar characteristics. Contracts
    valued with prices provided by models and other valuation
    techniques make up 5% of the total fair value of all derivative
    contracts. The fair value of each contract is discounted using a
    risk free interest rate. In addition, the Company applies a
    credit reserve to reflect credit risk which is calculated based
    on published default probabilities. To the extent that
    NRG’s net exposure under a specific master agreement is an
    asset, the Company is using the counterparty’s default swap
    rate. If the exposure under a specific master agreement is a
    liability, the Company is using NRG’s default swap rate.
    The credit reserve is added to the discounted fair value to
    reflect the exit price that a market participant would be
    willing to receive to assume NRG’s liabilities or that a
    market participant would be willing to pay for NRG’s
    assets. As of December 31, 2008 the credit reserve resulted
    in a $22 million decrease in fair value which is composed
    of a $10 million gain in other comprehensive income, or
    OCI, and a $12 million gain in derivative revenue.

The fair values in each category reflect the level of forward
    prices and volatility factors as of December 31, 2008 and
    may change as a result of changes in these factors. Management
    uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity
    and derivative contracts NRG holds and sells. These estimates
    consider various factors including closing exchange and
    over-the-counter price quotations, time value, volatility
    factors and credit exposure. It is possible however, that future
    market prices could vary from those used in recording assets and
    liabilities from energy marketing and trading activities and
    such variations could be material.



The Company has elected to disclose derivative activity on a

trade-by-trade

basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master
    agreement level. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in
    individual current and non-current derivative assets or
    liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk
    of the Company’s portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A

— Commodity Price Risk

, NRG measures the
    sensitivity of the Company’s portfolio to potential changes
    in market prices using Value at Risk, or VAR, a statistical
    model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market
    price and volatility. NRG’s risk management policy places a
    limit on

one-day

holding period VAR, which limits the Company’s net open
    position. As the Company’s

trade-by-trade

derivative accounting results in a

gross-up

of
    the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities, the net
    derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator
    of our hedging activity. As of December 31, 2008,
    NRG’s net derivative asset was $996 million, an
    increase to total fair value of $1,488 million as compared
    to December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily driven by
    decreases in gas and power prices as well as the roll-off of
    trades that settled during the period.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

NRG’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition
    and results of operations are based upon the consolidated
    financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the US.
    The preparation of these financial statements and related
    disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, or GAAP, requires the application of appropriate
    technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of
    estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The
    application of these policies necessarily involves judgments
    regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of
    particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges. These
    judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the
    financial statements and disclosures based on varying
    assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the
    financial and operating environment may also have a significant
    effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the
    results reported through the application of accounting measures
    used in preparing the financial statements and related
    disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have
    not changed.

On an ongoing basis, NRG evaluates these estimates, utilizing
    historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods
    the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results
    may differ substantially from the Company’s estimates. Any
    effects on the Company’s business, financial position or
    results of operations resulting from revisions to these
    estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that
    give rise to the revision become known.

NRG’s significant accounting policies are summarized in
    Item 15 — Note 2,

Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

, to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting
    policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to
    the portrayal of the Company’s financial position and
    results of operations, and that require the most difficult,
    subjective

and/or

complex judgments by management regarding estimates about
    matters that are inherently uncertain.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company follows the guidance of SFAS 133, to account
    for derivative financial instruments. SFAS 133 requires the
    Company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the
    balance sheet, and recognize changes in the fair value of
    non-hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. In
    certain cases, NRG may apply hedge accounting to the
    Company’s derivative instruments. The criteria used to
    determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are:
    (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure,
    (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and
    (iii) if there is a correlation between the fair value of
    the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item.
    Changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted
    for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to
    the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or
    deferred and recorded as a component of OCI, and subsequently
    recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.

For purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative
    instruments, NRG uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes.
    When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models
    to determine the fair value. These internal models include
    assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on
    the specific market in which the energy commodity is being
    purchased or sold, using externally available forward market
    pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model.
    In order to qualify derivative instruments for hedged
    transactions, NRG estimates the forecasted generation occurring
    within a specified time period. Judgments related to the
    probability of forecasted generation occurring are based on
    available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and
    generation, and historical physical delivery on similar
    contracts. The probability that hedged forecasted generation
    will occur by the end of a specified time period could change
    the results of operations by requiring amounts currently
    classified in OCI to be reclassified into earnings, creating
    increased variability in our earnings. These estimations are
    considered to be critical accounting estimates.



Certain derivative financial instruments that meet the criteria
    for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope
    exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered
    Normal Purchase and Normal Sales, or NPNS. The availability of
    this exception is based upon the assumption that NRG has the
    ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the
    underlying item. These assumptions are based on available
    baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation,
    and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that
    are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting
    treatment, and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it
    is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer
    meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the
    related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
    value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.

Income
    Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax
    Assets

As of December 31, 2008, NRG had a valuation allowance of
    approximately $359 million. This amount is comprised of
    U.S. domestic capital loss carryforwards and
    non-depreciable property of approximately $292 million,
    foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
    $66 million and foreign capital loss carryforwards of
    approximately $1 million. In assessing the recoverability
    of NRG’s deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether
    it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
    deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization
    of deferred tax assets is dependent upon projected capital gains
    and available tax planning strategies.

As of December 31, 2007, cumulative net operating losses of
    $245 million had been fully utilized with the exception of
    state NOLs. The utilization of the Company’s NOLs depends
    on several factors, such as NRG’s ability to utilize tax
    benefits through carryforwards to future periods, the
    application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions.

NRG continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing
    authorities in other jurisdictions. Considerable judgment is
    required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item
    that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. NRG is
    subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax
    returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various
    state and foreign jurisdictions including major operations
    located in Germany and Australia. The Company is no longer
    subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years
    prior to 2002. With few exceptions, state and local income tax
    examinations are no longer open for years before 2003. The
    Company’s significant foreign operations are also no longer
    subject to examination by local jurisdictions for years prior to
    2000.

Evaluation
    of Assets for Impairment and Other Than Temporary Decline in
    Value

In accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, or
    SFAS 144, NRG evaluates property, plant and equipment and
    certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of
    impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are:

•

Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;

•

Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used
    or its physical condition;

•

Adverse business climate;

•

Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
    originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an
    asset;

•

Current-period loss combined with a history of losses or the
    projection of future losses; and

•

Change in the Company’s intent about an asset from an
    intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset
    will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously
    estimated useful life.

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
    comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future
    net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through
    considering project specific assumptions for long-term power
    pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and
    expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be
    impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
    amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
    fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability
    weighting of different courses of action available to the
    Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using
    valuation



techniques such as the present value of expected future cash
    flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations
    and considers various factors, including forward price curves
    for energy, fuel costs, and operating costs. However, actual
    future market prices and project costs could vary from the
    assumptions used in the Company’s estimates, and the impact
    of such variations could be material.

For assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that
    the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the
    carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to
    determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets
    held-for-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount
    or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair
    value under SFAS 144, whether in conjunction with an asset
    to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the
    evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature subjective.
    NRG considers quoted market prices in active markets to the
    extent they are available. In the absence of such information,
    the Company may consider prices of similar assets, consult with
    brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. NRG will also
    discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the
    asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk
    involved with such an investment or employ an expected present
    value method that probability-weights a range of possible
    outcomes. The use of these methods involves the same inherent
    uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with
    respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices
    and project costs could vary from those used in the
    Company’s estimates, and the impact of such variations
    could be material.

For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were
    reductions of $23 million and $11 million,
    respectively, in income from continuing operation due to
    impairment of an investment in commercial paper. The Company
    recorded these impairments as a reduction to interest income.
    For the year ended December 31, 2006, there was no
    reduction in income from continuing operations due to an
    impairment.

NRG is also required to evaluate its equity-method and
    cost-method investments to determine whether or not they are
    impaired. Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18,

The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common
    Stock

, or APB18, provides the accounting requirements for
    these investments. The standard for determining whether an
    impairment must be recorded under APB 18 is whether the value is
    considered an “other than a temporary” decline in
    value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under APB
    18 involves the same uncertainties as described for long-lived
    assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in
    accordance with SFAS 144. Similarly, the estimates that NRG
    makes with respect to its equity and cost-method investments are
    subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates
    could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the
    Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under
    the provisions of SFAS 144, NRG would record its
    proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate
    its investment for an other than temporary decline in value
    under APB 18.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

As part of the acquisition of Texas Genco, NRG recorded goodwill
    and intangible assets at its Texas segment reporting unit. The
    Company applied SFAS No. 141,

Business
    Combinations,

or SFAS 141, and SFAS 142 to account
    for these intangibles. Under these standards, the Company
    amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their
    respective estimated weighted-average useful lives, while
    goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. However,
    goodwill and all intangible assets not subject to amortization
    are tested for impairments at least annually, or more frequently
    whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would
    more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit
    below its carrying amount. We test goodwill for impairment at
    the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing
    whether the components of our operating segments constitute
    businesses for which discrete financial information is available
    and segment management regularly reviews the operating results
    of those components. If it is determined that the fair value of
    a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, where necessary
    the Company’s goodwill

and/or

intangible asset with indefinite lives will be impaired at that
    time.

The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment
    as of December 31, 2008 for its Texas reporting unit, which
    is at the operating segment level. The impairment assessment
    included both income and



market approaches, represented by discounted cash flow and
    earnings multiple methodologies that considered the following:

Income
    approach

•

a discounted cash flow valuation for the region’s major
    solid fuel baseload plants that utilized the Company’s
    six-year budget data and a market-derived earnings multiple
    terminal value, with such terminal value assessed for
    reasonableness by capitalizing the final year’s cash flow
    with adjustments for expected inflation;

•

a discounted cash flow valuation for the tax benefit associated
    with the amortization of tax basis of the region’s
    intangible assets;

•

a market approach valuation of the region’s gas plants
    using market-derived earnings multiples of comparable power
    generators, with adjustments for the region’s expected
    capital expenditure requirements;

Market
    approach

•

an overall market approach reasonableness test that reconciled
    NRG’s current market value based upon the average percent
    of total company value represented by NRG Texas, as measured by
    four different earnings measures, each calculated over three
    different historical time periods. This market approach
    reasonableness test also considered sensitivity testing under a
    number of different implied control premium scenarios, including
    one with no premium.

The income approach methodologies were consistent with the
    approach for determining fair value at December 31, 2007
    and 2006. Significant assumptions and judgments impacting the
    Company’s goodwill impairment assessment included
    management’s projections of operating results and capital
    expenditure requirements, risk-adjusted discount rates, market
    performance, and other factors. Under all methodologies, the
    calculated NRG Texas equity value exceeded the NRG Texas book
    value, and the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired
    as of December 31, 2008.

In connection with the Texas Genco acquisition, the Company
    recognized the estimated fair value of certain power sale
    contracts and fuel contracts acquired. NRG estimated their fair
    value using forward pricing curves as of the closing date of the
    acquisition over the life of each contract. These contracts had
    net negative fair values at the closing date of the acquisition
    and were reflected as assumed contracts in the consolidated
    balance sheets. Assumed contracts are amortized to revenues and
    fuel expense as applicable based on the estimated realization of
    the fair value established on the closing date over the
    contractual lives.

Contingencies

NRG records a loss contingency when management determines it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until management determines it is certain that the
    future event will become or does become a reality. Such
    determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts
    and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of
    the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail
    its contingencies in Item 15 — Note 21,

Commitments and Contingencies,

    Financial Statements.

Item 7A —

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

NRG is exposed to several market risks in the Company’s
    normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss
    that may result from market changes associated with the
    Company’s merchant power generation or with an existing or
    forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of
    market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk,
    interest rate risk and currency exchange risk. In order to
    manage these risks the Company uses various fixed-price forward
    purchase and sales contracts, futures and option contracts
    traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps and
    options traded in the over-the-counter financial markets to:

•

Manage and hedge fixed-price purchase and sales commitments;

•

Manage and hedge exposure to variable rate debt obligations;

•

Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices; and

•

Hedge fuel requirements for the Company’s generating
    facilities.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot
    prices, forward prices, volatility in commodities, and
    correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas,
    electricity, coal, oil, and emissions credits. A number of
    factors influence the level and volatility of prices for energy
    commodities and related derivative products. These factors
    include:

•

Seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;

•

Extreme peak demands due to weather conditions;

•

Available supply resources;

•

Transportation availability and reliability within and between
    regions; and

•

Changes in the nature and extent of federal and state
    regulations.

As part of NRG’s overall portfolio, NRG manages the
    commodity price risk of the Company’s merchant generation
    operations by entering into various derivative or non-derivative
    instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from
    forecasted sales of electricity and purchases of fuel. These
    instruments include forwards, futures, swaps, and option
    contracts traded on various exchanges, such as New York
    Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, Intercontinental Exchange, or
    ICE, and Chicago Climate Exchange, or CCX, as well as
    over-the-counter financial markets. The portion of forecasted
    transactions hedged may vary based upon management’s
    assessment of market, weather, operation and other factors.

While some of the contracts the Company uses to manage risk
    represent commodities or instruments for which prices are
    available from external sources, other commodities and certain
    contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other
    pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected
    future market prices, contract quantities, or both. NRG uses the
    Company’s best estimates to determine the fair value of
    commodity and derivative contracts held and sold. These
    estimates consider various factors, including closing exchange
    and over-the-counter price quotations, time value, volatility
    factors and credit exposure. However, it is likely that future
    market prices could vary from those used in recording
    mark-to-market derivative instrument valuation, and such
    variations could be material.

NRG measures the risk of the Company’s portfolio using
    several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests,
    scenario tests, stress tests, position reports, and Value at
    Risk, or VAR. VAR is a statistical model that attempts to
    predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility.
    Currently, the company estimates VAR using a Monte Carlo
    simulation based methodology. NRG’s total portfolio
    includes mark-to-market and non mark-to-market energy assets and
    liabilities.

NRG uses a diversified VAR model to calculate an estimate of the
    potential loss in the fair value of the Company’s energy
    assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, load
    obligations, and bilateral physical and financial transactions.
    The key assumptions for the Company’s diversified model
    include: (i) a lognormal



distribution of prices,

(ii) one-day

holding period, (iii) a 95% confidence interval,
    (iv) a rolling

36-month

forward looking period, and (v) market implied volatilities
    and historical price correlations.

As of December 31, 2008, the VAR for NRG’s commodity
    portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and
    bilateral physical and financial transactions calculated using
    the diversified VAR model was $43 million.

The following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VAR
    for NRG for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007:

VAR

In millions

(a)

Prior to December 4, 2007,
    NRG’s VAR measurement was based on a rolling

24-month

forward looking period

Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as
    VAR, the evolving nature of the competitive markets for
    electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of
    changes in market prices, the VAR calculation may not capture
    the full extent of commodity price exposure. As a result, actual
    changes in the fair value of mark-to-market energy assets and
    liabilities could differ from the calculated VAR, and such
    changes could have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial results.

In order to provide additional information for comparative
    purposes to NRG’s peers, the Company also uses VAR to
    estimate the potential loss of derivative financial instruments
    that are subject to mark-to-market accounting. These derivative
    instruments include transactions that were entered into for both
    asset management and trading purposes. The VAR for the
    derivative financial instruments calculated using the
    diversified VAR model as of December 31, 2008, for the
    entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset
    management and trading, was approximately $35 million
    primarily driven by

asset-backed

transactions.

Interest
    Rate Risk

NRG is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through the
    Company’s issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt.
    Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by
    entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate
    swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts
    reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in
    primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account
    the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate
    derivative instrument. NRG’s risk management policies allow
    the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate
    debt obligations.

In January 2006, the Company entered into a series of new
    interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps became effective
    on February 15, 2006, and are intended to hedge the risk
    associated with floating interest rates. For each of the
    interest rate swaps, NRG pays its counterparty the equivalent of
    a fixed interest payment on a predetermined notional value, and
    NRG receives the equivalent of a floating interest payment based
    on a

3-month

LIBOR rate calculated on the same notional value. All interest
    rate swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made
    quarterly, and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each
    interest period. While the notional value of each of the swaps
    does not vary over time, the swaps are designed to mature
    sequentially. The total notional amount of these swaps as of
    December 31, 2008 was $1.9 billion.



The maturities and notional amounts of each tranche of these
    swaps in connection with the Senior Credit Facility are as
    follows:

Maturity

March 31, 2009

$

150 million

March 31, 2010

$

190 million

March 31, 2011

1.55 billion

In addition to those listed above, the Company had the following
    additional interest rate swaps outstanding as of
    December 31, 2008:

$

266 million

June 10, 2019

Fixed to floating interest rate swap for Senior notes, due 2014

$

400 million

December 15, 2013

If all of the above swaps had been discontinued on
    December 31, 2008, the Company would have owed the
    counterparties approximately $156 million. Based on the
    investment grade rating of the counterparties, NRG believes its
    exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by counterparties
    to its hedge contracts to be insignificant.

NRG has both long and short-term debt instruments that subject
    the Company to the risk of loss associated with movements in
    market interest rates. As of December 31, 2008, a 1% change
    in interest rates would result in a $12.8 million change in
    interest expense on a rolling twelve month basis.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company’s long-term debt
    fair value was $7.5 billion and the carrying amount was
    $8.0 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market
    interest rates would have increased the fair value of the
    Company’s long-term debt by $401 million.

Liquidity
    Risk

Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of
    NRG’s activities and in the management of the
    Company’s assets and liabilities. NRG’s liquidity
    management framework is intended to maximize liquidity access
    and minimize funding costs. Through active liquidity management,
    the Company seeks to preserve stable, reliable and
    cost-effective sources of funding. This enables the Company to
    replace maturing obligations when due and fund assets at
    appropriate maturities and rates. To accomplish this task,
    management uses a variety of liquidity risk measures that take
    into consideration market conditions, prevailing interest rates,
    liquidity needs, and the desired maturity profile of liabilities.

Based on a sensitivity analysis, a $1 per MMBtu increase or
    decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the marginable
    contracts for power and gas positions would cause a change in
    margin collateral outstanding of approximately $72 million
    as of December 31, 2008. In addition, a 0.25 MMBtu/MWh
    change in heat rates for heat rate positions would result in a
    change in margin collateral of approximately $82 million as
    of December 31, 2008. This analysis uses simplified
    assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and
    margin-related contract provisions as of December 31, 2008.

Under the second lien, NRG is required to post certain letter of
    credits as credit support for changes in commodity prices. As of
    December 31, 2008, $19 million in letters of credit
    are outstanding to second lien counterparties. With changes in
    commodity prices, the letters of credit could grow to
    $87 million, the cap under the agreements.

Credit
    Risk

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from
    non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the
    terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and
    manages credit risk through credit policies that include:
    (i) an established credit approval process, (ii) a
    daily monitoring of counterparties’ credit limits,
    (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin,
    collateral, credit derivatives or prepayment



arrangements, (iv) the use of payment netting agreements,
    and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for
    the netting of positive and negative exposures of various
    contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks
    surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately
    impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company
    seeks to mitigate counterparty risk with a diversified portfolio
    of counterparties, including ten participants under its first
    and second lien structure. The Company also has credit
    protection within various agreements to call on additional
    collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is
    collected and held at NRG to cover the credit risk of the
    counterparty until positions settle.

A sharp economic downturn in the US and overseas markets during
    the latter part of 2008 was prompted by a combination of
    factors: tight credit markets, speculation and fear over the
    health of the US and global financial systems, and weaker
    economic activity in general prompting fears of an economic
    recession. Under the current market dynamics, the Company has
    heightened its management and mitigation of counterparty credit
    risk by using credit limits, netting agreements, collateral
    thresholds, volumetric limits and other mitigation measures,
    where available. NRG avoids concentration of counterparties
    whenever possible and applies credit policies that include an
    evaluation of counterparties’ financial condition,
    collateral requirements and the use of standard agreements that
    allow for netting and other security.

As of December 31, 2008, total credit exposure to
    substantially all counterparties was $2.0 billion and NRG
    held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those
    positions of $788 million resulting in a net exposure of
    $1.2 billion. Total credit exposure is discounted at the
    risk free rate.

The following table highlights the credit quality and the net
    counterparty credit exposure by industry sector. Net
    counterparty credit risk is defined as the aggregate net asset
    position for NRG with counterparties where netting is permitted
    under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark to
    market and normal purchase and sale and non-derivative
    transactions. The exposure is shown net of collateral held, and
    includes amounts net of receivables or payables.

Credit exposure excludes California

NRG has credit risk exposure to certain counterparties
    representing more than 10% of total net exposure and the
    aggregate of such counterparties was $241 million. No
    counterparty represents more than 20% of total net credit
    exposure. Approximately 80% of NRG’s positions relating to
    credit risk roll-off by the end of 2011. Changes in hedge
    positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and
    counterparty concentration. NRG does not anticipate any material
    adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or
    results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any of
    NRG’s counterparties.



Currency
    Exchange Risk

NRG may be subject to foreign currency risk as a result of the
    Company entering into purchase commitments with foreign vendors
    for the purchase of major equipment associated with

Repowering

NRG initiatives. To reduce the risks to such
    foreign currency exposure, the Company may enter into
    transactions to hedge its foreign currency exposure using
    currency options and forward contracts. At December 31,
    2008, no foreign currency options and forward contracts were
    outstanding. As a result of the Company’s limited foreign
    currency exposure to date, the effect of foreign currency
    fluctuations has not been material to the Company’s results
    of operations, financial position and cash flows.

The effects of a hypothetical simultaneous 10% appreciation in
    the US dollar from year-end 2007 levels against all other
    currencies of countries in which the Company has continuing
    operations would result in an immaterial impact to NRG’s
    consolidated statements of operations and approximately
    $58 million in pre-tax unrealized income reflected in the
    currency translation adjustment component of OCI.

Controls

Conclusion
    Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of NRG’s
    management, including its principal executive officer, principal
    financial officer and principal accounting officer, NRG
    conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such
    term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

or

15d-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s
    principal executive officer, principal financial officer and
    principal accounting officer concluded that the disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
    period covered by this annual report on

Form 10-K.

Management’s report on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting and the report of the Company’s
    independent registered public accounting firm are incorporated
    under the caption “Management’s Report on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting” and under the caption
    “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
    Firm,” of the Company’s 2008 Annual Report to
    Shareholders.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Except for the remediation of the material weakness discussed
    below, there were no changes in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) that occurred in the fourth quarter of
    2008 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Material
    Weakness Related to Operating Revenues

Subsequent to the filing of the September 30, 2008

Form 10-Q,

the Company identified a material weakness in our internal
    control over financial reporting related to the accounting for
    option premiums on certain derivative instruments. This material
    weakness resulted from the operational ineffectiveness of
    reconciliation and review controls specifically related to our
    accounting for premiums on energy options.

The material weakness resulted in an error to operating revenues
    of $78 million in the third quarter of 2008. In this

Form 10-K,

we have revised our unaudited quarterly financial data for the
    quarter ended September 30, 2008. For further information,
    see Item 15 — Note 27,

Unaudited
    Quarterly Financial Data,

to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.



In connection with this material weakness, we reevaluated our
    disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30,
    2008. Based on this reevaluation, and solely as a result of this
    material weakness, the Company’s principal executive
    officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting
    officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
    were not effective as of September 30, 2008.

Remediation
    of Material Weakness in Internal Control

During the fourth quarter, a number of remedial actions were
    taken to address the material weakness, which included:

•

Reviewing and documenting all mark-to-market logic in our power
    marketing trading activity system, including any manual
    adjustments related thereto;

•

Formalizing and documenting energy options accounting;

•

Formalizing the analysis and review by management of realized
    and unrealized gain/(loss) derivative accounts;

•

Expanding the communication process between accounting, risk
    management and commercial operations groups to understand
    derivative accounting results and changes in the commercial
    operations portfolio; and

•

Establishing ongoing training and education in the
    Company’s accounting group on accounting for derivative
    option premiums

We have completed the process of implementing the aforementioned
    enhancements, and believe that we have fully remediated the
    material weakness in our internal control over financial
    reporting with respect to the appropriate accounting for option
    premiums on certain derivative instruments as of
    December 31, 2008.

Inherent
    Limitations over Internal Controls

NRG’s internal control over financial reporting is designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that:

1.

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of our assets;

2.

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
    made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
    and directors; and

3.

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our
    assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated
    financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
    absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
    because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility
    of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of
    controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system
    may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely
    basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
    future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

NRG Energy Inc.’s management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company’s management, including its principal executive
    officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting
    officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the
    Company’s evaluation under the framework in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework, the Company’s
    management concluded that its internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been
    audited by KPMG LLP, the Company’s independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is
    included in this

Form 10-K.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

NRG Energy, Inc.:

We have audited NRG Energy, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO). NRG Energy, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, NRG Energy, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries
    as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
    and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, and
    our report dated February 12, 2009 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

NRG Energy, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008
    and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income/(loss), and consolidated statements of cash
    flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2008. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements, we also have audited
    financial statement schedule “Schedule II. Valuation
    and Qualifying Accounts.” These consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
    our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, in order to comply with the requirements of
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company
    adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
    No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, effective January 1,
    2008; FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of
    SFAS No. 109, effective January 1, 2007; Emerging
    Issues Task Force Issue

No. 04-6,

Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the
    Mining Industry, and SFAS No. 123R, Share Based
    Payments, and related interpretations effective January 1,
    2006; and SFAS No 158, Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106
    and 132R, effective December 31, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), NRG
    Energy, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO), and our report dated February 12, 2009 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 —

Nature of
    Business

General

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a wholesale power
    generation company with a significant presence in major
    competitive power markets in the US. NRG is engaged in the
    ownership, development, construction and operation of power
    generation facilities, the transacting in and trading of fuel
    and transportation services, and the trading of energy, capacity
    and related products in the US and select international markets.

As of December 31, 2008, NRG had a total global portfolio
    of 189 active operating fossil fuel and nuclear generation
    units, at 48 power generation plants, with an aggregate
    generation capacity of approximately 24,005 MW, and
    approximately 550 MW under construction which includes
    partners’ interests of 275 MW. In addition, NRG has
    ownership interests in two wind farms representing an aggregate
    generation capacity of 270 MW, which includes partner
    interests of 75 MW. Within the US, NRG has one of the
    largest and most diversified power generation portfolios in
    terms of geography, fuel-type and dispatch levels, with
    approximately 22,925 MW of fossil fuel and nuclear
    generation capacity in 177 active generating units at 43 plants
    and ownership interests in two wind farms representing
    195 MW of wind generation capacity. These power generation
    facilities are primarily located in Texas (approximately
    11,010 MW, including the 195 MW from the two wind
    farms), the Northeast (approximately 7,020 MW), South
    Central (approximately 2,845 MW), and West (approximately
    2,130 MW) regions of the US, and approximately 115 MW
    of additional generation capacity from the Company’s
    thermal assets.

NRG was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on May 29,
    1992. NRG’s common stock is listed on the New York
    Stock Exchange under the symbol “NRG”. The
    Company’s headquarters and principal executive offices are
    located at 211 Carnegie Center, Princeton, New Jersey 08540.
    NRG’s telephone number is

(609) 524-4500.

. NRG’s recent annual reports,
    quarterly reports, current reports, and other periodic filings
    are available free of charge through the Company’s website.

Note 2 —

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include NRG’s
    accounts and operations and those of its subsidiaries in which
    the Company has a controlling interest. All significant
    intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
    consolidation. The usual condition for a controlling financial
    interest is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of
    an entity. However, a controlling financial interest may also
    exist in entities, such as a variable interest entity, through
    arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests.

As such, NRG applies the guidance of FASB Interpretation, or
    FIN, No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities,

or FIN 46R, to consolidate variable interest
    entities, or VIEs, for which the Company is the primary
    beneficiary. FIN 46R requires a variable interest holder to
    consolidate a VIE if that party will absorb a majority of the
    expected losses of the VIE, receive the majority of the expected
    residual returns of the VIE, or both. This party is considered
    the primary beneficiary. Conversely, NRG will not consolidate a
    VIE in which it has a majority ownership interest when the
    Company is not considered the primary beneficiary. In
    determining the primary beneficiary, NRG thoroughly evaluates
    the VIE’s design, capital structure, and relationships
    among variable interest holders. If a primary beneficiary cannot
    be determined by a qualitative analysis, a quantitative analysis
    allocating the expected cash flows among the variable interest
    holders is used in the determination.

As discussed in Note 14,

Investments Accounted for by
    the Equity Method

, NRG has investments in partnerships,
    joint ventures and projects, one of which is a VIE for which the
    Company is not the primary beneficiary.

Accounting policies for all of NRG’s operations are in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    US. Upon its emergence from bankruptcy on December 5, 2003,
    the Company qualified for and

.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
    an original maturity of three months or less at the time of
    purchase.

Funds
    Deposited by Counterparties

Funds deposited by counterparties consist of cash held as
    collateral from hedge counterparties in support of energy risk
    management activities, and at December 31, 2008, it is the
    Company’s intention to limit the use of these funds.

    underlying contracts, the Company will refund this collateral to
    the hedge counterparties pursuant to the terms and conditions of
    the underlying trades. No such restrictions were imposed by the
    Company in prior periods, and the amount of cash collateral held
    at December 31, 2007 was immaterial. Changes in funds
    deposited by counterparties are closely associated with the
    Company’s operating activities, and are classified as an
    operating activity in the Company’s consolidated statements
    of cash flows.

Restricted
    Cash

Restricted cash consists primarily of funds held to satisfy the
    requirements of certain debt agreements and funds held within
    the Company’s projects that are restricted in their use.
    These funds are used to pay for current operating expenses and
    current debt service payments, per the restrictions of the debt
    agreements.

Trade
    Receivables

Trade receivables are reported in the balance sheet at
    outstanding principal adjusted for any write-offs and the
    allowance for doubtful accounts.

Inventory

Inventory is valued at the lower of weighted average cost or
    market, unless evidence indicates that the weighted average cost
    will be recovered with a normal profit in the ordinary course of
    business, and consists principally of fuel oil, coal and raw
    materials used to generate steam. The Company removes these
    inventories as they are used in the production of electricity or
    steam. Spare parts inventory is valued at a weighted average
    cost, since the Company expects to recover these costs in the
    ordinary course of business. The Company removes these
    inventories when they are used for repairs, maintenance or
    capital projects. Sales of inventory are classified as an
    operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost; however
    impairment adjustments are recorded whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be
    recoverable. NRG also classifies nuclear fuel related to the
    Company’s 44% ownership interest in STP as part of the
    Company’s property, plant, and equipment. Significant
    additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized
    as incurred, while repairs and maintenance that do not improve
    or extend the life of the respective asset are charged to
    expense as incurred. Depreciation other than nuclear fuel is
    computed using the straight-line method, while nuclear fuel is
    amortized based on units of production over the estimated useful
    lives. Certain assets and their related accumulated depreciation
    amounts are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with
    the resulting gain or loss included in other income/(expense) in
    the consolidated statements of operations.

Asset
    Impairments

Long-lived assets that are held and used are reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    carrying values may not be recoverable. Such reviews are
    performed in accordance with SFAS 144. An impairment loss
    is recognized if the total future estimated undiscounted cash
    flows expected from an asset are less than its carrying value.
    An impairment charge is measured by the difference between an
    asset’s carrying amount and fair value with the difference
    recorded in operating costs and expenses in the statements of
    operations. Fair values are determined by a variety of valuation
    methods, including appraisals, sales prices of similar assets
    and present value techniques.

Investments accounted for by the equity method are reviewed for
    impairment in accordance with APB 18, which requires that a loss
    in value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline
    should be recognized. The Company identifies and measures losses
    in the value of equity method investments based upon a
    comparison of fair value to carrying value.

Discontinued
    Operations

Long-lived assets or disposal groups are classified as
    discontinued operations when all of the required criteria
    specified in SFAS 144 are met. These criteria include,
    among others, existence of a qualified plan to dispose of an
    asset or disposal group, an assessment that completion of a sale
    within one year is probable and approval of the appropriate
    level of management. In addition, upon completion of the
    transaction, the operations and cash flows of the disposal group
    must be eliminated from ongoing operations of the Company, and
    the disposal group must not have any significant continuing
    involvement with the Company. Discontinued operations are
    reported at the lower of the asset’s carrying amount or
    fair value less cost to sell.

Project
    Development Costs and Capitalized Interest

Project development costs are expensed in the preliminary stages
    of a project and capitalized when the project is deemed to be
    commercially viable. Commercial viability is determined by one
    or a series of actions including among others, Board of Director
    approval pursuant to a formal project plan that subjects the
    Company to significant future obligations that can only be
    discharged by the use of a Company asset.

Interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance capital projects
    is capitalized if material, until the project under construction
    is ready for its intended use. The amount of interest
    capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
    2006 was $45 million, $11 million and $5 million,
    respectively.

When a project is available for operations, capitalized interest
    and project development costs are reclassified to property,
    plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the estimated useful life of the project’s related assets.
    Capitalized costs are charged to expense if a project is
    abandoned or management otherwise determines the costs to be
    unrecoverable.

Debt
    Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest
    expense on a basis which approximates the effective interest
    method over the term of the related debt.

Intangible
    Assets

Intangible assets represent contractual rights held by NRG. The
    Company recognizes specifically identifiable intangible assets
    including emission allowances, power and fuel contracts when
    specific rights and contracts are acquired. In addition, NRG
    also established values for emission allowances and power
    contracts upon adoption of Fresh Start reporting. These
    intangible assets are amortized on a contracted volumes,
    straight line or units of production basis.



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not
    amortized, but rather are tested for impairment at least
    annually or more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that such acquired intangible assets have
    been determined to have finite lives and should now be amortized
    over their useful lives. NRG had no intangible assets with
    indefinite lives recorded as of December 31, 2008.

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company recognizes
    goodwill for the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net
    value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

NRG performs goodwill impairment tests annually, typically
    during the fourth quarter, and when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step
    process:

Step one

—

Identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a
    reporting unit to the book value, including goodwill. If the
    fair value exceeds book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is
    not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value,
    proceed to step two.

Step two

—

Compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill to the book value of the reporting unit goodwill. If
    the book value of goodwill exceeds fair value, an impairment
    charge is recognized for the sum of such excess.

Income
    Taxes

NRG accounts for income taxes using the liability method in
    accordance with SFAS 109, which requires that the Company
    use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred
    income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all
    significant temporary differences.

NRG has two categories of income tax expense or
    benefit — current and deferred, as follows:

•

Current income tax expense or benefit consists solely of regular
    tax less applicable tax credits, and

•

Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the change in the net
    deferred income tax asset or liability, excluding amounts
    charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income.

NRG reports some of the Company’s revenues and expenses
    differently for financial statement purposes than for income tax
    return purposes resulting in temporary and permanent differences
    between the Company’s financial statements and income tax
    returns. The tax effects of such temporary differences are
    recorded as either deferred income tax assets or deferred income
    tax liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets. NRG measures the Company’s deferred income tax
    assets and deferred income tax liabilities using income tax
    rates that are currently in effect. A valuation allowance is
    recorded to reduce the Company’s net deferred tax assets to
    an amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized.

In January 2007, the Company adopted FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

, or
    FIN 48, which applies to all tax positions related to
    income taxes subject to SFAS 109. Under FIN 48, tax
    benefits are recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that a
    tax position will be sustained upon examination by the
    authorities. The benefit from a position that has surpassed the
    more-likely-than-not threshold is the largest amount of benefit
    that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. The
    Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Revenue
    Recognition

NRG is primarily a power generation company, operating a
    portfolio of majority-owned electric generating plants and
    certain plants in which the Company’s ownership interest is
    50% or less, which are accounted for under the equity method of
    accounting. NRG also produces thermal energy for sale to
    customers, principally through steam and chilled water
    facilities.

Energy

— Both physical and financial
    transactions are entered into to optimize the financial
    performance of NRG’s generating facilities. Electric energy
    revenue is recognized upon transmission to the customer.
    Physical transactions, or the sale of generated electricity to
    meet supply and demand, are recorded on a gross basis in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Financial
    transactions, or the buying and selling of energy for trading
    purposes, are recorded net within operating revenues in the
    consolidated statements of operations in accordance with
    Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue

No. 02-3,

Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held
    for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading
    and Risk Management Activities,

or

EITF 02-3.

Capacity —

Capacity revenues are recognized
    when contractually earned, and consist of revenues billed to a
    third party at either the market or a negotiated contract price
    for making installed generation capacity available in order to
    satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements.

Sale of Emission Allowances —

NRG records the
    Company’s bank of emission allowances as part of the
    Company’s intangible assets. From time to time, management
    may authorize the transfer from the Company’s emission bank
    to intangible assets held-for-sale as part of the Company’s
    asset optimization strategy. NRG records the sale of emission
    allowances on a net basis within other revenue in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Contract Amortization —

Liabilities recognized
    from power sales agreements assumed at Fresh Start and through
    acquisitions related to the sale of electric capacity and energy
    in future periods for which the fair value has been determined
    to be significantly less than market is amortized as an increase
    to revenue over the term of each underlying contract based on
    actual generation

and/or

contracted volumes.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

NRG accounts for derivative financial instruments under
    SFAS 133. SFAS 133 requires the Company to record all
    derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value unless they
    qualify for a NPNS exception. Changes in the fair value of
    non-hedge derivatives are immediately recognized in earnings.
    Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as hedges
    are either:

•

Recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair
    value of the related hedged assets, liabilities and firm
    commitments; or

•

Deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated OCI until
    the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings.

NRG’s primary derivative instruments are power sales
    contracts, fuels purchase contracts, other energy related
    commodities, and interest rate instruments used to mitigate
    variability in earnings due to fluctuations in market prices and
    interest rates. On an ongoing basis, NRG assesses the
    effectiveness of all derivatives that are designated as hedges
    for accounting purposes in order to determine that each
    derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting
    changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Internal
    analyses that measure the statistical correlation between the
    derivative and the associated hedged item determine the
    effectiveness of such an energy contract designated as a hedge.
    If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly
    effective as a hedge, hedge accounting will be discontinued
    prospectively. Hedge accounting will also be discontinued on
    contracts related to commodity price risk previously accounted
    for as cash flow hedges when it is probable that delivery will
    not be made against these contracts. In this case, the gain or
    loss previously deferred in OCI would be immediately
    reclassified into earnings. If the derivative instrument is
    terminated, the effective portion of this derivative in OCI will
    be frozen until the underlying hedged item is delivered.



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify for the NPNS
    exception are recognized when the underlying physical
    transaction is delivered. While these contracts are considered
    derivative financial instruments under SFAS 133, they are
    not recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of
    accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as
    NPNS no longer meets the scope exception, the fair value of the
    related contract is recorded on the balance sheet and
    immediately recognized through earnings.

NRG’s trading activities include contracts entered into
    that profit from market price changes as opposed to hedging an
    exposure, and are subject to limits in accordance with the
    Company’s risk management policy. These contracts are
    recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the
    fair value of these derivative financial instruments are
    recognized in earnings. These trading activities are a
    complement to NRG’s energy marketing portfolio.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and
    Losses

The local currencies are generally the functional currency of
    NRG’s foreign operations. Foreign currency denominated
    assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates of
    exchange. Revenues, expenses, and cash flows are translated at
    the weighted-average rates of exchange for the period. The
    resulting currency translation adjustments are not included in
    the determination of the Company’s statements of operations
    for the period, but are accumulated and reported as a separate
    component of stockholders’ equity until sale or complete or
    substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the
    foreign entity takes place. Foreign currency transaction gains
    or losses are reported within other income/(expense) in the
    Company’s statements of operations. For the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, amounts recognized as
    foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were immaterial.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject NRG to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, trust
    funds, accounts receivable, notes receivable, derivatives, and
    investments in debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and
    funds deposited by counterparties are predominantly held in
    money market funds invested in treasury securities or treasury
    repurchase agreements. Trust funds are held in accounts managed
    by experienced investment advisors. Accounts receivable, notes
    receivable, and derivative instruments are concentrated within
    entities engaged in the energy industry. These industry
    concentrations may impact the Company’s overall exposure to
    credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the
    customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic,
    industry or other conditions. Receivables and other contractual
    arrangements are subject to collateral requirements under the
    terms of enabling agreements. However, NRG believes that the
    credit risk posed by industry concentration is offset by the
    diversification and creditworthiness of the Company’s
    customer base. See Note 5,

Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,

for a further discussion
    of derivative concentrations.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, funds
    deposited by counterparties, trust funds, receivables, accounts
    payables, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because
    of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying
    amounts of long-term receivables usually approximate fair value,
    as the effective rates for these instruments are comparable to
    market rates at year-end, including current portions. Any
    differences are disclosed in Note 4,

Fair Value of
    Financial Instruments.

The fair value of long-term debt is
    based on quoted market prices for those instruments that are
    publicly traded, or estimated based on the income approach
    valuation technique for non-publicly traded debt. For the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded
    impairment charges related to an investment in commercial paper
    of $23 million and $11 million, respectively; reducing
    its carrying value to approximately $7 million.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

NRG accounts for its asset retirement obligations, or AROs, in
    accordance with SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations

, or SFAS 143, and
    FIN No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations

, or FIN 47. Retirement
    obligations associated with long-lived assets included within
    the scope of SFAS 143 and FIN 47 are those for which a
    legal obligation exists under enacted laws, statutes, and
    written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under
    the doctrine of promissory estoppel, and for which the timing

and/or

method of settlement may be conditional on a future event.
    SFAS 143 and FIN 47 require an entity to recognize the
    fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which it
    is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.

Upon initial recognition of a liability for an ARO, NRG
    capitalizes the asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying
    amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount. Over
    time, the liability is accreted to its future value, while the
    capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the
    related asset.

NRG’s AROs are primarily related to the future
    dismantlement of equipment on leased property and environmental
    obligations related to nuclear decommissioning, ash disposal,
    site closures, and fuel storage facilities. In addition, NRG has
    also identified conditional AROs for asbestos removal and
    disposal, which are specific to certain power generation
    operations. See Note 6,

Nuclear Decommissioning
    Trust Fund,

for a further discussion of NRG’s
    nuclear decommissioning obligations.

The following table represents the balance of ARO obligations as
    of December 31, 2008 and 2007, along with the additions,

Pensions

NRG offers pension benefits through either a defined benefit
    pension plan or a cash balance plan. In addition, the Company
    provides postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain
    groups of employees. Effective December 31, 2006, NRG
    accounts for pension and other postretirement benefits in
    accordance with SFAS No. 158,

Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106 and 132(R)

, or SFAS 158. NRG recognizes the
    funded status of the Company’s defined benefit plans in the
    statement of financial position and records an offset to other
    comprehensive income. In addition, NRG also recognizes on an
    after tax basis, as a component of other comprehensive income,
    gains and losses as well as all prior service costs that have
    not been included as part of the Company’s net periodic
    benefit cost. The determination of NRG’s obligation and
    expenses for pension benefits is dependent on the selection of
    certain assumptions. These assumptions determined by management
    include the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan
    assets and the rate of future compensation increases. NRG’s
    actuarial consultants use assumptions for such items as
    retirement age. The assumptions used may differ materially from
    actual results, which may result in a significant impact to the
    amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by the Company.

As of December 31, 2008, NRG measured the fair value of its
    pension assets in accordance with SFAS 157,

Stock-Based
    Compensation

NRG accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004),

Share-Based
    Payment

, or SFAS 123R. The fair value of the
    Company’s non-qualified stock options and performance units
    are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model and the Monte Carlo valuation model,
    respectively. NRG uses the Company’s common stock price on
    the date of grant as the fair value of the Company’s
    restricted stock units and deferred stock units. Forfeiture
    rates are estimated based on an analysis of NRG’s
    historical forfeitures, employment turnover, and expected future
    behavior. The Company recognizes compensation expense for both
    graded and cliff vesting awards on a straight-line basis over
    the requisite service period for the entire award.

Investments
    Accounted for by the Equity Method

NRG has investments in various international and domestic energy
    projects. The equity method of accounting is applied to such
    investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and
    partnerships, because the ownership structure prevents NRG from
    exercising a controlling influence over the operating and
    financial policies of the projects. Under this method, equity in
    pre-tax income or losses of domestic partnerships and,
    generally, in the net income or losses of international
    projects, are reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated
    affiliates.

On January 1, 2006, NRG adopted EITF Issue

No. 04-6,

Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in
    the Mining Industry

, or

EITF 04-6.

EITF 04-6

provides that costs incurred to remove overburden and waste
    material to access coal seams, or stripping costs; during the
    production phase of a mine are variable production costs that
    should be included in the costs of the inventory produced during
    the period that the stripping costs are incurred. MIBRAG, in
    which NRG holds a 50% equity investment, has mining operations
    which were negatively affected by this pronouncement. The
    adoption of

EITF 04-6

did not have a material impact on NRG’s consolidated
    results of operations, but did have a material impact on
    NRG’s consolidated financial position. Upon adoption of

EITF 04-6

on January 1, 2006, NRG’s investment in MIBRAG was
    reduced by 50% of the above mentioned asset, or approximately
    $93 million after-tax, with an offsetting charge to
    retained earnings.

Issuance
    of Subsidiary’s Stock

The Company accounts for issuance of its subsidiaries’
    stock in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin Topic 5H,

Accounting For Sales Of Stock By A
    Subsidiary

, or Topic 5H. Topic 5H precludes recognizing any
    gain on issuance of a subsidiary’s stock into earnings when
    the subsidiary is a development stage entity. In March 2008, NRG
    formed NINA, an NRG development stage subsidiary focused on
    developing, financing, and investing in nuclear projects in
    North America. TANE has partnered with NRG on the NINA venture,
    receiving a 12% equity ownership in NINA in exchange for
    $300 million to be invested in NINA in six annual
    installments of $50 million, the last three of which are
    subject to certain restrictions. NRG continues to control NINA
    through its voting interest. Any change in NRG’s
    proportionate share of NINA’s equity resulting from cash
    invested by TANE directly into NINA is accounted for by the
    Company as an equity transaction in consolidation, and not a
    gain on sale, for as long as NINA remains a development stage
    entity.

Accordingly, upon TANE’s initial $50 million
    installment contribution in April 2008, $44 million, or
    88%, was recorded as additional paid in capital, while the
    remaining $6 million, or 12%, was recorded as minority
    interest on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the US requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
    financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial

statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
    these estimates.

In recording transactions and balances resulting from business
    operations, NRG uses estimates based on the best information
    available. Estimates are used for such items as plant
    depreciable lives, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts,
    actuarially determined benefit costs, and the valuation of
    energy commodity contracts, environmental liabilities, and legal
    costs incurred in connection with recorded loss contingencies,
    among others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived
    assets and goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair
    value of impaired assets. As better information becomes
    available or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded
    estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be
    affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified for
    comparative purposes.

Recent
    Accounting Developments

The Company partially adopted SFAS No. 157,

Fair

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

, which
    permitted delayed application of this statement for
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for
    items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
    financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually),
    until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and
    interim periods within those fiscal years. The partial adoption
    of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    statement of operations, and cash flows. The Company adopted the
    remaining portion of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities on January 1, 2009, with no
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    statement of operations, and cash flows.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value
    Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-including
    an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115,

or
    SFAS 159, on January 1, 2008. This statement provides
    entities with an option to measure and report selected financial
    assets and liabilities at fair value. The Company does not
    intend to apply this standard to any of its eligible assets or
    liabilities; therefore, there was no impact on NRG’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows.

The Company adopted FSP

FIN 39-1,

Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39

, or FSP

FIN 39-1,

which amends FIN 39,

Offsetting of Amounts Related to
    Certain Contracts

, on January 1, 2008. FSP

FIN 39-1

impacts entities that enter into master netting arrangements as
    part of their derivative transactions. Under the guidance in
    this FSP, entities may choose to offset derivative positions in
    the financial statements against the fair value of amounts
    recognized as cash collateral paid or received under those
    arrangements. The Company chose not to offset positions as
    defined in this FSP; therefore there was no impact on NRG’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

, or SFAS 141R.
    This statement applies prospectively to all business
    combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the
    beginning of an entity’s first annual reporting period
    beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The statement
    establishes principles and requires an acquirer to recognize and
    measure in its financial statements the identifiable

    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any minority
    interest in the acquiree at fair value. It also recognizes and
    measures the goodwill acquired or a gain from a bargain purchase
    in the business combination and determines what information to
    disclose to enable users of an entity’s financial
    statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the
    business combination. NRG adopted SFAS 141R on
    January 1, 2009, with no immediate impact on the
    Company’s results of operations, financial position and
    cash flows. However, any future reductions to existing net
    deferred tax assets or valuation allowances, and changes to
    uncertain tax benefits, as they relate to Fresh Start or
    previously completed acquisitions, occurring after
    January 1, 2009 will be recorded to income tax expense
    rather than APIC or goodwill, respectively.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51,
    Consolidated Financial Statements

, or SFAS 160. This
    Statement amends ARB No. 51 to establish accounting and
    reporting standards for the minority interest in a subsidiary
    and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also amends
    certain of ARB No. 51’s consolidation procedures for
    consistency with the requirements of SFAS 141R. This
    Statement shall be effective and applied prospectively for
    fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
    beginning on or after December 15, 2008, except for the
    presentation and disclosure requirements, which shall be applied
    retrospectively. NRG adopted SFAS 160 on January 1,
    2009, with no material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, statement of operations, and cash flows.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

, or SFAS 161. SFAS 161 requires
    entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an
    entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments
    and related hedged items are accounted for under
    SFAS No. 133 and how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance, and cash flows. This statement
    encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for
    earlier periods at initial adoption. SFAS 161 is effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim
    periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early
    application encouraged. NRG adopted SFAS 161 on
    January 1, 2009, with no impact on the Company’s
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets,

or
    FSP

FAS 142-3.

This FSP amends the factors that should be considered in
    developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine
    the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under
    SFAS 142. FSP

FAS 142-3

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years, with early adoption prohibited. NRG
    adopted FSP

FAS 142-3

on January 1, 2009, with no impact on the Company’s
    results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB

14-1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement),

or FSP APB

14-1.

This
    FSP clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be
    settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash
    settlement) do not fall within the scope of paragraph 12 of
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 14,

Accounting
    for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase
    Warrants,

and specifies that issuers of such instruments
    should separately account for the liability and equity
    components in a manner that will reflect the entity’s
    nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is
    recognized in subsequent periods. FSP APB

14-1

does
    not apply to embedded conversion options that must be separately
    accounted for as derivatives under SFAS 133. FSP APB

14-1

is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods
    within those fiscal years and is to be applied retrospectively.
    NRG adopted FSP APB

14-1

on
    January 1, 2009, with no material impact on the
    Company’s results of operations, financial position, or
    cash flows.

In June 2008, the EITF issued EITF

No. 07-5,

Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is
    Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock,

or

EITF 07-5.

EITF 07-5

clarifies that contingent and other adjustment features in
    equity-linked financial instruments are consistent with equity
    indexation if they are based on variables that would be inputs
    to a “plain vanilla” option or forward pricing model
    and they do not increase the contract’s exposure to those
    variables.

EITF 07-5

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15,

2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. NRG adopted

EITF 07-5

on January 1, 2009, with no impact on the Company’s
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In September 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 133-1

and

FIN 45-4,

Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain Guarantees:
    An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and Financial
    Interpretation Number 45; and Clarification of the Effective
    Date of FASB Statement No. 161

, or FSP

FAS 133-1

and

FIN 45-4.

This FSP amends FAS 133, and FIN No. 45

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
    Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
    Others,

or FIN 45, to require additional disclosures
    about credit derivatives, credit derivatives embedded in a
    hybrid instrument, and the current status of the payment or
    performance risk of a guarantee. FSP

FAS 133-1

and

FIN 45-4

is effective for the financial statements of reporting periods
    (annual or interim) ending after November 15, 2008. NRG
    currently has no credit derivative contracts, so the amendments
    in this FSP related to FAS 133 will not impact NRG. The
    clarification to SFAS 161 is also not applicable to NRG, as
    it only affects non-calendar year filers. NRG adopted the
    provisions of this FSP related to FIN 45 on January 1,
    2009, with no impact on the Company’s results of
    operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In September 2008, the EITF issued

EITF 08-5,

Issuer’s Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair
    Value with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement,

or

EITF 08-5.

EITF 08-5

requires issuers of liability instruments with third-party
    credit enhancements to exclude the effect of the credit
    enhancement when measuring the liability’s fair value. The
    effect of initially applying the requirements is included in the
    change in the instrument’s fair value in the period of
    adoption. Entities are required to disclose the valuation
    technique used to measure the liabilities and to discuss any
    changes in the valuation techniques used to measure those
    liabilities in earlier periods. Entities will also need to
    disclose the existence of a third-party credit enhancement on
    the entity’s issued debt.

EITF 08-5

is effective on a prospective basis in the first reporting
    period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, with
    earlier application permitted. NRG adopted

EITF 08-5

on January 1, 2009, with no impact on the Company’s
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active,

or FSP

FAS 157-3.

This FSP clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market
    that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key
    considerations in determining the fair value of a financial
    asset when the market for that financial asset is not active.
    FSP

FAS 157-3

is effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which
    financial statements have not been issued. Revisions resulting
    from a change in the valuation technique or its application
    shall be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate under
    SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error
    Corrections,

or SFAS 154. The disclosure provisions of
    SFAS 154 for a change in accounting estimate are not
    required for revisions resulting from a change in valuation
    technique or its application. Although effective for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, FSP

FAS 157-3

did not have an impact on the Company’s results of
    operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In November 2008, the EITF issued

EITF 08-6,

Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations

, or

EITF 08-6.

EITF 08-6

addresses questions about the potential effect of FAS 141R
    and FAS 160 on equity-method accounting under APB 18.

EITF 08-6

generally continues existing practices under APB 18, including
    the use of a cost-accumulation approach to initial measurement
    of the investment. This EITF does not require the investor to
    perform a separate impairment test on the underlying assets of
    an equity method investment. However, an equity-method investor
    is required to recognize its proportionate share of impairment
    charges recognized by the investee, adjusted for basis
    differences, if any, between the investee’s carrying amount
    for the impaired assets and the cost allocated to such assets by
    the investor. The investor is also required to perform an
    overall other-than-temporary impairment test of its investment
    in accordance with APB 18.

EITF 08-6

is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal
    years, and shall be applied prospectively. Early application is
    not permitted. The Company adopted

EITF 08-6

on January 1, 2009, with no impact on the Company’s
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8,

Disclosures by Public Entities
    (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial assets and Interests
    in Variable Interest Entities, or

FSP

FAS 140-4

and



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

FIN 46R-8.

This FSP amends FASB Statement No. 140,

Accounting for
    Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments
    of Liabilities,

to require public entities to provide
    additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets. It
    also amends FIN 46R to require public enterprises,
    including sponsors that have a variable interest in a VIE, to
    provide additional disclosures about their involvement with such
    VIEs. FSP

FAS 140-4

and

FIN 46R-8

is effective immediately. NRG does not engage in transfers of
    financial assets within the scope of FAS 140, so the
    amendments in this FSP related to FAS 140 will not impact
    NRG. The additional disclosure requirements related to
    FIN 46R have been adopted by NRG and included in the
    December 31, 2008 financial statements, with no impact on
    the Company’s results of operations, financial position, or
    cash flows.

In December 2008, the FASB also issued FSP
    No. FAS 132(R)-1

Employers’ Disclosures about
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets,

or FSP 132R-1. This
    FSP amends FASB Statement No. 132 (revised 2003),

Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other
    Postretirement Benefits,

to provide guidance and additional
    transparency on an employer’s disclosures about plan assets
    of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan,
    including the concentrations of risk in those plans. The
    effective date of FSP

FAS 132R-1

is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2009. The
    enhanced disclosure requirements are relevant to NRG but will
    not be effective until the first interim period of 2010, and
    will not have an impact on the Company’s results of
    operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Note 3 —

Discontinued
    Operations, Business Acquisitions and Dispositions

Discontinued
    Operations

NRG has classified material business operations, and
    gains/(losses) recognized on sales, as discontinued operations
    for projects that were sold or have met the required criteria
    for such classification. The financial results for the affected
    businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations.

SFAS 144 requires that discontinued operations be valued on
    an

asset-by-asset

basis at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs
    to sell. In applying the provisions of SFAS 144, the
    Company’s management considers cash flow analyses, bids,
    and offers related to those assets and businesses. In accordance
    with the provisions of SFAS 144, discontinued operations
    are not depreciated commencing with their classification as
    such. The assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations
    are reported in NRG’s balance sheets as discontinued
    operations.

ITISA

— The assets and liabilities reported in
    the balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 as discontinued
    operations represent those of ITISA. On April 28, 2008, NRG
    completed the sale of its 100% interest in Tosli, which held all
    NRG’s interest in ITISA, to Brookfield Renewable Power Inc.
    (previously Brookfield Power Inc.), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Brookfield Asset Management Inc. In addition, the purchase price
    adjustment contingency under the sale agreement was resolved on
    August 7, 2008. In connection with the sale, NRG received
    $300 million of cash proceeds from Brookfield, and removed
    $163 million of assets, including $59 million of cash,
    $122 million of liabilities, including $63 million of
    debt, and $15 million in foreign currency translation
    adjustment from its 2008 consolidated balance sheet.

Resource Recovery

— In 2006, NRG completed the
    sale of the Company’s Newport and Elk River Resource
    Recovery facilities, Becker Ash Disposal facility as well as the
    Company’s ownership interest in NRG Processing Solutions
    LLC, to Resource Recovery Technologies, LLC for total proceeds
    of approximately $22 million.

Flinders

— In 2006, NRG completed the sale of
    the Company’s 100% owned Flinders power station and related
    assets, or Flinders, located near Port Augusta, Australia, which
    consisted of two coal-fueled plants — Northern and
    Playford, with a combined generation capacity of approximately
    760 MW, to Babcock & Brown Power Pty, a
    subsidiary of Babcock & Brown. Proceeds from the sale
    were approximately $242 million (AU$317 million). The
    sale resulted in the elimination of approximately
    $370 million (AU$485 million) of consolidated
    liabilities, including approximately $183 million
    (AU$240 million) of non-recourse debt obligations and
    approximately $92 million (AU$121 million) in
    non-current liabilities related to obligations for the purchase
    of electricity and the supply of fuel to the Osborne power
    station that were guaranteed by NRG.

Audrain

— In 2006, NRG completed the sale of
    Audrain generating station, a gas-fired peaking facility in
    Vandalia, Missouri, to AmerenUE, a subsidiary of Ameren
    Corporation. The proceeds from the sale were $115 million,
    plus AmerenUE’s assumption of $240 million of
    non-recourse capital lease obligations and assignment of a
    $240 million note receivable. Of the $115 million in
    cash proceeds, approximately $20 million was paid to NRG
    and the balance was paid to the lenders of NRG Financial I LLC.

Acquisition
    of Texas Genco LLC, or Texas Genco

On February 2, 2006, NRG acquired Texas Genco, which
    subsequently is being managed and accounted for as a separate
    business segment referred to as NRG’s Texas region. As
    such, the results of Texas Genco have been included in
    NRG’s consolidated financial statements since
    February 2, 2006. The purchase price of approximately
    $6.2 billion consisted of approximately $4.4 billion
    in cash, the issuance of approximately 71 million shares of
    NRG’s common stock valued at approximately
    $1.7 billion, and acquisition costs of approximately
    $0.1 billion. The value of NRG’s common stock issued
    to the sellers was based on NRG’s average stock price
    immediately before and after the closing date of
    February 2, 2006. The acquisition also included the
    assumption of approximately $2.7 billion of Texas Genco
    debt.



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The acquisition of Texas Genco was funded at closing with a
    combination of: (i) cash proceeds received upon the
    issuance and sale in a public offering of approximately
    42 million shares of NRG’s common stock at a price of
    $24.38 per share; (ii) cash proceeds received upon the
    issuance and sale of $1.2 billion aggregate principal
    amount of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2014 and $2.4 billion
    aggregate principal amount of 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016;
    (iii) cash proceeds received upon the issuance and sale in
    a public offering of 2,000,000 shares of mandatory
    convertible preferred stock at a price of $250 per share;
    (iv) funds borrowed under a new senior secured credit
    facility; and (v) cash on hand.

The acquisition of Texas Genco was accounted for using the
    purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the purchase
    price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed based on the estimated fair value of such assets and
    liabilities as of February 2, 2006. The excess of the
    purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
    identified intangible assets acquired was $1,782 million
    and was recorded as goodwill.

Acquisition
    of Remaining 50% interest in WCP

On March 31, 2006, NRG completed a purchase and sale
    agreement for projects co-owned with Dynegy, Inc. Under the
    agreements, NRG acquired Dynegy’s 50% ownership interest in
    WCP for $205 million in cash and the assumption of a
    $1 million liability, with NRG becoming the sole owner of
    WCP’s 1,825 MW of generation capacity in Southern
    California. In addition, NRG sold to Dynegy the Company’s
    50% ownership interest in Rocky Road Power LLC, or Rocky Road, a
    330 MW gas-fueled, simple cycle peaking plant located in
    Dundee, Illinois. NRG sold Rocky Road for a fair value sale
    price of $45 million, paying Dynegy a net purchase price of
    $160 million at closing. Prior to the purchase, NRG had an
    existing investment in WCP accounted for as an equity method
    investment.

Other
    Business Events

Red Bluff and Chowchilla

— On January 3,
    2007, NRG completed the sale of the Company’s Red Bluff and
    Chowchilla II power plants to an entity controlled by

    marketable securities is based on quoted market prices for those
    instruments. Trust fund investments are comprised of various US
    debt and equity securities carried at fair market value.

The fair value of notes receivable, debt securities and certain
    long-term debt are based on expected future cash flows
    discounted at market interest rates. The fair value of long-term
    debt is based on quoted market prices for these instruments that
    are publicly traded, or estimated based on the income approach
    valuation technique for non-publicly traded debt using current
    interest rates for similar instruments with equivalent credit
    quality.

Adoption
    of SFAS No. 157

The Company partially adopted SFAS 157 on January 1,
    2008, delaying application for non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities as permitted. This statement
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
    prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
    fair value into three levels as follows:

•

Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has
    the ability to access as of the measurement date. NRG’s
    financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs
    include active exchange-traded securities, energy derivatives,
    and trust fund investments.

•

Level 2 — inputs other than quoted prices
    included within Level 1 that are directly observable for
    the asset or liability or indirectly observable through
    corroboration with observable market data. NRG’s financial
    assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include
    fixed income securities, exchange-based derivatives, and over
    the counter derivatives such as swaps, options and forwards.

•

Level 3 — unobservable inputs for the asset or
    liability only used when there is little, if any, market
    activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
    NRG’s financial assets and liabilities utilizing
    Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded,
    non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds,
    and are measured using present value pricing models.

In accordance with SFAS 157, the Company determines the
    level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value
    measurement in its entirety falls, based on the lowest level
    input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its
    entirety.

Recurring

Non-derivative
    fair value measurements

NRG’s debt securities are classified as Level 3 and
    consist of non-traded debt instruments that are valued based on
    an auction process.

The trust fund investments are held primarily to satisfy
    NRG’s nuclear decommissioning obligations. These trust fund
    investments hold debt and equity securities directly and equity
    securities indirectly through commingled funds. The fair values
    of equity securities held directly by the trust funds are based
    on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized in
    Level 1. In addition, US Treasury securities are
    categorized as Level 1 because they trade in a highly
    liquid and transparent market. The fair values of fixed income
    securities, excluding US Treasury securities, are based on
    evaluated prices that reflect observable market information,
    such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted
    for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2.
    Commingled funds, which are analogous to mutual funds, are
    maintained by investment companies and hold certain investments
    in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The fair
    value of commingled funds are based on net asset values per fund
    share (the unit of account), derived from the quoted prices in
    active markets of the underlying equity securities. However,
    because the shares in the commingled funds are not publicly
    quoted, not traded in an active market and are subject to
    certain restrictions regarding their purchase and sale, the
    commingled funds are categorized in Level 3. See also

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Derivative
    fair value measurements

A small portion of NRG’s contracts are exchange-traded
    contracts with readily available quoted market prices. The
    majority of NRG’s contracts are non exchange-traded
    contracts valued using prices provided by external sources,
    primarily price quotations available through brokers or
    over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. For the majority of our
    markets the Company receives quotes from multiple sources. To
    the extent that the Company receives multiple quotes, NRG prices
    reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices obtained
    from all sources that it believes provide the most liquid market
    for the commodity. If the Company only receives one quote then
    the mid point of the bid-ask spread for that quote is used. The
    terms for which such price information is available vary by
    commodity, region and product. The remainder of the assets and
    liabilities represent contracts for which external sources or
    observable market quotes are not available. These contracts are
    valued based on various valuation techniques including but not
    limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of
    the market and extrapolation of observable market data with
    similar characteristics. Contracts valued with prices provided
    by models and other valuation techniques make up 5% of the total
    fair value of all derivative contracts. The fair value of each
    contract is discounted using a risk free interest rate. In
    addition, the Company applies a credit reserve to reflect credit
    risk which is calculated based on credit default swaps. To the
    extent that NRG’s net exposure under a specific master
    agreement is an asset the Company is using the
    counterparty’s default swap rate. If the exposure under a
    specific master agreement is a liability the Company is using
    NRG’s default swap rate. The credit reserve is added to the
    discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market
    participant would be willing to receive to assume NRG’s
    liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay
    for NRG’s assets. As of December 31, 2008 the credit
    reserve resulted in a $22 million decrease in fair value
    which is composed of a $10 million loss in OCI and a
    $12 million loss in derivative revenue. The fair values in
    each category reflect the level of forward prices and volatility
    factors as of December 31, 2008 and may change as a result
    of changes in these factors. Management uses its best estimates
    to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative
    contracts NRG holds and sells. These estimates consider various
    factors including closing exchange and over-the-counter price
    quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit exposure.
    It is possible, however, that future market prices could vary
    from those used in recording assets and liabilities from energy
    marketing and trading activities and such variations could be
    material.

Under the guidance of FSP

FIN 39-1,

entities may choose to offset cash collateral paid or received
    against the fair value of derivative positions executed with the
    same counterparties under the same master netting agreements.
    The Company has chosen not to offset positions as defined in
    this FSP. As of December 31, 2008, the Company
    recorded $494 million of cash collateral paid and
    $760 million of cash collateral received on its balance
    sheet.

Note 5 —

Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

SFAS 133 requires NRG to recognize all derivative
    instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities
    and to measure them at fair value each reporting period unless
    they qualify for a NPNS exception. If certain conditions are
    met, NRG may be able to designate certain derivatives as cash
    flow hedges and defer the effective portion of the change in
    fair value of the derivatives to OCI, until the hedged
    transactions occur and are recognized in earnings. The
    ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is immediately
    recognized in earnings.

For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets
    or liabilities, the changes in fair value of both the derivative
    and the hedged transaction are recorded in current earnings. The
    ineffective portion of a hedging derivative instrument’s
    change in fair value is immediately recognized into earnings.

For derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges or
    do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in
    the fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Under
    the guidelines established per SFAS 133, certain derivative
    instruments may qualify for the NPNS exception and are therefore
    exempt from fair value accounting treatment. SFAS 133
    applies to NRG’s energy related commodity contracts,
    interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange contracts.



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As the Company engages principally in the trading and marketing
    of its generation assets, most of NRG’s commercial
    activities qualify for hedge accounting under the requirements
    of SFAS 133. In order to so qualify, the physical
    generation and sale of electricity should be highly probable at
    inception of the trade and throughout the period it is held, as
    is the case with the Company’s baseload plants. For this
    reason, the majority of trades in support of NRG’s baseload
    units normally qualify for NPNS or cash flow hedge accounting
    treatment, and trades in support of NRG’s peaking units
    will generally not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, with
    any changes in fair value likely to be reflected on a
    mark-to-market basis in the statement of operations. All of
    NRG’s hedging and trading activities are in accordance with
    the Company’s risk management policy.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Energy-Related
    Commodities

To manage the commodity price risk associated with the
    Company’s competitive supply activities and the price risk
    associated with power sales from the Company’s electric
    generation facilities, NRG may enter into a variety of
    derivative and non-derivative hedging instruments, utilizing the
    following:

•

Forward contracts, which commit NRG to sell energy commodities
    or purchase fuels in the future.

•

Futures contracts, which are exchange-traded standardized
    commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial
    instrument.

•

Swap agreements, which require payments to or from
    counter-parties based upon the differential between two prices
    for a predetermined contractual, or notional, quantity.

•

Option contracts, which convey the right or obligation to buy or
    sell a commodity.

The objectives for entering into derivative contracts designated
    as hedges include:

•

Fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity
    sales through the use of various derivative instruments
    including gas collars and swaps at a level that provides an
    acceptable return on the Company’s electric generation
    operations.

•

Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for
    the operation of NRG’s power plants.

•

Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated energy purchases to
    supply NRG’s load-serving customers.

As of December 31, 2008, NRG had hedge and non-hedge
    energy-related derivative financial instruments, and other
    energy-related contracts that did not qualify as derivative
    financial instruments extending through December 2026. As of
    December 31, 2008, NRG’s derivative assets and
    liabilities consisted primarily of the following:

•

Forward and financial contracts for the sale of electricity and
    related products economically hedging NRG’s generation
    assets’ forecasted output through 2014.

•

Forward and financial contracts for the purchase of fuel
    commodities relating to the forecasted usage of NRG’s
    generation assets into 2017.

Also, as of December 31, 2008, NRG had other energy-related
    contracts that qualified for the NPNS exception and were
    therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment under the
    guidelines established by SFAS 133 as follows:

•

Power sales and capacity contracts extending to 2025.

•

Coal purchase contracts extending through 2012 designated as
    normal purchases and disclosed as part of NRG’s contractual
    cash obligations. See also Note 21,

Interest
    Rate Swaps

NRG is exposed to changes in interest rates through the
    Company’s issuance of variable and fixed rate debt. In
    order to manage the Company’s interest rate risk, NRG
    enters into interest-rate swap agreements. In January 2006, in
    anticipation of the New Senior Credit Facility, NRG entered into
    a series of forward starting interest rate swaps intended to
    hedge the variability in cash flows associated with the debt
    issuance. These transactions were designated as cash flow hedges
    with any gains/losses deferred on the balance sheet in OCI. In
    February 2006, with the completion of the sale of the Senior
    Notes, the Company designated a fixed-to-floating interest rate
    swap as a hedge of fair value changes in the Senior Notes. This
    interest rate swap was previously designated as a hedge of
    NRG’s 8% Second Priority Notes, which were effectively
    replaced by the Senior Notes.

As of December 31, 2008, all of NRG’s interest rate
    swap arrangements had been designated as either cash flow or
    fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2008, NRG had
    interest rate derivative instruments extending through June 2019.

Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive Income

Gains and losses attributable to hedge derivatives are
    reclassified from OCI to current period earnings due to the
    unwinding of previously deferred amounts. These amounts are
    recorded on the same line in the statement of operations in
    which the hedged transactions are recorded. Changes in the fair
    values of derivatives accounted for as hedges are also recorded
    in OCI.

    derivative instruments accumulated in OCI to be recognized in
    earnings during the next twelve months.

As of July 31, 2008, our regression analysis for natural
    gas prices to ERCOT power prices did not meet the required
    threshold for cash flow hedge accounting for calendar years 2012
    and 2013. As a result, we de-designated our 2012 and 2013 ERCOT
    cash flow hedges as of this day. We will continue to monitor the
    correlations in this market, and if the regression analysis
    meets the required thresholds in the future, we may elect to
    re-designate these transactions as cash flow hedges.

    $160 million loss from the reversal of mark-to-market
    gains, which ultimately settled as financial revenues, and
    $49 million of gains associated with our trading activity.
    The $34 million of fair value increases in forward sales of
    electricity and fuel includes approximately $14 million due
    to the ineffectiveness associated with financial forward

NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Discontinued Hedge Accounting

— During 2008, a
    relatively mild summer season in the Northeast resulted in
    falling power prices and expected lower power generation for the
    remainder of 2008 and calendar year 2009. As such, NRG
    discontinued cash flow hedge accounting for certain contracts
    related to commodity price risk previously accounted for as cash
    flow hedges for 2008 and 2009. These contracts were originally
    entered into as hedges of forecasted sales by baseload plants.
    As a result, $31 million of gain previously deferred in OCI
    was recognized in earnings for the year ended December 31,
    2008.

During 2006, due to a relatively mild summer season and expected
    lower power generation for the remainder of 2006, NRG
    discontinued cash flow hedge accounting for certain contracts
    related to commodity prices previously accounted for as a cash
    flow hedge and determined forecasted sales were no longer
    probable. These contracts were originally entered into as hedges
    of forecasted sales by baseload plants. The decision not to
    deliver against these contracts was driven by the decline in
    natural gas and associated power prices, making it uneconomical
    to dispatch the units into the marketplace. As a result,
    approximately $5 million of previously deferred revenue in
    OCI was recognized in earnings for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Impact of Hedge Reset

— NRG accounted for the
    Company’s Hedge Reset transaction as a net settlement of
    its current hedge positions and a subsequent reestablishment of
    new hedge positions. The impact of the net settlement reduced
    revenues by approximately $129 million.

As of December 31, 2006, the impact to NRG’s
    consolidated financial position and statement of operations from
    the Hedge Reset transaction was as follows:

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from
    non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the
    terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and
    manages credit risk through credit policies that include:
    (i) an established credit approval process, (ii) a
    daily monitoring of counterparties’ credit limits,
    (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin,
    collateral, credit derivatives or prepayment arrangements,
    (iv) the use of payment netting agreements, and
    (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the
    netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts
    associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding
    counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the
    amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to
    mitigate counterparty risk with a diversified portfolio of
    counterparties, including ten participants under its first and
    second lien structure. The Company also has credit protection
    within various agreements to call on additional collateral
    support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held
    at NRG to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until
    positions settle.

As of December 31, 2008, total credit exposure to
    substantially all counterparties was $2.0 billion and NRG
    held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those
    positions of $788 million resulting in a net exposure of
    $1.2 billion. Total credit exposure is discounted at the
    risk free rate.

NRG has credit risk exposure to certain counterparties
    representing more than 10% of total net exposure and the
    aggregate of such counterparties was $241 million. No
    counterparty represents more than 20% of total net credit
    exposure. Approximately 80% of NRG’s positions relating to
    credit risk roll-off by the end of 2011. Changes in hedge
    positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and
    counterparty concentration. NRG does not anticipate any material
    adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or
    results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any of
    NRG’s counterparties.

Nuclear
    Decommissioning Trust Fund

NRG’s nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets which are
    for the decommissioning of STP are primarily comprised of
    securities recorded at fair value based on actively quoted
    market prices. NRG accounts for these trust fund assets per
    SFAS 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
    Regulation

, because the Company’s nuclear
    decommissioning activities are regulated by the PUCT. Although
    the owners of STP are responsible for the management of
    decommissioning STP, the cost of decommissioning is the
    responsibility of the Texas ratepayers. As such, NRG does not
    bear the cost for these decommissioning responsibilities, except
    to the extent that NRG has a prudence obligation with respect to
    the management of the trust funds or the future decommissioning
    of STP. Third party appraisals are periodically conducted to
    estimate the future decommissioning liability related to STP.
    These appraisals are then used to determine the adequacy of the
    existing decommissioning trust investments to cover that
    estimated future liability. Should there be a shortfall in the
    value of the assets in the trust relative to the estimated
    liability, NRG has the ability to file a rate case with the PUCT
    to increase decommissioning reimbursements over time from retail
    customers.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangibles

Goodwill

—

NRG’s goodwill arose in
    connection with the acquisitions of Texas Genco and Padoma. As
    of December 31, 2008 and 2007, goodwill was approximately
    $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. In
    accordance with SFAS 141, goodwill associated with the
    Texas Genco acquisition decreased by $68 million during
    2008 due to an adjustment to deferred tax liabilities originally
    established under the 2006 purchase price allocation. Goodwill
    is not amortized but instead tested for impairment in accordance
    with SFAS 142 at the

reporting-unit

level. Goodwill is tested annually, typically during the fourth
    quarter, or more often if events or circumstances, such as
    adverse changes in the business climate, indicate there may be
    impairment. As of December 31, 2008, there was no
    impairment to goodwill. As of December 31, 2008, NRG had
    approximately $786 million of goodwill that is deductible
    for US income tax purposes in future periods.

Intangible Assets

—

NRG acquired
    intangible assets as part of the Company’s acquisition of
    Texas Genco and established intangible assets upon adoption of
    Fresh Start reporting. These intangible assets include
    SO


and
    NO

x

emission allowances and certain in-market power, fuel (coal,
    gas, and nuclear) and water contracts. The emission allowances
    are amortized and recorded as part of the cost of operations,
    with
    NO

x

emission allowances amortized on a straight line basis and
    SO


emission allowances amortized based on units of production. The
    power contracts are amortized based on contracted volumes over
    the life of each contract and the fuel contracts are amortized
    over expected volumes over the life of each contract. The power
    contracts are amortized and recorded as part of revenues, while
    fuel and water contracts are amortized and recorded as part of
    the cost of operations.

NRG actively trades portions of the Company’s emission
    allowances as part of the Company’s asset optimization
    strategy, with their respective costs expensed when sold.
    Emission allowances that the Company designates for such trading
    are reclassified to intangible assets held-for-sale on the
    balance sheet and are not amortized.

The weighted average remaining amortization period is

    emitted from the respective plants.

Intangible assets held for sale

— NRG records
    the Company’s bank of emission allowances as part of the
    Company’s intangible assets. From time to time, management
    may authorize the transfer from the Company’s emission bank
    to intangible assets held-for-sale as part of the Company’s
    asset optimization strategy. As of December 31, 2008, the
    value of emission allowances held-for-sale is $4 million
    and is managed within the Corporate segment. Once transferred to
    held-for-sale, these emission allowances transferred are
    prohibited from moving back to held-for-use.

Out-of-market contracts —

Due to Fresh Start
    accounting, as well as the acquisition of Texas Genco, NRG
    acquired certain out-of-market contracts. These are primarily
    power, gas swaps, and certain coal contracts and are classified
    as non-current liabilities on NRG’s consolidated balance
    sheet. Both the gas swap and power contracts are amortized to
    revenues, while the coal contracts are amortized to cost of
    operations.

NRG
    Recourse Debt

Senior
    Notes

NRG has three outstanding issuances of senior notes, or Senior
    Notes, under an Indenture, dated February 2, 2006, or the
    Indenture, between NRG and Law Debenture Trust Company of
    New York, as trustee:

(i) 7.25% senior notes, issued February 2, 2006
    and due February 1, 2014, or the 2014 Senior Notes;

(ii) 7.375% senior notes, issued February 2, 2006
    and due February 1, 2016, or the 2016 Senior Notes;

(iii) 7.375% senior notes, issued November 21,
    2006 and due January 15, 2017, or the 2017 Senior Notes.

Supplemental indentures to the series of notes have been issued
    to add newly formed or acquired subsidiaries as guarantors.

The Indentures and the form of notes provide, among other
    things, that the Senior Notes will be senior unsecured
    obligations of NRG. The Indentures also provide for customary
    events of default, which include, among others: nonpayment of
    principal or interest; breach of other agreements in the
    Indentures; defaults in failure to pay certain other
    indebtedness; the rendering of judgments to pay certain amounts
    of money against NRG and its subsidiaries; the failure of
    certain guarantees to be enforceable; and certain events of
    bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default
    occurs, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal
    amount of the then outstanding series of Senior Notes may
    declare all of the Senior Notes of such series to be due and
    payable immediately.

The terms of the Indentures, among other things, limit
    NRG’s ability and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability
    to:

•

return capital to shareholders;

•

grant liens on assets to lenders; and

•

incur additional debt.

Interest is payable semi-annually on the Senior Notes until
    their maturity dates. In addition, the Company entered into a
    fixed to floating interest rate swap in 2004 with a notional
    amount as of December 31, 2008 of $400 million and a
    maturity date of December 15, 2013.

At any time prior to February 1, 2009, NRG may redeem up to
    35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Senior Notes
    and the 2016 Senior Notes with the net proceeds of certain
    equity offerings, at a redemption price of 107.25% of the
    principal amount, in the case of the 2014 Senior Notes, and
    107.375% of the principal amount, in the case of the 2016 Senior
    Notes. In addition, NRG may redeem the 2014 Senior Notes and
    2016 Senior Notes at the redemption prices expressed as a
    percentage of the principal amount redeemed set forth below,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes redeemed.

Prior to February 1, 2010, NRG may redeem all or a portion
    of the 2014 Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the
    principal amount plus a premium and accrued interest. The
    premium is the greater of (i) 1% of the principal amount of

Senior
    Credit Facility

As of December 31, 2008, NRG has a Senior Credit Facility
    which is comprised of a senior first priority secured term loan,
    or the Term Loan Facility, a $1.0 billion senior first
    priority secured revolving credit facility, or the Revolving
    Credit Facility, and a $1.3 billion senior first priority
    secured synthetic letter of credit facility, or the Synthetic
    Letter of Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility is the
    result of a refinancing by the Company which occurred on
    June 8, 2007, and for which a charge of $35 million
    was recorded to the Company’s results of operations for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, primarily related to the
    write-off of previously deferred financing costs. Among other
    things, this refinancing resulted in a 0.25% reduction on the
    spread that the Company pays on its Term Loan Facility and
    Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility. The pricing on the
    Company’s Term Loan Facility and Synthetic Letter of Credit
    Facility is also subject to further reductions upon the
    achievement of certain financial ratios. On December 31,
    2007, the Company used cash on hand to prepay, without penalty,
    $300 million of its Term Loan Facility under the Senior
    Credit Facility. With this prepayment, the Company met a
    financial ratio by the end of 2007 that resulted in a further
    0.25% reduction in the interest rate on both its Term Loan
    Facility and Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility. The prepayment
    was credited against the Company’s mandatory annual offer
    required under the Senior Credit Facility, as hereinafter
    discussed.

As of December 31, 2008, NRG had issued $440 million
    of letters of credit under the Synthetic Letter of Credit
    Facility, leaving $860 million available for future
    issuances. There were no letters of credit issued under the



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company’s Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31,
    2008, leaving $1.0 billion available for borrowings, of
    which approximately $900 million could be used to issue
    additional letters of credit.

The Term Loan Facility matures on February 1, 2013, and
    amortizes in 27 consecutive equal quarterly installments of
    0.25% term loan commitments, beginning June 30, 2006, with
    the balance payable on the seventh anniversary thereof. The full
    amount of the Revolving Credit Facility will mature on
    February 2, 2011. The Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility
    will mature on February 1, 2013, and no amortization will
    be required in respect thereof. NRG has the option to prepay the
    Senior Credit Facility in whole or in part at any time.

Beginning in 2008, NRG must annually offer a portion of its
    excess cash flow (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) to
    its first lien lenders under the Term Loan Facility. The
    percentage of the excess cash flow offered to these lenders is
    dependent upon the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio
    (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) at the end of the
    preceding year. Of the amount offered, the first lien lenders
    must accept 50%, while the remaining 50% may either be accepted
    or rejected at the lenders’ option. Based on current credit
    market conditions, the Company expects that its lenders will
    accept in full the 2009 mandatory offer related to 2008, and, as
    such, the Company has reclassified approximately
    $197 million of Term Loan Facility maturity from a
    non-current to a current liability as of December 31, 2008.
    The 2008 mandatory offer related to 2007 was $446 million,
    against which the Company made a prepayment of $300 million
    in December 2007. Of the remaining $146 million, the
    lenders accepted a repayment of $143 million in March 2008.
    The amount retained by the Company was used for investments,
    capital expenditures and other items as permitted by the Senior
    Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2007, the Company
    reclassified approximately $146 million of the Term Loan
    Facility maturity from a non-current to a current liability.

The Senior Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of
    NRG’s existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries,
    with certain customary or

agreed-upon

exceptions for unrestricted foreign subsidiaries, project
    subsidiaries, and certain other subsidiaries. The capital stock
    of substantially all of NRG’s subsidiaries, with certain
    exceptions for unrestricted subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries,
    and project subsidiaries, has been pledged for the benefit of
    the Senior Credit Facility’s lenders.

The Senior Credit Facility is also secured by first-priority
    perfected security interests in substantially all of the
    property and assets owned or acquired by NRG and its
    subsidiaries, other than certain limited exceptions. These
    exceptions include assets of certain unrestricted subsidiaries,
    equity interests in certain of NRG’s project affiliates
    that have non-recourse debt financing, and voting equity
    interests in excess of 66% of the total outstanding voting
    equity interest of certain of NRG’s foreign subsidiaries.

The Senior Credit Facility contains customary covenants, which,
    among other things, require NRG to meet certain financial tests,
    including minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage

Interest Rate Swaps

— In connection with the
    Senior Credit Facility, NRG entered into a series of
    forward-setting interest rate swaps in 2006 which are intended
    to hedge the risks associated with floating interest rates. For
    each of the interest rate swaps, the Company pays its
    counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a
    predetermined notional value, and NRG receives quarterly the
    equivalent of a floating interest payment based on a

3-month

LIBOR calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate
    swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made quarterly,
    and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period.
    While the notional value of each of the swaps does not vary over
    time, the swaps are designed to mature sequentially.

NRG
    Non-Recourse Debt

Debt
    Related to Capital Allocation Program

During the third quarter 2006, the Company formed CSF I and CSF
    II, two wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiaries that are both
    consolidated by NRG. Their purpose was to repurchase
    $500 million shares of NRG’s common stock in the
    public markets or in privately negotiated transactions in
    connection with the Company’s Capital Allocation Program.
    These subsidiaries were funded with a combination of cash from
    NRG and a mix of notes and preferred interests issued to CS.
    Both the notes and the preferred interests are non-recourse debt
    to NRG or any of its restricted subsidiaries, with the debt
    collateralized by the NRG common stock held by CSF I and CSF II.
    In addition, the assets of CSF I and CSF II are not available to
    the creditors of NRG or the Company’s other subsidiaries.
    At December 31, 2008, CSF I and CSF II held 12,441,973 and
    9,528,930 shares of NRG common stock, respectively,
    reflected within treasury stock on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet.

As of December 31, 2007, the notes and preferred interests
    of CSF I and II contained a feature considered an embedded
    derivative, which requires NRG to pay to CS at maturity, either
    in cash or stock at NRG’s option, the excess of NRG’s
    then current stock price over a Threshold Price. This Threshold
    Price is the price of NRG’s stock in excess of a compound
    annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 20% beyond the volume-weighted
    average share price of the stock at the time of repurchase.
    Although this feature is considered a derivative, it is exempt
    from derivative accounting under the guidance in
    paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133, and will only be
    recognized upon settlement. As a result of the early settlement
    described below in August 2008 by the CSF I extension, as of
    December 31, 2008 only the notes and preferred interests of
    CSF II contain the embedded derivative feature. This CSF II
    embedded derivative has a Threshold Price of $40.80 per share
    and the maximum number of shares collateralizing the embedded
    derivatives is 7,623,211 shares. As of December 31,
    2008, based on the Company’s stock price, the CSF II
    embedded derivative was out-of-the money and had no redemption
    value.

CSF I Extension

— In March 2008, the Company
    executed an arrangement with CS to extend the notes and
    preferred interest maturities of CSF I from October 2008 to June
    2010. In addition, the settlement date of the embedded
    derivative, or CSF I CAGR, was extended 30 days to early
    December 2008. As part of this extension arrangement, the
    Company contributed 795,503 treasury shares to CSF I as
    additional collateral to maintain a blended interest rate in the
    CSF I facility of approximately 7.5%. Accordingly, the amount
    due at maturity in June 2010, including accrued interest, for
    the CSF I notes and preferred interests will be
    $248 million. In August 2008, the Company amended the CSF I
    notes and preferred interests to early settle the CSF I CAGR.
    Accordingly, NRG made a cash payment of $45 million to CS
    for the benefit of CSF I, which was recorded to interest
    expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of
    Operations.

Notes

— As of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    CSF I and II had a total of $249 million in notes in
    connection with Phase I of the Capital Allocation Program that
    mature in two tranches: $112 million for CSF II in October
    2009, plus accrued interest at an annual rate of 6.11%, and the
    balance of $137 million for CSF I in June 2010, plus
    accrued interest at an annual rate of 5.45%.

Preferred Interests

— As of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, total preferred interests issued and outstanding
    by CSF I and II were approximately $84 million to CS.
    These preferred interests are classified as a liability per
    SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
    Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,

because they embody a fixed unconditional obligation that
    these two unrestricted subsidiaries must settle. The

preferred interests also mature in two tranches:
    $31 million for CSF II in October 2009, plus accrued
    interest at an annual rate of 13.23%, and the balance of
    $53 million for CSF I in June 2010, plus accrued
    interest at an annual rate of 12.65%.

Project
    Financings

The following are descriptions of certain indebtedness of
    NRG’s project subsidiaries that remain outstanding as of
    December 31, 2008. The indebtedness described below is
    non-recourse to NRG, unless otherwise noted.

Other

In 2008, NINA and NRG Repowering Holdings LLC, or NRG
    Repowering, each obtained a $20 million revolving credit
    facility to provide working capital which permits NINA and NRG
    Repowering to make cash draws or issue letters of credit. The
    facilities mature on April 21, 2011 for NINA and
    August 12, 2011 for NRG Repowering. The facilities provide
    for customary events of default, which include, among others:
    nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of other agreements
    in the facility; the rendering of judgments to pay certain
    amounts of money against NINA or NRG Repowering and their
    subsidiaries; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.
    Borrowings under the facilities accrue interest at LIBOR or a
    base rate, plus a spread and are secured by substantially all of
    the assets of the respective borrower. As of December 31,
    2008, NINA and NRG Repowering each had borrowed approximately
    $10 million.

Peakers

In June 2002, NRG Peaker Financing LLC, or Peakers, an indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $325 million in floating
    rate bonds due June 2019. Peakers subsequently swapped such
    floating rate debt for fixed rate debt at an all-in cost of
    6.67% per annum. Principal, interest, and swap payments are
    guaranteed by XL Capital Assurance, through a financial guaranty
    insurance policy. These notes are also secured by, among other
    things, substantially all of the assets of and membership
    interests in Bayou Cove Peaking Power LLC, Big Cajun I Peaking
    Power LLC, NRG Sterlington Power LLC, NRG Rockford LLC, NRG
    Rockford II LLC, and NRG Rockford Equipment LLC. As of
    December 31, 2008, approximately $266 million in
    principal remained outstanding on these bonds. Upon emergence
    from bankruptcy, NRG issued a $36 million letter of credit
    to the Peakers’ collateral agent. The letter of credit may
    be drawn if the project is unable to meet principal or interest
    payments. There are no provisions requiring NRG to replenish the
    letter of credit if it is drawn.

NRG
    Thermal

NRG owns and operates its thermal business through a
    wholly-owned subsidiary holding company, NRG Thermal LLC, or NRG
    Thermal. In August 1993, the predecessor entity to NRG
    Thermal’s largest subsidiary, NRG Energy Center Minneapolis
    LLC, or NRG Thermal Minneapolis, issued $84 million of
    7.31% senior secured notes due June 2013, of which
    approximately $31 million remained outstanding as of
    December 31, 2008. In July 2002, NRG Thermal Minneapolis
    issued an additional $55 million of 7.25% Series A
    notes due August 2017, of which approximately $39 million
    remained outstanding as of December 31, 2008, and
    $20 million of 7.12% Series B notes due August 2017,
    of which approximately $14 million remained outstanding as
    of December 31, 2008. This indebtedness is secured by
    substantially all of the assets of NRG Thermal Minneapolis. NRG
    Thermal has guaranteed the indebtedness, and its guarantee is
    secured by a pledge of the equity interests in all of NRG
    Thermal’s subsidiaries.

Saale Energie GmbH, or SEG, an NRG wholly-owned subsidiary, has
    a 41.9% participation in Schkopau through NRG’s interest in
    the Kraftwerke Schkopau GbR, or KSGbR, partnership. Under the
    terms of a Use and Benefit Fee Agreement, SEG and the other
    partner to the project, E.ON Kraftwerke GmbH, are required to
    fund debt service and certain other costs resulting from the
    construction and financing of Schkopau. The Use and Benefit Fee
    Agreement is treated as a capital lease under US GAAP. Calls for
    funds are made to the partners based on their participation
    interest as cash is needed. As of December 31, 2008, the
    capital lease obligation at SEG was approximately
    $142 million.

The KSGbR issued debt to fund Schkopau pursuant to multiple
    facilities totaling approximately €785 million. As of
    December 31, 2008, approximately €185 million
    (approximately $258 million) remained outstanding at
    Schkopau. Interests on the individual loans accrue at fixed
    rates averaging 5.30% per annum, with maturities occurring
    between 2009 and 2015. SEG remains liable to the lenders as a

Benefit
    Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

NRG sponsors and operates three defined benefit pension and
    other postretirement plans. The NRG Plan for Bargained Employees
    and the NRG Plan for Non-bargained Employees are maintained
    solely for eligible legacy NRG participants. A third plan, the
    Texas Genco Retirement Plan, is maintained for participation by
    eligible Texas based employees. NRG expects to contribute
    approximately $60 million to the Company’s three
    pension plans in 2009, $29 million of which related to the
    Company’s 2008 benefit obligation as a result of the weak
    market performance of plan assets in 2008.

NRG Plans for Bargained and Non-bargained
    Employees

— Substantially all employees hired
    prior to December 5, 2003 were eligible to participate in
    NRG’s legacy defined benefit pension plans. The Company
    initiated a noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan
    effective January 1, 2004, with credit for service from
    December 5, 2003. In addition, the Company provides
    postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain groups of
    employees. Generally, these are groups that were acquired prior
    to 2004 and for whom prior benefits are being continued (at
    least for a certain period of time or as required by union
    contracts). Cost sharing provisions vary by acquisition group
    and terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements.

Texas Genco Retirement Plan

— The Texas
    region’s pension plan is a noncontributory defined benefit
    pension plan that provides a final average pay benefit or cash
    balance benefit, where the participant receives the more
    favorable of the two formulas, based on all years of service. In
    addition, employees who were hired prior to 1999 are also
    eligible for grandfathered benefits under a final average pay
    formula. In most cases, the benefits under the grandfathered
    formula were frozen on December 31, 2008. NRG’s Texas
    region employees are also covered under an unfunded
    postretirement health and welfare plan. Each year, employees
    receive a fixed credit of $750 to their account plus interest.
    Certain grandfathered employees will receive additional credits
    through 2008. At retirement, the employees may use their
    accounts to purchase retiree medical and dental benefits from
    NRG. NRG’s costs are limited to the amounts earned in the
    employee’s account; all other costs are paid by the
    participant.

NRG uses December 31 of each respective year as the measurement
    date for the Company’s pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans. The Company sets the discount rate assumptions on
    an annual basis for each of NRG’s retirement related
    benefit plans at their respective measurement date. This rate is
    determined by NRG’s Investment Committee based on
    information provided by the Company’s actuary. The discount
    rate assumptions reflect the current rate at which the
    associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end
    of the year. The discount rate assumptions used to determine
    future pension obligations as of December 31, 2008 and 2007
    were based on the Hewitt Yield Curve, or HYC, which was designed
    by Hewitt Associates to provide a means for plan sponsors to
    value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans. The
    HYC is a hypothetical yield curve represented by a series of
    annualized individual discount rates. Each bond issue underlying
    the HYC is required to have a rating of Aa or better by
    Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. or a rating of AA or better
    by Standard & Poor’s. Prior to using the HYC
    rates, the discount rate assumptions for pension expense in 2006
    were based on investment yields available on AA rated long-term
    corporate bonds.

NRG employs a total return investment approach, whereby a mix of
    equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the
    long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
    Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of
    plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial
    condition. The target allocation of plan assets is 60% to 75%
    invested in equity securities, with the remainder invested in
    fixed income securities. The Investment Committee reviews the
    asset mix periodically and as the plan assets increase in future
    years, the Investment Committee may examine other asset classes
    such as real estate or private equity. NRG employs a building
    block approach to determining the long-term rate of return for
    plan assets, with proper consideration given to diversification
    and rebalancing. Historical markets are studied and long-term
    historical relationships between equities and fixed income are
    preserved, consistent with the widely accepted capital market
    principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater
    return over the long run. Current factors such as inflation and
    interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market
    assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are
    reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

Plan assets are currently invested in a diversified blend of
    equity and fixed-income investments. Furthermore, equity
    investments are diversified across US and non-US equities, as
    well as among growth, value, small and large capitalization
    stocks.

NRG’s pension plan assets weighted average allocation as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:

    2008 and ended December 31, 2008. As of December 31,
    2008, there were 500,000 shares of treasury stock reserved
    for issuance under the ESPP. In January 2009, 41,706 shares
    of common stock were issued to employee account from treasury

Preferred
    Stock

    Preferred Stock.

5.75%
    Preferred Stock

On February 2, 2006, NRG completed the issuance of
    2,000,000 shares of 5.75% Preferred Stock, for net proceeds
    of $486 million, reflecting an offering price of $250 per
    share and the deduction of offering expenses and discounts of
    approximately $14 million. Dividends on the 5.75% Preferred
    Stock are $14.375 per share per year, and are due and payable on
    a quarterly basis beginning on March 15, 2006. Each share
    of the 5.75% Preferred Stock will automatically convert into a
    number of shares of common stock on March 16, 2009, or the
    Conversion Date, at a rate that is dependent upon the applicable
    market value of NRG’s common stock, illustrated in the
    following table:

Included in the agreement is a call option which allows that at
    any time prior to March 16, 2009, should the price of
    NRG’s common stock exceed $45.375, for at least 20 trading
    days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days, NRG may
    elect to cause the conversion of all, but not less than all, of
    its 5.75% Preferred Stock outstanding at the minimum conversion
    rate of 8.2712 shares of the Company’s common stock
    for each share of the 5.75% Preferred Stock. However, NRG can
    cause conversion only if it pays the holders in cash an amount
    equal to any

accrued, accumulated and unpaid dividends on the outstanding
    5.75% Preferred Stock declared and not declared plus the present
    value of all remaining future dividends through March 16,
    2009.

The holders of the 5.75% Preferred Stock may elect to convert at
    any time prior to the Conversion Date at the minimum conversion
    rate of 8.2712. As of December 31, 2008,
    158,320 shares of 5.75% Preferred Stock were converted
    early into 1,309,495 shares of common stock at the election
    of the holders. As of February 2, 2009, an additional
    142,400 shares of 5.75% Preferred Stock was converted into
    1,177,818 shares of common stock in 2009. Also included is
    an early conversion feature by the holders which is contingent
    upon a cash acquisition of NRG on or prior to March 16,
    2009. This feature requires paying converting holders an amount
    equal to the sum of any accumulated and unpaid dividends, the
    present value of all remaining dividend payments through and
    including March 16, 2009, and a specified conversion rate
    determined by reference to the price per share of the
    Company’s common stock paid in such acquisition for each
    share of the outstanding 5.75% Preferred Stock. However, should
    such a transaction be consummated by a public acquirer, in lieu
    of providing for conversion and paying the dividend amount, the
    Company may adjust its conversion obligation such that upon
    conversion of the outstanding 5.75% Preferred Stock, NRG will
    deliver the acquirer’s common stock.

4%

Preferred
    Stock

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, 420,000 shares of
    the Company’s 4% Preferred Stock were issued and
    outstanding at a liquidation value, net of issuance costs, of
    $406 million. Holders of the 4% Preferred Stock are
    entitled to receive, when declared by NRG’s Board of
    Directors, cash dividends at the rate of 4% per annum, or $40.00
    per share per year, payable quarterly in arrears commencing on
    March 15, 2005. The 4% Preferred Stock is convertible, at
    the option of the holder, at any time into shares of NRG’s
    common stock at an initial conversion price of $20.00 per share.
    As of February 2, 2009, 100 shares of the 4% Preferred
    Stock were converted into 5,000 shares of common stock in
    2009. On or after December 20, 2009, NRG may redeem,
    subject to certain limitations, some or all of the 4% Preferred
    Stock with cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
    liquidation preference, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends,
    including liquidated damages, if any, to the redemption date.

Should NRG be subject to a fundamental change, as defined in the
    Certificate of Designation of the 4% Preferred Stock, each
    holder of shares of the 4% Preferred Stock has the right,
    subject to certain limitations, to require NRG to purchase any
    or all of the Company’s shares of Preferred Stock at a
    purchase price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, plus
    accumulated and unpaid dividends, including liquidated damages,
    if any, to the date of purchase. Final determination of a
    fundamental change must be approved by the Board of Directors.
    Each holder of the 4% Preferred Stock has one vote for each
    share of the 4% Preferred Stock held by the holder on all
    matters voted upon by the holders of NRG common stock, as well
    as voting rights specifically provided for in NRG’s amended
    and restated certificate of incorporation or as otherwise, from
    time to time, required by law.

The 4% Preferred Stock is, with respect to dividend rights and
    rights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution: junior to
    all of NRG’s existing and future debt obligations; junior
    to each other class or series of NRG’s capital stock other
    than (i) NRG’s common stock and any other class or
    series of the Company’s capital stock that provides that
    such class or series will rank junior to the 4% Preferred Stock,
    and (ii) any other class or series of NRG’s capital
    stock, the terms of which provide that such class or series will
    rank on a parity with the 4% Preferred Stock.

On August 11, 2005, NRG issued 250,000 shares of
    3.625% Preferred Stock, which is treated as Redeemable Preferred
    Stock, to CS in a private placement. As of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, 250,000 shares of the 3.625% Preferred Stock
    were issued and outstanding at a liquidation value, net of
    issuance costs, of $247 million. The 3.625% Preferred Stock

Balance Sheet, due to the fact that the preferred shares can be
    redeemed in cash by the shareholder. The 3.625% Preferred Stock
    has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. Holders of the
    3.625% Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, out of legally
    available funds, cash dividends at the rate of 3.625% per annum,
    or $36.25 per share per year, payable in cash quarterly in
    arrears commencing on December 15, 2005.

Each share of the 3.625% Preferred Stock is convertible during
    the

90-day

period beginning August 11, 2015 at the option of NRG or
    the holder. Holders tendering the 3.625% Preferred Stock for
    conversion shall be entitled to receive, for each share of
    3.625% Preferred Stock converted, $1,000 in cash and a number of
    shares of NRG common stock equal to the product of (a) the
    greater of (i) the difference between the average closing
    share price of NRG common stock on each of the 20 consecutive
    scheduled trading days starting on the date 30 exchange business
    days immediately prior to the conversion date, or the Market
    Price, and $29.54 and (ii) zero, times (b) 50.77. The
    number of NRG common stock to be delivered under the conversion
    feature is limited to 16,000,000 shares. If upon
    conversion, the Market Price is less than $19.69, then the
    Holder will deliver to NRG cash or a number of shares of NRG
    common stock equal in value to the product of (i) $19.69
    minus the Market Price, times (ii) 50.77. NRG may elect to
    make a cash payment in lieu of delivering shares of NRG common
    stock in connection with such conversion, and NRG may elect to
    receive cash in lieu of shares of common stock, if any, from the
    Holder in connection with such conversion. The conversion
    feature is considered an embedded derivative per SFAS 133
    that is exempt from derivative accounting as it’s excluded
    from the scope pursuant to paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133.

If a fundamental change occurs, the holders will have the right
    to require NRG to repurchase all or a portion of the 3.625%
    Preferred Stock for a period of time after the fundamental
    change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the liquidation
    preference, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The 3.625%
    Preferred Stock is senior to all classes of common stock, on
    parity with the Company’s 4% Preferred Stock, and junior to
    all of the Company’s existing and future debt obligations
    and all of NRG subsidiaries’ existing and future
    liabilities and capital stock held by persons other than NRG or
    its subsidiaries.

The project is expected to be funded through equity
    contributions from the owners and non-recourse, project level

    equity investment in GenConn. In addition, as discussed in
    Note 8,

Capital Leases and Notes Receivable

, NRG
    entered into a short-term $45 million note receivable
    facility with GenConn to fund NRG’s proportionate
    share of project liquidity needs. GenConn had borrowed
    $36 million under this facility as of December 31,

Guarantees

, NRG has
    guaranteed its proportionate share of GenConn’s payments to
    a vendor under turbine purchase agreements for the Devon and
    Middletown sites, effective until such time as GenConn has
    obtained financing for each of the respective projects. As of
    December 31, 2008, NRG’s potential remaining
    obligation under the guarantees is $54 million. NRG’s
    maximum exposure to loss is limited to its equity investments
    and note receivable, as well as its remaining potential

GenConn is considered a VIE under FIN 46R, but NRG is not
    the primary beneficiary of GenConn and accounts for its 50%
    interest under the equity method. GenConn is a development stage
    entity, and is not expected to begin generating revenues until
    2010; therefore NRG recognized no equity earnings from the joint
    venture for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Gladstone

— NRG owns a 37.5% interest in
    Gladstone, an unincorporated joint venture, or UJV, which
    operates a 1,613 megawatt coal-fueled power generation facility
    in Queensland, Australia. The power generation facility is
    managed by the joint venture participants and the facility is
    operated by NRG. Operating expenses incurred in connection with
    the operation of the facility are funded by each of the
    participants in proportion to their ownership interests. Coal is
    sourced from a mining operation owned and operated by certain
    joint venture partners and other investors under a long-term
    supply agreement. NRG and the joint venture participants receive
    a majority of their respective share of revenues directly from
    customers and are directly responsible and liable for
    project-related debt, all in proportion to the ownership
    interests in the UJV. Power generated by the facility is
    primarily sold to an adjacent aluminum smelter, with excess
    power sold on the national market. For the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, NRG’s equity
    earnings from Gladstone were approximately $21 million,
    $21 million and $25 million, respectively.

    generation facility located in Cadillac, Michigan, along with
    its right to receive Production Tax Credits, or PTCs, through
    2009 to Lakes Renewable LLC. In consideration, NRG received
    approximately $4 million in a note receivable and a
    promissory note equal to the value of the Company’s share
    in future PTCs earned through 2009. The sale was contingent upon
    the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the
    Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and accordingly, all
    consideration was held in escrow. On April 13, 2006, NRG
    sold its remaining 0.5% share in Cadillac along with the
    Company’s interest in the note receivable and promissory
    note to Delta Power for approximately $11 million,
    resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $11 million.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net
    income less accumulated preferred stock dividends by the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Shares
    issued and treasury shares repurchased during the year are
    weighted for the portion of the year that they were outstanding.
    Diluted earnings per share is computed in a manner consistent
    with that of basic earnings per share while giving effect to all
    potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during
    the period.

Dilutive effect for equity compensation

— The
    outstanding non-qualified stock options, non-vested restricted
    stock units, deferred stock units and performance units are not
    considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings
    per share. However, these instruments are included in the
    denominator for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share
    under the treasury stock method.

Dilutive effect for other equity instruments

—
    NRG’s outstanding 4% Preferred Stock and 5.75% Preferred
    Stock are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing
    basic earnings per share. However, these instruments are
    considered for inclusion in the denominator for purposes of
    computing diluted earnings per share under the if-converted
    method. The if-converted method is also used to determine the
    dilutive effect of embedded derivatives in the Company’s
    3.625% Preferred Stock, and CSF preferred interests and notes.

The reconciliation of NRG’s basic earnings per common share
    to diluted earnings per share for the years ended

%

%

37.2

%

The effective income tax rate for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 differs from the
    US statutory rate of 35% due to a taxable dividend from
    foreign operations, including the provision of deferred taxes in
    2008 on foreign income no longer expected to be permanently
    reinvested overseas, and non-deductible interest. In addition,
    earnings in foreign jurisdictions are taxed at rates lower than
    the US statutory rate including the impact of a law change
    that reduced the German tax rate. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the effective tax rate differs from the
    US. statutory rate of 35% due to settlements paid from a
    claimant reserve established at bankruptcy as well as earnings
    in foreign jurisdictions that are taxed at rates lower than the
    US statutory rate.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, NRG’s state
    effective income tax rate has been reduced to 6%, which is lower
    than its 2007 rate of 7%, due to increased operational
    activities within the state of Texas in the current year. For
    the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company decreased the
    estimated state effective income tax rate to 7% from the prior
    year state income tax rate of 9%. This decrease was due to the
    acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, which operates in the state of
    Texas where there was no state income tax as of
    December 31, 2006. A decrease to the net deferred tax asset
    balance of approximately $24 million, of which
    $21 million is derived from continuing operations and
    $3 million is from discontinued operations, has been
    recorded for this change during 2006. In addition, a reduction
    of $22 million, of which $19 million is generated from
    continuing operations and $3 million is from discontinued
    operations, reflected in our domestic valuation allowance, was
    recorded due to a change in our estimated state effective income
    tax rate during 2006.

Tax
    Receivable and Payable

As of December 31, 2008, NRG recorded a current tax payable
    of approximately $30 million that represents a tax
    liability due to a domestic state tax of approximately
    $24 million, as well as foreign taxes payable of
    approximately $6 million. In addition, NRG has a domestic
    tax receivable of $54 million.

Deferred
    tax assets and valuation allowance

Net deferred tax balance

— As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, NRG recorded a net deferred tax
    liability of $1,032 million and $180 million, respectively.
    However, due to an assessment of positive and negative evidence,
    including projected capital gains and available tax planning
    strategies, NRG believes that it is more likely than not that a
    benefit will not be realized on $359 and $539 million of
    tax assets, thus a valuation allowance has remained, resulting
    in a net deferred tax liability of $1,391 million and
    $719 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. NRG believes it is more likely than not that
    future earnings will be sufficient to utilize the Company’s
    deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowances at
    December 31, 2008.

NOL carryforwards

— For the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company generated total
    domestic pretax book income of $1,644 million and
    $860 million, respectively. As a result, a cumulative
    domestic net operating loss, or NOL, in the amount
    $245 million had been fully utilized as of
    December 31, 2007 with the exception of certain state NOLs.
    In addition, as of December 31, 2008, NRG has cumulative
    foreign NOL carryforwards of $239 million of which
    $41 million will expire starting 2011 through 2017 and of
    which $198 million do not have an expiration date.

Valuation allowance

— As of December 31,
    2008, the Company’s valuation allowance and other deferred
    tax items were reduced as a result of the reduction in
    NRG’s net deferred tax assets. In accordance with

SOP 90-7,

these movements resulted in an increase in Additional Paid in
    Capital and income tax benefit of approximately
    $162 million and $12 million respectively. In
    accordance with SFAS 141R, any future reductions to
    valuation allowance occurring after January 1, 2009 will be
    credited to income tax expense rather than APIC.

APIC adjustment —

During 2008, the Company
    recorded $14 million through APIC for various Fresh-Start
    related book-tax differences.

APB
    Opinion 23

Through 2007, it was management’s intent to permanently
    reinvest unremitted earnings overseas in accordance with APB
    Opinion No. 23

Accounting for Income Taxes —
    Special Areas

, or APB 23. If NRG does not permanently
    reinvest earnings, then deferred taxes of approximately
    $39 million would have been recognized for the cumulative
    translation adjustment as of December 31, 2007.



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Uncertain
    tax benefits

NRG has identified certain unrecognized tax benefits whose
    after-tax value was $527 million, of which $36 million
    would impact the Company’s income tax expense. Of the
    $527 million in unrecognized tax benefits,
    $491 million relates to periods prior to the Company’s
    emergence from bankruptcy. In accordance with Statement of
    Position

90-7,

Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the
    Bankruptcy Code

, and the application of fresh start
    accounting, recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits
    existing pre-emergence would not impact the Company’s
    effective tax rate but would increase Additional Paid in
    Capital, or APIC. In accordance with SFAS 141R, any changes
    to our uncertain tax benefits occurring after January 1,
    2009 will be credited to income tax expense rather than APIC.

As of December 31, 2008, NRG has recorded a
    $208 million non-current tax liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits, resulting from taxable earnings for the period for
    which there are no NOLs available to offset for financial
    statement purposes. NRG accrued interest and penalties related
    to these unrecognized tax benefits of approximately
    $8 million as of December 31, 2008. The Company
    recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in income tax expense. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the Company incurred an immaterial
    amount of interest and penalties related to its unrecognized tax
    benefits.

Tax jurisdictions

— NRG is subject to
    examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed
    in the US federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign
    jurisdictions including major operations located in Germany and
    Australia. The Company is no longer subject to US federal income
    tax examinations for years prior to 2002. With few exceptions,
    state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for
    years before 2003. The Company’s significant foreign
    operations are also no longer subject to examination by local
    jurisdictions for years prior to 2000.

The Company has been contacted for examination by the Internal
    Revenue Service for years 2004 through 2006. The audit commenced
    during the third quarter 2008 and is expected to continue for
    approximately 18 to 24 months.

Sale of ITISA

— On April 28, 2008, NRG
    completed the sale of its 100% interest in Tosli Acquisition
    B.V., or Tosli, which held all NRG’s interest in ITISA, to
    Brookfield Renewable Power Inc. (previously Brookfield Power
    Inc.), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management
    Inc. In addition, the purchase price adjustment contingency
    under the sale agreement was resolved on August 7, 2008. In
    connection with the sale, NRG recorded a capital gain of
    $215 million which further reduced our uncertain tax
    benefits.

    tax benefits at the beginning and end of the respective periods:

NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Due to the classification of NOL’s as capital losses for
    financial statement purposes, $292 million of the
    Company’s $527 million unrecognized tax benefit will
    expire as of December 31, 2009.

German
    Tax Reform Act 2008

On July 6, 2007, the German government passed the Tax
    Reform Act of 2008, which reduces the German statutory and
    resulting effective tax rates on earnings from approximately 36%
    to approximately 27% effective January 1, 2008. Due to this
    reduction in the statutory and resulting effective tax rate in
    2007, NRG recognized a $29 million tax benefit and as of
    December 31, 2007, NRG had a German net deferred tax
    liability of approximately $84 million which includes the
    impact of this tax rate change.

Note 19 —

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company adopted SFAS 123R, effective January 1,
    2006, with no material effect on NRG’s consolidated
    statements of operations.

Long-Term
    Incentive Plan, or LTIP

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, a total of
    16,000,000 shares of NRG common stock were authorized for
    issuance under the LTIP, subject to adjustments in the event of
    reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock
    split, stock dividend, and a combination of shares, merger or
    similar change in NRG’s structure or outstanding shares of
    common stock. It is NRG’s policy to issue treasury shares
    upon exercise of a LTIP award. If there are no treasury shares
    available, new shares of common stock will be issued. There were
    6,798,074 and 7,941,758 shares of common stock remaining
    available for grants under NRG’s LTIP as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Non-Qualified
    Stock Options, or NQSO’s

NQSO’s granted under the LTIP typically have a three-year
    graded vesting schedule beginning on the grant date and become
    exercisable at the end of the requisite service period. NRG
    recognizes compensation costs for NQSO’s on a straight-line
    basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
    The maximum contractual term is ten years for approximately
    1.1 million of NRG’s outstanding NQSO’s, and six
    years for the remaining 2.9 million NQSO’s.

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted
    during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $10.33, $8.28, and $7.26, respectively. The total intrinsic
    value of options exercised during the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $14 million,
    $11 million and $1 million, respectively and cash
    received from the exercise of these options was $9 million,
    $7 million and $1 million, respectively.

The fair value of the Company’s NQSO’s is estimated on
    the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
    Significant assumptions used in the fair value model for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 with respect
    to the Company’s NQSO’s are summarized below:

For 2006, expected volatility was calculated based on a blended
    average of NRG and NRG’s industry peers’ historical
    two-year stock price volatility data. For 2008 and 2007, as more
    historical NRG data has become available, expected volatility is
    calculated based on NRG’s historical stock price volatility
    data over the period commensurate with the expected term of the
    stock option. Typically, the expected term for the
    Company’s NQSO’s is based on the simple average of the
    contractual term and vesting term.

Restricted
    Stock Units, or RSU’s

Typically, RSU’s granted under the Company’s LTIP
    fully vest three years from the date of issuance. Fair value of
    the RSU’s is based on the closing price of NRG common stock
    on the date of grant. The following table summarizes the
    Company’s non-vested RSU awards as of December 31,
    2008 and changes during the year then ended:

Deferred
    Stock Units, or DSU’s

DSU’s represent the right of a participant to be paid one
    share of NRG common stock at the end of a deferral period
    established under the terms of the award. DSU’s granted
    under the Company’s LTIP are fully vested at the date of
    issuance. Fair value of the DSU’s, which is based on the
    closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant, is
    recorded as compensation expense in the period of grant.

    2008, 2007 and 2006 were $1.5 million, $1.2 million
    and $0.4 million, respectively.

Performance
    Units, or PU’s

PU’s granted under the Company’s LTIP fully vest three
    years from the date of issuance. PU’s granted prior to
    January 1, 2009 are paid out upon vesting if the average
    closing price of NRG’s common stock for the ten trading
    days prior to the vesting date, or the Measurement Price, is
    equal to or greater than the Target Price. A Target Price and
    Maximum Price are determined on the date of issuance. The payout
    for each PU will be equal to: (i) one share of common
    stock, if the Measurement Price equals the Target Price;
    (ii) a pro-rata amount between one and two shares of common
    stock, if the Measurement Price is greater than the Target Price
    but less than the Maximum Price; and (iii) two shares of
    common stock, if the Measurement Price is equal to, or greater
    than, the Maximum Price. PU’s granted after January 1,
    2009 are paid out upon vesting if the Measurement Price is equal
    to or greater than 9% growth in the NRG stock price compounded
    annually over three years, or the Threshold Price. The payout
    for each PU will be equal to a pro-rated amount in between
    one-half and one share of common stock if the Measurement Price
    equals or exceeds the Threshold Price but less than the Target
    Price. The payout for each PU will be equal to a pro-rated
    amount in between one and two shares of common stock, if the
    Measurement Price is equal to the Target Price but less than the
    Maximum Price. The payout for each PU will be equal to two
    shares of common stock if the Measurement Price is equal to or
    greater than the Maximum Price.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

In May 2008, NRG shareholders approved the adoption of the NRG
    Energy, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, pursuant to
    which eligible employees may elect to withhold up to 10% of
    their eligible compensation to purchase shares of NRG common
    stock at 85% of its fair market value on the exercise date. An
    exercise date occurs each June 30 and December 31. The
    initial six month employee withholding period began July 1,
    2008 and ended December 31, 2008. As of December 31,
    2008, there were 500,000 shares of treasury stock reserved
    for issuance under the ESPP. In January 2009, 41,706 shares
    were issued to employees accounts from the treasury
    stock reserve for the ESPP.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Operating
    Lease Commitments

NRG leases certain Company facilities and equipment under
    operating leases, some of which include escalation clauses,
    expiring on various dates through 2027. Certain operating lease
    agreements over their lease term include provisions such as
    scheduled rent increases, leasehold incentives, and rent
    concessions. The Company recognizes the effects of these
    scheduled rent increases, leasehold incentives, and rent
    concessions on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless
    another systematic and rational allocation basis is more
    representative of the time pattern in which the leased property
    is physically employed. Rental expense under operating leases
    was approximately $40 million, $40 million and
    $37 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Lignite
    Contract with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co.

The lignite used to fuel the Texas region’s Limestone
    facility is obtained from a surface mine, or the Jewett mine,
    adjacent to the Limestone facility under an amended long-term
    contract with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co, or TWCC. During 2007,
    NRG and TWCC renegotiated a long-term contract that
    significantly changed the contractual structure as well as
    extended the mining period. The new contract is based on a
    cost-plus arrangement with incentives and penalties to ensure
    proper management of the mine. NRG has the flexibility to
    increase or decrease lignite purchases from the mine within
    certain ranges, including the ability to suspend or terminate
    lignite purchases with adequate notice. The mining period was
    extended through 2018 with an option to extend the mining period
    by two five-year intervals.

TWCC is responsible for performing ongoing reclamation
    activities at the mine until all lignite reserves have been
    produced. When production is completed at the mine, NRG will be
    responsible for final mine reclamation obligations. Due to an
    increase in reclamation estimates offset by the negotiated
    three-year extension of the mining contract, the Company’s
    ARO for mine reclamation costs increased by $5 million.



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

The Railroad Commission of Texas has imposed a bond obligation
    of approximately $83 million on TWCC for the reclamation of
    this lignite mine. Pursuant to the contract with TWCC, an
    affiliate of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. has guaranteed
    $50 million of this obligation. The remaining sum of
    approximately $33 million has been bonded by the mine
    operator, TWCC. Approximately $7 million of such amount is
    supported by a letter of credit posted by NRG. Under the terms
    of the new cost plus agreement with TWCC, NRG is required to
    maintain a corporate guarantee of TWCC’s bond obligation in
    the amount of $50 million if CenterPoint Energy,
    Inc.’s obligation lapses, or pay the costs of obtaining
    replacement performance assurance. Additionally, NRG is required
    to provide additional performance assurance over TWCC’s
    current bond obligations if required by the Commission.

International
    Commitments

Two of the Company’s wholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries
    are severally responsible for the pro rata payments of
    principal, interest and related costs incurred in connection
    with the financing of NRG’s equity investment in the
    unincorporated joint venture Gladstone Power Station. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company was obligated for the loan
    of AUD 20 million (approximately US $14 million) in
    principal. This loan is scheduled to be fully repaid on
    March 31, 2009.

First
    and Second Lien Structure

NRG has granted first and second liens to certain counterparties
    on substantially all of the Company’s assets. NRG uses the
    first or second lien structure to reduce the amount of cash
    collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be
    required to post from time to time to support its obligations
    under out-of-the-money hedge agreements for forward sales of
    power or MWh equivalents. To the extent that the underlying
    hedge positions for a counterparty are in-the-money to NRG, the
    counterparty would have no claim under the lien program. The
    lien program limits the volumes that can be hedged, not the
    value of underlying out-of-the money positions. The first lien
    program does not require NRG to post collateral above any
    threshold amount of exposure. Within the first and second lien
    structure, the Company can hedge up to 80% of its baseload
    capacity and 10% of its non-baseload assets with these
    counterparties for the first 60 months and then declining
    thereafter. Net exposure to a counterparty on all trades must be
    positively correlated to the price of the relevant commodity for
    the first lien to be available to that counterparty. The first
    and second lien structure is not subject to unwind or
    termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has
    no stated maturity date.

The Company’s lien counterparties may have a claim on our
    assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged price. As
    of December 31, 2008 and February 2, 2009, the first
    lien exposure of net out-of-the-money positions to
    counterparties on hedges was $88 million and
    $43 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008 and
    February 2, 2009, there was no exposure to out-of-the-money
    positions to counterparties on hedges under the second lien.

RepoweringNRG
    Initiatives

NRG has made non-refundable payments of $188 million in
    support of expected deliveries of wind turbines totaling
    approximately $215 million through 2009. The Company
    believes that these payments are necessary for the timely and
    successful execution of related

Repowering

NRG initiatives.

In addition, NRG has capitalized $30 million through
    December 31, 2008 for the repowering of its El Segundo
    generating facility in California. As a result of permitting
    delays related to on-going Natural Resource Defense Counsel
    claims, the El Segundo project is unlikely to reach its original
    completion date of June 1, 2011.

Contingencies

Set forth below is a description of the Company’s material
    legal proceedings. The Company believes that it has valid
    defenses to these legal proceedings and intends to defend them
    vigorously. Pursuant to the requirements of
    SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

or
    SFAS 5, and related guidance, NRG records reserves for
    estimated losses from contingencies when information available
    indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or
    range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. In addition legal
    cost are expensed as incurred. Management has assessed each of
    the following matters based on current information and made a
    judgment concerning its potential outcome, considering the
    nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought,
    and the probability of success. Unless specified below, the
    Company is unable to predict the outcome of these legal
    proceedings or reasonably estimate the scope or amount of any
    associated costs and potential liabilities. As additional
    information becomes available, management adjusts its assessment
    and estimates of such contingencies accordingly. Because
    litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable
    rulings or developments, it is possible that the ultimate
    resolution of the Company’s liabilities and contingencies
    could be at amounts that are different from its currently
    recorded reserves and that such difference could be material.

In addition to the legal proceedings noted below, NRG and its
    subsidiaries are party to other litigation or legal proceedings
    arising in the ordinary course of business. In management’s
    opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will
    not materially adversely affect NRG’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Exelon
    Related Litigation

Delaware
    Chancery Court

On November 11, 2008, Exelon and its wholly-owned
    subsidiary Exelon Xchange filed a complaint against NRG and
    NRG’s Board of Directors. The complaint alleges, among
    other things, that NRG’s Board of Directors failed to give
    due consideration and to take appropriate action in response to
    the acquisition proposal announced by Exelon on October 19,
    2008, in which Exelon offered to acquire all of the outstanding
    shares of NRG common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.485 Exelon
    shares for each NRG common share. The complaint seeks, among
    other things, declaratory and injunctive relief:
    (1) declaring that NRG’s Board of Directors has
    breached its fiduciary duties to the NRG stockholders by
    rejecting and refusing to consider Exelon’s acquisition
    proposal and by failing to exempt the proposed transaction from
    application of Section 203 of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law; (2) compelling NRG’s Board of
    Directors to approve Exelon’s acquisition proposal for
    purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General
    Corporations Law; (3) declaring that the adoption of any
    measure that would have the effect of impeding or interfering
    with Exelon’s acquisition proposal constitutes a breach of
    NRG’s Board of Directors fiduciary duties; and
    (4) enjoining the defendants from adopting any measures
    that would have the effect of impeding or interfering with
    Exelon’s acquisition proposal. On November 14, 2008,
    NRG and NRG’s Board of Directors filed a motion to dismiss
    Exelon’s complaint on the grounds that it failed to state a
    claim upon which relief can be granted. On January 28,
    2009, NRG and NRG’s Board of Directors filed their brief in
    support of their motion to dismiss.

On December 11, the Louisiana Sheriffs’
    Pension & Relief Fund and City of St. Claire Shores
    Police & Fire Retirement System, on behalf of
    themselves and all others similarly situated, served a
    previously filed complaint on NRG and its Board of Directors
    alleging substantially similar allegations as the Exelon
    complaint. On December 23, 2008, NRG and NRG’s Board
    of Directors filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the
    grounds that it failed to state a claim upon which relief can be
    granted. On January 28, 2009, NRG and NRG’s Board of
    Directors filed their brief in support of their motion to
    dismiss.

Mercer
    County, New Jersey Superior Court

On January 6, 2009, three lawsuits previously filed against
    NRG and NRG’s Board of Directors on behalf of individual
    shareholders and all others similarly situated were consolidated
    into one case in the Law Division of the Superior Court of
    Mercer County, New Jersey. On January 21, 2009, the
    plaintiffs filed an Amended Consolidated Complaint in which they
    allege a single count of breach of fiduciary duty against
    NRG’s Board of Directors and seek injunctive relief:
    (1) declaring that the action is a class action and
    certifying plaintiffs as class plaintiffs and counsel as class
    counsel; (2) declaring that defendants breached their
    fiduciary duties by summarily rejecting the Exelon offer;
    (3) ordering defendants to negotiate with respect to the
    Exelon offer or with respect to another transaction to maximize
    shareholder value; (4) ordering defendants to exempt
    Exelon’s offer from Section 203 of the Delaware
    General Corporations Law; (5) awarding compensatory damages
    including interest; (6) awarding plaintiffs costs and fees;
    and (7) granting other relief the Court deems proper. A
    response is due on or before February 20, 2009.

California
    Department of Water Resources

This matter concerns, among other contracts and other
    defendants, the CDWR and its wholesale power contract with
    subsidiaries of WCP (Generation) Holdings, Inc., or WCP. The
    case originated with a February 2002 complaint filed by the
    State of California alleging that many parties, including WCP
    subsidiaries, overcharged the State of California. For WCP, the
    alleged overcharges totaled approximately $940 million for
    2001 and 2002. The complaint demanded that the FERC abrogate the
    CDWR contract and sought refunds associated with revenues
    collected under the contract. In 2003, the FERC rejected this
    complaint, denied rehearing, and the case was appealed to the US
    Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, or Ninth Circuit, where
    oral argument was held on December 8, 2004. On
    December 19, 2006, the Ninth Circuit decided that in the
    FERC’s review of the contracts at issue, the FERC could not
    rely on the

Mobil-Sierra

standard presumption of just and
    reasonable rates, where such contracts were not reviewed by the
    FERC with full knowledge of the then existing market conditions.
    WCP and others sought review by the US Supreme Court. WCP’s
    appeal was not selected, but instead held by the Supreme Court.
    In the appeal that was selected by the Supreme Court, on
    June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court ruled (1) that the

Mobil-Sierra

public interest standard of review applied
    to contracts made under a seller’s market-based rate
    authority; (2) that the public interest “bar”
    required to set aside a contract remains a very high one to
    overcome; and (3) that the

Mobil-Sierra

presumption
    of contract reasonableness applies when a contract is formed
    during a period of market dysfunction unless (a) such
    market conditions were caused by the illegal actions of one of
    the parties or (b) the contract negotiations were tainted
    by fraud or duress. In this related case, the US Supreme Court
    affirmed the Ninth Circuit’s decision agreeing that the
    case should be remanded to FERC to clarify FERC’s 2003
    reasoning regarding its rejection of the original complaint
    relating to the financial burdens under the contracts at issue
    and to alleged market manipulation at the time these contracts
    were formed. As a result, the US Supreme Court then reversed and
    remanded the WCP CDWR case to the Ninth Circuit for treatment
    consistent with its June 26, 2008, decision in the related
    case. On October 20, 2008, the Ninth Circuit asked the
    parties in the remanded CDWR case, including WCP and the FERC,
    whether that Court should answer a question the US Supreme Court
    did not address in its June 26, 2008, decision; whether the

Mobil-Sierra

doctrine applies to a third-party that was
    not a signatory to any of the wholesale power contracts,
    including the CDWR contract, at issue in the case. Without
    answering that reserved question, on December 4, 2008, the
    Ninth Circuit vacated its prior opinion and remanded the WCP
    CDWR case back to the FERC for proceedings consistent with the
    US Supreme Court’s June 26, 2008, decision. On
    December 15, 2008, WCP and the other seller-defendants
    filed with FERC a Motion for Order Governing Proceedings on
    Remand. On January 14, 2009, the Public Utilities
    Commission of the State of California filed an Answer and Cross
    Motion for an Order Governing Procedures on Remand, and on
    January 28, 2009, WCP and the other seller-defendants filed
    their reply.

At this time, while NRG cannot predict with certainty whether
    WCP will be required to make refunds for rates collected under
    the CDWR contract or estimate the range of any such possible
    refunds, a reconsideration of the CDWR contract by the FERC with
    a resulting order mandating significant refunds could have a
    material adverse impact on NRG’s financial position,
    statement of operations, and statement of cash flows. As part of
    the 2006 acquisition of Dynegy’s 50% ownership interest in
    WCP, WCP and NRG assumed responsibility for any risk of loss
    arising from this case, unless any such loss was deemed to have
    resulted from certain acts of gross negligence or willful
    misconduct on the part of Dynegy, in which case any such loss
    would be shared equally between WCP and Dynegy.

Disputed
    Claims Reserve

As part of NRG’s plan of reorganization, NRG funded a
    disputed claims reserve for the satisfaction of certain general
    unsecured claims that were disputed claims as of the effective
    date of the plan. Under the terms of the plan, as such claims
    are resolved, the claimants are paid from the reserve on the
    same basis as if they had been paid out in the bankruptcy. To
    the extent the aggregate amount required to be paid on the
    disputed claims exceeds the amount remaining in the funded
    claims reserve, NRG will be obligated to provide additional cash
    and common stock to satisfy the claims. Any excess funds in the
    disputed claims reserve will be reallocated to the creditor pool
    for the pro rata benefit of all allowed claims. The contributed
    common stock and cash in the reserves is held by an escrow agent
    to complete the distribution and settlement process. Since NRG
    has surrendered control over the common stock and cash provided
    to the disputed claims reserve, NRG recognized the issuance of
    the common stock as of December 6, 2003 and removed the
    cash amounts from the balance sheet. Similarly, NRG removed the
    obligations relevant to the claims from the balance sheet when
    the common stock was issued and cash contributed.

On April 3, 2006, the Company made a supplemental
    distribution to creditors under the Company’s
    Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan, totaling $25 million in
    cash and 5,082,000 shares of common stock. On
    December 18, 2008, NRG filed with the US Bankruptcy Court
    for the Southern District of New York a Closing Report and an
    Application for Final Decree Closing the Chapter 11 Case
    for NRG Energy, Inc. et al and on December 29, 2008,
    the court entered the Final Decree. As of December 21,
    2008, the reserve held approximately $9,776,880 in cash and
    1,282,783 shares of common stock. On December 21,
    2008, the Company issued an instruction letter to The Bank of
    New York Mellon to distribute all remaining cash and stock in
    the Disputed Claims Reserve to NRG’s creditors. On
    January 12, 2009, The Bank of New York Mellon commenced the
    distribution of all remaining cash and stock in the Disputed
    Claim Reserve to the Company’s creditors pursuant to
    NRG’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan.

NRG operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to
    regulation by various federal and state agencies. As such, NRG
    is affected by regulatory developments at both the federal and
    state levels and in the regions in which NRG operates. In
    addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures, and

New England —

On July 16, 2007, the FERC
    conditionally accepted, subject to refund, the RMR agreement
    filed on April 26, 2007 by Norwalk Power for its units 1
    and 2, specifying a June 19, 2007 effective date. On
    December 4, 2008, Norwalk Power filed a Settlement
    Agreement resolving the RMR agreement eligibility and rate
    issues. The Settlement Agreement provides for an Annual Fixed
    Revenue Requirement of $34 million for 2008 and
    $32 million for 2009, continuing at a rate of
    $32 million per year until FCM is implemented on
    June 1, 2010. The FERC accepted the Settlement Agreement on
    December 30, 2008.

PJM —

On August 23, 2007, several
    entities, including the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities,
    the District of Columbia Office of the People’s Counsel,
    and the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, filed appeals
    of the FERC orders accepting the settlement of the locational
    capacity market for PJM. The settlement, filed at the FERC on
    September 29, 2006, provides for a capacity market
    mechanism known as the RPM which is designed to provide a
    long-term price signal through competitive forward auctions. On
    December 22, 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting the
    settlement, which was reaffirmed on rehearing by order dated
    June 25, 2007. The RPM auctions have been conducted and
    capacity payments pursuant to the RPM mechanism have commenced.
    A successful appeal by the appellants could disturb the
    settlement and create a refund obligation of capacity payments.

On May 30, 2008, the Maryland Public Service Commission
    together with other load interests, filed at the FERC a
    complaint against PJM challenging the results of the RPM
    transition Base Residual Auctions for installed capacity, held
    between April 2007 and January 2008. The complaint seeks to
    replace the auction-determined results for installed capacity
    for the 2008/2009, 2009/2010, and 2010/2011 delivery years with
    administratively-determined prices. On September 19, 2008,
    the FERC dismissed the complaint. The parties representing load
    interests have sought rehearing of the dismissal of the
    complaint. In a related proceeding, PJM filed proposed changes
    to RPM on December 12, 2008.

Note 23 — Environmental
    Matters

The construction and operation of power projects are subject to
    stringent environmental and safety protection and land use laws
    and regulation in the US. If such laws and regulations become
    more stringent, or new laws, interpretations or compliance
    policies apply and NRG’s facilities are not exempt from
    coverage, the Company could be required to make modifications to
    further reduce potential environmental impacts. New legislation
    and regulations to mitigate the effects of GHG including
    CO


from power plants, are under consideration at the federal and
    state levels. In general, the effect of such future laws or
    regulations is expected to require the addition of pollution
    control equipment or the imposition of restrictions or
    additional costs on the Company’s operations.

Environmental
    Capital Expenditures

Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated
    that environmental capital expenditures to be incurred from 2009
    through 2013 to meet NRG’s environmental commitments will
    be approximately $1.2 billion (unaudited). These capital
    expenditures, in general, are related to installation of
    particulate,
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury controls to comply with federal and state air
    quality rules and consent orders, as well as installation of
    “Best Technology Available” under the Phase II
    316(b) rule. NRG continues to explore cost effective
    alternatives that can achieve desired results. While this
    estimate reflects anticipated schedules and controls related to
    2008 court rulings that affect requirements for both CAIR and
    CAMR, the full impact on the scope and timing of environmental
    retrofits from any new or revised regulations cannot be
    determined at this time.

Northeast
    Region

NRG operates electric generating units located in Connecticut,
    Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York which are
    subject to RGGI. These units will have to surrender one
    allowance for every US ton of
    CO


emitted with true up for

2009-2011

occurring in 2012. Allowances will be partially allocated in the
    state of Delaware only. In 2008, NRG emitted approximately
    12 million tonnes of
    CO


in RGGI states. NRG believes that to the extent
    CO


will not be fully reflected in wholesale electricity prices, the
    direct financial impact on the Company is likely to be negative
    as costs will be incurred in the course of securing the
    necessary RGGI allowances and offsets at auction and in the
    market.

In January 2006, NRG’s Indian River Operations, Inc.
    received a letter of informal notification from the DNREC
    stating that the Company may be a potentially responsible party
    with respect to a historic captive landfill. On October 1,
    2007, NRG signed an agreement with DNREC to investigate the site
    through the Voluntary

Clean-up

Program. On February 4, 2008, the DNREC issued findings
    that no further action is required in relation to surface water
    and that a previously planned shoreline stabilization project
    would adequately address shore line erosion. The landfill itself
    will require a further Remedial Investigation and Feasibility
    Study to determine the type and scope of any additional work
    required. Until the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study
    are completed, the Company is unable to predict the impact of
    any required remediation.

On May 29, 2008, the DNREC issued an invitation to
    NRG’s Indian River Operations, Inc. to participate in the
    development and performance of a Natural Resource Damage
    Assessment, or NRDA, at the Burton Island Old Ash Landfill. NRG
    is currently working with the DNREC and other trustees to close
    out the property.

South
    Central Region

On January 27, 2004, NRG’s Louisiana Generating, LLC
    and the Company’s Big Cajun II plant received a
    request under Section 114 of the CAA from the USEPA seeking
    information primarily related to physical changes made at the
    Big Cajun II plant, and subsequently received a NOV on
    February 15, 2005, alleging that NRG’s predecessors
    had undertaken projects that triggered requirements under the
    Prevention of Significant Deterioration program, including the
    installation of emission controls. NRG submitted multiple
    responses commencing February 27, 2004 and ending on
    October 20, 2004. On May 9, 2006, these entities
    received from the Department of Justice, or DOJ, a Notice of
    Deficiency related to their responses, to which NRG responded on
    May 22, 2006. A document review was conducted at NRG’s
    Louisiana Generating, LLC offices by the DOJ during the week of
    August 14, 2006. On December 8, 2006, the USEPA issued
    a supplemental NOV updating the original February 15,
    2005 NOV. NRG has evaluated the original and subsequent
    claims and believes they have no merit. Nonetheless, NRG has had
    discussions with the USEPA about resolving the claims and the
    Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome of this matter.

Note 25 — Guarantees

NRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that
    include indemnification and guarantee provisions as a routine
    part of the Company’s business activities. Examples of
    these contracts include asset purchases and sale agreements,
    commodity sale and purchase agreements, joint venture
    agreements, EPC agreements, operation and maintenance
    agreements, service agreements, settlement agreements, and other
    types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third
    parties, as well as affiliates. These contracts generally
    indemnify the counterparty for tax, environmental liability,
    litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of
    representations, warranties and covenants set forth in these
    agreements. In some cases, NRG’s maximum potential
    liability cannot be estimated, since the underlying agreements
    contain no limits on potential liability. In accordance with
    FIN 45, NRG has estimated that the current fair value for
    issuing these guarantees was approximately $7 million as of
    December 31, 2008, and the liability in this amount is
    included in the Company’s non-current liabilities.

The following table summarizes NRG’s estimated guarantees,
    indemnity, and other contingent liability obligations by

Letters of credit and surety bonds —

As of
    December 31, 2008, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries
    were contingently obligated for a total of approximately
    $445 million under letters of credit and surety bonds. Most
    of these letters of credit and surety bonds are issued in
    support of the Company’s obligations to perform under



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

commodity agreements, financing or other arrangements. A
    majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds expire
    within one year of issuance, and it is typical for the Company
    to renew them on similar terms.

Asset sale guarantees —

NRG is typically
    requested to provide certain assurances to the counter-parties
    of the Company’s asset sale agreements. Such assurances may
    take the form of a guarantee issued by the Company on behalf of
    a directly or indirectly held majority-owned subsidiary which
    include certain indemnifications to a third party, usually the
    buyer, as described below. Due to the inter-company nature of
    such arrangements, NRG is essentially guaranteeing its own
    performance, and the nature of the guarantee being provided. It
    is not the Company’s policy to recognize the value of such
    an obligation in its consolidated financial statements. Most of
    these guarantees provide an explicit cap on the Company’s
    maximum liability, as well as an expiration period, exclusive of
    breach of representations and warranties.

Commercial sales arrangements —

In
    connection with the purchase and sale of fuel, emission
    allowances and power generation products to and from third
    parties with respect to the operation of some of NRG’s
    generation facilities in the US, the Company may be required to
    guarantee a portion of the obligations of certain of its
    subsidiaries. These obligations may include liquidated damages
    payments or other unscheduled payments.

Other guarantees —

NRG has issued guarantees of
    obligations that its subsidiaries may incur as a provision for
    environmental site remediation, payment of debt obligations,
    rail car leases, performance under purchase, EPC and operating
    and maintenance agreements. NRG has executed guarantees with
    related parties for one of its subsidiary’s obligations as
    construction manager under EPC contracts for the construction of
    the Sherbino wind farm and two peaking power plants at
    GenConn’s Devon and Middletown sites. See Note 14,

Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method,

for more
    information on these equity investments. The Company does not
    believe that it will be required to perform under these
    guarantees.

In addition, GenConn has entered into turbine purchase
    agreements for the Devon and Middletown sites. NRG has issued
    guarantees for payment on its proportionate share of the unpaid
    amounts under each of these purchase agreements. Each of the
    guarantees will remain in place until such time as GenConn has
    obtained financing for each of the respective projects. As of
    December 31, 2008, NRG’s potential remaining
    obligation under the guarantees is $54 million in the
    aggregate.

The material indemnities, within the scope of FIN 45, are
    as follows:

Asset purchases and divestitures —

The purchase
    and sale agreements which govern NRG’s asset or share
    investments and divestitures customarily contain
    indemnifications of the transaction to third parties. The
    contracts indemnify the parties for liabilities incurred as a
    result of a breach of a representation or warranty by the
    indemnifying party, or as a result of a change in tax laws.
    These obligations generally have a discrete term and are
    intended to protect the parties against risks that are difficult
    to predict or estimate at the time of the transaction. In
    several cases, the contract limits the liability of the
    indemnifier. For those indemnities in which liability is capped,
    the maximum exposures range from $1 million to
    $300 million. NRG has no reason to believe that the Company
    currently has any material liability relating to such routine
    indemnification obligations.

Other indemnities —

Other indemnifications NRG
    has provided cover operational, tax, litigation and breaches of
    representations, warranties and covenants. NRG has also
    indemnified, on a routine basis in the ordinary course of
    business, consultants or other vendors who have provided
    services to the Company. NRG’s maximum potential exposure
    under these indemnifications can range from a specified dollar
    amount to an indeterminate amount, depending on the nature of
    the transaction. Total maximum potential exposure under these
    indemnifications is not estimable due to uncertainty as to
    whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved. NRG
    does not have any reason to believe that the Company will be
    required to make any material payments under these indemnity
    provisions.

Because many of the guarantees and indemnities NRG issues to
    third parties and affiliates do not limit the amount or duration
    of its obligations to perform under them, there exists a risk
    that the Company may have



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

obligations in excess of the amounts described above. For those
    guarantees and indemnities that do not limit the Company’s
    liability exposure, it may not be able to estimate what the
    Company’s liability would be, until a claim is made for
    payment or performance, due to the contingent nature of these
    contracts.

Note 26 — Jointly
    Owned Plants

Certain NRG subsidiaries own undivided interests in
    jointly-owned plants, described below. These plants are
    maintained and operated pursuant to their joint ownership
    participation and operating agreements. NRG is responsible for
    its subsidiaries’ share of operating costs and direct
    expense and includes its proportionate share of the facilities
    and related revenues and direct expenses in these jointly-owned
    plants in the corresponding balance sheet and income statement
    captions of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Subsequent to filing of NRG’s Quarterly Report on

Form 10-Q

for the period ended September 30, 2008, the Company
    identified a $78 million overstatement of revenues
    resulting from an error in the accounting for energy options for
    the three months ended September 30, 2008. There was no
    impact to the Company’s year-to-date cash flows or
    liquidity position. The impact on the September 30, 2008
    balance sheet was an understatement of the current derivative
    instruments valuation of $35 million and other current
    liabilities of $113 million. There was an insignificant
    impact on the 2007 results and 2008 first and second quarter
    statements of operations and thus, NRG is not revising the
    revenues reported in these previously issued interim financial
    statements. NRG determined that the revenue recognition practice
    used prior to September 30, 2008 resulted in the
    unintentional recognition of excess amortization of premiums
    during the earlier portion of the option contract terms. This
    excess was reversed upon termination of the options, resulting
    in no net misstatement over the life of the option. The interim
    periods however were subject to misstatement depending upon the
    volume and timing of option execution.

Although not material to the previously filed financial
    statements, the correction of the third quarter option revenue
    during the fourth quarter would have understated the fourth
    quarter operating revenues and income by

    much of its business through and derives much of its income from
    its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company’s ability to make

    subject to certain restrictions under the Company’s Peaker
    financing agreements, there are no restrictions on the ability
    of any of the guarantor subsidiaries to transfer funds to NRG.

    subsidiaries.

    guarantor subsidiaries and the non-guarantor subsidiaries in
    accordance with

    subsidiaries or non-guarantor subsidiaries operated as
    independent entities.

    company operations. Guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor
    subsidiaries of NRG are reported on an equity basis. For
