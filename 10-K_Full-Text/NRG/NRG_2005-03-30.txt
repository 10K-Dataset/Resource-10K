PART I

Item 1 —

Business

General

NRG Energy, Inc., or “NRG Energy”, the
“Company”, “we”, “our”, or
“us” is a wholesale power generation company,
primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of power
generation facilities, the transacting in and trading of fuel
and transportation services and the marketing and trading of
energy, capacity and related products in the United States and
internationally. We have a diverse portfolio of electric
generation facilities in terms of geography, fuel type and
dispatch levels. Our principal domestic generation assets
consist of a diversified mix of natural gas-, coal- and
oil-fired facilities, representing approximately 40%, 31% and
29% of our total domestic generation capacity, respectively. In
addition, 23% of our domestic generating facilities have dual-
or multiple-fuel capacity, which may allow plants to dispatch
with the lowest cost fuel option.

We seek to maximize operating income through the generation of
energy, marketing and trading of energy, capacity and ancillary
services into spot, intermediate and long-term markets and the
effective transacting in and trading of fuel supplies and
transportation-related services. We perform our own power
marketing (except with respect to our West Coast Power and Rocky
Road affiliates), which is focused on maximizing the value of
our North American and Australian assets through the pursuit of
asset-focused power and fuel marketing and trading activities in
the spot, intermediate and long-term markets. Our principal
objectives are the management and mitigation of commodity market
risk, the reduction of cash flow volatility over time, the
realization of the full market value of the asset base, and
adding incremental value by using market knowledge to
effectively trade positions associated with our asset portfolio.
Additionally, we work with markets, independent system operators
and regulators to promote market designs that provide adequate
long-term compensation for existing generation assets and to
attract the investment required to meet future generation needs.

As of December 31, 2004, we owned interests in 52 power
projects in five countries having an aggregate net generation
capacity of approximately 15,400 MW. Approximately
7,900 MW of our capacity consisted of merchant power plants
in the Northeast region of the United States. Certain of these
assets are located in transmission constrained areas, including
approximately 1,400 MW of “in-city” New York City
generation capacity and approximately 750 MW of southwest
Connecticut generation capacity. We also own approximately
2,500 MW of capacity in the South Central region of the
United States, with approximately 1,900 MW of that capacity
supported by long-term power purchase agreements.

As of December 31, 2004, our assets in the West Coast
region of the United States consisted of approximately
1,300 MW of capacity with the majority of such capacity
owned via our 50% interest in West Coast Power LLC, or West
Coast Power. Our assets in the West Coast region were supported
by a power purchase agreement with the California Department of
Water Resources that expired on December 31, 2004. One-year
term reliability must-run, or RMR, agreements with the
California Independent System Operator, or Cal ISO, for
approximately 568 MW in the San Diego area have been
renewed for 2005. On January 1, 2005, a new RMR agreement
for the 670 MW gross capacity of the West Coast Power El
Segundo generating facility became effective. In January 2005,
that generating facility entered into a tolling agreement for
its entire gross generating capacity of 670 MW commencing
May 1, 2005 and extending through December 31, 2005.
During the term of this agreement, the purchaser will be
entitled to primary energy dispatch right for the
facility’s generating capacity. The agreement is subject to
the amendment of the El Segundo RMR agreement to switch to RMR
Condition I and to otherwise allow the purchaser to exercise its
primary dispatch rights under this agreement while preserving
Cal ISO’s ability to call on the El Segundo facility as a
reliability resource under the RMR agreement, if necessary.
Approximately 265 MW of capacity at the Long Beach
generating facility was retired January 1, 2005.

We own approximately 1,600 MW of net generating capacity in
other regions of the U.S. We also own interests in plants
having a net generation capacity of approximately 2,100 MW
in various international



markets, including Australia, Europe and Brazil. We operate
substantially all of our generating assets, including the West
Coast Power plants.

We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation on May 29,
1992. In March 2004, our common stock was listed on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol “NRG”. Our
headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 211
Carnegie Center, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. Our telephone
number is (609) 524-4500. The address of our website is
www.nrgenergy.com. Our recent annual reports, quarterly reports,
current reports and other periodic filings are available free of
charge through our website. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines
and the charters of our Audit, Compensation and Governance and
Nominating Committees are also available on our website at
www.nrgenergy.com/investor/corpgov.htm. These charters are
available in print to any shareholder who requests them.

Strategy

We are a significant owner and operator of a diverse portfolio
of electric generation facilities. We are focused on owning,
operating and maximizing the value of our generation assets in
our core regions, which are the Northeast, South Central and
West Coast regions of the United States, as well as Australia.
Our two principal objectives are: (i) to maximize the
operating performance of our entire portfolio, and (ii) to
protect and enhance the market value of our physical and
contractual assets through the execution of asset-based risk
management, marketing and trading strategies within well-defined
risk and liquidity guidelines.

To achieve our principal objectives, we intend to pursue the
following strategies, among others:

•

Develop the assets in our core regions into integrated
    businesses well suited to serve the requirements of the
    load-serving entities in our core markets;

•

Reinvest our capital in our existing assets for reasons of
    repowering, expansion, environmental remediation, operating
    efficiency, reliability programs, greater fuel optionality,
    greater merit order diversity, enhanced portfolio effect or
    alternative use, among others; and

•

Where consistent with our “core region” strategy,
    pursue selective acquisitions to complement the assets and
    portfolios in our core regions.

From time to time we may also consider and undertake other
merger and acquisition transactions that are consistent with our
strategy. We continue to market our interest in our remaining
non-core assets. Thereafter, we have no current plans to market
actively any of our core assets, although our intention to
maximize over time the value of all of our assets could lead to
additional asset sales.

Competition

Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive,
commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants.
Many of our large competitors are facing restructuring,
bankruptcy or liquidation. Many U.S. markets have a glut of
generation capacity. New sources of capital have entered the
industry, including well-capitalized financial players seeking
to acquire assets at distressed prices. Regulatory bodies,
including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC,
regional independent system operators, state public utility
commissions and other regulatory participants are considering
significant changes to the structure of certain wholesale
utility markets.

Many companies in the regulated utility industry, with which the
wholesale power industry is closely linked, are also
restructuring or reviewing their strategies. Several of those
companies are discontinuing their unregulated activities,
seeking to divest their unregulated subsidiaries or attempting
to have their regulated subsidiaries acquire assets out of their
or other companies’ unregulated subsidiaries. This may lead
to increased competition between the regulated utilities and the
unregulated power producers within certain markets.



Competitive Strengths

We believe that we benefit from the following competitive
strengths:

Plant Diversity.

Our generation fleet in core regional
markets includes plants dispatched as baseload generation, on an
intermediate basis and during peak periods. Approximately
4,300 MWs of domestic baseload capacity provide stability
of cash flows, while 5,500 MWs of domestic peaking capacity
give us significant upside optionality. Our generation
facilities include a diversified fuel mix of natural gas, coal
and oil. A significant percentage of our core domestic
portfolio, approximately 31%, is fueled by coal, which is a
distinct advantage at a time of historically high natural gas
prices. We believe that our Huntley, Dunkirk, Big Cajun II
and Indian River coal-fired facilities will continue, for the
foreseeable future, to have competitive advantages in terms of
their marginal cost of production relative to the gas-fired
plants with which they compete. In addition, a significant
portion of our non-coal domestic generation facilities have dual
or multiple fuel capability, which allows most of these plants
to dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option. The volatility in
oil and gas prices versus the stability of low-sulfur western
coal prices creates opportunities for us because of our ability
to use low-sulfur coal in certain of our plants.

Locational Advantages.

Owning multiple power plants in a
particular market provides greater dispatch flexibility and
increases power marketing and trading opportunities. We have
achieved this goal to a certain extent in the Northeast (New
York, New England Power Pool, or NEPOOL, and Pennsylvania,
Jersey, Maryland Interconnection, or PJM) and South Central
(Entergy) markets.

Transmission constraints and other market factors give certain
of our power plants locational advantages over the competition.
For example, the Astoria and Arthur Kill plants serve the New
York City market. Competitors outside the city limits are at a
disadvantage because transmission constraints restrict the
importation of power into New York City, providing an advantage
to “in-city” generation physically located within city
limits. Construction of new power plants in New York City is
limited because of the difficulties in finding sites for new
plants, obtaining the necessary permits and arranging fuel
delivery. In California, our facilities are located in the Los
Angeles and San Diego load basins where, similar to New
York City, transmission constraints restrict the import of power
from remotely located plants.

In some locations, a facility’s advantage is enhanced by
the potential for repowering or site expansion or alternative
use. Certain Connecticut facilities, for example, have
attractive locations in transmission-constrained areas in
southern Connecticut. The El Segundo plant located in the west
Los Angeles load basin is well positioned to serve the needs of
that region well into the future. Our California facilities
utilize ocean water cooling, which gives them competitive
advantages, especially during water shortages in California, and
provides a competitive advantage in the potential siting of
desalination projects or for other alternative uses. We are
working to preserve our options to expand or repower these
facilities when economically justifiable.

Risk Mitigation.

As a wholesale generator, we are subject
to the risks associated with volatility in fuel and power
prices. We seek to mitigate these risks by managing a portfolio
of contractual relationships for power supply, fuel needs and
transportation services. We reduce spot price volatility
exposure via mid- and long-term contractual arrangements when
these markets economically justify such transactions. We plan to
trade around the contractual commitments consistent with our
market view in an effort to produce enhanced value from market
volatility.

Improved Financial Position.

As part of our
reorganization (discussed below), we eliminated approximately
$5.2 billion of corporate level bank and bond debt and
approximately $1.3 billion of additional claims and
additional disputes. Since January 1, 2004, we have
successfully sold select non-core assets and eliminated
approximately $989.9 million of consolidated debt related
to those assets. We continued managing our balance sheet
throughout 2004 with the tack-on bond offering in January and
the refinancing of our credit facility in December.

Reorganization

We were formed in 1992 as the non-utility subsidiary of Northern
States Power Company, or NSP, which was itself merged into New
Century Energies, Inc. to form Xcel Energy, Inc., or Xcel
Energy, in 2000. While



owned by NSP and later by Xcel Energy, we pursued an aggressive
high growth strategy focused on power plant acquisitions, high
leverage and aggressive development, including site development
and turbine orders. In 2002, a number of factors, most notably
the aggressive prices paid by us for our acquisitions of
turbines, development projects and plants, combined with the
overall downturn in the power generation industry, triggered a
series of credit rating downgrades which, in turn, precipitated
a severe liquidity crisis at the Company. From May 14 to
December 23, 2003, we and a number of our subsidiaries
undertook a comprehensive reorganization and restructuring under
chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. With the
exception of one subsidiary that remains in bankruptcy to effect
its liquidation, all NRG entities had emerged from
chapter 11 as of December 31, 2004.

As part of our reorganization, Xcel Energy relinquished its
ownership interest in us, and we became an independent public
company. We no longer have any material affiliation or
relationship with Xcel Energy. As part of the reorganization, we
eliminated approximately $5.2 billion of corporate level
bank and bond debt and approximately $1.3 billion of
additional claims and disputes by distributing a combination of
equity and $1.04 billion in cash to our unsecured creditors.

As part of our restructuring, on December 23, 2003, we used
the proceeds of a new $1.25 billion offering of 8% second
priority senior secured notes due 2013, and borrowings under a
new $1.45 billion secured credit facility, to retire
approximately $1.7 billion of project-level debt. In
January 2004, we used proceeds of a tack-on bond offering of the
same notes to repay $503.5 million of the outstanding
borrowings under the secured credit facility.

In 2004, we completed our post-confirmation bankruptcy
initiatives, including the liquidation of the chapter 11
subsidiaries deemed to be of no value to NRG Energy
(LSP-Nelson Energy LLC and NRG Nelson Turbines LLC); the
collection and distribution to creditors of amounts owing by our
pre-bankruptcy parent company, Xcel Energy, Inc., under the plan
of reorganization and related documents; and the settlement of
several large disputed claims. We are still litigating or
seeking to settle a number of unresolved disputed claims, for
which we believe we have established an adequate disputed claims
reserve pursuant to the NRG plan of reorganization. In all other
respects, the reorganization process was completed in 2004.

On December 24, 2004, we entered into an amendment and
restatement of our $1.45 billion seven-year secured credit
facility, recasting it as a $950 million seven-year secured
credit facility with more favorable covenants and interest
rates, scheduled to expire in December 2011. On
December 27, 2004, we completed the issuance of
$420 million of perpetual convertible preferred stock, and
used the proceeds to redeem $375 million of our 8% second
priority senior secured notes on February 4, 2005. In
January 2005 and in March 2005, we purchased $25 million
and $15.8 million, respectively, of the notes.

Fresh Start Reporting

As a result of our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted Fresh
Start Reporting, or Fresh Start. Under Fresh Start, our
confirmed enterprise value was allocated to our assets and
liabilities based on their respective fair values. See
Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operation — Reorganization and Emergence from
Bankruptcy for additional information. 2004 was our first
complete year following the adoption of Fresh Start.

In understanding our business, we believe that certain
performance metrics are particularly important. These are
industry statistics defined by the North American Electric
Reliability Council and are more fully described below:

Annual Equivalent Availability Factor, or EAF:

is the
total available hours a unit is available in a year minus the
sum of all partial outage events in a year converted to
equivalent hours (EH), where EH is partial megawatts lost
divided by unit net available capacity times hours of each
event, and the net of these hours is divided by hours in a year
to achieve EAF in percent.

Average gross heat rate:

We calculate the average heat
rate for our fossil-fired power plants by dividing (a) fuel
consumed in Btus by (b) KWh generated. The resultant heat
rate is a measure of fuel efficiency.

Net Capacity Factor:

Net actual generation divided by net
maximum capacity for the period hours.

Power Generation

Northeast Region

Facilities.

As of December 31, 2004, we owned
7,884 MW of net generation capacity in the Northeast region
of the United States, primarily in New York, Connecticut and
Delaware. These generation facilities are diversified in terms
of dispatch level (base-load, intermediate and peaking), fuel
type (coal, natural gas and oil) and customers.

The Northeast region’s power generation assets as of
December 31, 2004 are summarized in the table below.

Market Framework.

Our largest asset base is located in
the Northeast region. This asset base is comprised of
investments in generation facilities primarily located in the
physical control areas of the New York Independent System
Operator, or NYISO, the ISO New England, Inc., or ISO-NE, and
the Pennsylvania, Jersey, Maryland Interconnection, or PJM.

Although each of the three northeast ISOs and their respective
energy markets are functionally, administratively and
operationally independent, they all follow, to a certain extent,
the FERC-endorsed model for Standard Market Design, or SMD. The
physical power deliveries in these markets are financially
settled by Locational Marginal Prices, or LMPs, which reflect
the value of energy at a specific location at the specific



time it is delivered. This value is determined by an ISO-
administered auction process, which evaluates and selects the
least costly supplier offers or ‘bids’ to fill the
specific locational requirement. The ISO-sponsored LMP energy
marketplaces consist of two separate and characteristically
distinct settlement time frames. The first is a
security-constrained, financially firm, “Day Ahead”
unit commitment market. The second is a security-constrained,
financially settled, “Real-time” dispatch and
balancing market. In addition to energy delivery, the ISOs
manage secondary markets for installed capacity, ancillary
services and financial transmission rights.

Market Developments.

ISO-NE and NEPOOL operate a
centralized energy market with “Day-Ahead” and
“Real-time” energy markets. On August 23, 2004,
ISO-NE filed its proposal for locational installed capacity, or
LICAP, with FERC, which will decide the issue in a litigated
proceeding before an administrative law judge. Under the
proposal, separate capacity markets would be created for
distinct areas of New England, including southwest Connecticut.
While we view this proposal as a positive development, as it is
currently proposed it would not permit us to recover all of our
fixed costs. In response, we have submitted testimony which
includes an alternative proposal. FERC’s goal is to make a
decision on the precise terms of the NEPOOL LICAP market in the
fall of 2005, to be effective January 1, 2006.

On January 27, 2005, FERC approved the settlement of
various reliability must-run, or RMR, agreements between some of
our Connecticut generation and ISO-NE. Under the settlement, we
will receive monthly payments for the Devon 11-14, Montville and
Middletown facilities until December 31, 2005, the day
before the expected implementation date for LICAP. The
settlement also requires the payment of third party maintenance
expenses by NEPOOL participants incurred by Devon 11-14,
Middletown, Montville and Norwalk Harbor and are capped at
$30 million for the period April 1, 2004 through
December 31, 2005. The settlement also approves prior RMR
agreements involving Devon 7 and 8, both of which are on
deactivated reserves.

The NYISO operates an energy market that is structurally the
same as the New England energy markets. In April 2003, NYISO
implemented a demand curve in its capacity market and scarcity
pricing improvements in its energy market. The New York demand
curve eliminated the previous market structure’s tendency
to price capacity at either its cap (deficiency rate) or near
zero. FERC had previously approved the demand curve, but on
December 19, 2003, the Electricity Consumers Resource
Council appealed the FERC decision to the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On
December 3, 2004, NRG Energy and other suppliers filed a
brief in opposition. An adverse decision by the Court of Appeals
could require the elimination of the demand curve for the
capacity market, and would negatively impact the development of
LICAP in New England and PJM in addition to New York.

On January 7, 2005, NYISO filed proposed LICAP demand
curves for the following capacity years: 2005-06, 2006-07 and
2007-08. Under the NYISO proposal, the LICAP price for New York
City generation would be $126 per KW-year for the capacity
year 2006-07. On January 28, 2005, we filed a protest at
FERC asserting the LICAP price for this period should be at
least $140 per KW-year.

Our New York City generation is presently subject to price
mitigation in the installed capacity market. When the capacity
market is tight, the price we receive is limited by the
mitigation price. However when the New York City capacity market
is not tight, such as during the winter season, the proposed
demand curve price levels should increase our revenues from
capacity sales.

On January 25, 2005, FERC issued an order approving the PJM
proposal to increase the compensation for generators which are
located in load pockets and are mitigated at least 80% of their
running time. Specifically, when a generator would be subject to
mitigation, the generator would have the option of recovering
its variable cost plus $40 or a negotiated rate with PJM, based
on the facility’s going forward costs. If the generator
declines both options, it could file for an alternative rate
with FERC. FERC also substantially revised the exemption of
facilities built after 1996 from the energy price capping
mitigation rule. Several of our facilities are presently
mitigated 80% of the time and, therefore, are impacted by the
change.



South Central Region

Facilities.

As of December 31, 2004, we owned
2,469 MW of net generating capacity in the South Central
region of the United States. The South Central region’s
generating assets consist primarily of our power generation
facilities in New Roads, Louisiana, referred to as the Cajun
Facilities, and the Sterlington and Bayou Cove generating
facilities.

Our portfolio of plants in Louisiana comprises the third largest
generator in the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council/
Entergy, or SERC-Entergy region. Our primary assets are the
Cajun Facilities, which are primarily coal-fired assets
supported by long-term power purchase agreements with regional
cooperatives.

The South Central region’s power generation assets as of
December 31, 2004 are summarized in the table below.

*

We own 100% of Units 1 and 2 and 58% of Unit 3.

Market Framework.

Our South Central region’s assets
are located within the franchise territory of Entergy, a
vertically-integrated utility. Entergy performs the scheduling,
reserve and reliability functions that are administered by ISOs
in certain other regions of the United States and Canada. We
operate a North American Electric Reliability Council, or NERC,
certified-control area within the Entergy franchise territory,
which is comprised of our generating assets and our
cooperatives’ customer loads. In the South Central region,
including Entergy’s franchise territory, the energy market
is not a centralized market and it does not have an independent
system operator as is found in the northeast markets. All power
sales and purchases are consummated bilaterally between
individual counter-parties, and physically delivered either
within or across the physical control areas of the transmission
owners. Transacting counter-parties are required to reserve and
purchase transmission services from the intervening transmission
owners at their FERC-approved tariff rates. Included with these
transmission services are the reserve and ancillary costs.
Energy prices in the South Central region are determined and
agreed to in bilateral negotiations between representatives of
the transacting counter-parties, using market information
gleaned by the individual marketing agents arranging the
transactions.

Market Developments.

We have long-term “all
requirements” contracts with 11 Louisiana distribution
cooperatives, serving approximately 350,000 retail customers,
and long-term contracts with the Municipal Energy Agency of
Mississippi, South Mississippi Electric Power Association and
Southwestern Electric Power Company. With limited exceptions,
the all-requirements nature of certain of the power supply
agreements between Louisiana Generating and its cooperative
customers requires Louisiana Generating to serve future
expansion of those cooperative loads at existing contract rates.
Additionally, at times of maximum demand, our generating
facilities do not produce enough power to serve their customers,
and we purchase power in the market to make up the shortfall.

Entergy has filed an Independent Coordinator of Transmission, or
ICT, proposal at FERC and with the public service commissions of
the states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas. Entergy
states that this proposal will achieve greater oversight of its
transmission system operation and provide greater efficiency for
providing and pricing transmission service. On March 22,
2005, FERC approved the ICT proposal for a two-year period,
subject to certain conditions.

On December 17, 2004, FERC ordered that an investigation
and evidentiary hearing be held to determine whether Entergy is
providing access to its transmission system on a short-term
basis and in a just and



reasonable manner. On March 22, 2005, FERC suspended the
hearing until Entergy indicates whether it will accept the
FERC’s conditional approval of its ICT proposal. On
March 25, 2005, FERC permitted Entergy’s proposal
regarding reserving 2,900 MWs of import capacity on its
transmission system for emergency purposes to go into effect
subject to refund. The case was set for hearing, which was then
suspended pending settlement discussions.

In December 2004, we entered into a long-term coal transport
agreement with the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway
Company and affiliates of American Commercial Lines LLC to
deliver low sulfur coal to our Big Cajun II facility in New
Roads, Louisiana beginning April 1, 2005. In December 2004,
we also entered into coal purchase contracts extending through
2007. In March 2005, we entered into an agreement to purchase
23.75 tons of coal over a period of four years and nine
months from Buckskin Mining Company, or Buckskin. The coal will
be sourced from Buckskin’s mine in the Powder River Basin,
Wyoming, and will be used primarily in NRG Energy’s
coal-burning generation plants in the South Central region.

In August 2004, we entered into a contract to
purchase 1,540 aluminum railcars from Johnston America
Corporation to be used for the transportation of low sulfur coal
from Wyoming to NRG Energy’s coal burning generating
plants, including the Cajun Facilities. On February 18,
2005, we entered into a ten-year operating lease agreement with
GE Railcar Services Corporation, or GE, for the lease of 1,500
railcars and delivery commenced in February 2005. We have
assigned certain of our rights and obligations for 1,500
railcars under the purchase agreement with Johnston America to
GE. Accordingly, the railcars which we lease from GE under the
arrangement described above will be purchased by GE from
Johnston America in lieu of our purchase of those railcars.

West Coast Region

Facilities.

As of December 31, 2004, we owned
1,315 MW of net generating capacity in the West Coast
region, primarily in California and Nevada. Our West Coast
generation assets consist primarily of a 50% interest in West
Coast Power LLC, or West Coast Power. Effective January 1,
2005, the Long Beach Generating Station was permanently retired,
reducing our net generating capacity by 265 MW, to
1,050 MW. The ultimate disposition of the Long Beach plant
and property has yet to be determined. However, site demolition
and remediation costs, if required, are expected to approximate
the market value of the property. The Company has been
negotiating a sale of the Saguaro plant and closing is expected
to take place sometime during 2005.

In May 1999 we formed West Coast Power, along with Dynegy, Inc.,
to serve as the holding company for a portfolio of operating
companies that own generation assets in Southern California in
the California Independent System Operator, or Cal ISO, market.
This portfolio currently consists of the El Segundo
Generating Station, the Encina Generating Station and
13 combustion turbines in the San Diego area. Dynegy
provides power marketing and fuel procurement services to West
Coast Power, and we provide operations and management services.
On December 23, 2004, California Energy Commission, or CEC,
approved our application for a permit to repower the existing
El Segundo site and replace retired units 1 and 2 with
630 MW of new generation. On January 19, 2005, the CEC
voted unanimously to reconsider its December 23, 2004
decision to certify the repowering project. The reconsideration
hearing took place on February 2, 2005 and the permit was
approved by unanimous vote of the CEC. The reconsideration
extended the 30-day period in which parties may petition for
rehearing or seek judicial review to March 4, 2005. A
petition seeking review of the CEC final order was filed with
the California Supreme Court on March 14, 2005. We believe
this filing to be untimely.

Our West Coast Power assets were supported by a power purchase
agreement with the California Department of Water Resources that
expired on December 31, 2004. We do not anticipate that we
can replace that contract with one that has similar or more
attractive terms and conditions. One-year term RMR contracts
with Cal ISO for 576 MW of net owned capacity in the
San Diego area have been renewed for 2005. On
January 1, 2005, a new RMR agreement for the 670 MW
gross capacity of the West Coast Power El Segundo
generating facility became effective. In January 2005, that
generating facility entered into a tolling agreement for its
entire gross generating capacity of 670 MW commencing
May 1, 2005 and extending through



December 31, 2005. During the term of this agreement, the
purchaser will be entitled to primary energy dispatch right for
the facility’s generating capacity. The agreement is
subject to the amendment of the El Segundo
RMR agreement to switch to RMR Condition I and to
otherwise allow the purchaser to exercise its primary dispatch
rights under this agreement while preserving Cal ISO’s
ability to call on the El Segundo facility as a reliability
resource under the RMR agreement, if necessary. The RMR contract
on approximately 45 MW of generating capacity at Red Bluff
expired on December 31, 2004 and will not be renewed for
2005.

The West Coast region’s power generation assets as of
December 31, 2004 are summarized in the table below.

*

Retired effective January 1, 2005

Market Framework.

Our West Coast region assets are
primarily located within the control area of Cal ISO. Cal ISO
operates a financially settled “Real-time” balancing
market similar to the regional ISOs in the northeast area of the
U.S. Cal ISO’s “Day Ahead” energy markets
are similar to those in the South Central region, with all power
sales and purchases consummated bilaterally between individual
counter-parties and scheduled for physical delivery with Cal ISO.

Market Developments.

In California, Cal ISO continues
with its plan to move toward markets similar to PJM, NYISO and
ISO-NE, with its Market Redesign & Technology Upgrade,
or MRTU, formerly known as MD02 (market design 2002). The
proposed changes will re-establish a “real-time”
market and allow for multiple settlements. NRG Energy views this
as an improvement to the existing structure. In general, Cal ISO
is continuing along a path of small incremental changes, rather
than implementing a comprehensive market restructuring. The
effect of the new MRTU changes on NRG Energy cannot be
determined at this time.

In addition to the Cal ISO’s market changes, numerous
legislative initiatives in California create uncertainty and
risk for us. Most significantly, SB39XX mandates that the
California Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC, exercise
jurisdiction over the operating and maintenance procedures of
wholesale power generators including the setting of operating,
maintenance and logbook standards. On October 28, 2004, the
CPUC issued draft orders directing in-state utilities to meet a
15-17% reserve requirement by no later than June 2006, and
establishing a requirement that the utilities acquire 90% of
their capacity needs a year in advance. This order may present
opportunities for West Coast Power to enter into new bilateral
agreements.

In September 2004, Governor Schwarzenegger vetoed AB2006,
commonly referred to as the “re-regulation”
initiative, with a promise to the people of California to create
a competitive energy market in California that will attract the
investment capital required to meet growing load obligations.

Other North America

Facilities.

As of December 31, 2004, we owned
approximately 1,591 MW of net generating capacity in other
regions of the U.S.



Our Other North America power generation assets as of
December 31, 2004 are summarized in the table below.

Australia

Facilities.

As of December 31, 2004, we owned
approximately 1,390 MW of net generating capacity in
Australia. The Flinders assets are comprised of the Northern
Power Station which provides 520 MW, the refurbished
Playford Power Station, which provides 240 MW and the Leigh
Creek Coal Mine which supplies coal to both plants. The
1,680 MW Gladstone Plant, of which we own 37.5%, is
operated by NRG Energy.

Market Framework

The National Electricity Market operates across the
interconnected states of southern and eastern Australia. The
market represents a physical wholesale trading exchange based on
merit order generation dispatch and gross pool settlement,
within an energy-only market design. The physical market is
managed by National Electricity Market Management Co. Ltd.,
or NEMMCO, as the independent market operator, with spot prices
determined on a regional basis in half-hourly trading intervals,
capped at a maximum of AUD 10,000/ MWh. The majority of
wholesale trading occurs through bilateral financial
(hedge) contracts between counter-parties on a regional
basis, with some limited financial trading through exchange
traded futures.

The Flinders plant operates within the market as a merchant
portfolio. Northern Power Station (520 MW base load) and
Playford Power Station (240 MW mid merit) are the only
coal-fired units in South Australia. Their output, together with
the output of the gas fired Osborne Power Station (output
purchased under long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs)
supply over 40% of the state’s electricity. All output is
market traded, with revenue streams protected by hedge contracts
for a large proportion of forward output.

The output of Gladstone is fully contracted under long-term PPAs
to an adjacent aluminum smelter and a government entity that
trades its portion into the market.



Market Development

In late 2003, the governments spanning the National Electricity
Market embarked upon a series of reforms to address perceived
deficiencies in the governance and institutional structure of
the market. These reforms are proceeding under cooperative
legislation expected to be in operation by mid-2005, and include
the creation of a new national energy regulator and the
establishment of a more efficient process to change and
administer the rules governing the operation of the market.

These reforms are not intended to alter the operation or
fundamental design of the market, but are designed to streamline
the administration of the wholesale market, increase regulatory
certainty for investors, and improve rule change and
decision-making processes in both the electricity and gas
sectors.

Further policy announcements are expected in the near future in
relation to electricity transmission planning and regulation,
trading region boundary change arrangements, and funding
arrangements for the new institutional bodies.

Other International

Facilities.

Over the past decade, through our foreign
subsidiaries, we invested in international power generation
projects in Australia, Europe and Latin America. During 2002,
2003 and 2004, we sold international generation projects with an
aggregate total generating capacity of approximately
600 MW, 1,640 MW and 833 MW, respectively. As of
December 31, 2004, we had investments in power generation
projects located in the United Kingdom, Germany and Brazil with
approximately 768 MW of net generating capacity.

Our Other International power generation assets as of
December 31, 2004 are summarized in the table below.

Primarily a coal mining facility.

Alternative Energy and Services

We own alternative energy generation facilities through NEO
Corporation, or NEO, and through our NRG Resource Recovery
business division, which converts municipal solid waste, or MSW,
into refuse derived fuel suitable to burn in third party power
plants.

NEO Corporation.

NEO is a wholly-owned subsidiary that
was formed to develop power generation facilities ranging in
size from one to 49 MW in the United States. As of
December 31, 2004, NEO had 41 MW of net ownership
interests in 15 hydroelectric facilities and 98.6 MW
of net ownership interests in four distributed generation
facilities including 94 MW of gas-fired peaking engines in
California (referred to as the Red Bluff and Chowchilla
facilities and included in our summary of the West Coast
region). Certain of the assets owned by NEO are currently being
marketed. See “Significant Dispositions of Non-Strategic
Assets” under this Item 1 for more information.



Resource Recovery Facilities.

Our Resource Recovery
business is focused on owning and operating alternative
fuel/“green power” generation and fuels processing
projects. The alternative fuels currently processed and
combusted are municipal solid waste, urban wood waste (pallets,
clean construction debris, etc.), and non-recyclable waste paper
and compost. Our Resource Recovery business has municipal solid
waste processing capacity of approximately 2,800 tons per
day. Our Resource Recovery business owns and operates municipal
solid waste processing facilities in Minnesota, as well as NRG
Processing Solutions, including ten composting and biomass fuel
processing sites in Minnesota, three of which are permitted to
operate as municipal solid waste transfer stations.

Non-Generation

In addition to our traditional power generation facilities
discussed above, we have interests in district heating and
cooling systems and steam transmission operations through our
subsidiary, NRG Thermal LLC. NRG Thermal’s steam and
chilled water businesses have a steam and chilled water capacity
of approximately 1,225 megawatt thermal equivalents, or MWt.

As of December 31, 2004, NRG Thermal owned five district
heating and cooling systems in Minneapolis, Minnesota;
San Francisco, California; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and San Diego, California. These
systems provide steam heating to approximately
565 customers and chilled water to 90 customers. In
addition, NRG Thermal owns and operates three projects that
serve industrial/government customers with high-pressure steam
and hot water, an 88 MW combustion turbine peaking
generation facility and an 18 MW coal-fired cogeneration
facility in Dover, Delaware (included in the summary of the
Other North America region).



Our thermal and chilled water assets as of December 31,
2004 are summarized in the table below.

*

Thermal production and transmission capacity is based on 1,000
    Btus per pound of steam production or transmission capacity. The
    unit mmBtu is equal to one million Btus.

Energy Marketing

Our wholly-owned energy marketing subsidiary, NRG Power
Marketing, Inc., or PMI, began operations in 1998. PMI provides
a full range of energy management services for our domestic
generation facilities. These services are provided under
bilateral contracts or agreements pursuant to which PMI engages
in the sale,



purchase and trading of energy, capacity and ancillary services
from the facilities, transacts in and trades the fuel (coal, oil
and natural gas) and associated transportation, and manages and
trades the emission allowance credits for these facilities. A
significant responsibility of PMI is to recommend to senior
management commercial hedge transactions in an effort to manage
risk and to maximize earnings and cash flow for NRG Energy.
In addition, PMI provides all necessary ISO bidding, dispatch,
and transmission scheduling for the facilities. PMI also
utilizes its contractual arrangements with third parties to
procure fuel, to sell energy, capacity and ancillary services to
minimize administrative costs and burdens and reduce the
collateral requirements imposed by third party suppliers and
purchasers.

NRG Worldwide Operations

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, NRG Worldwide Operations, or NRG
Operations, provides operating and maintenance services to our
generation facilities. These services include providing
experienced personnel for the operation and administration of
each facility and oversight out of the corporate office to
balance resources, share expertise and best practices, and to
ensure the optimum utilization of resources available to the
facilities. In addition, NRG Operations provides overall
facilities management, strategic planning, and the development
and dissemination of consistent Company policies and practices
relating to operations.

Financial Information About Segments and Geographic Areas

For financial information on our operations on a geographical
and on a segment basis, see Item 15 —
Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Dispositions of Non-Strategic Assets

We continue to market our interest in our remaining non-core
assets. Since 2003, we sold or made arrangements to sell a
number of consolidated businesses and equity investments in an
effort to reduce our debt, improve liquidity and rationalize our
investments. Dispositions completed during 2004 are summarized
in the following chart:

Significant Customers

Reorganized NRG

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we derived
approximately 49.8% of our total revenues from majority-owned
operations from four customers: NYISO accounted for 28.5%, ISO
New England accounted for 9.1%, National Electricity Market
Management Co. Ltd (Australia) accounted for 6.8% and Vattenfall
Europe (Germany) accounted for 5.4%. We account for the revenues
attributable to NYISO and ISO-NE as



part of our North American power generation segment. We account
for the revenues attributable to National Electricity Market
Management and Vattenfall Europe as part of our International
segment. For the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003, we derived approximately 39.0% of our
total revenues from majority-owned operations from two
customers: NYISO accounted for 26.5% and ISO-NE accounted for
12.5%. ISO-NE and NYISO are ISOs or RTOs and are FERC-regulated
entities that administer a residual (spot) energy market
and manage transmission assets collectively under their
respective control to provide non-discriminatory access to the
transmission grid. The NYISO exercises operational control over
most of New York State’s transmission facilities. We
anticipate that NYISO will continue to be a significant customer
given the scale of our asset base in the NYISO control area.

Predecessor Company

For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003 and for the year ended December 31, 2002, sales to one
customer, NYISO, accounted for 33.4% and 26.0% of our total
revenues from majority-owned operations, respectively.

Seasonality and Price Volatility

Annual and quarterly operating results can be significantly
affected by weather and price volatility. Significant other
events, such as the demand for natural gas and relative levels
of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power
price volatility. We derive a majority of our annual revenues in
the months of May through September, when demand for electricity
is the highest in our North American markets. Further,
volatility is generally higher in the summer months due to the
effect of temperature variations. Our second most important
season is winter when volatility and price spikes in underlying
fuel prices have tended to drive seasonal electricity prices.
Issues related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly
uniform across our business segments.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

Our raw material requirements primarily include various forms of
fossil fuel, including oil, natural gas and coal. We obtain our
oil, natural gas and coal from multiple sources and availability
is generally not an issue, although localized shortages,
transportation availability and supplier financial stability
issues can and do occur. The prices of oil, natural gas and coal
are subject to macro- and micro-economic forces that can change
dramatically in both the short-term and the long-term. For
example, the price of natural gas was particularly volatile in
mid-January 2004 due to the extreme temperatures experienced in
the Northeast. Additionally, throughout 2004, oil prices were
extremely high due to the geo-political uncertainty in the
Middle East and increased demand by China and India. The total
cost of oil, natural gas and coal represented approximately
41.6%, 37.5%, 42.4% and 15.1% of our total operating costs and
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004, the periods
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 and
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, and for the
year ended December 31, 2002, respectively. Issues related
to the sources and availability of raw materials are fairly
uniform across our business segments.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, we had 2,644 employees,
approximately 555 of whom are employed directly by us and
approximately 2,089 of whom are employed by our wholly-owned
subsidiaries and affiliates. Approximately 1,011 employees are
covered by bargaining agreements. During 2004, we experienced no
significant labor stoppages or labor disputes at our facilities.

Federal Energy Regulation

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The FERC is an
independent agency that regulates the transmission and wholesale
sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority
of the Federal Power Act, or FPA. In addition, FERC determines
whether a generation facility qualifies for Exempt Wholesale
Generator, or EWG, status under Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, or PUHCA. FERC also



determines whether a generation facility meets the ownership and
technical criteria of a Qualifying Facility, or QF, under Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, or PURPA.

Federal Power Act.

The FPA gives FERC exclusive
rate-making jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and
transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. FERC
regulates the owners of facilities used for the wholesale sale
of electricity or transmission in interstate commerce as
“public utilities.” The FPA also gives FERC
jurisdiction to review certain transactions and numerous other
activities of public utilities. Our QFs are exempt from the
FERC’s FPA rate regulation.

Public utilities are required to obtain FERC’s acceptance
of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity.
Because our non-QF generating companies are selling electricity
in the wholesale market, such generating companies are deemed to
be public utilities for purposes of the FPA. FERC has granted
our generating and power marketing companies the authority to
sell electricity at market-based rates. Usually, the FERC’s
orders that grant our generating and power marketing companies
market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or
revise that authority if FERC subsequently determines that we
can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create
barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.
If our generating and power marketing companies were to lose
their market-based rate authority, such companies may be
required to obtain FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-service
rate schedule and may become subject to the accounting,
record-keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on
utilities with cost-based rate schedules.

In addition, the FPA gives FERC jurisdiction over a public
utility’s issuance of securities or assumption of
liabilities. However, FERC usually grants blanket approval for
future securities issuances or assumptions of liabilities to
entities with market-based rate authority. In the event that one
of our public utility generating companies were to lose its
market-based rate authority, our future securities issuances or
assumptions of liabilities could require prior approval of the
FERC.

The FPA also requires the FERC’s prior approval for the
transfer of control over assets subject to FERC’s
jurisdiction. FERC has jurisdiction over certain facilities used
to interconnect our generating projects to the transmission
grid, and over the filed rate schedules and tariffs of our EWG
generating projects and power marketing operating companies.
Thus, transferring these assets would require FERC approval.

In New England, New York, the Mid-Atlantic region, the Midwest
and California, FERC has approved independent system operators
or regional transmission organizations, or ISOs or RTOs. Most of
these ISOs or RTOs administer a wholesale centralized bid-based
spot market in their regions pursuant to tariffs approved by
FERC. These tariffs/market rules dictate how the day-ahead and
real-time markets operate and how entities with market-based
rates shall be compensated within those markets. The ISOs or
RTOs in these regions also control access to and the operation
of the transmission grid within their footprint. Outside of ISO
or RTO-controlled regions, we are allowed to sell energy at
market-based rates as determined by willing buyers and sellers.
Access to, pricing for, and operation of the transmission grid
in such regions is controlled by the local transmission owning
utility according to its Open Access Transmission Tariff
approved by FERC.

Public Utility Holding Company Act.

PUHCA defines as a
“holding company” any entity that owns, controls or
has the power to vote 10% or more of the outstanding voting
securities of a “public utility company.” Unless
exempt, a holding company is required to register with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and it and its
Subsidiaries (i.e., a company with 10% of its voting securities
held by the registered holding company) become subject to
extensive regulation. Registered holding companies under PUHCA
are required to limit their utility operations to a single,
integrated utility system and divest any other operations that
are not functionally related to the operation of the utility
system. In addition, a company that is a Subsidiary of a
registered holding company is subject to financial and
organizational regulation, including approval by the SEC of
certain financings and transactions. Domestic generating
facilities that qualify as QFs and/or that have obtained EWG
status from FERC are exempt from PUHCA. Each of our domestic
generating subsidiaries has been designated by FERC as an EWG or
is otherwise exempt from PUHCA because it is a QF under PURPA.
Because our generating subsidiaries have EWG or QF status, we do
not qualify as a “holding company” under PUHCA. We
will not be subject to regulation under PUHCA as long as
(a) we do not become a Subsidiary of another registered
holding company and (b) the projects in which we



have an interest (1) qualify as QFs under PURPA,
(2) obtain and maintain EWG status under Section 32 of
PUHCA, (3) obtain and maintain Foreign Utility Company, or
FUCO, status under Section 33 of PUHCA, or (4) are
subject to another exemption or waiver. If our projects were to
cease to be exempt and we were to become subject to SEC
regulation under PUHCA, it would be difficult for us to comply
with PUHCA absent a substantial corporate restructuring.

Regulatory Developments.

FERC is attempting to spur
deregulation of the wholesale markets by requiring transmission
owners to provide open, non-discriminatory access to electricity
markets and the transmission grid. In April 1996, FERC issued
Orders 888 and 889, which required all public utilities to file
“open access” transmission tariffs that give wholesale
generators, as well as other wholesale sellers and buyers of
electricity, access to transmission facilities on a
non-discriminatory basis. This led to the formation of the ISOs
described above. On December 20, 1999, FERC issued Order
2000, encouraging the creation of RTOs. On July 31, 2002,
FERC issued its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Standard
Market Design, or SMD. All three orders were intended to
eliminate market discrimination by incumbent vertically
integrated utilities and to provide for open access to the
transmission grid. The status of FERC’s RTO and SMD
initiatives is uncertain. On April 28, 2003, FERC issued a
white paper describing proposed changes to the proposed SMD
rulemaking that would, among other things, allow for more
regional differences. In addition, the Energy Bill pending
before Congress could restrict FERC’s ability to implement
these initiatives.

The full effect of these changes on us is uncertain at this
time, because in many parts of the United States it has not been
determined how entities will attempt to comply with FERC’s
initiatives. At this time, five ISOs have been approved and are
operational: ISO-NE in New England; the NYISO in New York; PJM
in the Mid-Atlantic region; the Midwest Independent System
Operation, or MISO, in the Central Midwest region; and the Cal
ISO in California. Three of these ISOs: PJM, MISO and ISO-NE,
have been found to also qualify as RTOs.

We are affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the
existing ISOs and RTOs. The ISOs and RTOs that oversee most of
the wholesale power markets have in the past imposed, and may in
the future continue to impose, price limitations and other
mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.
For example, ISO-NE, NYISO, PJM and Cal ISO have imposed price
limitations. These types of price limitations and other
regulatory mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of
our generation facilities that sell energy into the wholesale
power markets. In addition, the regulatory and legislative
changes that have recently been enacted in a number of states in
an effort to promote competition are novel and untested in many
respects. These new approaches to the sale of electric power
have very short operating histories, and it is not yet clear how
they will operate in times of market stress or pressure, given
the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long-term price
history in many of these markets and the imposition of price
limitations by independent system operators.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and
local environmental and safety laws and regulations in the
development, ownership, construction and operation of our
domestic and international projects. These laws and regulations
impose requirements on discharges of substances to the air,
water and land, the handling, storage and disposal of, and
exposure to, hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of
properties affected by pollutants. These laws and regulations
generally require that we obtain governmental permits and
approvals before construction or operation of a power plant
commences, and after completion, that our facilities operate in
compliance with those permits and applicable legal requirements.
We could also be held responsible under these laws for the
cleanup of pollutants released at our facilities or at off-site
locations where we may have sent wastes, even if the release or
off-site disposal was conducted in compliance with the law.

Environmental laws have become increasingly stringent over time,
particularly the regulation of air emissions from our plants.
Such laws generally require regular capital expenditures for
power plant upgrades, modifications and the installation of
certain pollution control equipment. In addition, regulatory
compliance for the construction of new facilities is a costly
and time-consuming process. Intricate and rapidly changing



environmental regulations may require major capital expenditures
for permitting and create a risk of expensive delays or material
impairment of project value if projects cannot function as
planned due to changing regulatory requirements or local
opposition. In all cases, we seek to reflect environmental
impacts and mitigants in every business decision we make, and by
doing so, strive to improve our competitive advantage by meeting
or exceeding environmental and safety requirements in the
management and operation of our assets.

It is not possible at this time to determine when or to what
extent additional facilities or modifications to existing or
planned facilities will be required as a result of potential
changes to environmental and safety laws and regulations,
regulatory interpretations or enforcement policies. In general,
future laws and regulations are expected to require the addition
of pollution control equipment or the imposition of certain
restrictions on our operations. We expect that future liability
under, or compliance with, environmental and safety requirements
could have a material effect on our operations or competitive
position.

Domestic Environmental Regulatory Matters

Power projects are subject to stringent environmental and safety
protection and land use requirements in the U.S. These laws
and regulations generally require lengthy and complex processes
to obtain licenses, permits and approvals from federal, state
and local agencies. If such laws and regulations become more
stringent and our facilities are not exempted from coverage, we
could be required to make extensive modifications to further
reduce potential environmental impacts.

We establish accruals where it is probable that we will incur
environmental costs under applicable law or contract and it is
possible to reasonably estimate those costs. We adjust the
accruals when new remediation or other environmental liability
responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become
estimable, or when current liability estimates are adjusted to
reflect new information or a change in the law.

U.S. Federal Environmental Initiatives

Several federal regulatory and legislative initiatives to
further limit and control pollutant emissions from fossil
fuel-fired combustion units are currently underway. Although
neither the exact impact of these initiatives nor their final
form is known at this time, all of our power plants will likely
be affected in some manner by the expected changes in federal
environmental laws and regulations. In Congress, legislation has
been proposed that would impose annual caps on U.S. power
plant emissions of nitrogen oxides, or NO

X

, sulfur
dioxide, or SO


, mercury and, in some instances,
carbon dioxide, or CO


.

In December 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
or USEPA, proposed rules governing mercury emissions from power
plants. On March 15, 2005, USEPA issued the Clean Air
Mercury Rule, or CAMR, to permanently cap and reduce mercury
emissions from coal-fired power plants. CAMR imposes limits on
mercury emissions from new and existing coal-fired plants and
creates a market-based cap-and-trade program that will reduce
nationwide utility emissions of mercury in two phases (2010 and
2018), to achieve an ultimate reduction level of approximately
70%. The cap-and-trade program for mercury is expected to be
structured like the federal Acid Rain Program, allowing
generators to decide in each particular case the most effective
means for their compliance (i.e., install control technologies
and/or purchase emissions allowances in the market). As there
has been significant debate on whether USEPA has authority to
regulate mercury emissions through the proposed cap-and-trade
mechanism (as opposed to a command-and-control requirement to
install “maximum achievable control technology”, or
MACT, on a unit basis), it is reasonable to expect that the new
rule may be subject to legal challenge. Each of our coal-fired
electric power plants will be subject to mercury regulation.
However, since the final rule has yet to be implemented by
individual states pursuant to state-specific legislation, it is
not possible to identify in detail how the final mercury rules
will affect our operations located in those states.
Nevertheless, we continue to actively review emerging mercury
monitoring and mitigation technologies and assess appropriate
options for the Company in future.

The USEPA has also proposed MACT standards for nickel from
oil-fired units. The proposed nickel rule would accept the use
of an electrostatic precipitator, or ESP, as the appropriate
MACT control, with an implementation date of three years after
rule promulgation. Eight of the Company’s oil-fired
generating units are not equipped with an ESP: Middletown
Unit 4, Montville Unit 6, Vienna and Encina Units 1-5.
While



USEPA’s final decision regarding nickel emissions from
oil-fired units is still pending, USEPA is reconsidering
whether, based on the scientific data, any new controls on
nickel emissions from oil-fired generators are in fact needed.
Given the current situation, we do not consider any material
expenditure for nickel emission mitigation by the Company to be
probable at this time.

The USEPA has finalized federal rules governing ozone season
NO

X

emissions across the eastern U.S. Current
ozone season rules are being implemented within two programs.
Restrictions exist in the Ozone Transport Region, or OTR,
through annual ozone seasons (May – September) and all
of the Company’s generating units located in the OTR are
included in this program (which was effective in 2003).
NO

X

allowance allocations are based on an equivalent
emissions rate of 0.15 lbs/MMBtu, with each OTR state managing
its own NO

X

Budget Program and specific rules for
allowance distribution. The second program, in effect from May
2004, is similar to the OTR program, and extends to states
within the Ozone Transport Assessment Group, or OTAG, region.
This restricts 2004 and subsequent ozone season NO

X

emissions in most states east of the Mississippi River. These
rules essentially require one NO

X

allowance to be
held for each ton of NO

X

emitted from fossil
fuel-fired stationary boilers, combustion turbines, or combined
cycle systems. NO

X

allowance allocation is similar to
the OTR and each of the Company’s facilities that is
subject to these rules has been allocated NO

X

emissions allowances. While the portfolio total is currently
sufficient to cover operations at these facilities, if at any
point allowances are insufficient for the anticipated operation
of each of these facilities, the Company must purchase
NO

X

allowances. Any need to purchase additional
NO

X

allowances could have a material adverse effect
on our operations.

On March 10, 2005, the USEPA announced the Clean Air
Interstate Rule, or CAIR, originally proposed in January 2004.
The new rule applies to 28 eastern states and the District of
Columbia and caps SO


and NO

X

emissions
from power plants in two phases: 2010 and 2015 for
SO


and 2009 and 2015 for NO

X

. CAIR will
reduce such emissions in aggregate by just over 70% in the case
of SO


and just under 70% in the case of
NO

X

and will apply to certain of the Company’s
power plants located in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Delaware (NO

X

only) and Louisiana. States must
achieve the required emission reductions using one of two
compliance options: (a) meet the state’s emission
budget by requiring power plants to participate in a
USEPA-administered interstate cap-and-trade system; or
(b) meet an individual state emissions budget through
measures selected by individual states. While the Company’s
current business plans include initiatives (for example, the
conversion of Huntley and Dunkirk to burn low sulfur coal) in
part to address the new emissions caps, until the final rule as
issued by USEPA is actually implemented by specific state
legislation, it is not possible to identify with greater
specificity the effect of CAIR on the Company.

In 2004, USEPA reproposed the 1999 Regional Haze Rule, designed
to improve air quality in national parks and wilderness areas.
This rule requires regional haze controls (by targeting
SO


and NO

X

emissions from sources
including power plants) through the installation of Best
Available Retrofit Technology, or BART, for certain sources put
into operation between 1962 and 1977. The so-called BART rule is
expected to be finalized in April 2005, with states required to
submit their implementation plans by 2008. It is likely that the
BART rule, if implemented, will affect many of the
Company’s facilities. However, it is also expected that
required actions taken for compliance with CAIR (when it is
fully implemented) and certain state initiatives will also
achieve compliance with the BART rule as currently proposed.

During the first quarter of 2002, USEPA proposed new rules
governing cooling water intake structures at existing power
facilities (the Phase II 316(b) Rules). These rules were
finalized in February 2004. The Phase II 316(b) Rules
specify certain location, design, construction, and capacity
standards for cooling water intake structures at existing power
plants using the largest amounts of cooling water. These rules
will require implementation of the Best Technology Available, or
BTA, for minimizing adverse environmental impacts unless a
facility shows that such standards would result in very high
costs or little environmental benefit. The
Phase II 316(b) Rules require the Company’s
facilities that withdraw water in amounts greater than
50 million gallons per day to submit certain surveys,
plans, operational measures, and restoration measures (with
wastewater permit applications or renewal applications) that
would minimize certain adverse environmental impacts of
impingement or entrainment. The Phase II 316(b) Rules
affect a number of the Company’s plants, specifically those
with once-through cooling systems. Compliance options include
the addition of control technology, modified operations,
restoration, or a combination of these, and are subject to a



comparative cost and cost/benefit justification. While we have
conducted a number of the requisite studies (and in one case
already budgeted to install BTA), until all the needed studies
throughout our fleet have been completed and consultations on
the results have occurred with USEPA (or its delegated state or
regional agencies), it is not possible to estimate the capital
costs that will be required for compliance with the
Phase II 316(b) Rules.

Federal legislation, such as the Clear Skies Act, or Clear
Skies, has been proposed that would impose annual caps on
U.S. power plant emissions of NO

X

,
SO


, mercury, and, in some instances, CO


.
Under Clear Skies, these caps would go into effect in two
phases: 2010 and 2016 for SO


; 2008 and 2016 for
NO

X

; and 2010 and 2016 for mercury, with the proposed
final reduction level in 2016 for SO


, NO

X

and mercury being approximately 70%. Clear Skies was first
proposed in 2002 and while the bill stalled in Senate Committee
on March 9, 2005, the Bush Administration continues to
support, and work with Congress to achieve, passage of Clear
Skies in 2005. Clear Skies overlaps to a significant degree with
the USEPA CAIR and CAMR, and would modify or supersede those
rules if enacted as federal legislation.

While the Bush Administration has publicly stated that it does
not support mandatory national restrictions on greenhouse gas,
or GHG, emissions, it supports a number of initiatives with
respect to voluntary reductions of “carbon intensity”
(a measure of carbon emissions per unit of GDP). A number of
members of the Senate and Congress continue to call for federal
GHG regulation and to propose legislation. Additionally, there
have been several petitions from states and other parties to
compel USEPA to regulate GHGs under the Clean Air Act, or CAA.
On September 3, 2003, USEPA denied a petition by
Massachusetts, Maine and Connecticut to require USEPA to
establish a National Ambient Air Quality Standard, or NAAQS, for
CO


. Since that time, twelve states and other
territorial entities have filed suit against USEPA asking the
Court to address whether USEPA has an existing obligation to
regulate GHGs under the CAA. Oral arguments in the case are
scheduled for April, 2005. Additionally, eight states and the
City of New York filed suit on July 21, 2004 against
American Electric Power Company, Southern Company, Tennessee
Valley Authority, Xcel Energy, Inc. and Cinergy Corporation,
alleged to be the nation’s five largest emitters of GHGs
and all of which are owners of electric generation. On the same
day, a similar complaint was filed in the same court against the
same defendants by the Natural Resources Defense Council on
behalf of certain special interest groups. In both cases, the
complaint seeks an injunction against each defendant forcing it
to abate its contribution to the “global warming
nuisance” by requiring it to cap its CO


emissions and then reduce them by a specified percentage each
year for at least a decade. The outcome of this litigation and
proposed legislation cannot be predicted. The Company’s
compliance costs with any mandated GHG reductions in the future
could be material.

Other federal initiatives that could affect the Company’s
generating facilities with respect to fine particulate matter
(PM2.5), and ozone are underway, with compliance implementation
timeframes expected from 2009.

Regional U.S. Regulatory Initiatives

Northeast Region.

Connecticut rules on air regulation
require certain reductions in emissions of SO


(in
two steps: 2002 and 2003). The Company’s Connecticut plants
have operated in compliance with both phases of the rule. The
Company also complies with Connecticut’s NO

X

emission rules (restricting the average, non-ozone season
NO

X

emission rate to 0.15 lbs/ MMBtu), through
selective firing of natural gas, use of selective non-catalytic
reduction, or SNCR, technology presently installed at the
Norwalk Harbor and Middletown Power Stations, improved
combustion controls, use of emission reduction credits, and
purchase of allowances. In 2002, the Connecticut legislature
passed a law further tightening air emission standards by
eliminating emissions credit purchases after January 1,
2005 as a means of meeting Department of Environmental
Protection, or DEP, regulatory standards for SO


emissions from older power plants. The Company plans to comply
with the legislation through the use of lower sulfur oil.

Massachusetts air regulations prescribe schedules under which
six existing coal-fired power plants in-state are required to
meet stringent emission limits for NO

X

,
SO


, mercury, and CO


. The state has
reserved the issue of control of carbon monoxide and particulate
matter emissions for future consideration. Consistent



with a permit to install natural gas reburn technology to meet
the NO

X

and SO


limits received in early
2003 from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection, or MADEP, the Company has implemented that
technology at Somerset station. On June 4, 2004, MADEP
issued its regulation on the control of mercury emissions. The
effect of this regulation is that starting October 1, 2006,
Somerset will be capped at 13.1 lbs/year of mercury and as
of January 1, 2008, Somerset must achieve a reduction in
its mercury inlet-to-outlet concentration of 85%. The Company
plans to meet the requirements through the management of its
fuels, and the use of early and off-site reduction credits.
Additionally, the Company has entered into an agreement with
MADEP to retire or repower the Somerset station by the end of
2009. The Company is currently considering its options with
respect to how it will address MADEP’s CO


emission standards; part of this analysis depends upon the
outcome of the model rule process currently underway for the
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, discussed below.

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, or
NYSDEC, rules reducing allowable SO


and
NO

X

emissions from large, fossil-fuel-fired
combustion units in New York State became effective October
2004. The reductions are achieved through an allowance-based
cap-and-trade program that affects only New York sources.
Specifically, New York electric generators have to reduce
SO


emissions to 25% below the levels allowed in the
federal Acid Rain Program starting January 2005 and 50% below
the levels allowed by federal Acid Rain Program starting in
January 2008. Under this Acid Rain Deposition Program, or ADRP,
electric generators also have to meet the ozone season
NO

X

emissions limit of 0.15 lbs/MMBtu
year-round, starting October 2004. The Company’s strategy
for complying with the ADRP is to generate early reductions of
SO


and NO

X

emissions associated with fuel
switching and use such reductions to extend the timeframe for
implementing technological controls, which could ultimately
include the addition of flue gas desulfurization, or FGD, and
selective catalytic reduction, or SCR, equipment. On
January 11, 2005, the Company reached an agreement with the
State of New York and the NYSDEC in connection with voluntary
emissions reductions at the Huntley and Dunkirk facilities, as
discussed in Item 3 — Legal Proceedings. The
Company does not anticipate that any material capital
expenditures, beyond those already planned, will be required for
our Huntley and Dunkirk plants to meet the current compliance
standards in New York (including under the recent settlement)
through the end of the decade.

While no rules affecting the Company’s existing facilities
have been formally proposed, Delaware has foreshadowed the
development of MACT-comparable standards for SO


,
NO

X

and mercury. Delaware is considering such
rule-making based on recent determinations that portions of the
state are in non-attainment for NAAQS for fine particulates, or
PM2.5, and all of the state is in non-attainment for the NAAQS
for 8-Hour Ozone. The Company is evaluating voluntary emissions
reductions opportunities which may include blending low sulfur
western coals. While Delaware has not yet issued a proposed
rule, the Company is currently participating as a stakeholder in
such policy-making efforts along with the Governor’s Energy
Task Force, legislators, the PSC and the Delaware Department of
Natural Resources and Environmental Control, or DNREC. Further,
Delaware has begun rule-making in regard to developing emissions
standards for small combustion turbines and distributive
generation sources and implementing USEPA’s New Source
Review, or NSR, revisions. In addition to air emission
initiatives, Delaware has also established Total Maximum Daily
Loading, or TMDL, standards for temperature in its watersheds
and intends to establish one for mercury as well. The Company
continues to participate in these developments and has filed
comments with the relevant agencies.

In July 2003, nine northeastern states announced a regional
initiative to establish a cap-and-trade GHG program for electric
generators, referred to as the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative, or RGGI. The model RGGI rule is to be announced in
2005, with an estimate of two to three years for participating
states to finalize implementing regulations. A proposed level of
the RGGI cap has not been determined at this time. If
implemented, our plants in New York, Delaware, Massachusetts,
and Connecticut may be affected and our compliance costs with
any mandated GHG reductions in the future could be material.

The Ozone Transport Commission, or OTC, was established by
Congress and governs ozone and the NO

X

budget program
in certain eastern states, including Massachusetts, Connecticut,
New York and Delaware. In January 2005, the OTC stepped up its
efforts to develop a multi-pollutant regime (SO


,
NO

X

, mercury and CO


) that is expected to
be completed by mid-2006 (with individual state implementation to



follow), particularly if Clear Skies does not eventuate in 2005
or CAIR is perceived to be lenient. The Company continues to be
engaged in the OTC stakeholder process. While it is not possible
to predict the outcome of this regional legislative effort, to
the extent that the OTC seeks to effect emissions requirements
that are more stringent than currently proposed or existing
regimes (including the recently reached New York settlement),
the Company could be materially impacted.

South Central Region.

The Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality, or LADEQ, has promulgated State
Implementation Plan revisions to bring the Baton Rouge ozone
non-attainment area into compliance with applicable NAAQS. The
Company participated in development of the revisions, which
require the reduction of NO

X

emissions at the
gas-fired Big Cajun I Power Station and coal-fired Big
Cajun II Power Station to 0.1 lbs/ MMBtu and 0.21 lbs/
MMBtu NO

X

, respectively (both based on heat input).
This revision of the Louisiana air rules would constitute a
change-in-law covered by agreement between Louisiana Generating
LLC and the electric cooperatives (power offtakers) allowing the
costs of added combustion controls to be passed through to the
cooperatives. The capital cost of combustion controls required
at the Big Cajun II Generating Station to meet the
state’s NO

X

regulations will total about
$10.0 million for Unit 1 and will be undertaken in
2005. Units 2 and 3 have already made such changes.

In the 1990s, the USEPA commenced an industry-wide investigation
of coal-fired electric generators to determine compliance with
environmental requirements under the CAA associated with
repairs, maintenance, modifications and operational changes made
to the facilities over the years. USEPA focused on whether the
changes were subject to NSR regulations which require companies
to obtain permits before making major modifications to their
facilities and if deemed necessary, install control equipment to
reduce air emissions. As a result of this ongoing investigation
USEPA and several states have filed suits against a number of
coal-fired power plants in mid-western and southern states
alleging violations of the CAA NSR requirements. The
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio
issued a decision in August 2003 finding Ohio Edison Company in
violation of the NSR provisions of the CAA. In United
States v. Duke Energy Company, however, the
U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North
Carolina rejected the USEPA’s interpretation, concluding
that the exclusion for routine maintenance should be defined
relative to what is routine for the particular industry, not
what is routine for the particular unit at issue. On
October 27, 2003, the USEPA’s NSR rule on routine
maintenance was published in the Federal Register. The new
regulations, which are not retroactive, would establish an
equipment replacement cost threshold of 20% for determining when
major NSR requirements are triggered. An appeal opposing the
rule was filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals. The
effective date of the rule has been delayed pending review. In
June 2004, the USEPA filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit from the decision in the Duke
Energy case which is currently being heard with a ruling
expected by summer 2005.

On January 27, 2004, Louisiana Generating, LLC and Big
Cajun II received a request for information under
Section 114 of the CAA from USEPA seeking information
primarily related to physical changes made at Big Cajun II.
Throughout 2004 Louisiana Generating, LLC and Big Cajun II
submitted several responses to the USEPA’s follow-up
requests. On February 15, 2005, we received a Notice of
Violation, or NOV, alleging violations of the NSR provisions of
the CAA at Big Cajun 2 Units 1 and 2 from 1998 through the NOV
date. Given the preliminary stage of this NOV process, the
Company cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time,
but it is actively engaged with USEPA to address these issues.

West Coast Region.

The El Segundo Generating Station is
regulated by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, or
SCAQMD. Before its retirement as of January 1, 2005, the
Long Beach Generating Station was also regulated by SCAQMD.
SCAQMD approved amendments to its Regional Clean Air Incentives
Market, or RECLAIM, NO

X

regulations on
January 7, 2005. RECLAIM is a regional emission-trading
program targeting NO

X

reductions to achieve state and
federal ambient air quality standards for ozone. Among other
changes, the amendments reduce the NO

X

RECLAIM
Trading Credit, or RTC, holdings of El Segundo Power, LLC
and Long Beach Generation LLC facilities by certain amounts.
Notwithstanding these amendments, retained RTCs are expected to
be sufficient to operate El Segundo Units 3 and 4 as
high as 100% capacity factor.



Domestic Site Remediation Matters

Under certain federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of any
facility, including an electric generating facility, may be
required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened
releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products
at the facility. We may also be held liable to a governmental
entity or to third parties for property damage; personal injury
and investigation and remediation costs incurred by the party in
connection with hazardous material releases or threatened
releases. These laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, as
amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of
1986, or SARA, impose liability without regard to whether the
owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous
substances, and courts have interpreted liability under such
laws to be strict (without fault), and joint and several. The
cost of investigation, remediation or removal of any hazardous
or toxic substances or petroleum products could be substantial.
Although we have been involved in on-site contamination matters,
to date, we have not been named as a potentially responsible
party with respect to any off-site waste disposal matter.

Northeast Region.

Ash is produced as a by-product of coal
combustion at the Dunkirk, Huntley, Indian River and Somerset
Generating Stations. The Company attempts to direct its coal ash
to beneficial uses. Even so, significant amounts of ash are
landfilled. At Dunkirk and Huntley ash is disposed of at
landfills owned and operated by the Company and it maintains
financial assurance to cover costs associated with landfill
closure, post-closure care and monitoring activities. On
April 30, 2003, the Company funded a trust in the amount of
approximately $5.9 million to provide such financial
assurance. The Company is also responsible for the costs
associated with closure, post-closure care and monitoring of the
ash landfill owned and operated by the Company at the Indian
River facility. Financial assurance to provide for closure and
post-closure costs at that location is currently maintained by a
trust fund collateralized in the amount of approximately
$6.7 million. The Company seeks to commence a project to
utilize a quarter of its ash production in 2005 for beneficial
local use. Additionally, the Company is working with DNREC to
modify current landfill slope design to gain significant
additional capacity at the existing landfill, thus delaying
pending closure and expansion of the landfill. The Company must
also maintain financial assurance for closing interim status
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, facilities at
the Devon, Middletown, Montville and Norwalk Harbor Generating
Stations. On April 30, 2003, the Company funded a trust in
the amount of $1.5 million to provide RCRA financial
assurance.

The Company inherited historical clean-up liabilities when it
acquired the Somerset, Devon, Middletown, Montville, Norwalk
Harbor, Arthur Kill and Astoria Generating Stations. During
installation of a sound wall at Somerset Station in 2003, oil
contaminated soil was encountered. The Company has delineated
the general extent of contamination, determined it to be
minimal, and has placed an activity use limitation on that
section of the property. Site contamination liabilities arising
under the Connecticut Transfer Act at the Devon, Middletown,
Montville and Norwalk Harbor Stations have been identified. The
Company has proposed a remedial action plan to be implemented
over the next two to eight years (depending on the station) to
address historical coal ash contamination at the facilities. The
total estimated cost of this remedial action plan is not
expected to exceed $1.5 million. Remedial obligations at
the Arthur Kill generating station have been established in
discussions between the Company and the NYSDEC and are estimated
to cost between $1 million and $2 million. Remedial
investigations continue at the Astoria generating station with
long-term clean-up liability expected to be within the range of
$2.5 million to $4.3 million. While installing
groundwater-monitoring wells on the Astoria site to track
remediation of a historical fuel oil spill, the drilling
contractor encountered deposits of coal tar in two borings. The
Company reported the coal tar discovery to the NYSDEC in 2003
and delineated the extent of this contamination. The Company may
also be required to remediate the coal tar contamination and/or
record a deed restriction on the property if significant
contamination is to remain in place.

The Company has been put on notice that the prior owner of the
Huntley, Dunkirk and Oswego plants is seeking indemnification
and defense in connection with several lawsuits alleging
liability for damages to persons allegedly exposed to
asbestos-containing materials at the plants. The prior owner
alleges that the Company is liable by the terms of the Asset
Sales Agreements pursuant to which the Company acquired the



plants, which allegations are disputed. To date, the prior owner
has not filed suit against the Company with respect to its claim
for indemnification with respect to these cases.

South Central Region.

Liabilities associated with
closure, post-closure care and monitoring of the ash ponds owned
and operated at the Big Cajun II Generating Station are
addressed through the use of a trust fund maintained by the
Company. The value of the trust fund is approximately
$5.0 million and the Company is making annual payments to
the fund in the amount of approximately $116,000.

West Coast Region.

The Asset Purchase Agreements for the
Long Beach, El Segundo, Encina, and San Diego gas
turbine generating facilities provide that Southern California
Edison, or SCE, and San Diego Gas & Electric, or
SDG&E, retain liability, and indemnify the Company, for
existing soil and groundwater contamination that exceeds
remedial thresholds in place at the time of closing. The Company
and its business partner conducted Phase I and
Phase II Environmental Site Assessments at each of these
sites for purposes of identifying such existing contamination
and provided the results to the sellers. SCE and SDG&E have
agreed to address contamination identified by these studies and
are undertaking corrective action at the Encina and
San Diego gas turbine generating sites. Spills and releases
of various substances have occurred at these sites since the
Company established the historical baseline, all of which have
been, or will be, completely remediated. An oil leak in 2002
from underground piping at the El Segundo Generating
Station contaminated soils adjacent to and underneath the
Unit 1 and 2 powerhouse. The Company excavated and disposed
of contaminated soils that could be removed in accordance with
existing laws. Following the Company’s formal request, the
Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, or LARWQCB,
will allow contaminated soils to remain underneath the building
foundation until the building is demolished.

A diesel fuel spill to on-site surface containment occurred at
the Cabrillo Power II LLC Kearny Combustion Turbine
facility (San Diego) in February 2003. Emergency response
and subsequent remediation activities were completed.
Confirmation sampling for the site was completed in 2004 and
submitted to the San Diego County Department of
Environmental Health. Three San Diego Combustion Turbine
facilities, formerly operating pursuant to land leases with the
U.S. Navy, are currently being decommissioned with
equipment being removed from the sites and remediation
activities occurring where necessary. All remedial activities
are being completed pursuant to the requirements of the
U.S. Navy and the San Diego County Department of
Environmental Health. Remediation activities were completed in
2004 at the Naval Training Center and North Island facilities.
At the 32nd Street Naval Station facility, additional
contamination delineation is necessary and additional
unquantified remediation in inaccessible areas may be required
in the future.

International Environmental Matters

Most of the foreign countries in which we own or may acquire or
develop independent power projects have environmental and safety
laws or regulations relating to the ownership or operation of
electric power generation facilities. These laws and
regulations, like in the U.S., are constantly evolving, and have
a significant impact on international wholesale power producers.
In particular, our international power generation facilities
will likely be affected by emissions limitations and operational
requirements imposed by the Kyoto Protocol, which is an
international treaty related to greenhouse gas emissions which
entered into force on February 16, 2005, and country-based
restrictions pertaining to global climate change concerns.

We retain appropriate advisors in foreign countries and seek to
design our international asset management strategy to comply
with each country’s environmental and safety laws and
regulations. There can be no assurance that changes in such laws
or regulations will not adversely effect our international
operations.

Australia.

With respect to Australia, climate change is
considered a long-term issue (e.g. 2010 and beyond) and the
Australian government’s response to date has included a
number of initiatives, all of which have had no impact or
minimal impact on the Company’s operations. The Australian
government has stated that Australia will achieve its Kyoto
Protocol target of 8% below 1990 greenhouse gas emission levels
for the 2008 to 2012 reporting period but that Australia will
not ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Each Australian state government
is considering implementing a number of climate change
initiatives that will vary considerably state to state.



The asset purchase documentation for the NRG Flinders assets in
South Australia provides protections to buyer with respect to
historical soil and ground water contamination. Although NRG
Flinders has some ongoing obligations with respect to historic
site contamination management at Augusta Power Station,
Clause 5 of the Environment Compliance Agreement between
the South Australian Minister for Environment and Heritage and
NRG Flinders dated September 20, 2000, referred to as the
EC Agreement, removed any obligation for clean-up or
remediation of existing contamination.

While new legislation on contamination is being introduced in
South Australia, with particular emphasis on groundwater
contamination (regardless of the existing quality of the
groundwater), the Company considers it unlikely that any of the
proposed amendments will materially negatively impact NRG
Flinders’ operations. Specifically, despite the proposed
“Soil Contamination Amendments to the Environment
Protection Act 1993”, Flinders will not be obligated to
take any action to clean up or remediate any historical
groundwater contamination caused by disposal of ash as a
seawater slurry to the ash ponds by virtue of the
EC Agreement (referenced above).

NRG Flinders disposes of ash to slurry ponds at Port Augusta in
South Australia. At the end of life of the power station, NRG
Flinders has an obligation to remediate these ponds in
accordance with a plan accepted by the South Australian EPA and
confirmed in the EC Agreement. The estimated cost of
remediation according to the Plan is AUD 1.7 million. There
is no timeline associated with the obligation but the
EC Agreement extends to 2025. Under these arrangements,
required remediation relates to surface remediation and does not
entail any groundwater remediation.

A number of other changes in South Australian legislation are
proposed; for example a new Water Quality Policy, which may have
some minor implications for the Company’s operations (e.g.,
especially mine operations). The Company continues to be
involved in the legislative stakeholder process and does not
expect the proposed amendments to have a materially adverse
effect on its assets or operations.

MIBRAG/ Schkopau, Germany.

The Company’s facilities
in Germany are likely to be impacted by evolving emissions
limitations imposed as a result of the ratification of the Kyoto
Protocol. The Company expects that CO


emissions
trading will begin in Germany in 2005. Allocations of allowances
have now been made by the government, but are being challenged
by most recipients. Irrespective of the final allocation
amounts, the Company does not expect the CO


trading
program to be a material constraint on its business in Germany.
In addition, changes to the German Emission Control Directive
will result in lower NO

X

emission limits for plants
firing conventional fuels (Section 13 of the Directive) and
co-firing waste products (Section 17 of the Directive). The
new regulations will require the Mumsdorf and Deuben Power
stations to install additional controls to reduce NO

X

emissions in 2006.

The European Union’s Groundwater Directive and Mine
Wastewater Management Directive are in the rule-making stage
with the final outcome still under debate. Given the uncertainty
regarding the possible outcome of the debate on these
directives, we cannot quantify at this time the possible effect
such requirements would have on our future coal mining
operations in Germany.

A new law specifically dealing with the relocation of residents
of Heuersdorf in the path of the mining plan was enacted by the
legislature of Saxony in 2004 and there are numerous potential
court challenges still outstanding in this process. We cannot
predict the outcome of these actions at this time. MIBRAG
continues its political and legal work in an effort to obtain a
favorable resolution.

The supply contracts under which MIBRAG mines lignite from the
Profen mine expire on December 31, 2021. The contracts
under which MIBRAG mines lignite from the Schleenhain mine
expire in 2041. At the end of each mine’s productive
lifetime, MIBRAG will be required to reclaim certain areas.
MIBRAG accrues for these eventual expenses and estimates the
cost of the final reclamation to approach

€

175 million
in the instance of the Schleenhain mine and

€

132 million
for Profen.

Enfield Energy Centre Limited, United Kingdom.

The first
phase of Europe’s CO


emissions trading scheme,
or EU ETS, beginning in 2005, also affects our assets in the
U.K. Participants will be required to surrender emissions
allowances equal to the amount of CO


they have
emitted in each year of the scheme. Allowances will be tradable
and a market has already developed in this product. For the U.K.
it is not yet



possible to quantify the possible effect of this scheme on our
operations because final installation level details for the
scheme have yet to be released. The second phase of the program
will run between 2008 and 2012 and may be extended to cover
other GHGs. Additionally, the integrated pollution prevention
and control directive, or IPPC, which sets out a framework for
the environmental regulation of industrial activities, will be
implemented in March 2006. As Enfield Energy Centre is a latest
design combined cycle gas turbine, implementing this directive
is not expected to require any major changes or expenditures.

Risks Related to NRG Energy, Inc.

Future decreases in gas prices may adversely impact our
    financial performance.

Certain of our facilities, particularly our coal generation
assets, are currently benefiting from higher electricity prices
in their respective markets as a result of high gas prices
compared to historical levels. Gas-fired facilities set the
marginal cost of energy in most of our domestic markets. A
decrease in gas prices may lead to a corresponding decrease in
electricity prices in these markets, which could materially and
adversely impact our financial performance.

Our revenues are unpredictable because most of our power
    generation facilities operate, wholly or partially, without
    long-term power purchase agreements. Further, because wholesale
    power prices are subject to significant volatility, the revenues
    that we generate are subject to significant fluctuations.

Most of our facilities operate as “merchant”
facilities without long-term agreements. An oversupply of
generating capacity has depressed wholesale power prices in many
regions of the country and increased the difficulty of obtaining
long-term contracts. Without the benefit of long-term power
purchase agreements, we cannot be sure that we will be able to
sell any or all of the power generated by our facilities at
commercially attractive rates or that our facilities will be
able to operate profitably. This could lead to future
impairments of our property, plant and equipment or to the
closing of certain of our facilities resulting in economic
losses and liabilities.

We sell all or a portion of the energy, capacity and other
products from many of our facilities to wholesale power markets,
including energy markets operated by independent system
operators, or ISOs, or regional transmission organizations, or
RTOs. The prices of energy products in those markets are
influenced by many factors outside of our control, including
fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand,
weather, economic conditions and the rules, regulations and
actions of the ISOs or RTOs and state and federal regulators. In
addition, unlike most other commodities, electric power can only
be stored on a very limited basis and generally must be produced
concurrently with its use. As a result, the wholesale power
markets are subject to significant and unpredictable price
fluctuations over relatively short periods.

Competition in wholesale power markets may have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations and cash
    flows.

We have numerous competitors in all aspects of our business, and
additional competitors may enter the industry. Our wholesale
energy operations compete with other providers of electric
energy in the procurement of fuel and transportation services,
and the sale of capacity, energy and related products. In order
to successfully compete, we seek to aggregate fuel supplies at
competitive prices from different sources and locations and to
efficiently utilize transportation services from third-party
pipelines, railways and other fuel transporters and transmission
services from electric utilities.

We also compete against other energy merchants on the basis of
our relative skills, financial position and access to credit
sources. Energy customers, wholesale energy suppliers and
transporters often seek financial guarantees and other
assurances that their energy contracts will be satisfied. As a
result, our business is constrained by our liquidity, our access
to credit and the reduction in market liquidity. Other companies
with which we compete may have greater resources in these areas.

Other factors may contribute to increased competition in
wholesale power markets. The future of the wholesale power
generation industry is unpredictable, but may include
consolidation within the industry, the



sale, bankruptcy or liquidation of certain competitors, the
re-regulation of certain markets or a long-term reduction in new
investment into the industry. New capital and competitors have
entered the industry in the last three years, including
financial investors who perceive that asset values may have
bottomed out at levels below their true replacement value. A
number of generation facilities in the United States are now in
the hands of lenders. Under any scenario, we anticipate that we
will continue to face competition from numerous companies in the
industry. We anticipate that FERC will continue its efforts to
facilitate the competitive energy marketplace throughout the
country on several fronts but particularly by encouraging
utilities to voluntarily participate in RTOs or ISOs.

Many companies in the regulated utility industry, with which the
wholesale power industry is closely linked, are also
restructuring or reviewing their strategies. Several of those
companies are discontinuing their unregulated activities,
seeking to divest their unregulated subsidiaries or attempting
to have their regulated subsidiaries acquire assets out of their
or other companies’ unregulated subsidiaries. This may lead
to increased competition between the regulated utilities and the
unregulated power producers within certain markets.

A substantial portion of our historical cash flow has been
    derived from a CDWR contract in California and we do not expect
    to be able to enter into comparable agreements beyond
    2004.

In March 2001, certain affiliates of West Coast Power entered
into a contract with the California Department of Water
Resources, or CDWR, pursuant to which the affiliates agreed to
sell up to 2,300 MW from January 1, 2002 through
December 31, 2004, any of which may be resold by the CDWR
to utilities such as Southern California Edison Company,
PG&E Corp. and San Diego Gas and Electric Company. This
contract contributed $108.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 and $102.6 million for the full year
2003 to our reported equity earnings in West Coast Power, which
were decreased by the non-cash impact of fresh start accounting
of $115.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
and $8.8 million for the period December 6, 2003
through December 31, 2003. West Coast Power made
distributions to NRG Energy of $114.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004 and $122.2 million during
calendar year 2003. The contract and the corresponding earnings
and cash flow terminated on December 31, 2004. The CDWR
contract accounted for a majority of West Coast Power’s
revenues during these periods. Beginning January 2005, all of
the West Coast Power assets have been negotiated and will
operate under reliability must-run, or RMR, agreements. In
January 2005, the El Segundo generating facility entered into a
tolling arrangement for its entire gross generating capacity of
670 MW commencing May 1, 2005 and extending through
December 31, 2005. During the term of this agreement, the
purchaser will be entitled to primary energy dispatch rights for
the facility’s generating capacity. The agreement is
subject to the amendment of the El Segundo RMR agreement to
switch to RMR Condition I and to otherwise allow the purchaser
to exercise its primary dispatch rights under this agreement
while preserving Cal ISO’s ability to call on the El
Segundo facility as a reliability resource under the RMR
agreement, if necessary.

Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of
    power generation facilities involve significant risks that
    cannot always be covered by insurance or contractual protections
    and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and
    results of operations.

Many of our facilities are old. Newer plants owned by our
competitors are often more efficient than our aging plants,
which may put some of our plants at a competitive disadvantage.
Over time, our plants may be squeezed out of their markets, or
be unable to compete, because of the construction of new, more
efficient plants. Older equipment, even if maintained in
accordance with good engineering practices, may require
significant capital expenditures to keep it operating at optimum
efficiency. This equipment is also likely to require periodic
upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including
failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any
unanticipated capital expenditures could result in reduced
profitability. In addition, if we make any “major
modifications” to our power generation facilities, as
defined under the new source review provisions of the federal
Clean Air Act, we may be required to install “best
available control technology” or to achieve the
“lowest achievable emissions rate.” Any such
modifications would likely result in substantial additional
capital expenditures.



In general, environmental laws and regulations, particularly
with respect to air emissions, are becoming more stringent,
which may require us to install expensive plant upgrades and/or
restrict or modify our operations to meet more stringent
standards. An example of this is RGGI, the regional greenhouse
gas initiative in the Northeast, discussed previously in the
Northeast section under Regional U.S. Regulatory
Initiatives. There are many key unknowns with respect to this
initiative, including the applicable baseline, initial
allocations, required emissions reductions, availability of
offsets, the extent to which states will adopt the program, and
the timing for implementation. There can be no assurance at this
time that a carbon dioxide cap-and-trade program, if implemented
by the states in which we operate, would not have a material
adverse effect on our operations in this region.

We cannot predict the level of capital expenditures that will be
required due to frequently changing environmental and safety
laws and regulations, deteriorating facility conditions and
unexpected events (such as natural disasters or terrorist
attacks). The unexpected requirement of large capital
expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our
financial performance and condition. Further, the construction,
expansion, modification and refurbishment of power generation
facilities involve many risks, including:

The ongoing operation of our facilities involves all of the
risks described above, as well as risks relating to the
breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, performance
below expected levels of output or efficiency and the inability
to transport our product to our customers in an efficient manner
due to a lack of transmission capacity. While we maintain
insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate
contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of
such insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not be
adequate to cover our lost revenues, increased expenses or
liquidated damages payments should we experience equipment
breakdown or non-performance by contractors. Any of these risks
could cause us to operate below expected capacity or
availability levels, which in turn could result in lost
revenues, increased expenses, higher maintenance costs and
penalties.

We are exposed to the risk of fuel and fuel transportation
    cost increases and volatility and interruption in fuel supply
    because some of our facilities do not have long-term natural
    gas, coal or liquid fuel supply agreements.

Most of our domestic natural gas-, coal- and oil-fired power
generation facilities purchase their fuel requirements under
short-term contracts or on the spot market. Although we attempt
to purchase fuel based on our known fuel requirements, we still
face the risks of supply interruptions and fuel price volatility
as fuel deliveries may not exactly match energy sales due in
part to our need to prepurchase fuel inventories for reliability
and dispatch requirements. The price we can obtain for the sale
of energy may not rise at the same rate, or may not rise at all,
to match a rise in fuel costs. This may have a material adverse
effect on our financial performance. Moreover, changes in market
prices for natural gas, coal and oil may result from the
following:

•

weather conditions;

•

seasonality;

•

demand for energy commodities and general economic conditions;



The volatility of fuel prices could materially and adversely
affect our financial results and operations.

The quality of fuel that we rely on at certain of our coal
    plants may not be available at times.

Our plant operating characteristics and equipment often dictate
the specific fuel quality to be combusted. The availability and
price of specific fuel qualities may vary due to supplier
financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions
and force majeure. At times, coal of specific quality may not be
available at any price, or we may not be able to transport such
coal to our facilities on a timely basis. In such case, we may
not be able to run a coal facility even if it would be
profitable. Operating a coal plant with lesser quality coal can
lead to emission problems. If we had contracted the power from
the facility, we could be required to supply or purchase power
from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. This could have a
material adverse impact on the financial results of specific
plants and on our results of operations.

We often rely on single suppliers and at times we rely on
    single customers at our facilities, exposing us to significant
    financial risks if either should fail to perform their
    obligations.

We often rely on a single contracted supplier for the provision
of transportation of fuel and other services required for the
operation of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform,
we utilize the marketplace to provide these services. At times,
we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all
or a significant portion of a facility’s output, in some
cases under long-term agreements that provide the support for
any project debt used to finance the facility. For the year
ended December 31, 2004, we derived 49.8% of our revenues
from majority-owned operations from four customers: NYISO
accounted for 28.5%, ISO New England accounted for 9.1%,
National Electricity Market Management Co. Ltd (Australia)
accounted for 6.8% and Vattenfall Europe (Germany) accounted for
5.4%. For the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003, we derived 39.0% of our revenues from
majority-owned operations from two customers: NYISO accounted
for 26.5% and ISO New England accounted for 12.5%. During the
period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we
derived 33.4% of our revenues from majority-owned operations
from NYISO. During 2002, we derived approximately 26.0% of our
revenues from majority-owned operations from NYISO. The failure
of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual
obligations to a facility could have a material adverse effect
on such facility’s financial results. Consequently, the
financial performance of any such facility is dependent on the
credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and
customers.

Our operations are subject to hazards customary to the
    power generation industry. We may not have adequate insurance to
    cover all of these hazards.

Our operations are subject to many hazards associated with the
power generation industry, which may expose us to significant
liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance
coverage. Power generation involves hazardous activities,
including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating
large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to
transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural
risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind,
hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and



machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations. These
and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss
of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and
equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and
suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these
events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits
asserting claims for substantial damages, including for
environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and property damage
and fines and/or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance
protection that we consider adequate, but we cannot assure you
that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all
circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we
may be subject. A successful claim for which we are not fully
insured could hurt our financial results and materially harm our
financial condition. Further, due to rising insurance costs and
changes in the insurance markets, we cannot assure you that
insurance coverage will continue to be available at all or at
rates or on terms similar to those presently available to us.

We may not have sufficient liquidity to hedge market risks
    effectively.

We are exposed to market risks through our power marketing
business, which involves the sale of energy, capacity and
related products and procurement of fuel, transmission services
and emission allowances. These market risks include, among other
risks, volatility arising from the timing differences associated
with buying fuel, converting fuel into energy and delivering the
energy to a buyer. We seek to manage this volatility by entering
into forward and other contracts that hedge our exposure for our
net transactions. The effectiveness of our hedging strategy may
be dependent on the amount of collateral available to enter into
these hedging contracts, and liquidity requirements may be
greater than we anticipate or are able to meet. Without a
sufficient amount of working capital to post as collateral in
support of performance guarantees or as cash margin, we may not
be able to effectively manage price volatility. Factors which
could lead to an increase in our required collateral include
volatile commodity prices, adverse changes in our industry,
credit rating downgrades and the secured nature of our Amended
Credit Facility. Under certain unfavorable commodity price
scenarios, it is possible that we could experience inadequate
liquidity as a result of the posting of additional collateral.

Further, if our facilities experience unplanned outages, we may
be required to procure replacement power in the open market to
minimize our exposure to liquidated damages. Without adequate
liquidity to post margin and collateral requirements, we may be
exposed to significant losses and may miss significant
opportunities, and we may have increased exposure to the
volatility of spot markets.

The accounting for our hedging activities may increase the
    volatility in our quarterly and annual financial results.

We engage in commodity-related marketing and price-risk
management activities in order to economically hedge our
exposure to market risk with respect to (i) electricity
sales from our generation assets, (ii) fuel utilized by
those assets and (iii) emission allowances. We generally
attempt to balance our fixed-price physical and financial
purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract volumes and
the timing of performance and delivery obligations, through the
use of financial and physical derivative contracts. These
derivatives are accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,”

as amended by
SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and
SFAS No. 149. SFAS No. 133 requires us to
record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with
changes in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in the
underlying commodity prices immediately recognized in earnings,
unless the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment.
Whether a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting depends upon
it meeting specific criteria used to determine if hedge
accounting is and will remain appropriate for the term of the
derivative. Economic hedges will not necessarily qualify for
hedge accounting treatment. As a result, we are unable to
predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have
on our quarterly operating results or financial position.



The value of our assets is subject to the nature and
    extent of decommissioning and remediation obligations applicable
    to us.

Our facilities and related properties may become subject to
decommissioning and/or site remediation obligations that may
require material unplanned expenditures or otherwise materially
affect the value of those assets. While we meet all site
remediation obligations currently applicable to our assets
(largely through the provision of various forms of financial
assurance. See Item 1 — Environmental
Matters — Domestic Site Remediation Matters), more
onerous obligations apply to sites where a plant is to be
dismantled, which could negatively affect our ability to
economically undertake power redevelopments or alternate uses at
existing power plant sites. Further, laws and regulations may
change to impose material additional decommissioning and
remediation obligations on us in the future, negatively
impacting the value of our assets and/or our ability to
undertake redevelopment projects.

Our results are subject to quarterly and seasonal
    fluctuations.

Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and
will continue to do so in the future as a result of a number of
factors, including seasonal variations in demand and
corresponding electricity and fuel price volatility and
variations in levels of production.

Because we own less than a majority of some of our project
    investments, we cannot exercise complete control over their
    operations.

We have limited control over the operation of some project
investments and joint ventures because our investments are in
projects where we beneficially own less than a majority of the
ownership interests. We seek to exert a degree of influence with
respect to the management and operation of projects in which we
own less than a majority of the ownership interests by
negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to
receive certain limited governance rights such as rights to veto
significant actions. However, we may not always succeed in such
negotiations. We may be dependent on our co-venturers to operate
such projects. Our co-venturers may not have the level of
experience, technical expertise, human resources management and
other attributes necessary to operate these projects optimally.
The approval of co-venturers also may be required for us to
receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer our
interest in projects.

Our access to the capital markets may be limited.

We may require additional capital from outside sources from time
to time. Our ability to arrange financing, either at the
corporate level or on a non-recourse project-level basis, and
the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors,
including:

We may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for
these or other reasons. The failure to obtain additional capital
from time to time may have a material adverse effect on our
business and operations.



Our business is subject to substantial governmental
    regulation and permitting requirements and may be adversely
    affected by liability under, or any future inability to comply
    with, existing or future regulations or requirements.

Our business is subject to extensive foreign, federal, state and
local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations. We
generally are required to obtain and comply with a wide variety
of licenses, permits and other approvals in order to construct,
operate or modify our facilities. We may incur significant
additional costs because of our need to comply with these
requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we
could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the
imposition of liens or fines. We could also be required to shut
down any facilities that do not comply with these requirements.
In addition, we are at risk for liability for past, current or
future contamination at our former and existing facilities or
with respect to off-site waste disposal sites that we have used
in our operations. Existing regulations may be revised or
reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or
become applicable to us or our facilities in a manner that may
have a detrimental effect on our business. With the continuing
trend toward stricter standards, greater regulation and more
extensive permitting requirements, we expect that our
environmental expenditures will be substantial in the future.

Our operations are potentially subject to the provisions of
various energy laws and regulations, including the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, or PUHCA, the Federal Power
Act or FPA, and state and local utility laws and regulations.
Under the FPA, FERC regulates our wholesale sales of electric
power (other than sales by our qualifying facilities, which are
exempt from FERC rate regulation). The ability to sell energy at
market-based rates is predicated on the absence of market power
in either generation or transmission, the inability to create
barriers to entry and the inability to engage in abusive
affiliate transactions and filing of certain reports with FERC.
The market power analysis includes not only generation and
transmission owned by a particular applicant but also assets
owned by affiliated companies. Holders of market-based rate
authority must comply with obligations imposed by FERC and with
certain FERC filing requirements such as the requirement to file
quarterly reports detailing wholesale sales. Although a number
of our direct and indirect subsidiaries have obtained
market-based rate authority from FERC, these authorizations
could be revoked if we fail in the future to satisfy the
applicable criteria, if FERC modifies the criteria, or if FERC
eliminates or further restricts the ability of wholesale sellers
to make sales at market-based rates.

In addition, under PUHCA, registered holding companies and their
subsidiaries (i.e., companies with 10% or more of their voting
securities held by registered holding companies) are subject to
extensive regulation by the SEC. We will not be considered a
holding company or subject to PUHCA as long as we do not become
a subsidiary of another registered holding company and the
projects in which we have an interest (1) qualify as a
qualifying facility, or QF, under the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act, or PURPA, (2) obtain and maintain exempt
wholesale generator, or EWG, status under Section 32 of
PUHCA, (3) obtain and maintain foreign utility company, or
FUCO, status under Section 33 of PUHCA, or (4) are
subject to another exemption or waiver. If our projects were to
cease to be exempt and we were to become subject to SEC and FERC
regulation under PUHCA, it would be difficult for us to comply
with PUHCA absent a substantial corporate restructuring.

Our business faces regulatory risks related to the market
    rules and regulations imposed by transmission providers,
    independent system operators and regional transmission
    organizations.

We face regulatory risk imposed by the various transmission
providers, ISOs and RTOs and their corresponding market rules.
These market rules are subject to revisions, and such revisions
may not benefit us. Transmission providers, ISOs and RTOs have
FERC-approved tariffs that govern access to their transmission
system. These tariffs may contain provisions that limit access
to the transmission grid or allocate scarce transmission
capacity in a particular manner.

We presently operate in the following ISO or RTO markets:
California (through the West Coast Power joint venture and
individually), New England, New York and PJM (the Pennsylvania,
Jersey, Maryland Interconnection). The chief regulatory risk is
the lack of, or uncertainty regarding, market mechanisms that
effectively compensate generating units for providing
reliability services and installed capacity.



Restrictions in transmission access and expansions in the
    transmission system could reduce revenues.

We are dependent on access to transmission systems to sell our
energy. In the northeastern ISO and RTO markets, we have a
significant amount of generation located in load pockets.
Expansion of the transmission system to reduce or eliminate
these load pockets could negatively impact our existing
facilities in these areas.

Our facilities located in the Entergy franchise territory face a
different transmission risk, in that restrictions on
transmission access may limit our ability to sell energy or to
service new customers.

We are subject to claims made after the date that we filed
    for bankruptcy and other claims that were not discharged in the
    bankruptcy cases, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations and profitability.

The nature of our business frequently subjects us to litigation.
Many of the largest claims against us prior to the date of the
bankruptcy filing were satisfied and discharged in accordance
with the terms of the NRG plan of reorganization or the plan of
reorganization for certain subsidiaries or in connection with
settlement agreements that were approved by the bankruptcy court
prior to our emergence from bankruptcy. Circumstances in which
pre-bankruptcy filing claims have not been discharged include,
among others, where we have agreed with a given claimant to
preserve their claims, as well as, potentially, instances where
a claimant had no notice of the bankruptcy filing. The ultimate
resolution of certain remaining or future claims may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and
profitability. In addition, claims made against subsidiaries
that did not file for chapter 11, and claims arising after
the date of our bankruptcy filing, were not discharged in the
bankruptcy cases. See Item 15 — Note 27 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the Year ended December 31,
2004, for a description of the significant legal proceedings and
investigations in which we are presently involved.

Under the NRG plan of reorganization, we have established
disputed claims reserves, which we will utilize to make
distributions to holders of disputed claims in our bankruptcy
cases as and when their claims are resolved. If these reserves
prove inadequate, we will be required to finance any further
cash distributions from other resources, and doing so could have
a material adverse impact on our financial condition, and, in
addition, we could be required to issue new common stock, which
would dilute existing shareholders. In particular, the State of
California’s disputed claims against us are capped at
$1.35 billion. There are also a number of private claims
springing from the California energy crisis for which there is
no cap. We have made no reserves for these claims, because we
believe they are without merit; however, if the State of
California or these private litigants prevail, then payment of
the distributions to which the State of California or these
private litigants would be entitled under the NRG plan of
reorganization could have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition.

Acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Our generation facilities and the facilities of third parties on
which they rely may be targets of terrorist activities, as well
as events occurring in response to or in connection with them,
that could cause environmental repercussions and/or result in
full or partial disruption of their ability to generate,
transmit, transport or distribute electricity or natural gas.
Strategic targets, such as energy-related facilities, may be at
greater risk of future terrorist activities than other domestic
targets. Any such environmental repercussions or disruption
could result in a significant decrease in revenues or
significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

Legal Proceedings

California Wholesale Electricity Litigation and Related
Investigations

People of the State of California ex. rel. Bill Lockyer,
Attorney General, v. Dynegy, Inc. et al.,

U.S. District Court, Northern District of California,
Case No. C-02-O1854 VRW; U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit, Case No. 02-16619.

This action was filed in
state court on March 11, 2002, against us, Dynegy, Dynegy
Power Marketing, Inc., Xcel Energy, West Coast Power, or WCP,
and WCP’s four operating subsidiaries. Through our
subsidiary, NRG West Coast LLC, we are a 50 percent
beneficial owner with Dynegy of West Coast Power, which owns,
operates, and markets the power of four California plants.
Dynegy and its affiliates and subsidiaries are responsible for
gas procurement and marketing and trading activities on behalf
of West Coast Power. The complaint alleges that the defendants
violated state unfair competition law by selling ancillary
services to the state independent system operator, and
subsequently selling the same capacity into the spot market. It
seeks injunctive relief as well as restitution, disgorgement and
unspecified civil penalties. On April 17, 2002, the
defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California in San Francisco. In a
March 25, 2003, opinion, the court dismissed the Attorney
General’s action against Dynegy and us with prejudice,
finding it was barred by the filed-rate doctrine and preempted
by federal law. On July 6, 2004, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the Attorney
General’s appeal. Rehearing was sought and rejected on
October 29, 2004. On January 27, 2005, the Attorney
General filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the
U.S. Supreme Court.

Public Utility District of Snohomish County v. Dynegy
Power Marketing, Inc et al.,

Case No. 02-CV-1993
RHW, U.S. District Court, Southern District of California
(part of MDL 1405).

This action was filed against us,
Dynegy, Xcel Energy and several other market participants on
July 15, 2002. The complaint alleges violations of state
anti-trust and unfair competition laws by means of price fixing,
restriction of supply, and other market “gaming”
activities. After the action was transferred to the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California
in San Diego and made a part of the Multi-District
Litigation, or MDL, proceeding described below, it was dismissed
on the grounds of federal preemption and filed-rate doctrine.
The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal and on
September 10, 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal on
the same legal grounds. On November 5, 2004, the plaintiff
filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme
Court and on February 22, 2005, the Supreme Court issued an
order requesting the views of the U.S. Solicitor General on
the petition.

    et al., inclusive.

Case No. BC249705, Superior
    Court of California, Los Angeles County

(filed May 2,
    2001).

NRG Energy is a defendant in all of the above referenced
cases. Several of WCP’s operating subsidiaries are also
defendants in the

Bustamante

case. The cases
allege unfair competition, market manipulation and price fixing
and all seek treble damages, restitution and injunctive relief.
In December 2002, the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of California issued an opinion finding that federal
jurisdiction was absent in the district court, and remanding the
cases back to state court. A notice of appeal was filed and on
December 8, 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit issued its published, unanimous decision affirming
the District Court in most respects. On March 5, 2005, the
Ninth Circuit denied a petition for rehearing. We anticipate
that the cases will be remanded to state court in 2005 at which
time the defendants will again raise filed-rate and federal
preemption challenges.

“Northern California”

cases against
various market participants.

T&E Pastorino v. Duke
Energy, et al., Case No. 02-CV-2176; RDJ Farms v.
Allegheny Energy, et al., Case No. 02-2059; Century
Theatres v. Allegheny Energy, et al., Case No.
02-CV-2177; Bronco Don v. Duke Energy, Case
No. 02-CV-2178; El Super Burrito v. Allegheny

Karsant V. Duke Energy, Case No. 02-CV-2182. (Part of MDL
1405).

We were not named in any of these cases, but in all
of them, either WCP or one or more of its operating subsidiaries
as well as Dynegy are named as defendants. These cases all
allege violations of state unfair competition law. Dynegy’s
counsel is representing both Dynegy and the WCP subsidiaries in
these cases with each side responsible for half of the defense
costs. These cases all were removed to federal court and denied
remand to state court. In late August 2003, the defendants’
motions to dismiss were granted in these various cases. On
February 25, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit approved the district court decision to dismiss
the case.

Bustamante v. McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.,
et al.,

No. BC 235598, California Superior Court,
Los Angeles County

(filed November 20, 2002, and
amended in 2003). This putative class action alleges that the
defendants attempted to manipulate gas indexes by reporting
false and fraudulent trades. Named defendants in the suit
include several of WCP’s operating subsidiaries. Dynegy is
defending the WCP subsidiaries pursuant to a limited
indemnification agreement. The complaint seeks restitution and
disgorgement, civil fines, compensatory and punitive damages,
attorneys’ fees and declaratory and injunctive relief.
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is pending.

Jerry Egger, et al. v. Dynegy, Inc., et al.,

Case No. 809822, Superior Court of California,
San Diego County

(filed May 1, 2003). This
putative class action alleges violations of California’s
antitrust law, as well as unlawful and unfair business practices
and seeks treble damages, restitution and injunctive relief. The
named defendants include WCP and several of its operating
subsidiaries. NRG Energy is not named. This case was
removed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California, and the defendants have moved to have
this case included as Multi-District Litigation along with the
above referenced cases. Plaintiffs argued a motion to remand to
state court on February 19, 2004, at which time the court
stayed the case pending a



decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit in the

Pastorino

appeal, referenced above.
Dynegy’s counsel is representing Dynegy and WCP and its
subsidiaries in this case with each side responsible for half of
the defense costs. With the Ninth Circuit’s
February 25, 2005, decision in the Northern California
cases referenced above, a decision on the stay in this case is
expected this year.

Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc., on behalf of Itself and all
others similarly situated v. Dynegy, Inc. Holding Co., West
Coast Power, LLC, et al.,

Case No. CIV.S-03-2346 DFL
GGH, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
California

(filed November 10, 2003). This putative
class action alleges violations of the federal Sherman and
Clayton Acts and state antitrust law. In addition to naming WCP
and Dynegy, Inc. Holding Co., the complaint names numerous
industry participants, as well as “unnamed
co-conspirators.” The complaint alleges that defendants
conspired to manipulate the spot price and basis differential of
natural gas with respect to the California market. The complaint
seeks unspecified amounts of damages, including a trebling of
plaintiff’s and the putative class’s actual damages.
Dynegy is defending WCP pursuant to a limited indemnification
agreement.

Division, v. American Electric Power Service Corporation,
et al.,

U.S. District Court, Western District of
Washington, Case No. C04-5325 RBL

(filed June 16,
2004). The complaint names over 50 defendants, including
WCP’s four operating subsidiaries and various Dynegy
entities. The complaint also names both us and WCP as
“Non-Defendant Co-Conspirators.” Plaintiff alleges a
conspiracy to violate the federal Sherman Act by withholding
power generation from, and/or inflating the apparent demand for
power in markets in California and elsewhere. Plaintiff claims
damages in excess of $175 million. Dynegy is defending WCP
and its subsidiaries pursuant to a limited indemnification
agreement.

Sherman Act, and California’s antitrust and unfair
competition law as well as unjust enrichment. The Complaints
seek a determination of class action status, a trebling of
unspecified damages, statutory, punitive or exemplary damages,
restitution, disgorgement, injunctive relief, a constructive
trust, and costs and attorneys’ fees. Dynegy is defending
WCP pursuant to a limited indemnification agreement.

The defendants in all of the above referenced cases include WCP
and various Dynegy entities. NRG Energy is not a defendant.
The Complaints allege that defendants attempted to manipulate
natural gas prices in California, and allege violations of
California’s antitrust law, conspiracy, and unjust
enrichment. The relief sought in all of these cases includes
treble damages, restitution and injunctive relief. The
Complaints assert that WCP is a joint venture between Dynegy and
NRG Energy, but that Dynegy Marketing and Trade handled all
of the administrative services and commodity related concerns of
WCP. The cases are presently being consolidated for coordinated
pretrial proceedings in San Diego County Superior Court.
Dynegy is defending WCP pursuant to a limited indemnification
agreement.

NRG Bankruptcy Cap on California Claims

On November 21, 2003, in conjunction with confirmation of
the NRG plan of reorganization, we reached an agreement with the
Attorney General and the State of California, generally, whereby
for purposes of distributions, if any, to be made to the State
of California under the NRG plan of reorganization, the
liquidated amount of any and all allowed claims shall not exceed
$1.35 billion in the aggregate. The agreement neither
affects our right to object to these claims on any and all
grounds nor admits any liability whatsoever. We further agreed
to waive any objection to the liquidation of these claims in a
non-bankruptcy forum having proper jurisdiction.

Investigations

FERC — California Market Manipulation

The FERC conducted an “Investigation of Potential
Manipulation of Electric and Natural Gas Prices,” which
involved hundreds of parties, including our affiliate, West
Coast Power, or WCP, and substantial discovery. In June 2001,
FERC initiated proceedings related to California’s demand
for $8.9 billion in refunds from power sellers who
allegedly inflated wholesale prices during the energy crisis.
After two administrative law judge opinions and a March 26,
2003, FERC Order adopting in part and modifying in part the last
of the two opinions, Dynegy, we and the WCP entities engaged in
extensive settlement negotiations with FERC Staff; the People of
the State of California

ex rel.

Bill Lockyer, Attorney
General; the California Public Utility Commission, or CPUC
staff; the California Department of Water Resources acting
through its Electric Power Fund, the California Electricity
Oversight Board; PG&E; Southern California Edison Company;
and San Diego Gas and Electric Company. The parties entered
into a definitive, comprehensive settlement, which FERC approved
on October 25, 2004, (the FERC Settlement).

As part of the FERC Settlement, WCP placed into escrow for
distribution to California energy consumers a total of
$22.5 million, which includes the $3 million
settlement with FERC respecting trading techniques, announced on
January 20, 2004. In addition, WCP agreed to forego:
(1) past due receivables from the California Independent
System Operator and the California Power Exchange related to the
settlement period; and (2) natural gas cost recovery claims
against the settling parties related to the settlement period. In



exchange, the various California settling parties agreed to
forego: (1) all claims relating to refunds or other
monetary damages for sales of electricity during the settlement
period; (2) claims alleging that WCP received unjust or
unreasonable rates for the sale of electricity during the
settlement period; and (3) FERC dismissed numerous
investigations respecting market transactions. For a two year
period following FERC’s acceptance of the settlement
agreement, WCP will retain an independent engineering company to
perform semi-annual audits of the technical and economic basis,
justification and rationale for outages that occurred at its
California generating plants during the previous six month
period, and to have the results of such audits provided to the
FERC Office of Market Oversight and Investigation without any
prior review by WCP.

WCP previously established significant reserves on its balance
sheet and will not incur any further loss associated with the
FERC Settlement. We will pay no cash from corporate funds, nor
will the FERC Settlement have any direct impact on our profit
and loss statement.

Other FERC Proceedings

There are a number of additional, related proceedings in which
WCP subsidiaries are parties, which are either pending before
FERC or on appeal from FERC to various U.S. Courts of
Appeal. These cases involve, among other things, allegations of
physical withholding, a FERC-established price mitigation plan
determining maximum rates for wholesale power transactions in
certain spot markets, and the enforceability of, and obligations
under, various contracts with, among others, the California
Independent System Operator and the State of California and
certain of its agencies and departments.

California Attorney General

The California Attorney General has undertaken an investigation
entitled “In the Matter of the Investigation of Possibly
Unlawful, Unfair, or Anti-Competitive Behavior Affecting
Electricity Prices in California.” In this connection, the
Attorney General has issued subpoenas to Dynegy, served
interrogatories on Dynegy and us, and informally requested
documents and conducted interviews with Dynegy and Dynegy
employees as well as us and our employees. We responded to the
interrogatories in the summer of 2002, and again on
September 3, 2002. We have also produced a large volume of
documentation relating to the West Coast Power subsidiaries.

Electricity Consumers Resource Council v. Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission,

Docket No. 03-1449.

On December 19, 2003, the Electricity Consumers Resource
Council, or ECRC, appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit a 2003 FERC decision approving
the implementation of a demand curve for the New York installed
capacity, or ICAP, market. ECRC claims that the implementation
of the ICAP demand curve violates section 205 of the
Federal Power Act because it constitutes unreasonable
ratemaking. On December 3, 2004, the Company filed a brief
opposing the ECRC request.

Consolidated Edison Co. of New York v. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission,

Docket No. 01-1503.

Consolidated Edison and others petitioned the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of
certain FERC orders in which FERC refused to order a
re-determination of prices in the New York Independent System
Operator, or NYISO, operating reserve markets for the period
January 29, 2000, to March 27, 2000. On
November 7, 2003, the Court issued a decision which found
that the NYISO’s method of pricing spinning reserves
violated the NYISO tariff. The Court also required FERC to
determine whether the exclusion from the non-spinning market of
a generating facility known as Blenheim-Gilboa and resources
located in western New York also constituted a tariff violation
and/or whether these exclusions enabled NYISO to use its
Temporary Extraordinary Procedure, or TEP, authority to require
refunds. On March 4, 2005, FERC issued an order stating
that no refunds would be required for the tariff violation
associated with the pricing of spinning reserves. In the order,
FERC also stated that the exclusion of the Blenheim-Gilboa
facility and western reserves from the non-spinning market was
not a market flaw and NYISO was correct not to use its TEP
authority to revise the prices in this market. Motions for
rehearing of the Order must be filed by April 3, 2005. If
the March 4, 2005 order is reversed and refunds are
required, NRG entities which may be affected include NRG Power
Marketing, Inc., Astoria Gas Turbine Power LLC and Arthur Kill
Power LLC.



Although non-NRG-related entities would share responsibility for
payment of any such refunds under the petitioners’ theory
the cumulative exposure to our above-listed entities could
exceed $23 million.

Connecticut Light & Power Company v. NRG
Power Marketing, Inc.,

Docket No. 3:01-CV-2373 (AWT),
U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut

(filed on
November 28, 2001). Connecticut Light & Power
Company, or CL&P, sought recovery of amounts it claimed it
was owed for congestion charges under the terms of an
October 29, 1999, contract between the parties. CL&P
withheld approximately $30 million from amounts owed to NRG
Power Marketing, Inc., or PMI, and PMI counterclaimed. CL&P
filed its motion for summary judgment to which PMI filed a
response on March 21, 2003. By reason of the stay issued by
the bankruptcy court, the court has not ruled on the pending
motion. On November 6, 2003, the parties filed a joint
stipulation for relief from the stay in order to allow the
proceeding to go forward that was promptly granted. PMI cannot
estimate at this time the overall exposure for congestion
charges for the full term of the contract.

Connecticut Light & Power Company v.
NRG Energy, Inc.,

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
Docket No. EL03-10-000-Station Service Dispute

(filed
October 9, 2002);

Binding Arbitration.

On
July 1, 1999, Connecticut Light & Power Company,
or CL&P, and the Company agreed that we would purchase
certain CL&P generating facilities. The transaction closed
on December 14, 1999, whereupon NRG Energy took
ownership of the facilities. CL&P began billing NRG Energy
for station service power and delivery services provided to the
facilities and NRG Energy refused to pay asserting that the
facilities self-supplied their station service needs. On
October 9, 2002, Northeast Utilities Services Company, on
behalf of itself and CL&P, filed a complaint at FERC seeking
an order requiring NRG Energy to pay for station service
and delivery services. On December 20, 2002, FERC issued an
Order finding that at times when NRG Energy is not able to
self-supply its station power needs, there is a sale of station
power from a third-party and retail charges apply. CL&P
renewed its demand for payment which was again refused by
NRG Energy. In August 2003, the parties agreed to submit
the dispute to binding arbitration. The parties each selected
one respective arbitrator. A neutral arbitrator cannot be
selected until the party-appointed arbitrators have been given a
mutually agreed upon description of the dispute, which has yet
to occur. Once the neutral arbitrator is selected, a decision is
required within 90 days unless otherwise agreed by the
parties. The potential loss inclusive of amounts paid to
CL&P and accrued could exceed $6 million.

The State of New York and Erin M. Crotty, as Commissioner
of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation
et al.,

U.S. District Court for the Western
District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-CV-002S.

In
January 2002, the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation, or NYSDEC, sued Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation,
or NiMo, and us in federal court in New York. The complaint
asserted that projects undertaken at our Huntley and Dunkirk
plants by NiMo, the former owner of the facilities, required
preconstruction permits pursuant to the Clean Air Act and that
the failure to obtain these permits violated federal and state
laws. On January 11, 2005, we reached agreement with the
State of New York and the NYSDEC to settle this matter. The
settlement requires the reduction of sulfur dioxide
(SO


) by over 86 percent and nitrogen oxide by
over 80 percent in aggregate at the Huntley and Dunkirk
plants. To do so, units 63 and 64 at Huntley will be retired
after receiving the appropriate regulatory approvals. Units 65
and 66 will be retired eighteen months later. We also agreed to
limits on the transfer of certain federal SO


allowances. We are not subject to any penalty as a result of the
settlement. Through the end of the decade, we expect that our
ongoing compliance with the emissions limits set out in the
settlement will be achieved through capital expenditures already
planned. This includes conversion to low sulfur western coal at
the Huntley and Dunkirk plants that will be completed by spring
2006.

Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation v. NRG Energy,
Inc., Huntley Power, LLC, and Dunkirk Power, LLC,

Supreme
Court, State of New York, County of Onondaga, Case
No. 2001-4372

(filed on July 13, 2001). NiMo filed
suit in state court in New York seeking a declaratory judgment
with respect to its obligations to indemnify us under the asset
sales agreement. We asserted that NiMo is obligated to indemnify
us for any related compliance costs associated with resolution
of the above referenced NYSDEC enforcement action. On
October 18, 2004, the parties reached a confidential
settlement.



Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation v. Dunkirk Power
LLC, NRG Dunkirk Operations, Inc., Huntley Power LLC, NRG
Huntley Operations, Inc., Oswego Power LLC and NRG Oswego
Operations, Inc.,

Supreme Court, Erie County, Index
No. 1-2000-8681 — Station Service Dispute

(filed October 2, 2000). NiMo seeks to recover damages
less payments received through the date of judgment, as well as
any additional amounts due and owing, for electric service
provided to the Dunkirk Plant after September 18, 2000.
NiMo claims that we failed to pay retail tariff amounts for
utility services commencing on or about June 11, 1999, and
continuing to September 18, 2000, and thereafter. NiMo
alleged breach of contract, suit on account, violation of
statutory duty and unjust enrichment claims. Prior to trial, the
parties entered into a Stipulation and Order filed
August 9, 2002, consolidating this action with two other
actions against the Huntley and Oswego subsidiaries, both of
which cases assert the same claims and legal theories. On
October 8, 2002, a Stipulation and Order was filed staying
this action pending submission to FERC of some or all of the
disputes in the action. The potential loss inclusive of amounts
paid to NiMo and accrued is approximately $23.2 million.

Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation v. Huntley Power
LLC, NRG Huntley Operations, Inc., NRG Dunkirk Operations, Inc.,
Dunkirk Power LLC, Oswego Harbor Power LLC, and NRG Oswego
Operations, Inc.,

Case Filed November 26, 2002 in
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Docket No. EL
03-27-000.

This is the companion action to the above
referenced action filed by NiMo at FERC asserting the same
claims and legal theories. On November 19, 2004, FERC
denied NiMo’s petition and ruled that the Huntley, Dunkirk
and Oswego plants could net their service station obligations
over a 30 calendar day period from the day NRG Energy
acquired the facilities. In addition, FERC ruled that neither
NiMo nor the New York Public Service Commission could impose a
retail delivery charge on the NRG facilities because they are
interconnected to transmission and not to distribution. NiMo
filed a motion for rehearing, on which FERC has not ruled.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Request for
Information under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act.

On January 27, 2004, Louisiana Generating, LLC and Big
Cajun II received a request under Section 114 of the
federal Clean Air Act from U.S. EPA Region 6 seeking
information primarily relating to physical changes made at Big
Cajun II. Louisiana Generating, LLC and Big Cajun II
submitted several responses to the EPA. On February 15,
2005, Louisiana Generating, LLC received a Notice of Violation
alleging violations of the New Source Review provisions of the
Clean Air Act from 1998 through the Notice of Violation date. We
cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time.

Itiquira Energetica, S.A.

Our Brazilian project
company, Itiquira Energetica S.A., the owner of a 156 MW
hydro project in Brazil, is in arbitration with the former EPC
contractor for the project, Inepar Industria e Construcoes, or
“Inepar.” The dispute was commenced by Itiquira in
September of 2002 and pertains to certain matters arising under
the former EPC contract. Itiquira seeks
U.S. $40 million and asserts that Inepar breached the
contract and caused damages to Itiquira by (i) failing to
meet milestones for substantial completion; (ii) failing to
provide adequate resources to meet such milestones;
(iii) failing to pay subcontractors amounts due; and
(iv) being insolvent. Inepar seeks
U.S. $10 million and alleges that Itiquira breached
the contract and caused damages to Inepar by failing to
recognize events of force majeure as grounds for excused delay
and extensions of scope of services and material under the
contract. An expert investigation was ordered by an arbitration
panel to cover technical and accounting issues and expert
testimony was presented at two subsequent hearings. Final
written arguments from the parties were submitted on
January 28, 2005. The court of arbitration is expected to
issue a decision by the close of the second quarter of 2005.

CFTC Trading Inquiry.

On July 1, 2004, the
CFTC filed a civil complaint against us in Minnesota federal
district court, alleging false reporting of natural gas trades
from August 2001 to May 2002, and seeking an injunction against
future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. On
July 23, 2004, we filed a motion with the bankruptcy court
to enforce the injunction provisions of the NRG plan of
reorganization against the CFTC. Thereafter, we filed with the
Minnesota federal district court a motion to dismiss. On
November 17, 2004, a Bankruptcy Court hearing was held on
the CFTC’s motion to reinstate its expunged bankruptcy
claim, and on our motion to enforce the injunction contained in
our plan of reorganization in order to preclude the CFTC from
continuing its Minnesota federal court action. On
December 6, 2004, a federal magistrate judge in Minnesota
issued a report and recommendation that our motion to dismiss be
granted by the district court. On March 16, 2005, the
federal district court in Minnesota adopted the magistrate
judge’s report and



recommendations and dismissed the case. The Bankruptcy Court has
yet to schedule for a hearing or rule on the CFTC’s pending
motion to reinstate its expunged claim.

Additional Litigation

In addition to the foregoing, we are parties to other litigation
or legal proceedings. See “Market Developments” in the
various regions in Item 1 — Business —
Power Generation for additional discussion on regulatory legal
proceedings.

The Company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal
proceedings and investigations described above and intends to
defend them vigorously. However, litigation is inherently
subject to many uncertainties. There can be no assurance that
additional litigation will not be filed against the Company or
its subsidiaries in the future asserting similar or different
legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages
and relief. Unless specified above, the Company is unable to
predict the outcome these legal proceedings and investigations
may have or reasonably estimate the scope or amount of any
associated costs and potential liabilities. An unfavorable
outcome in one or more of these proceedings could have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company also
has indemnity rights for some of these proceedings to reimburse
the Company for certain legal expenses and to offset certain
amounts deemed to be owed in the event of an unfavorable
litigation outcome.

Disputed Claims Reserve

As part of the NRG plan of reorganization, we have funded a
disputed claims reserve for the satisfaction of certain general
unsecured claims that were disputed claims as of the effective
date of the plan. Under the terms of the plan, to the extent
such claims are resolved now that we have emerged from
bankruptcy, the claimants will be paid from the reserve on the
same basis as if they had been paid out in the bankruptcy. That
means that their allowed claims will be reduced to the same
recovery percentage as other creditors would have received and
will be paid in pro rata distributions of cash and common stock.
We believe we have funded the disputed claims reserve at a
sufficient level to settle the remaining unresolved proofs of
claim we received during the bankruptcy proceedings. However, to
the extent the aggregate amount of these payouts of disputed
claims ultimately exceeds the amount of the funded claims
reserve, we are obligated to provide additional cash, notes and
common stock to the claimants. We will continue to monitor our
obligation as the disputed claims are settled. If excess funds
remain in the disputed claims reserve after payment of all
obligations, such amounts will be reallocated to the creditor
pool. We have contributed common stock and cash to an escrow
agent to complete the distribution and settlement process. Since
we have surrendered control over the common stock and cash
provided to the disputed claims reserve, we recognized the
issuance of the common stock as of December 6, 2003 and
removed the cash amounts from our balance sheet. Similarly, we
removed the obligations relevant to the claims from our balance
sheet when the common stock was issued and cash contributed.

No matters were considered during the fourth quarter of 2004.

PART II

Item 5 —

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related
    Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
    Securities

Market Information and Holders

In connection with the consummation of our reorganization, on
December 5, 2003, all shares of our old common stock were
canceled and 100,000,000 shares of new common stock of
NRG Energy were distributed pursuant to such plan in
accordance with Section 1145 of the bankruptcy code to the
holders of certain classes of claims. We received no proceeds
from such issuance. A certain number of shares of common stock
were



issued and placed in the Disputed Claims Reserve for
distribution to holders of disputed claims as such claims are
resolved or settled. See Item 3 — Legal
Proceedings — Disputed Claims Reserve. In the event
our disputed claims reserve is inadequate, it is possible we
will have to issue additional shares of our common stock to
satisfy such pre-petition claims or contribute additional cash
proceeds. Our authorized capital stock consists of
500,000,000 shares of NRG Energy common stock and
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. A total of
4,000,000 shares of our common stock are available for
issuance under our long-term incentive plan. We have also filed
with the Secretary of State of Delaware a Certificate of
Designation of our 4% Convertible Perpetual Preferred
Stock, or Preferred Stock.

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and
has been assigned the symbol: NRG. We have submitted to the New
York Stock Exchange our annual certificate from our Chief
Executive Officer certifying that he is not aware of any
violation by us of New York Stock Exchange corporate governance
listing standards. The high and low sales prices, as well as the
closing price for our common stock on a per share basis for 2004
and the period December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003

Recent Sale of Unregistered Securities; Repurchase of Common
Stock

Upon emergence from chapter 11, investment partnerships
managed by MatlinPatterson LLC, or MatlinPatterson, owned
approximately 21.5 million (21.5%) of our common shares. On
December 21, 2004, using existing cash we purchased
13 million shares of common stock from MatlinPatterson at a
purchase price of $31.16 per share. In addition to a
reduction in total shares of common stock outstanding by
13 million, the share repurchase resulted in (i) the
reduction of MatlinPatterson’s share ownership to less than
10% from the prior 21.5%, (ii) termination of
MatlinPatterson’s registration rights, and
(iii) resignation from our Board of Directors of three
directors affiliated with MatlinPatterson. Our Board’s
Governance and Nominating Committee is in the process of
identifying appropriate independent directors to fill the
vacancies.

Proceeds from the sale of the Preferred Stock were used to
redeem $375.0 million of our Second Priority Notes on
February 4, 2005. In January 2005 and in March 2005, we
used existing cash to purchase, at market prices,
$25 million and $15.8 million, respectively, in face
value of our Second Priority Notes. These notes were assumed by
NRG Energy and therefore remain outstanding.

The NRG Energy, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan became
    effective upon our emergence from bankruptcy. The Long-Term
    Incentive Plan, which was adopted in connection with the NRG
    plan of reorganization, was approved by our stockholders on
    August 4, 2004. The Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for
    grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
    stock, performance awards, deferred stock units and dividend
    equivalent rights. Our directors, officers and employees, as
    well as other individuals performing services for, or to whom an
    offer of employment has been extended by us, are eligible to
    receive grants under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. A total of
    4,000,000 shares of our common stock are available for
    issuance under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The purpose of the
    Long-Term Incentive Plan is to promote our long-term growth and
    profitability by providing these individuals with incentives to
    maximize stockholder value and otherwise contribute to our
    success and to enable us to attract, retain and reward the best
    available persons for positions of responsibility. The
    Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors administers the
    Long-Term Incentive Plan. There were 2,053,294 and
    3,367,249 shares of common stock remaining available for
    grants of stock options under our Long-Term Incentive Plan as of
    December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Energy and energy-related revenue consists of revenues received
from third parties for sales in the day-ahead and real-time
markets, as well as bilateral sales. In addition, this category
includes day-ahead and real-time operating revenues.

Capacity revenue consists of revenues received from a third
party at either the market or negotiated contract rates for
making installed generation capacity available in order to
satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements. In
addition, capacity revenues includes revenues received under
tolling arrangements which entitle third parties to dispatch our
facilities and assume title to the electrical generation
produced from that facility.

Alternative energy revenue consists of revenues received from
the sale of steam, hot and chilled water generally produced at a
central district energy plant and sold to commercial,
governmental and residential buildings for space heating,
domestic hot water heating and air conditioning. Alternative
energy revenue includes the sale of high-pressure steam produced
and delivered to industrial customers that is used as part of an
industrial process. In addition, alternative revenue includes
revenues received from the processing of municipal solid waste
into refuse derived fuel that is sold to a third party to be
used as fuel in the generation of electricity.

Operations and management, or O&M, fees consist primarily of
revenues received from providing certain unconsolidated
affiliates with management and operational services generally
under long-term operating agreements.

Other revenues consist of miscellaneous other revenues derived
from the sale of natural gas, recovery of incurred costs under
reliability agreements and revenues received under leasing
arrangements. In addition, we also generate revenues from
maintenance, the sale of ancillary services excluding day-ahead
and real-time operating revenues and by entering into certain
financial transactions. Ancillary revenues are derived from the
sale of energy related products associated with the generation
of electrical energy such as spinning reserves, reactive power
and other similar products. Also included in other revenues are
revenues derived from financial transactions
(derivatives) relating to the sale of energy or fuel which
do not require the physical delivery of the underlying commodity.

Item 7 —

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

NRG Energy, Inc., or “NRG Energy”, the
“Company”, “we”, “our”, or
“us” is a wholesale power generation company,
primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of power
generation facilities, the transacting in and trading of fuel
and transportation services and the marketing and trading of
energy, capacity and related products in the United States and
internationally. We have a diverse portfolio of electric
generation facilities in terms of geography, fuel type and
dispatch levels. Our principal domestic generation assets
consist of a diversified mix of natural gas-, coal- and
oil-fired facilities, representing approximately 40%, 31% and
29% of our total domestic generation capacity, respectively. In
addition, 23% of our domestic generating facilities have dual or
multiple fuel capacity, which allows plants to dispatch with the
lowest cost fuel option.

Our two principal objectives are to maximize the operating
performance of our entire portfolio, and to protect and enhance
the market value of our physical and contractual assets through
the execution of asset-based risk management, marketing and
trading strategies within well-defined risk and liquidity
guidelines. We aggregate the assets in our core regions into
integrated businesses to serve the requirements of the
load-serving entities in our core markets. Our business involves
the reinvestment of capital in our existing assets for reasons
of repowering, expansion, environmental remediation, operating
efficiency, reliability programs, greater fuel optionality,
greater merit order diversity, enhanced portfolio effect or for
alternative use, among other reasons. Our business also may
involve acquisitions intended to complement the asset portfolios
in our core regions, and from time to time we may also consider
and undertake other merger and acquisition transactions that are
consistent with our strategy.



The wholesale energy industry entered a prolonged slump in 2001,
from which it is only beginning to emerge. We expect that
generally weak market conditions will continue for the
foreseeable future in many U.S. markets. We further expect
that the merchant power industry will continue to see corporate
restructuring, debt restructuring, and consolidation over the
coming years.

Asset Sales.

We have substantially completed our
divestment of major non-core assets; however, as part of our
strategy, we plan to continue the selective divestment of
certain non-core assets. We have no current plans to market
actively any of our core assets, although our intention to
maximize over time the value of all of our assets could lead to
additional assets sales.

Discontinued Operations.

We have classified certain
business operations, and gains/losses recognized on sale, as
discontinued operations for projects that were sold or have met
the required criteria for such classification pending final
disposition. Accounting regulations require that continuing
operations be reported separately in the income statement from
discontinued operations, and that any gain or loss on the
disposition of any such business be reported along with the
operating results of such business. Assets classified as
discontinued operations on our balance sheet as of
December 31, 2004 consist of the McClain project. All other
projects have been sold as of December 31, 2004.

Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm; Audit
Committee.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP served as our
independent auditors from 1995 through 2003. On May 3,
2004, we announced that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP had decided
not to stand for re-election as our independent auditor for the
year ended December 31, 2004. On May 24, 2004 the
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors appointed KPMG LLP as
our independent registered public accounting firm going forward,
and on August 4, 2004 our stockholders ratified the
appointment. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has consented to the
inclusion of their reports for the periods January 1, 2003
to December 5, 2003 and December 6, 2003 to
December 31, 2003 and for the year ended December 31,
2002. The Company intends to continue to request the consent of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in future filings with the SEC when
deemed necessary.

Fresh Start Reporting.

In connection with our emergence
from bankruptcy, we adopted Fresh Start Reporting on
December 5, 2003, in accordance with the requirements of
Statement of Position 90-7,

“Financial Reporting by
Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code”

,
or SOP 90-7. The application of SOP 90-7 resulted in
the creation of a new reporting entity. Under Fresh Start, our
reorganization value was allocated to our assets and liabilities
on a basis substantially consistent with purchase accounting in
accordance with SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, our
assets’ recorded values were adjusted to reflect their
estimated fair values upon adoption of Fresh Start. Any portion
of the reorganization value not attributable to specific assets
is an indefinite-lived intangible asset referred to as
“reorganization value in excess of value of identifiable
assets” and reported as goodwill. We did not record any
such amounts. As a result of adopting Fresh Start and emerging
from bankruptcy, our historical financial information is not
comparable to financial information for periods after our
emergence from bankruptcy.

Results of Operations

Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted the Fresh Start
provisions of SOP 90-7. Accordingly, the Reorganized NRG
statement of operations and statement of cash flows have not
been prepared on a consistent basis with the Predecessor
Company’s financial statements and are not comparable in
certain respects to the financial statements prior to the
application of Fresh Start, therefore, the Predecessor
Company’s and the Reorganized NRG’s amounts are
discussed separately for comparison and analysis purposes,
herein.



The following table shows the percent of total revenue each
segment contributes to our total revenue:

The following table provides operating income by segment for the
year ended December 31, 2004.

For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the
    Year Ended December 31, 2003

Net Income/(Loss)

Reorganized NRG

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded net
income of $185.6 million, or $1.85 per weighted
average share of diluted common stock. These favorable results
occurred despite a challenging market environment in 2004.
Unseasonably mild weather, high volatility on forward markets
and disappointing spot power prices summarize 2004’s
events. The year started with colder than normal weather
arriving in January but unseasonably mild weather characterized
the period from March thru December which dampened energy prices
in North America. The National Oceanic Atmospheric Agency, or
NOAA, has ranked the mean average temperatures over the past
110 years by season for each of the lower 48 states.
The year 2004 started



with the winter being colder than normal in the east coast
followed by a spring, summer and fall which were among the
mildest in the last 110 years throughout most of the United
States. Although mild weather in the North America market kept
spot market on-peak power prices low throughout most of the
year, relatively high gas and oil prices kept spark spreads on
coal-based assets positive.

The overall perception that there would be significant
production losses due to Hurricane Ivan ignited a strong
pre-heating season rally in natural gas futures during the early
fourth quarter. While power prices tracked changes in natural
gas prices, this movement was not one for one. As a result, our
spark spreads on coal-based generation increased dramatically
with the fall 2004 changes in gas prices. During this period we
sold forward 2005 power locking in these spark spreads. Forward
power prices have fallen considerably from the highs set in
October, and many of those forward sales, which were
marked-to-market through earnings, significantly contributed to
the $57.3 million unrealized gain recorded in revenue for
the year ended December 31, 2004 and as more fully
described in Note 16 to the financial statements.

As indicated above, our 2004 results were favorably impacted by
the cold weather in January. Additionally, the Northeast’s
income results for the year were positively impacted by the
$57.3 million of unrealized gains associated with forward
sale transactions supporting our Northeast assets. The majority
of the unrealized gains relate to forward sales of electricity
which will be realized in 2005. These gains were offset by our
South Central region’s results, which were negatively
impacted by an unplanned outage in the fourth quarter forcing us
to purchase power to meet our contract supply obligations.
Impairment charges of $44.7 million negatively impacted net
income; of which $26.5 million relates to the Kendall
asset. Our results were also favorably impacted by the
FERC-approved settlement agreement between NRG Energy and
Connecticut Light & Power, or CL&P, and others
concerning the congestion and losses obligation associated with
a prior standard offer service contract, whereby we received
$38.4 million in settlement proceeds in July 2004. The 2004
results were also positively impacted by $159.8 million in
equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates including
$68.9 million from our interest in West Coast Power which
benefited from warmer than normal temperatures during the year.

During the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003, we recognized net income of
$11.0 million or $0.11 per share of common stock. Net
income was directly attributable to a number of factors some of
which are discussed below. From an overall operational
perspective our facilities were profitable during this period.
Our results were adversely impacted by our having to continue to
satisfy the standard offer service contract that we entered into
with CL&P in 2000. As a result of our inability to terminate
this contract during our bankruptcy proceeding, we continued to
be exposed to losses under this contract. These losses were
incurred, as we were unable to satisfy the requirements of this
contract at a price/cost below the contracted sales price. Upon
our adoption of Fresh Start, we recorded at fair value, all
assets and liabilities on our opening balance sheet and
accordingly we recorded as an obligation the fair value of the
CL&P contract. During the period December 6, 2003
through December 31, 2003, we recognized as revenues the
entire fair value of this contract effectively offsetting the
actual losses incurred under this contract. The CL&P
contract terminated on December 31, 2003.

Predecessor Company

During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003, we recorded net income of $2.8 billion. Net income
for the period is directly attributable to our emerging from
bankruptcy and adopting the Fresh Start provisions of
SOP 90-7. Upon the confirmation of our Plan of
Reorganization and our emergence from bankruptcy, we were able
to remove significant amounts of long-term debt and other
pre-petition obligations from our balance sheet. Accordingly, as
part of net income, we recorded a net gain of $3.9 billion
(comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from continuing
operations and a $0.2 billion loss from discontinued
operations) as the impact of our adopting Fresh Start in our
statement of operations. $6.0 billion of this amount is
directly related to the forgiveness of debt and settlement of
substantial amounts of our pre-petition obligations upon our
emergence from bankruptcy. In addition to the removal of
substantial amounts of pre-petition debt and other obligations
from our balance sheet, we also revalued our assets and
liabilities to fair value. Accordingly, we substantially wrote
down the value of our fixed assets. We recorded a net
$1.6 billion charge related to the revaluation of our
assets and liabilities within the Fresh Start Reporting
adjustment line of our consolidated



statement of operations. In addition to our adjustments related
to our emergence from bankruptcy, we also recorded substantial
charges related to other items such as the settlement of certain
outstanding litigation in the amount of $462.6 million,
write downs and losses on the sale of equity investments of
$147.1 million, advisor costs and legal fees directly
attributable to our being in bankruptcy of $197.8 million
and $237.6 million of other asset impairment and
restructuring costs incurred prior to our filing for bankruptcy.
Net income for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 was favorably impacted by our not
recording interest expense on substantial amounts of corporate
level debt while we were in bankruptcy and by the continued
favorable results experienced by our equity investments.

Revenues from Majority-Owned Operations

Reorganized NRG

Our revenues from majority-owned operations were
$2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004
which included $1.4 billion of energy revenues,
$612.3 million of capacity revenues, $175.7 million of
alternative energy revenues, $20.8 million of O&M fees
and $174.1 million of other revenues, which include
$57.3 million of unrealized gains associated with financial
sales transactions of electricity, which are marked to market,
$22.4 million from ancillary service revenues and the
remainder related to financial and physical gas sales and
non-cash contract amortization resulting from fresh start
accounting and other miscellaneous revenue items.

Revenues from majority-owned operations for the year ended
December 31, 2004, were driven primarily by our North
American operations, primarily our Northeast facilities. Our
wholly-owned domestic Northeast power generation operations
significantly contributed to our energy revenues. Our
wholly-owned North America assets generated approximately
29.0 million megawatt hours during the year 2004 with the
Northeast region representing 45.6% of these megawatt hours. Of
the total $1.4 billion in energy revenues, the Northeast
region represented 62%. Our energy revenues were favorably
impacted by the FERC-approved settlement agreement between us
and CL&P and others, whereby we received $38.4 million
in settlement proceeds in July 2004. These settlement proceeds
are included in the All Other segment in the energy revenue
category. South Central’s energy revenues are driven by our
ability to sell merchant energy, which is dependent upon
available generation from our coal-based Louisiana Generating
company after serving our co-op customer and long-term customer
load obligations. Since our load obligation is primarily
residential load, our merchant opportunities are largely
available in the off-peak hours of the day. Our Australian
operations were favorably impacted by strong market prices
driven by gas restrictions in January, record high temperatures
in February and March, and favorable foreign exchange movements.
Our capacity revenues are largely driven by our Northeast and
South Central facilities. Our South Central and New York City
assets earned 30% and 26% of our total capacity revenues,
respectively. In the Northeast, our Connecticut facilities
continue to benefit from the cost-based reliability must-run, or
RMR agreements, which were authorized by FERC as of
January 17, 2004 and approved by FERC on January 27,
2005. The agreements entitle us to approximately
$7.1 million of capacity revenues per month until
January 1, 2006, the LICAP implementation date. In the
South Central region, our long-term contracts provide for
capacity payments. Other North American capacity revenues were
generated by our Kendall operation, which had a long-term
tolling agreement. During this period we also experienced a
favorable impact on our revenues due to the mark-to-market on
certain of our derivative contracts wherein we have recognized
$57.3 million in unrealized gains. This gain is related to
our Northeast assets and is included in Other Revenue. Also
included in Other Revenue in the Northeast are the cost
reimbursement funds under the RMR agreement for our Connecticut
assets. Our revenues during this period include net charges of
$35.3 million of non-cash amortization of the fair values
of various executory contracts recorded on our balance sheet
upon our adoption of the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90-7
in December 2003.

Our revenues from majority-owned operations were
$138.5 million for the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003.



Predecessor Company

Revenues from majority-owned operations were $1.8 billion
for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003 and include $992.6 million of energy revenues,
$566.0 million of capacity revenues, $115.9 million of
alternative energy, $12.9 million of O&M fees and
$110.9 million of other revenues which include financial
and physical gas sales, sales from our Schkopau facility and
NEPOOL expense reimbursements. Revenues from majority-owned
operations during the period ended December 5, 2003, were
driven primarily by our North American operations and to a
lesser degree by our international operations, primarily
Australia. Our domestic Northeast and South Central power
generation operations significantly contributed to our revenues
due primarily to favorable market prices resulting from strong
fuel and electricity prices. Our Australian operations were
favorably impacted by foreign exchange rates. During this period
we also experienced an unfavorable impact on our revenues due to
continued losses on our CL&P standard offer contract and the
mark-to-market on certain of our derivatives.

Cost of Majority-Owned Operations

Reorganized NRG

Our cost of majority-owned operations for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was $1.5 billion or 63.3% of
revenues from majority-owned operations. Cost of majority-owned
operations consist of $1.008 billion of cost of energy
(primarily fuel and purchased energy costs), or 42.7% of
revenues from majority-owned operations and $486.1 million
of operating expenses, or 20.6% of revenues from majority-owned
operations. Operating expenses consist of $208.5 million of
labor related costs, $236.7 million of operating and
maintenance costs, $38.2 million of non-income based taxes
and $2.9 million of asset retirement obligation accretion.

Cost of Energy

Fuel related costs include $478.3 million in coal costs,
$233.0 million in natural gas costs, $104.7 million in
fuel oil costs, $38.8 million in transmission and
transportation expenses, $100.4 million of purchased energy
costs, $35.0 million in other costs and $17.8 million
in non-cash SO


emission credit amortization
resulting from Fresh Start accounting. The Northeast region
consumed 50%, 64% and 92% of total coal, natural gas and oil
expenditures, respectively. The South Central region, which is
comprised mainly of our Louisiana base-loaded coal plant,
consumed 32% of our total coal expenditures.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses related to continuing operations for the year
ended December 31, 2004 were $486.1 million or 20.6%
of revenues from majority-owned operations. Operating expenses
include labor, normal and major maintenance costs, environmental
and safety costs, utilities costs, and non-income based taxes.
Labor costs include regular, overtime and contract costs at our
plants and totaled $208.5 million. The Northeast region,
where the majority of our assets reside, represents 52% of total
labor costs; Australia represents 18%, while our South Central
region represents 11%. Of the total O&M costs, normal and
major maintenance at our plants accounted for
$176.7 million, or 36.3% of total operating costs.
Maintenance costs were largely driven by planned outages across
our fleet, and the low-sulfur coal conversion in western New
York. The Northeast region represented over half of the normal
and major maintenance, with a total of $98.6 million in
costs in 2004 while Australia had $38.8 million in normal
and major maintenance, or 22%. Operating expenses were
positively impacted by a $7 million favorable settlement
with a vendor regarding auxiliary power charges. Non-income
based taxes totaled $38.2 million net of $34.6 million
in property tax credits, primarily associated with an enterprise
zone program.

Cost of majority-owned operations was $95.5 million, or
69.0% of revenues from majority-owned operations for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Cost of
energy for this period was $62.3 million or 45.0% of
revenues from majority-owned operations and operating expenses
were $33.2 million, or 24.0% of revenues from
majority-owned operations. Labor during this period totaled
$11.1 million. Normal and major maintenance was
$12 million with 70% of the total normal and major
maintenance for this time period coming from our Northeast
region.



Predecessor Company

Cost of majority-owned operations was $1.4 billion, or
75.4% of revenues from majority-owned operations for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. Cost of
majority-owned operations was unfavorably impacted by increased
generation in the Northeast region, partially offset by a
reduction in trading and hedging activity resulting from a
reduction in our power marketing activities. Our international
operations were impacted by an unfavorable movement in foreign
exchange rates and continued mark-to-market of the Osborne
contract at Flinders resulting from lower pool prices.

Depreciation and Amortization

Reorganized NRG

Our depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing
operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 was
$209.3 million. Depreciation and amortization consists
primarily of the allocation of our historical depreciable fixed
asset costs over the remaining lives of such property. Upon
adoption of Fresh Start, we were required to revalue our fixed
assets to fair value and determine new remaining lives for such
assets. Our fixed assets were written down substantially upon
our emergence from bankruptcy. We also determined new remaining
depreciable lives, which are, on average, shorter than what we
had previously used primarily due to the age and condition of
our fixed assets.

Depreciation and amortization expense for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 was
$11.8 million. Depreciation and amortization expense
consists of the allocation of our newly valued basis in our
fixed assets over newly determined remaining fixed asset lives.

Predecessor Company

Our depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing
operations for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 was $218.8 million. During this
period, depreciation expense was unfavorably impacted by the
shortening of the depreciable lives of certain of our domestic
power generation facilities located in the Northeast region and
the impact of recently completed construction projects. The
depreciable lives of certain of our Northeast facilities,
primarily our Connecticut facilities, were shortened to reflect
economic developments in that region. Certain capitalized
development costs were written-off in connection with the Loy
Yang project resulting in increased expense. Amortization
expense increased due to reducing the life of certain software
costs.

General, Administrative and Development

Reorganized NRG

Our general, administrative and development costs related to
continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004
were $211.2 million. Of this total, $111.1 million or
4.7% of revenues from majority-owned operations represents our
corporate costs, with the remaining $100.1 million
representing costs at our plant operations. Corporate costs are
primarily comprised of corporate labor, external professional
support, such as legal, accounting and audit fees, and office
expenses. Corporate general, administrative and development
expenses were negatively impacted this year by increased legal
fees, increased audit costs and increased consulting costs due
to our Sarbanes Oxley testing and implementation. Plant general,
administrative and development costs primarily include insurance
and external consulting costs. Plant insurance costs were
$40.6 million. Additionally, we recorded $11.7 million
in bad debt expense related to notes receivable.

General, administrative and development costs were
$12.5 million, or 9.0% of revenues from continuing
operations for the period December 6, 2003 to
December 31, 2003. These costs are primarily comprised of
corporate labor, insurance and external professional support,
such as legal, accounting and audit fees.



Predecessor Company

Our general, administrative and development costs related to
continuing operations for the period January 1, 2003 to
December 5, 2003 were $170.3 million or 9.5% of
revenues from majority-owned operations. These costs are
primarily comprised of corporate labor, insurance and external
professional support, such as legal, accounting and audit fees.

Other Charges (Credits)

Reorganized NRG

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded other
charges of $47.4 million, which consisted of
$16.2 million of corporate relocation charges,
$13.4 million of reorganization credits and
$44.6 million of restructuring and impairment charges.

For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31,
2003 we recorded $2.5 million of reorganization charges.

Predecessor Company

During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003,
we recorded other credits of $3.2 billion, which consisted
primarily of $228.9 million related to asset impairments,
$462.6 million related to legal settlements,
$197.8 million related to reorganization charges and
$8.7 million related to restructuring charges. We also
incurred a $4.1 billion credit related to Fresh Start
adjustments.

Corporate Relocation Charges

On March 16, 2004, we announced plans to implement a new
regional business strategy and structure. The new structure
called for a reorganized leadership team and a corporate
headquarters relocation to Princeton, New Jersey. The corporate
headquarters staff were streamlined as part of the relocation,
as functions were either reduced or shifted to the regions. The
transition of the corporate headquarters is substantially
complete. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we
recorded $16.2 million for charges related to our corporate
relocation activities, primarily for employee severance and
termination benefits and employee related transition costs.
These charges are classified separately in our statement of
operations, in accordance with SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities”.

We expect to incur an additional
$7.7 million of SFAS No. 146-classified expenses
in connection with corporate relocation charges for a total of
$23.9 million. Of this total, relocating, recruiting and
other employee-related transition costs are expected to be
approximately $11.9 million and have been and will continue
to be expensed as incurred. These costs and cash payments are
expected to be incurred through the second quarter of 2005.
Severance and termination benefits of $7.2 million are
expected to be incurred through the second quarter of



2005 with cash payments being made through the fourth quarter of
2005. Building lease termination costs are expected to be
$4.8 million. These costs are expected to be incurred
through the first quarter of 2005 with cash payments being made
through the fourth quarter of 2006. Costs not classified
separately as relocation charges include rent expense of our
temporary office in Princeton, construction costs of our new
office and certain labor costs. All costs relating to the
corporate relocation that are not classified separately as
relocation charges, except for approximately $5.7 million
of related capital expenditures will be expensed as incurred and
included in general, administrative and development expenses.
Cash expenditures for 2004, including capital expenditures, were
$22.4 million. We currently estimate total costs associated
with the corporate relocation to be approximately
$40.0 million.

We recognized a curtailment gain of $750,000 on our defined
benefit pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2004, as a
substantial number of our current headquarters staff left the
Company in this period.

Reorganization Items

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded a net
credit of $13.4 million related primarily to the settlement
of obligations recorded under Fresh Start. We incurred
$7.4 million of professional fees associated with the
bankruptcy which offset $20.8 million of credits associated
with creditor settlements. For the periods December 6, 2003
to December 31, 2003 and January 1, 2003 to
December 5, 2003, we incurred $2.5 million and
$197.8 million, respectively, in reorganization costs. All
reorganization costs have been incurred since we filed for
bankruptcy in May 2003. The following table provides the detail
of the types of costs incurred.

Impairment Charges

We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets in
accordance with the guidelines of SFAS No. 144. As a
result of this review, we recorded impairment charges of
$44.7 million and $228.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 and the period January 1, 2003
through December 5, 2003, respectively, as shown in the
table below. Of the $44.7 million total in 2004, Kendall
and the Meriden turbine accounted for $26.5 million and
$15.0 million, respectively. Both of these charges were
based on indicative market valuations. We successfully completed
the sale of Kendall in November 2004 and expect to complete the
sale of the Meriden turbine in the first quarter of 2005. There
were no impairment charges for the period December 6, 2003
through December 31, 2003.

To determine whether an asset was impaired, we compared asset
carrying values to total future estimated undiscounted cash
flows. Separate analyses were completed for assets or groups of
assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows
were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and
liabilities. The estimates of future cash flows included only
future cash flows, net of associated cash outflows, directly
associated with and expected to arise as a result of our assumed
use and eventual disposition of the asset. Cash flow estimates
associated with assets in service were based on the asset’s
existing service potential. The cash



flow estimates may include probability weightings to consider
possible alternative courses of action and outcomes, given the
uncertainty of available information and prospective market
conditions.

If an asset was determined to be impaired based on the cash flow
testing performed, an impairment loss was recorded to write down
the asset to its fair value. Estimates of fair value were based
on prices for similar assets and present value techniques. Fair
values determined by similar asset prices reflect our current
estimate of recoverability from expected marketing of project
assets. For fair values determined by projected cash flows, the
fair value represents a discounted cash flow amount over the
remaining life of each project that reflects project-specific
assumptions for long-term power pool prices, escalated future
project operating costs, and expected plant operation given
assumed market conditions.

Impairment charges (credits) included the following asset
impairments (realized gains) for the year ended
December 31, 2004 and the period January 1, 2003 to
December 5, 2003.

Restructuring Charges

We incurred $8.7 million of employee separation costs and
advisor fees during the period January 1, 2003 until we
filed for bankruptcy in May 2003. Subsequent to that date we
recorded all advisor fees as reorganization costs.



Fresh Start Adjustments

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a net credit of
$3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from
continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from
discontinued operations) in connection with fresh start
adjustments. Following is a summary of the significant effects
of the reorganization and Fresh Start:

Legal Settlement Charges

During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003,
we recorded $462.6 million of legal settlement charges
which consisted of the following. We recorded
$396.0 million in connection with the resolution of an
arbitration claim asserted by FirstEnergy Corp. As a result of
this resolution, FirstEnergy retained ownership of the Lake
Plant Assets and received an allowed general unsecured claim of
$396.0 million under NRG Energy’s Plan of
Reorganization. In November 2003, we settled litigation with
Fortistar Capital in which Fortistar Capital released us from
all litigation claims in exchange for a $60.0 million
pre-petition bankruptcy claim and an $8.0 million
post-petition bankruptcy claim. We had previously recorded
$10.8 million in connection with various legal disputes
with Fortistar Capital; accordingly, we recorded an additional
$57.2 million during November 2003. In November 2003, we
settled our dispute with Dick Corporation in connection with
Meriden Gas Turbines LLC through the payment of a general
unsecured claim and a post-petition pre-confirmation payment.
This settlement resulted in our recording an additional
liability of $8.0 million in November 2003.

In August 1995, we entered into a Marketing, Development and
Joint Proposing Agreement, or the Marketing Agreement, with
Cambrian Energy Development LLC, or Cambrian. Various claims
arose in connection with the Marketing Agreement. In November
2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with Cambrian where
we agreed to transfer our 100% interest in three gasco projects
(NEO Ft. Smith, NEO Phoenix and NEO Woodville) and our 50%
interest in two genco projects (MM Phoenix and MM Woodville) to
Cambrian. In addition, we paid approximately $1.8 million
in settlement of royalties incurred in connection with the
Marketing Agreement. We had previously recorded a liability for
royalties owed to Cambrian, therefore, we recorded an additional
$1.4 million during November 2003.

Other Income (Expense)

Reorganized NRG

During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded other
expense of $171.9 million. Other expense consisted
primarily of $269.4 million of interest expense,
$71.6 million of refinancing-related expenses,
$1.0 million of minority interest in earnings of
consolidated subsidiaries and $16.3 million of write downs
and losses on sales of equity method investments, offset by
$159.8 million of equity in earnings of unconsolidated
affiliates (including $68.9 million from our investment in
West Coast Power LLC) and $26.6 million of other income,
net.



Other income (expense) for the period December 6, 2003
through December 31, 2003, was an expense of
$5.4 million and consisted primarily of $18.9 million
of interest expense, partially offset by $13.5 million of
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.

Predecessor Company

During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003, we recorded other expense of $286.9 million. Other
expense consisted primarily of $329.9 million of interest
expense and $147.1 million of write downs and losses on
sales of equity method investments, partially offset by equity
in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $170.9 million
and $19.2 million of other income, net.

Minority Interest in Earnings of Consolidated Subsidiaries

For the year ended December 31, 2004, minority interest in
earnings of consolidated subsidiaries was $1.0 million
which relates primarily to our ownership interests in Northbrook
Energy, LLC and Northbrook New York, LLC, partnerships which
hold a portfolio of small hydro projects. For the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, minority
interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries was $134,000
and relates primarily to Northbrook New York and Northbrook
Energy.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates

Reorganized NRG

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded
$159.8 million of equity earnings from our investments in
unconsolidated affiliates. Our equity in earnings of West Coast
Power comprised $68.9 million of this amount with our
equity in earnings of Enfield, Mibrag, and Gladstone comprising
$28.5 million, $20.9 million, and $17.5 million,
respectively. Our investment in West Coast Power generated
favorable results due to the pricing under the California
Department of Water Resources contract. Additionally, revenues
from ancillary services revenue and minimum load cost
compensation power positively contributed to West Coast
Power’s operating results. However, our equity earnings in
the project as reported in our results of operations have been
reduced by a net $115.8 million to reflect a non-cash basis
adjustment for in the money contracts resulting from adoption of
Fresh Start.

NRG Energy’s equity earnings were also favorably
impacted by $23.3 million of unrealized gain related to our
Enfield investment. This gain is associated with changes in the
fair value of energy-related derivative instruments not
accounted for as hedges in accordance with
SFAS No. 133.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of
$13.5 million for the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 consists primarily of equity earnings
from our 50% ownership in West Coast Power of $9.4 million.

Predecessor Company

During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003, we recorded $170.9 million of equity earnings from
investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Our 50% investment in
West Coast Power comprised $98.7 million of this amount
with our investments in the Mibrag, Loy Yang, Gladstone and
Rocky Road projects comprising $21.8 million,
$17.9 million, $12.4 million and $6.9 million,
respectively, with the remaining amounts attributable to various
domestic and international equity investments.



Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates consists of the
following:

Write Downs and Losses on Sales of Equity Method
    Investments

As part of our periodic review of our equity method investments
for impairments, we have taken write downs and losses on sales
of equity method investments during the year ended
December 31, 2004 of $16.3 million and
$147.1 million for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003. Our Commonwealth Atlantic Limited
Partnership (CALP) and James River investments were written
down based on indicative market bids. The sale of CALP closed in
the fourth quarter of 2004, while the sale agreement for James
River has been terminated. There were no write downs and losses
on sales of equity method investments for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003.



Write downs and losses (gains) on sales of equity method
investments recorded in the consolidated statement of operations
include the following:

Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership
(CALP)

— In June 2004, we executed an agreement to
sell our 50% interest in CALP. During the third quarter of 2004,
we recorded an impairment charge of approximately
$3.7 million to write down the value of our investment in
CALP to its fair value. The sale closed in November 2004,
resulting in net cash proceeds of $14.9 million. Total
impairment charges as a result of the sale were
$4.6 million.

James River Power LLC

— In September 2004, we
executed an agreement with Colonial Power Company LLC to sell
all of our outstanding shares of stock in Capistrano
Cogeneration Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
NRG Energy which owns a 50% interest in James River
Cogeneration Company. During the third quarter of 2004, we
recorded an impairment charge of approximately $6.0 million
to write down the value of our investment in James River to its
fair value. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the sale
agreement was terminated. We continue to impair any additional
equity earnings based on its fair value. Total impairment
charges for 2004 were $7.3 million.

NEO Corporation

— On September 30, 2004,
we completed the sale of several NEO investments —
Four Hills LLC, Minnesota Methane II LLC, NEO Montauk Genco
LLC and NEO Montauk Gasco LLC to Algonquin Power of Canada. The
sale also included four wholly-owned NEO subsidiaries (see
Item 15 — Note 6). We received cash proceeds
of $6.1 million. The sale resulted in a loss of
approximately $3.8 million attributable to the equity
investment entities sold.

Calpine Cogeneration

— In January 2004, we
executed an agreement to sell our 20% interest in Calpine
Cogeneration Corporation to Calpine Power Company. The
transaction closed in March 2004 and resulted in net cash
proceeds of $2.5 million and a net gain of
$0.2 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we
received additional consideration on the sale of
$0.5 million, resulting in an adjusted net gain of
$0.7 million.

NLGI — Minnesota Methane —

We
recorded an impairment charge of $12.3 million during 2002
to write-down our 50% investment in Minnesota Methane. We
recorded an additional impairment charge of $14.5 million
during the first quarter of 2003. These charges were related to
a revised project outlook and management’s belief that the
decline in fair value was other than temporary. In May 2003, the
project lenders to the wholly-owned subsidiaries of NEO Landfill
Gas, Inc. and Minnesota Methane LLC foreclosed on our membership
interest in the NEO Landfill Gas, Inc. subsidiaries and our
equity interest in Minnesota Methane LLC. Upon completion of the
foreclosure, we recorded a gain of $2.2 million, resulting
in a net impairment



charge of $12.3 million for the period January 1, 2003
to December 5, 2003. This gain resulted from the release of
certain obligations.

NLGI — MM Biogas —

We recorded an
impairment charge of $3.2 million during 2002 to write-down
our 50% investment in MM Biogas. This charge was related to a
revised project outlook and management’s belief that the
decline in fair value was other than temporary. In November
2003, we entered into a sales agreement with Cambrian Energy
Development to sell our 50% interest in MM Biogas. We recorded
an additional impairment charge of $2.6 million during the
fourth quarter of 2003 due to developments related to the sale
that indicated an impairment of our book value that was
considered to be other than temporary.

Kondapalli

— In the fourth quarter of 2002, we
wrote down our investment in Kondapalli by $12.7 million
due to recent estimates of sales value, which indicated an
impairment of our book value that was considered to be other
than temporary. On January 30, 2003, we signed a sale
agreement with the Genting Group of Malaysia, or Genting, to
sell our 30% interest in Lanco Kondapalli Power Pvt Ltd, or
Kondapalli, and a 74% interest in Eastern Generation Services
(India) Pvt Ltd (the O&M company). Kondapalli is based in
Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India, and is the owner of a
368 MW natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine. In the
first quarter of 2003, we wrote down our investment in
Kondapalli by $1.3 million based on the final sale
agreement. The sale closed on May 30, 2003 resulting in net
cash proceeds of approximately $24 million and a gain of
approximately $1.8 million, resulting in a net gain of
$0.5 million. The gain resulted from incurring lower
selling costs than estimated as part of the first quarter
impairment.

ECKG

— In September 2002, we announced that we
had reached agreement to sell our 44.5% interest in the ECKG
power station in connection with our Csepel power generating
facilities, and our interest in Entrade, an electricity trading
business, to Atel, an independent energy group headquartered in
Switzerland. The transaction closed in January 2003 and resulted
in cash proceeds of $65.3 million and a net loss of less
than $1.0 million. In accordance with the purchase
agreement, we were to receive additional consideration if Atel
purchased shares held by our partner. During the second quarter
of 2003, we received approximately $3.7 million of
additional consideration, resulting in a net gain of
$2.9 million.

Loy Yang

— Based on a third party market
valuation and bids received in response to marketing Loy Yang
for possible sale, we recorded a write down of our investment of
approximately $111.4 million during 2002. This write-down
reflected management’s belief that the decline in fair
value of the investment was other than temporary. In May 2003,
we entered into negotiations that culminated in the completion
of a Share Purchase Agreement to sell 100% of the Loy Yang
project. Consequently, we recorded an additional impairment
charge of approximately $146.4 million during 2003. In
April 2004, we completed the sale of Loy Yang which resulted in
net cash proceeds of $26.7 million and a loss of
$1.3 million.

Mustang Station

— On July 7, 2003, we
completed the sale of our 25% interest in Mustang Station, a
gas-fired combined cycle power generating plant located in
Denver City, Texas, to EIF Mustang Holdings I, LLC. The
sale resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately
$13.3 million and a net gain of approximately
$12.1 million.

Other Income, net

Reorganized NRG

During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded
$26.6 million of other income, net, consisting primarily of
interest income earned on notes receivable and cash balances.
For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31,
2003 we recorded other income of $97,000.

Predecessor Company

During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003, we recorded $19.2 million of other income, net.
During this period other income, net consisted primarily of
interest income earned on notes receivable and cash balances,
offset in part by the unfavorable mark-to-market on our
corporate level £160 million note that was cancelled
in connection with our bankruptcy proceedings.



Interest Expense

Reorganized NRG

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was
$269.4 million, consisting of interest expense on both our
project- and corporate-level interest-bearing debt. Significant
amounts of our corporate-level debt were forgiven upon our
emergence from bankruptcy and we refinanced significant amounts
of our project-level debt with corporate level high yield notes
and term loans in December 2003. Also included in interest
expense is the amortization of debt financing costs of
$9.2 million related to our corporate level debt and
$13.3 million of amortization expense related primarily to
debt discounts and premiums recorded as part of Fresh Start.
Interest expense also includes the impact of any interest rate
swaps that we have entered in order to manage our exposure to
changes in interest rates.

Interest expense for the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 of $18.9 million consists primarily
of interest expense at the corporate level, primarily related to
the Second Priority Notes, term loan facility and revolving line
of credit used to refinance certain project-level financings. In
addition, interest expense includes the amortization of deferred
financing costs incurred as a result of our refinancing efforts
and the amortization of discounts and premiums recorded upon the
marking of our debt to fair value upon our adoption of the Fresh
Start provision of SOP 90-7.

Predecessor Company

Interest expense for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 of $329.9 million consisted of
interest expense on both our project and corporate level
interest bearing debt. In addition, interest expense includes
the amortization of debt issuance costs and any interest rate
swap termination costs. Interest expense during this period was
favorably impacted by our ceasing to record interest expense on
debt where it was probable that such interest would not be paid,
such as the NRG Energy corporate level debt (primarily
bonds) and the NRG Finance Company debt (construction revolver)
due to our entering into bankruptcy in May 2003. We did not
however cease to record interest expense on the project-level
debt outstanding at our Northeast Generating and South Central
Generating facilities even though these entities were also in
bankruptcy as these claims were deemed to be most likely not
impaired and not subject to compromise. We also recorded
substantial amounts of fees and costs related to our acquiring a
debtor in possession financing arrangement while we were in
bankruptcy. In addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy we
wrote off any remaining deferred finance costs related to our
corporate and project-level debt including our Northeast and
South Central project-level debt as it was probable that they
would be refinanced upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Interest
expense was unfavorably impacted by an adverse mark-to-market on
certain interest rate swaps that we have entered in order to
manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Due to our
deteriorating financial condition during such period, hedge
accounting treatment was ceased for certain of our interest rate
swaps, causing changes in fair value to be recorded as interest
expense.

Refinancing Expense

Refinancing expense was $71.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. This amount includes $15.1 million
of prepayment penalties and a $15.3 million write-off of
deferred financing costs related to refinancing certain amounts
of our term loans with additional corporate level high yield
notes in January 2004 and $13.8 million of prepayment
penalties and a $26.8 million write-off of deferred
financing costs related to refinancing the senior credit
facility in December 2004.

Income Tax Expense

Reorganized NRG

Our income tax provision from continuing operations was
$65.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and
an income tax benefit of ($0.7) million for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. The
overall effective tax rate in 2004 and the short period in 2003
was 28.7% and (6.2%), respectively.



The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a
state tax refund received from Xcel Energy in 2003 and foreign
income taxed in jurisdictions with tax rates different from the
U.S. statutory rate.

Our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2004 were
offset by a full valuation allowance in accordance with
SFAS No. 109. Under SOP 90-7, any future benefits
from reducing a valuation allowance from preconfirmation
deferred tax assets are required to be reported first as an
adjustment of identifiable intangible assets and then as a
direct addition to paid in capital versus a benefit on our
statement of operations.

The effective tax rate may vary from year to year depending on,
among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings
and losses. These same and other factors, including history of
pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing
the ability to realize deferred tax assets.

Predecessor Company

Income tax expense for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 was $37.9 million. The overall
effective tax rate for the period ended December 5, 2003
was 1.3%. The rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate
primarily due to a release in valuation allowance for net
operating loss carryforwards that were utilized following our
emergence from bankruptcy to offset the current tax on
cancellation of debt income.

Income taxes have been recorded on the basis that our
U.S. subsidiaries and we would file separate federal income
tax returns for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003. Since our U.S. subsidiaries and we
were not included in the Xcel Energy consolidated tax group,
each of our U.S. subsidiaries that is classified as a
corporation for U.S. income tax purposes filed a separate
federal income tax return. It is uncertain if, on a stand-alone
basis, we would be able to fully realize deferred tax assets
related to net operating losses and other temporary differences,
therefore a full valuation allowance has been established.

Income From Discontinued Operations, net of Income Taxes

Reorganized NRG

We classified as discontinued operations the operations and
gains/losses recognized on the sale of projects that were sold
or were deemed to have met the required criteria for such
classification pending final disposition. During the year ended
December 31, 2004, we recorded income from discontinued
operations, net of income taxes, of $23.5 million. During
the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the period
December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003, discontinued
operations consisted of the results of our NRG McClain LLC,
Penobscot Energy Recovery Company, or PERC, Compania Boliviana
De Energia Electrica S.A. Bolivian Power Company Limited, or
Cobee, Hsin Yu, LSP Energy (Batesville) and four NEO Corporation
projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO Prima
Deshecha LLC and NEO Tajiguas LLC). All other discontinued
operations were disposed of in prior periods. The
$23.5 million income from discontinued operations includes
a gain of $22.4 million, net of income taxes of
$7.9 million, related primarily to the dispositions of
Batesville, Cobee and Hsin Yu.

Discontinued operations for the period December 6, 2003
through December 31, 2003 is comprised of a loss of
$0.4 million attributable to the on going operations of our
McClain, PERC, Cobee, LSP Energy, Hsin Yu and four NEO
Corporation projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO
Prima Deshecha LLC and NEO Tajiguas LLC).

Predecessor Company

As of December 5, 2003, we classified as discontinued
operations the operations and gains/losses recognized on the
sales of projects that were sold or were deemed to have met the
required criteria for such classification pending final
disposition. For the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003, discontinued operations consist of the
historical operations and net gains/losses related to our
Killingholme, McClain, PERC, Cobee, NEO Landfill Gas, Inc., or
NLGI, seven NEO Corporation projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO
Hackensack LLC, NEO Prima Deshecha LLC, NEO Tajiguas LLC, NEO
Ft. Smith LLC, NEO



Woodville LLC and NEO Phoenix LLC), Timber Energy Resources,
Inc., or TERI, Cahua, Energia Pacasmayo, LSP Energy and Hsin Yu
projects.

For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003, the results of operations related to such discontinued
operations was a net loss of $182.6 million due to a loss
on the sale of our Peru projects, impairment charges of
$100.7 million and $23.6 million, respectively,
recorded at McClain and NLGI and fresh start adjustments at LSP
Energy.

For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to the
    Year Ended December 31, 2002

Net Income

Reorganized NRG

During the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003, we recognized net income of
$11.0 million or $0.11 per share of common stock. Net
income was directly attributable to a number of factors some of
which are discussed below. From an overall operational
perspective our facilities were profitable during this period.
Our results were adversely impacted by our having to continue to
satisfy the standard offer service contract that we entered into
with Connecticut Light & Power, or CL&P, in 2000.
As a result of our inability to terminate this contract during
our bankruptcy proceeding, we continued to be exposed to losses
under this contract. These losses were incurred, as we were
unable to satisfy the requirements of this contract at a
price/cost below the contracted sales price. Upon our adoption
of Fresh Start, we recorded at fair value all assets and
liabilities on our opening balance sheet and accordingly we
recorded as an obligation the fair value of the CL&P
contract. During the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003, we recognized as revenues the entire
fair value of this contract effectively offsetting the actual
losses incurred under this contract. The CL&P contract
terminated on December 31, 2003.

Predecessor Company

During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003, we recorded net income of $2.8 billion. Net income
for the period is directly attributable to our emerging from
bankruptcy and adopting the Fresh Start provisions of
SOP 90-7. Upon the confirmation of our Plan of
Reorganization and our emergence from bankruptcy we were able to
remove significant amounts of long-term debt and other
pre-petition obligations from our balance sheet. Accordingly, as
part of net income, we recorded a net gain of $3.9 billion
(comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from continuing
operations and a $0.2 billion loss from discontinued
operations) as the impact of our adopting Fresh Start in our
statement of operations. $6.0 billion of this amount is
directly related to the forgiveness of debt and settlement of
substantial amounts of our pre-petition obligations upon our
emergence from bankruptcy. In addition to the removal of
substantial amounts of pre-petition debt and other obligations
from our balance sheet, we have also revalued our assets and
liabilities to fair value. Accordingly, we have substantially
written down the value of our fixed assets. We have recorded a
net $1.6 billion charge related to the revaluation of our
assets and liabilities within the Fresh Start Reporting
adjustment line of our consolidated statement of operations. In
addition to our recording adjustments related to our emergence
from bankruptcy, we also recorded substantial charges related to
other items such as the settlement of certain outstanding
litigation in the amount of $462.6 million, write downs and
losses on the sale of equity investments of $147.1 million,
advisor costs and legal fees directly attributable to our being
in bankruptcy of $197.8 million and $237.6 million of
other asset impairment and restructuring costs incurred prior to
our filing for bankruptcy. Net income for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 was favorably
impacted by our not recording interest expense on substantial
amounts of corporate level debt while we were in bankruptcy and
by the continued favorable results experienced by our equity
investments.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized a
net loss of $3.5 billion. The loss from continuing
operations incurred during 2002 primarily consisted of
$2.6 billion of other charges consisting primarily of asset
impairments.



Revenues from Majority-Owned Operations

Reorganized NRG

Our operating revenues from majority-owned operations were
$138.5 million for the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003.

Predecessor Company

Revenues from majority-owned operations were $1.8 billion
for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003 and include $992.6 million of energy revenues,
$566.0 million of capacity revenues, $115.9 million of
alternative energy, $12.9 million of O&M fees and
$110.9 million of other revenues which include financial
and physical gas sales, sales from our Schkopau facility and
NEPOOL expense reimbursements. Revenues from majority-owned
operations during the period year ended December 5, 2003,
were driven primarily by our North American operations and to a
lesser degree by our international operations, primarily
Australia. Our domestic Northeast and South Central power
generation operations significantly contributed to our revenues
due primarily to favorable market prices resulting from strong
fuel and electricity prices. Our Australian operations were
favorably impacted by favorable foreign exchange rates. During
this period we also experienced an unfavorable impact on our
revenues due to continued losses on our CL&P standard offer
contract and the mark-to-market on certain of our derivatives.

Revenues from majority-owned operations were $1.9 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Cost of Majority-Owned Operations

Reorganized NRG

Our cost of majority-owned operations for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 was
$95.5 million or 69.0% of revenues from majority-owned
operations.

Predecessor Company

Cost of majority-owned operations was $1.4 billion, or
75.4% of revenues from majority-owned operations for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. Cost of
majority-owned operations was unfavorably impacted by increased
generation in the Northeast region, partially offset by a
reduction in trading and hedging activity resulting from a
reduction in our power marketing activities. Our international
operations were unfavorably impacted due to an unfavorable
movement in foreign exchange rates and continued mark-to-market
of the Osborne contract at Flinders resulting from lower pool
prices.

Our cost of majority-owned operations related to continuing
operations was $1.3 billion for 2002, or 68.7% of revenues
from majority-owned operations. Cost of majority-owned
operations, consists primarily of cost of energy (primarily fuel
costs), labor, operating and maintenance costs and non-income
based taxes related to our majority-owned operations. Cost of
energy for the year ended December 31, 2002 was
$900.9 million or 46.5% of revenue from majority-owned
operations.

Depreciation and Amortization

Reorganized NRG

Our depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing
operations was $11.8 million for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003.
Depreciation and amortization expense consists of the allocation
of our newly valued basis in our fixed assets over newly
determined remaining fixed asset lives. As part of adopting the
Fresh Start concepts of SOP 90-7, our tangible fixed assets
were recorded at fair value as determined by a third party
valuation expert who we also consulted with in determining the
appropriate remaining lives for our tangible depreciable
property. Depreciation expense for this period was based on
preliminary depreciable lives and asset balances.



Predecessor Company

Our depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing
operations was $218.8 million for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and
$207.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003,
depreciation expense was unfavorably impacted by the shortening
of the depreciable lives of certain of our domestic power
generation facilities located in the Northeast region and the
impact of completed construction projects. Depreciation and
amortization consists of the allocation of our historical
depreciable fixed asset costs over the remaining lives of such
property as well as the amortization of certain contract based
intangible assets.

General, Administrative and Development

Reorganized NRG

Our general, administrative and development costs for the period
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 was
$12.5 million or 9.0% of revenues from majority-owned
operations. These costs are primarily comprised of corporate
labor, insurance and external professional support, such as
legal, accounting and audit fees.

Predecessor Company

Our general, administrative and development costs for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 were
$170.3 million, or 9.5% of revenues from majority-owned
operations. Our general, administrative and development costs
for 2002 were $218.9 million, or 11.3% of revenues from
majority-owned operations. General, administrative and
development costs for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 were favorably impacted by decreased costs
related to work force reduction efforts, cost reductions due to
the closure of certain international offices and reduced legal
costs. Outside services also decreased, due to less
non-restructuring legal activities.

Other Charges (Credits)

Reorganized NRG

During the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 we recorded $2.5 million of other
charges related to reorganization items.

Predecessor Company

During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003,
we recorded other credits of $3.2 billion, which consisted
primarily of $228.9 million related to asset impairments,
$462.6 million related to legal settlements,
$197.8 million related to reorganization charges and
$8.7 million related to restructuring charges. We also
incurred a $4.1 billion credit related to Fresh Start
adjustments. During 2002, we recorded other charges of
$2.6 billion, which consisted primarily of
$2.5 billion related to asset impairments and
$111.3 million related to restructuring charges.

We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets on a
periodic basis and if we determined that an asset was impaired,
we compared asset-carrying values to total future estimated
undiscounted cash flows. Separate analyses are completed for
assets or groups of assets at the lowest level for which
identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash
flows of other assets and liabilities. The estimates of future
cash flows included only future cash flows, net of associated
cash outflows, directly associated with and expected to arise as
a result of our assumed use and eventual disposition of the
asset. Cash flow estimates associated with assets in service are
based on the asset’s existing service potential. The cash
flow estimates may include probability weightings to consider
possible alternative courses of action and outcomes, given the
uncertainty of available information and prospective market
conditions.

If an asset was determined to be impaired based on the cash flow
testing performed, an impairment loss was recorded to write down
the asset to its fair value. Estimates of fair value were based
on prices for similar



assets and present value techniques. Fair values determined by
similar asset prices reflect our current estimate of
recoverability from expected marketing of project assets. For
fair values determined by projected cash flows, the fair value
represents a discounted cash flow amount over the remaining life
of each project that reflects project-specific assumptions for
long-term power pool prices, escalated future project operating
costs, and expected plant operation given assumed market
conditions.

Impairment charges (credits) included the following for the
period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003 and the
year ended December 31, 2002. There were no impairment
charges for the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003.



Reorganization Items

For the period from December 6, 2003 to December 31,
2003 we incurred $2.5 million in reorganization costs. For
the period from January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003,
we incurred $197.8 million in reorganization costs. All
reorganization costs have been incurred since we filed for
bankruptcy in May 2003. The following table provides the detail
of the types of costs incurred (in thousands):

Restructuring Charges

We incurred $8.7 million of employee separation costs and
advisor fees during the period January 1, 2003 until we
filed for bankruptcy in May 2003. Subsequent to that date we
recorded all advisor fees as reorganization costs. We incurred
total restructuring charges of approximately $111.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002. These costs consisted
of employee separation costs and advisor fees.

Legal Settlement Charges

During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003,
we recorded $462.6 million of legal settlement charges
which consisted of the following. We recorded
$396.0 million in connection with the resolution of an
arbitration claim asserted by FirstEnergy Corp. As a result of
this resolution, FirstEnergy retained ownership of the Lake
Plant Assets and received an allowed general unsecured claim of
$396.0 million under NRG Energy’s plan of
reorganization. In November 2003, we settled litigation with
Fortistar Capital in which Fortistar Capital released us from
all litigation claims in exchange for a $60.0 million
pre-petition bankruptcy claim and an $8.0 million
post-petition bankruptcy claim. We had previously recorded
$10.8 million in connection with various legal disputes
with Fortistar Capital; accordingly, we recorded an additional
$57.2 million during November 2003. In November 2003, we
settled our dispute with Dick Corporation in connection with
Meriden Gas Turbines LLC through the payment of a general
unsecured claim and a post-petition pre-confirmation payment.
This settlement resulted in our recording an additional
liability of $8.0 million in November 2003.

In August 1995, we entered into a Marketing, Development and
Joint Proposing Agreement, or the Marketing Agreement, with
Cambrian Energy Development LLC, or Cambrian. Various claims
arose in connection with the Marketing Agreement. In November
2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with Cambrian where
we agreed to transfer our 100% interest in three gasco projects
(NEO Ft. Smith, NEO Phoenix and NEO Woodville) and our 50%
interest in two genco projects (MM Phoenix and MM Woodville) to
Cambrian. In addition, we paid approximately $1.8 million
in settlement of royalties incurred in connection with the
Marketing Agreement. We had previously recorded a liability for
royalties owed to Cambrian, therefore, we recorded an additional
$1.4 million during November 2003.



Fresh Start Adjustments

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a net credit of
$3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from
continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from
discontinued operations) in connection with fresh start
adjustments. Following is a summary of the significant effects
of the reorganization and Fresh Start:

Other Income (Expense)

Reorganized NRG

Other income (expense) for the period December 6, 2003
through December 31, 2003, was an expense of
$5.4 million and consisted primarily of $18.9 million
of interest expense, partially offset by $13.5 million of
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.

Predecessor Company

During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003, we recorded other expense of $286.9 million. Other
expense consisted primarily of $329.9 million of interest
expense and $147.1 million of write downs and losses on
sales of equity method investments, partially offset by equity
in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $170.9 million
and $19.2 million of other income.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, other expenses were
$572.2 million, which consisted primarily of
$452.2 million of interest expense and $200.5 million
of write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments,
partially offset by equity in earnings of unconsolidated
affiliates of $69.0 million and other income, net of
$11.5 million.

Minority Interest in Earnings of Consolidated Subsidiaries

For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31,
2003, minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries
was $134,000 and relates primarily to Northbrook New York and
Northbrook Energy.



Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates

Reorganized NRG

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of
$13.5 million for the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 consists primarily of equity earnings
from our 50% ownership in West Coast Power of $9.4 million.

Predecessor Company

During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003, we recorded $170.9 million of equity earnings from
investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Our 50% investment in
West Coast Power comprised $98.7 million of this amount
with our investments in the Mibrag, Loy Yang, Gladstone and
Rocky Road projects comprising $21.8 million,
$17.9 million, $12.4 million and $6.9 million,
respectively, with the remaining amounts attributable to various
domestic and international equity investments. Our investment in
West Coast Power continues to generate favorable earnings as
well as our investments in Mibrag, Loy Yang, Gladstone and Rocky
Road. For the year ended December 31, 2002, equity earnings
from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was
$69.0 million.

Write-Downs and Losses on Sales of Equity Method
    Investments

As we periodically review our equity method investments for
impairments, we have taken substantial write-downs and losses on
sales of equity method investments during the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and for the
year 2002. During the period January 1, 2003 to
December 5, 2003, we recorded impairments and losses on the
sales of investments of $147.1 million compared to
$200.5 million in 2002. The $147.1 million recorded in
2003 consists primarily of the write down of our investment in
the Loy Yang project of $146.4 million, our investment in
the NEO Corporation — Minnesota Methane project of
$12.3 million and our investment in NEO
Corporation — MM Biogas of $2.6 million. These
losses were partially offset by gains on the sale of our
investment in the ECKG and Mustang projects of $2.9 million
and $12.1 million, respectively. During 2002 we recorded
write-downs and losses on sales of equity method investments of
$200.5 million. The $200.5 million recorded in 2002
consists primarily of a write down of our investment in the Loy
Yang project of $111.4 million, a loss of
$48.4 million on the transfer of our interest in the Sabine
River Works project to our partner, a $14.2 million write
down related to our investment in our EDL project, a write down
of our investment in our Kondapalli project of
$12.7 million and a write down of our investment in NEO
Corporation — Minnesota Methane and MM Biogas of
$12.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively among
others, offset by a $9.9 million gain on sale of our
Kingston project.

Other income, net

Other income, net consists primarily of interest income earned
on notes receivable and cash balances. We recorded $97,000,
$19.2 million and $11.4 million of other income, net
for the periods December 6, 2003 through December 31,
2003 and January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and
for the year ended December 31, 2002, respectively.

Interest expense

Reorganized NRG

Interest expense for the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 of $18.9 million consists primarily
of interest expense at the corporate level, primarily related to
the Second Priority Notes, term loan facility and revolving line
of credit used to refinance certain project-level financings. In
addition, interest expense includes the amortization of deferred
financing costs incurred as a result of our refinancing efforts
and the amortization of discounts and premiums recorded upon the
marking of our debt to fair value upon our adoption of the Fresh
Start provision of SOP 90-7.



Predecessor Company

Interest expense for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003 of $329.9 million consisted of
interest expense on both our project and corporate level
interest bearing debt. In addition, interest expense includes
the amortization of debt issuance costs and any interest rate
swap termination costs. Subsequent to our entering into
bankruptcy we ceased the recording of interest expense on our
corporate level debt as these pre-petition claims were deemed to
be impaired and subject to compromise. We did not however cease
to record interest expense on the project-level debt outstanding
at our Northeast Generating and South Central Generating
facilities even though these entities were also in bankruptcy as
these claims were deemed to be most likely not impaired and not
subject to compromise. We also recorded substantial amounts of
fees and costs related to our acquiring a debtor in possession
financing arrangement while we were in bankruptcy. In addition,
upon our emergence from bankruptcy we wrote off any remaining
deferred finance costs related to our corporate and
project-level debt including our Northeast and South Central
project-level debt as it was probable that they would be
refinanced upon our emergence from bankruptcy.

Interest expense was $452.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002.

Income Tax

Reorganized NRG

Income tax benefit for the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 was ($0.7) million and the overall
effective tax rate was (6.2%). The rate is lower than the
U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a state tax refund
received from Xcel Energy in 2003, foreign income taxed in
jurisdictions with tax rates different from the
U.S. statutory rate and a decrease in unfavorable permanent
differences.

Our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2003 were offset by
a full valuation allowance in accordance with
SFAS No. 109. Under SOP 90-7, any future benefits
from reducing a valuation allowance from preconfirmation
deferred tax assets are required to be reported as a direct
addition to paid in capital versus a benefit on our income
statement. Consequently, our effective tax rate in
post-bankruptcy emergence years will not benefit from the
realization of our deferred tax assets, which were fully valued
as of the date of our emergence from bankruptcy. The adoption of
this Statement of Position will result in a disallowance of a
future income statement benefit of $1.3 billion as a result
of a reduction to the intangible asset for realization of
benefits of fully valued deferred tax assets as of
December 5, 2003 (date of emergence from bankruptcy).

The effective tax rate may vary from year to year depending on,
among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings
and losses. These same and other factors, including history of
pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing
the ability to realize deferred tax assets.

Predecessor Company

Income tax expense (benefit) for the period January 1, 2003
through December 5, 2003 was a tax expense of
$37.9 million and a tax benefit of ($166.9) million
for the year ended December 31, 2002. The overall effective
tax rate for the short period ended December 5, 2003 and
the year ended December 31, 2002 was 1.3% and 5.6%,
respectively. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily
due to a release in valuation allowance for net operating loss
carryforwards that were utilized following our emergence from
bankruptcy to offset the current tax on cancellation of debt
income.

Discontinued Operations

Reorganized NRG

Discontinued operations for the period December 6, 2003
through December 31, 2003 is comprised of a loss of
$0.4 million attributable to the on going operations of our
McClain, PERC, Cobee, LSP Energy, Hsin Yu and four NEO
Corporation projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO
Prima Deshecha LLC and NEO Tajiguas LLC).



Predecessor Company

As of December 5, 2003, we classified as discontinued
operations the operations and gains/losses recognized on the
sales of projects that were sold or were deemed to have met the
required criteria for such classification pending final
disposition. For the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003, discontinued operations consist of the
historical operations and net gains/losses related to our
Killingholme, McClain, PERC, Cobee, NLGI, seven NEO Corporation
projects, TERI, Cahua, Energia Pacasmayo, LSP Energy and Hsin Yu
projects. Discontinued operations for the year ended
December 31, 2002 consisted of our Crockett Cogeneration,
Entrade, Killingholme, Csepel, Bulo Bulo, McClain, PERC, Cobee,
NLGI, seven NEO Corporation projects, TERI, Cahua, Energia
Pacasmayo, LSP Energy and Hsin Yu projects.

For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003, the results of operations related to such discontinued
operations was a net loss of $182.6 million due to a loss
on the sale of our Peru projects, impairment charges of
$100.7 million and $23.6 million, respectively,
recorded at McClain and NLGI and fresh start adjustments at LSP
Energy.

During 2002, we recognized a loss on discontinued operations of
$675.8 million due primarily to asset impairments recorded
at Killingholme, NLGI, TERI, LSP Energy and Hsin Yu projects.

Reorganization and Emergence from Bankruptcy

On May 14, 2003, we and 25 of our U.S. affiliates,
filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or the
Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York, or the bankruptcy court.

On May 15, 2003, NRG Energy, PMI, NRG Finance Company
I LLC, NRGenerating Holdings (No. 23) B.V. and NRG Capital
LLC, collectively the Plan Debtors, filed the NRG plan of
reorganization and the related Disclosure Statement for
Reorganizing Debtors’ Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant
to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as
subsequently amended, or the Disclosure Statement. The
Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the Disclosure Statement on
June 30, 2003, and instructed the Plan Debtors to include
certain additional disclosures. The Plan Debtors amended the
Disclosure Statement and obtained Bankruptcy Court approval for
the Third Amended Disclosure Statement for Debtors’ Second
Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter 11
of the Bankruptcy Code.

On November 24, 2003, the bankruptcy court issued an order
confirming the NRG plan of reorganization, and the plan became
effective on December 5, 2003. On September 17, 2003,
the Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization was proposed
after we secured the necessary financing commitments. On
November 25, 2003, the bankruptcy court issued an order
confirming the Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization
and the plan became effective on December 23, 2003.

Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under
    the Bankruptcy Code and Fresh Start

Between May 14, 2003 and December 5, 2003, we operated
as a debtor-in-possession under the supervision of the
bankruptcy court. Our financial statements for reporting periods
within that timeframe were prepared in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Position 90-7,

“Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under
the Bankruptcy Code”

, or SOP 90-7.

For financial reporting purposes, the close of business on
December 5, 2003, represents the date of emergence from
bankruptcy. As used herein, the following terms refer to the
Company and its operations:

“Predecessor Company”

The Company, pre-emergence from bankruptcy

The Company’s operations prior to December 6, 2003

“Reorganized NRG”

The Company, post-emergence from bankruptcy

The Company’s operations from December 6, 2003-

December 31, 2004



The implementation of the NRG plan of reorganization resulted
in, among other things, a new capital structure, the
satisfaction or disposition of various types of claims against
the Predecessor Company, the assumption or rejection of certain
contracts, and the establishment of a new board of directors.

In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted
Fresh Start in accordance with the requirements of
SOP 90-7. The application of SOP 90-7 resulted in the
creation of a new reporting entity. Under Fresh Start, the
enterprise value of our company was allocated among our assets
and liabilities on a basis substantially consistent with
purchase accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141

“Business Combinations”

, or
SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, we pushed down the effects
of this allocation to all of our subsidiaries.

Under the requirements of Fresh Start, we have adjusted our
assets and liabilities, other than deferred income taxes, to
their estimated fair values as of December 5, 2003. As a
result of marking our assets and liabilities to their estimated
fair values, we determined that there was no excess
reorganization value that was reallocated back to our tangible
and intangible assets. Deferred taxes were determined in
accordance with SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for
Income Taxes.”

The net effect of all Fresh Start
adjustments resulted in a gain of $3.9 billion (comprised
of a $4.1 billion gain from continuing operations and a
$0.2 billion loss from discontinued operations), which is
reflected in the Predecessor Company’s results of
operations for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003. The application of the Fresh Start
provisions of SOP 90-7 created a new reporting entity
having no retained earnings or accumulated deficit.

As part of the bankruptcy process we engaged an independent
financial advisor to assist in the determination of our
reorganized enterprise value. The fair value calculation was
based on management’s forecast of expected cash flows from
our core assets. Management’s forecast incorporated forward
commodity market prices obtained from a third party consulting
firm. A discounted cash flow calculation was used to develop the
enterprise value of Reorganized NRG, determined in part by
calculating the weighted average cost of capital of the
Reorganized NRG. The Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, valuation
methodology equates the value of an asset or business to the
present value of expected future economic benefits to be
generated by that asset or business. The DCF methodology is a
“forward looking” approach that discounts expected
future economic benefits by a theoretical or observed discount
rate. The independent financial advisors prepared a 30-year cash
flow forecast using a discount rate of approximately 11%. The
resulting reorganization enterprise value as included in the
Disclosure Statement ranged from $5.5 billion to
$5.7 billion. The independent financial advisor then
subtracted our project-level debt and made several other
adjustments to reflect the values of assets held for sale,
excess cash and collateral requirements to estimate a range of
Reorganized NRG equity value of between $2.2 billion and
$2.6 billion.

In constructing our Fresh Start balance sheet upon our emergence
from bankruptcy, we used a reorganization equity value of
approximately $2.4 billion, as we believe this value to be
the best indication of the value of the ownership distributed to
the new equity owners. Our NRG plan of reorganization provided
for the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of NRG common stock
to the various creditors resulting in a calculated price per
share of $24.04. Our reorganization value of approximately
$9.1 billion was determined by adding our reorganized
equity value of $2.4 billion, $3.7 billion of interest
bearing debt and our other liabilities of $3.0 billion. The
reorganization value represents the fair value of an entity
before liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer
would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after
restructuring. This value is consistent with the voting
creditors and bankruptcy court’s approval of the NRG plan
of reorganization.

We recorded approximately $3.9 billion of net
reorganization income (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain
from continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from
discontinued operations) in the Predecessor Company’s
statement of operations for 2003, which includes the gain on the
restructuring of equity and the discharge of obligations subject
to compromise for less than recorded amounts, as well as
adjustments to the historical carrying values of our assets and
liabilities to fair market value.

Due to the adoption of Fresh Start as of December 5, 2003,
the Reorganized NRG post-Fresh Start statement of operations and
statement of cash flows have not been prepared on a consistent
basis with the Predecessor Company’s financial statements
and are therefore not comparable in certain respects to the



financial statements prior to the application of Fresh Start.
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been
prepared to distinguish between Reorganized NRG and the
Predecessor Company.

APB No. 18,

“The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock,”

requires us to
effectively push down the effects of Fresh Start reporting to
our unconsolidated equity method investments and to recognize an
adjustment to our share of the earnings or losses of an investee
as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary. As a result
of pushing down the impact of Fresh Start to our West Coast
Power affiliate, we determined that a contract based intangible
asset with a one year remaining life, consisting of the value of
West Coast Power’s California Department of Water Resources
energy sales contract, must be established and recognized as a
basis adjustment to our share of the future earnings generated
by West Coast Power. This adjustment reduced our equity earnings
in the amount of $115.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. This contract expired in December 2004.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Reorganized Capital Structure

In connection with the consummation of our reorganization, on
December 5, 2003, all shares of our old common stock were
canceled and 100,000,000 shares of new common stock of
NRG Energy were distributed pursuant to such plan in
accordance with Section 1145 of the bankruptcy code to the
holders of certain classes of claims. We received no proceeds
from such issuance. A certain number of shares of common stock
were issued and placed in the Disputed Claims Reserve for
distribution to holders of disputed claims as such claims are
resolved or settled. See Item 3 — Legal
Proceedings — Disputed Claims Reserve. In the event
our disputed claims reserve is inadequate, it is possible we
will have to issue additional shares of our common stock to
satisfy such pre-petition claims or contribute additional cash
proceeds. Our authorized capital stock consists of
500,000,000 shares of NRG Energy common stock and
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. A total of
4,000,000 shares of our common stock are available for
issuance under our long-term incentive plan.

In addition to our issuance of new common stock, on
December 23, 2003, we completed a note offering consisting
of $1.25 billion of 8% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes
due 2013, or the Second Priority Notes, and we entered into a
new $1.45 billion credit facility consisting of a
$950.0 million term loan facility, a $250.0 million
funded letter of credit facility and a $250.0 million
revolving credit facility. In connection with the consummation
of the NRG plan of reorganization, we issued to Xcel Energy a
$10.0 million non-amortizing promissory note, which accrues
interest at a rate of 3% per annum and matures
2.5 years after the effective date of the NRG plan of
reorganization. In January 2004, we completed a supplementary
note offering whereby we issued an additional
$475.0 million of the Second Priority Notes at a premium
and used the proceeds to repay a portion of the
$950.0 million term loan. On December 24, 2004, we
amended and restated our existing $1.45 billion credit
facility, recasting it as a $950 million secured credit
facility made up of a $450.0 million seven-year senior
secured term loan, a $350.0 million funded letter of credit
facility and a three-year $150.0 million revolving line of
credit. In December 2004, we also issued $420 million of
convertible preferred stock and used the proceeds from such
issuance to redeem $375 million of the Second Priority
Notes in February 2005. Also in January 2005 and in
March 2005, we used existing cash to purchase, at market
prices, $25 million and $15.8 million, respectively,
in face value of our Second Priority Notes. These notes were
assumed by NRG Energy and therefore remain outstanding. As of
March 21, 2005, we had $1.35 billion in aggregate
principal amount of Second Priority Notes outstanding,
$450.0 million principal amount outstanding under the term
loan and $350 million of the funded letter of credit
facility outstanding. $178.3 million of undrawn letters of
credit remain available under the funded letter of credit
facility. As of March 21, 2005, we had not drawn down on
our revolving credit facility.



The following table summarizes the debt transactions:

*

The notes were assumed by NRG Energy and remain outstanding.

As part of the NRG plan of reorganization, we eliminated
approximately $5.2 billion of corporate level bank and bond
debt and approximately $1.3 billion of additional claims
and disputes through our distribution of new common stock and
$1.04 billion in cash among our unsecured creditors. In
addition to the debt reduction associated with the
restructuring, we used the proceeds of the Second Priority Notes
and borrowings under our credit facility to retire approximately
$1.7 billion of project-level debt.

For additional information on our short-term and long-term
borrowing arrangements, see Item 15 —
Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Historical Cash Flows

Reorganized NRG

We have obtained cash from operations, Xcel Energy’s
contribution net of distributions to creditors, proceeds from
the sale of certain assets, borrowings under our Second Priority
Notes and credit facilities and the proceeds from the sale of
preferred stock. We have used these funds to finance operations,
service debt obligations, finance capital expenditures,
repurchase common stock and meet other cash and liquidity needs.

Predecessor Company

Historically, we have obtained cash from operations, issuance of
debt and equity securities, borrowings under credit facilities,
capital contributions from Xcel Energy, reimbursement by Xcel
Energy of tax benefits pursuant to a tax sharing agreement and
proceeds from non-recourse project financings. We used these
funds



to finance operations, service debt obligations, fund the
acquisition, development and construction of generation
facilities, finance capital expenditures and meet other cash and
liquidity needs.

Net Cash Provided (Used) By Operating Activities

Reorganized NRG

For the year ended December 31, 2004, net cash provided by
operating activities was $644.0 million. Net income of
$185.6 million and adjustments of $383.3 million
accounted for $568.9 million of the total cash provided by
operating activities. Non-cash adjustments consist primarily of
depreciation, amortization and impairment charges offset by
unrealized gains on derivatives. Cash provided by working
capital of $75.0 million reflects a $100 million net
resolution of a bankruptcy-related receivable and payable offset
by other working capital changes of $25.0 million.

For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31,
2003, net cash used by operating activities was
$588.9 million. This was primarily a result of payments
made to creditors upon our emergence from bankruptcy.

Predecessor Company

For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003, net cash provided by operating activities was
$238.5 million. Operating activities consisted of a net
loss before Fresh Start adjustments of $1.1 billion, offset
by non-cash charges of $567.5 million and cash provided by
working capital of $800.1 million. The non-cash charges
consisted primarily of the write-down of our investment in Loy
Yang, asset impairments and legal settlement charges. The
favorable change in working capital was primarily due to reduced
cash expenditures throughout the bankruptcy period resulting in
increased accounts payable.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash provided by
operating activities was $430.0 million. Operating
activities consisted of a net loss before restructuring and
impairment charges of $319.8 million offset by non-cash
charges of $144.5 million and cash provided by working
capital of $605.3 million.

Net Cash Provided (Used) By Investing Activities

Reorganized NRG

For the year ended December 31, 2004, net cash provided by
investing activities was $184.7 million due primarily to
sales proceeds, net of cash on hand, of $252.7 million on
the sale of discontinued operations and sale proceeds of
$50.7 million from the sale of investments, offset by
capital expenditures of $114.4 million.

For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31,
2003, net cash provided by investing activities was
$363.4 million. In connection with the refinancing
transaction, approximately $375.3 million of restricted
cash was released upon payment of the Northeast Generating and
South Central Generating note. This increase was offset by funds
used for capital expenditures and investments in projects.



Predecessor Company

For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003, net cash used in investing activities was
$185.7 million. This was primarily a result of capital
expenditures and an increase in restricted cash, offset by cash
proceeds received upon the sale of investments.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash used by
investing activities was $1.7 billion due primarily to
$1.4 billion of capital expenditures.

Net Cash Provided (Used) By Financing Activities

Reorganized NRG

For the year ended December 31, 2004, net cash used by
financing activities was $283.7 million primarily due to
reduction of long-term debt by $159.3 million, which was
primarily related to the McClain sale. Financing activities were
also driven by an increase in the funded letter of credit asset
balance of $100.0 million. In December 2004, the Company
issued preferred stock for net proceeds of $406.4 million
which enabled us to redeem $375.0 million of senior secured
notes in 2005. Available cash balances were used to
purchase 13 million shares of common stock owned by
MatlinPatterson for a price of $405.3 million.

For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31,
2003, net cash provided by financing activities was
$393.3 million. We entered into refinancing transactions on
December 23, 2003, where we issued $1.25 billion of
Second Priority Notes and entered into the New Credit Facility,
which consisted of a $950.0 million senior secured term
loan facility, a $250.0 million funded letter of credit
facility and a $250.0 million unfunded revolving line of
credit. Upon completion of the refinancing transactions, we
repaid the Northeast Generating and South Central Generating
notes and the Mid-Atlantic Generating obligations.

Predecessor Company

For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003, net cash used by financing activities was
$29.9 million, which consisted primarily of principal
payments offset by the issuance of additional debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash provided by
financing activities was $1.4 billion which consisted
primarily of increased debt of $945.3 and a capital contribution
from Xcel Energy in the amount of $500.0 million.

Sources of Funds

The principal sources of liquidity for our future operations and
capital expenditures are expected to be: (i) existing cash
on hand and cash flows from operations and (ii) proceeds
from the sale of certain assets and businesses. Additionally, we
have approximately $192.9 million of undrawn letter of
credit capacity under our senior credit facility as of
December 31, 2004.

On December 24, 2004, we amended our corporate bank
facility, which at December 31, 2004 consists of a
$450.0 million, seven-year senior secured term loan, a
$350.0 million funded letter of credit facility, and a
three-year $150.0 million revolving line of credit, or the
revolving credit facility. With the refinancing, we lowered the
interest rate on the term loan to LIBOR plus 1.875% from LIBOR
plus 4.0%. Portions of the revolving credit facility are
available as a swing-line facility and as a revolving letter of
credit sub-facility. As of December 31, 2004, the corporate
revolver was undrawn.

On December 27, 2004, we completed the sale of
$420 million of convertible perpetual preferred stock with
a dividend coupon rate of 4%. The Preferred Stock has a
liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Preferred
Stock. Holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when,
as and if declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds
legally available therefore, cash dividends at the rate of
4% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on
March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of
each year, commencing on March 15, 2005. The Preferred
Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time
into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price
of $40.00 per share, which is equal to an approximate
conversion rate of 25 shares of common stock per share of
Preferred Stock, subject to specified adjustments. On or after



December 20, 2009, we may redeem, subject to certain
limitations, some or all of the Preferred Stock with cash at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference,
plus accumulated but unpaid dividends, including liquidated
damages, if any, to the redemption date.

Proceeds of $406.4 million from the sale of the preferred
securities are net of securities issuance costs of approximately
$13.6 million, and on February 4, 2005, these proceeds
along with cash on hand were used to redeem $375.0 million
in Second Priority Notes, pay an early redemption penalty of
$30.0 million and pay accrued interest of $4.1 million
on the redeemed notes.

Cash Flows.

Our operating cash flows are expected to be
impacted by, among other things: (i) spark spreads
generally; (ii) commodity prices (including demand for
natural gas, coal, oil and electricity); (iii) the cost of
ordinary course operations and maintenance expenses including
margin and collateral calls for our trading operation;
(iv) planned and unplanned outages; (v) contraction of
terms by trade creditors; (vi) cash requirements for
closure and restructuring of certain facilities;
(vii) restrictions in the declaration or payments of
dividends or similar distributions from our subsidiaries; and
(viii) the timing and nature of asset sales.

A principal component of the NRG plan of reorganization is a
settlement with Xcel Energy in which Xcel Energy agreed to make
a contribution to us consisting of cash (and, under certain
circumstances, its common stock) in an aggregate amount of up to
$640.0 million to be paid in three separate installments.
Xcel Energy contributed $288.0 million on February 20,
2004, $328.5 million on April 30, 2004 and
$23.5 million on May 28, 2004. We distributed
$540.0 million of cash we received from Xcel Energy to our
creditors pursuant to our plan of reorganization. We retained
the remaining $100.0 million, which we used for general
corporate purposes.

Asset Sales.

We received $303.4 million,
$196.5 million and $229.3 million in cash proceeds
from the sale of certain assets and businesses in the fiscal
years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Amended
Credit Facility and the indenture governing the notes place
restrictions on the use of any proceeds we may receive from
certain asset sales in the future.

Letter of Credit Sub-facility and Revolving Credit
Facility.

The Amended Credit Facility includes a letter of
credit sub-facility in the amount of $350.0 million. As of
December 31, 2004, we had issued $157.1 million in
letters of credit under this facility, leaving
$192.9 million available for future issuance. The Amended
Credit Facility also includes a revolving credit facility in the
amount of $150.0 million to be used for general corporate
purposes. On December 31, 2004 our revolving credit
facility was undrawn. For additional information regarding our
debt see Item 15 — Note 18 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Uses of Funds

Our requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than
for operating our facilities, can generally be categorized by
the following: (i) PMI activities; (ii) capital
expenditures; (iii) corporate financial restructuring and
(iv) project finance requirements for cash collateral.

PMI.

PMI activities comprise the single largest
requirement for liquidity and capital resources. PMI liquidity
requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and
collateral posted with counter-parties; (ii) initial
collateral required to establish trading relationships;
(iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e., buying
fuel before receiving energy revenues); and (iv) initial
collateral for large structured transactions. As of
December 31, 2004, PMI had total collateral outstanding of
$47.8 million in margin, prepayments and cash deposits and
$83.1 million outstanding in letters of credit to third
parties.

Future liquidity requirements may change based on our hedging
activity, fuel purchases, future market conditions, including
forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In
addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on our credit
ratings and general perception of creditworthiness. We do not
assume that we will be given unsecured credit from third parties
in budgeting our working capital requirements.

Capital Expenditures.

Capital expenditures were
$114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004,
$10.6 million for the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003, $113.5 million for the period



January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and
$1.4 billion for the year ended 2002. Capital expenditures
in 2004 relate primarily to the conversion of our western New
York plants to low-sulfur coal, the Playford 2 refurbishment at
our Flinders operation in Australia and planned outages across
our fleet. Capital expenditures in 2003 relate primarily to
operations and maintenance of our existing generating facilities
whereas capital expenditures in 2002 related primarily to new
plant construction. In 2005, we anticipate we will spend
approximately $133.3 million in capital expenditures and an
additional $109.5 million in major maintenance expense
related primarily to the operation and maintenance of our
existing generating facilities.

Corporate Financial Restructuring.

We may elect
periodically to modify our corporate financial structure in
order to increase near-term or long-term cash flows or to reduce
exposure to financial risks. On December 21, 2004, we
purchased 13 million shares of common equity interest in
NRG Energy from investment partnerships managed by
MatlinPatterson. Total costs associated with the repurchase,
including fees and expenses, was $405.3 million. On
February 4, 2005, we used proceeds from our Preferred Stock
issuance to redeem early $375.0 million of our Second
Priority Notes at par value plus 8%. We also paid outstanding
accrued interest and liquidated damage penalties attributable to
the redeemed notes. In January 2005 and March 2005, we
repurchased $25.0 million and $15.8 million,
respectively, of our notes, which remain outstanding. As of
March 21, 2005, $1.35 billion in Second Priority Notes
remain outstanding.

Preferred Dividend Payment.

On March 15, 2005, we
made a $3.9 million dividend payment to our preferred
shareholders of record as of March 1, 2005. This represents
the first quarterly dividend payment we anticipate making to our
preferred shareholders.

Project Finance Requirements.

We are a holding company
and conduct our operations through subsidiaries. Historically,
we have utilized project-level debt to fund a significant
portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to
construct our power plants and related assets. Consistent with
our strategy, we may seek, where available on commercially
reasonable terms, project-level debt in connection with the
assets or businesses that our affiliates or we may develop,
construct or acquire. Project-level borrowings are substantially
non-recourse to other subsidiaries, affiliates and us, and are
generally secured by the capital stock, physical assets,
contracts and cash flow of the related project subsidiary or
affiliate being financed. Some of these project financings may
require us to post collateral in the form of cash or an
acceptable letter of credit.

In February 2005, Flinders amended its debt facility of AUD
279.4 million (approximately US $218.5 million)
in floating-rate debt. The amendment extended the maturity to
February 2017, reduced borrowing costs and reserve requirements,
minimized debt service coverage ratios, removed mandatory cash
sharing arrangements, and made other minor modifications to
terms and conditions. The facility includes an AUD
20 million (approximately US $15.7 million)
working capital and performance bond facility. NRG Flinders is
required to maintain interest-rate hedging contracts on a
rolling 5-year basis at a minimum level of 60% of principal
outstanding. Upon execution of the amendment, a voluntary
principal prepayment of AUD 50 million (approximately
US $39.1 million) was made, reducing the principal
balance to AUD 229.2 million (approximately
$179.4 million).



Principal on short-term debt, long-term debt and capital leases
as of December 31, 2004 are due and payable in the
following periods (in thousands):

These amounts reflect scheduled amortization of principal as of
December 31, 2004, with the exception of the 8% Senior
Secured Notes, for which 2005 amounts reflect early redemption
and repurchases made through March 21, 2005. See
Item 15 — Note 18 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion on events that may
affect debt payment schedules.

On December 24, 2004, we amended and restated our senior
credit facility, which now consists of a $450.0 million,
seven-year senior secured term loan facility, a
$350.0 million funded letter of credit facility, and a
three-year revolving credit facility in an amount up to
$150.0 million. At that time, we paid $13.8 million in
prepayment breakage costs, $3.2 million in accrued but
unpaid interest and fees, and $16.7 million in other costs
associated with the amendment. The balance outstanding under
this facility was $800.0 million as of December 31,
2004. Other expenses include commitment fees on the undrawn
portion of the revolving credit facility, participation fees for
the credit-linked deposit and other fees.

As of December 31, 2004, the $350.0 million letter of
credit facility was fully funded and reflected as a funded
letter of credit on the December 31, 2004 balance sheet. As
of December 31, 2004, $157.1 million in letters of
credit had been issued under this facility, leaving
$192.9 million available for future issuances.

If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit
support to our subsidiaries, the inability of any of our
subsidiaries that have near-term debt payment obligations to
obtain non-recourse project financing may result in such
subsidiary’s insolvency and the loss of our investment in
such subsidiary. Additionally, the loss of a significant
customer at any of our subsidiaries could result in the need to
restructure the non-recourse project



financing at that subsidiary, and the inability to successfully
complete a restructuring of the non-recourse project financing
may result in a loss of our investment in such subsidiary.
Certain of our projects are subject to restrictions regarding
the movement of cash. For additional information see
Item 15 — Note 18 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Liquidity Estimates

For 2005, we anticipate utilizing $300 million of our
letter of credit facility. In addition, PMI may require
additional capital resources depending upon our hedging
activity, fuel purchases and future market conditions. As part
of our refinancing transactions, we have a $150.0 million
revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility was
established to satisfy short-term working capital requirements,
which may arise from time to time. It is not our current
intention to draw funds under the revolving credit facility.

On February 4, 2005, utilizing net proceeds of
$406.4 million from the sale of preferred securities in
December 2004, we redeemed $375.0 million in Second
Priority Notes. At the same time, we paid $30.0 million for
the early redemption premium on the redeemed notes,
$4.1 million in accrued but unpaid interest on the redeemed
notes and $0.4 million in accrued but unpaid liquidated
damages on the redeemed notes.

On March 15, 2005, we made a $3.9 million dividend
payment to our preferred shareholders of record as of
March 1, 2005. This represents the first quarterly dividend
payment we anticipate making to our preferred shareholders.

Other Liquidity Matters

We expect our capital requirements to be met with existing cash
balances, cash flows from operations, borrowings under our
Second Priority Notes and Amended Credit Facility, and asset
sales. We believe that our current level of cash availability
and asset sales, along with our future anticipated cash flows
from operations, will be sufficient to meet the existing
operational and collateral needs of our business for the next
12 months. Subject to restrictions in our Second Priority
Notes and our Amended Credit Facility, if cash generated from
operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity
requirements, we may seek to sell assets, obtain additional
credit facilities or other financings and/or issue additional
equity or convertible instruments. We cannot assure you,
however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow
from operations, such that currently anticipated cost savings
and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or that
future borrowings will be available to us under our credit
facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our
indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need
to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before
maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance
any of our indebtedness, on commercially reasonable terms or at
all. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant
amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many
factors beyond our control.

Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we generated a net
operating loss carryforward of $102.1 million which will
expire through 2024. We believe that it is more likely than not
that no benefit will be realized on the deferred tax assets
relating to the net operating loss carryforwards. This
assessment included consideration of positive and negative
factors, including our current financial position and results of
operations, projected future taxable income, including projected
operating and capital gains, and available tax planning
strategies. Therefore, as of December 31, 2004, a valuation
allowance of $707.9 million was recorded against the net
deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards
in accordance with SFAS No. 109.

Off-Balance Sheet Items

As of December 31, 2004, we have not entered into any
financing structure that is designed to be off-balance sheet
that would create liquidity, financing or incremental market
risk or credit risk to us. However, we have numerous investments
with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy
and energy related entities that are accounted for under the
equity method of accounting as disclosed in
Item 15 —



Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our
pro-rata share of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated
affiliates was approximately $251.7 million as of
December 31, 2004. The decline was largely a result of
sales of our interest in Calpine Cogeneration, Loy Yang and
Commonwealth Atlantic. In the normal course of business we may
be asked to loan funds to the unconsolidated affiliates on both
a long and short-term basis. Such transactions are generally
accounted for as accounts payable and receivable to/from
affiliates and notes payable/receivable to/from affiliates and
if appropriate, bear market-based interest rates. See
Item 15 — Note 11 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding
amounts accounted for as notes receivable — affiliates.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

We have a variety of contractual obligations and other
commercial commitments that represent prospective cash
requirements in addition to our capital expenditure programs.
The following is a summarized table of contractual obligations.

In December 2004, we entered into a long-term coal transport
agreement with the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway
Company and affiliates of American Commercial Lines LLC to
deliver low sulfur coal to our Big Cajun II facility in New
Roads, Louisiana beginning April 1, 2005. In December 2004,
we also entered into coal purchase contracts extending through
2007. In March 2005, we entered into an agreement to purchase
23.75 million tons of coal over a period of four years and
nine months from Buckskin Mining Company or Buckskin. The coal
will be sourced from Buckskin’s mine in the Powder River
Basin, Wyoming, and will be used primarily in
NRG Energy’s coal-burning generation plants in the
South Central region.

In August 2004, we entered into a contract to
purchase 1,540 aluminum railcars from Johnston America
Corporation to be used for the transportation of low sulfur coal
from Wyoming to NRG Energy’s coal burning generating
plants, including the Cajun Facilities. On February 18,
2005, we entered into a ten-year operating lease agreement with
GE Railcar Services Corporation, or GE, for the lease of 1,500
railcars and delivery



commenced in February 2005. We have assigned certain of our
rights and obligations for 1,500 railcars under the purchase
agreement with Johnston America to GE. Accordingly, the railcars
which we lease from GE under the arrangement described above
will be purchased by GE from Johnston America in lieu of our
purchase of those railcars.

Interdependent Relationships

We do not have any significant interdependent relationships.

Derivative Instruments

We may enter into long-term power sales contracts, long-term gas
purchase contracts and other energy related commodities
financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to
fluctuations in spot market prices, hedge fuel requirements at
generation facilities and protect fuel inventories. In addition,
in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the
issuance of our variable rate and fixed rate debt, we enter into
interest rate swap agreements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles



generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance
with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires
the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and
guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily
involves judgments regarding future events, including the
likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and
regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves,
could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures
based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use.
In addition, the financial and operating environment also may
have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the
business, but on the results reported through the application of
accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements
and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting
policies have not changed.

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, utilizing
historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods
we consider reasonable. In any case, actual results may differ
significantly from our estimates. Any effects on our business,
financial position or results of operations resulting from
revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which
the facts that give rise to the revision become known.

Our significant accounting policies are summarized in
Item 15 — Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The following table identifies certain of
the significant accounting policies listed in
Item 15 — Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The table also identifies the judgments
required, uncertainties involved in the application of each and
estimates that may have a material impact on our results of
operations and statement of financial position. These policies,
along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our
management in their application, have a significant impact on
our consolidated financial statements. We identify our most
critical accounting policies as those that are the most
pervasive and important to the portrayal of our financial
position and results of operations, and that require the most
difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management
regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.



Of all of the accounting policies identified in the above table,
we believe that the following policies and the application
thereof to be those having the most direct impact on our
financial position and results of operations.

Fresh Start Reporting

In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted
Fresh Start in accordance with the requirements of
SOP 90-7. The application of SOP 90-7 resulted in the
creation of a new reporting entity. Under Fresh Start, the
reorganization value of our company was allocated among our
assets and liabilities on a basis substantially consistent with
purchase accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

“Business Combinations.”

The bankruptcy court in its confirmation order approved our plan
of reorganization on November 24, 2003. Under the
requirements of SOP 90-7, the Fresh Start date is
determined to be the confirmation date unless significant
uncertainties exist regarding the effectiveness of the
bankruptcy order. Our plan of



reorganization required completion of the Xcel Energy settlement
agreement prior to emergence from bankruptcy. We believe this
settlement agreement was a significant contingency and thus
delayed the Fresh Start date until the Xcel Energy settlement
agreement was finalized on December 5, 2003.

Under the requirements of Fresh Start, we adjusted our assets
and liabilities, other than deferred income taxes, to their
estimated fair values as of December 5, 2003. As a result
of marking our assets and liabilities to their estimated fair
values, we determined that there was no excess reorganization
value to recognize as an intangible asset. Deferred taxes were
determined in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes.”

The net effect
of all Fresh Start adjustments resulted in a gain of
$3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from
continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from
discontinued operations), which is reflected in the Predecessor
Company’s results for the period January 1, 2003
through December 5, 2003. The application of the Fresh
Start provisions of SOP 90-7 created a new reporting entity
having no retained earnings or accumulated deficit.

As part of the bankruptcy process we engaged an independent
financial advisor to assist in the determination of the fair
value of our reorganized enterprise value. The fair value
calculation was based on management’s forecast of expected
cash flows from our core assets. Management’s forecast
incorporated forward commodity market prices obtained from a
third party consulting firm. A discounted cash flow calculation
was used to develop the enterprise value of Reorganized NRG,
determined in part by calculating the weighted average cost of
capital of the Reorganized NRG. The Discounted Cash Flow, or
DCF, valuation methodology equates the value of an asset or
business to the present value of expected future economic
benefits to be generated by that asset or business. The DCF
methodology is a “forward looking” approach that
discounts all expected future economic benefits by a theoretical
or observed discount rate. The independent financial advisor
prepared a 30-year cash flow forecast using a discount rate of
approximately 11%. The resulting reorganization enterprise value
ranged from $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion. The
independent financial advisor then subtracted our project-level
debt and made several other adjustments to reflect the values of
assets held for sale, excess cash and collateral requirements to
estimate a range of Reorganized NRG equity value of between
$2.2 billion and $2.6 billion.

In constructing our Fresh Start balance sheet upon our emergence
from bankruptcy, we used a reorganization equity value of
approximately $2.4 billion, as we believe this value to be
the best indication of the value of the ownership distributed to
the new equity owners. Our reorganization value of approximately
$9.1 billion was determined by adding our reorganized
equity value of $2.4 billion, $3.7 billion of interest
bearing debt and our other liabilities of $3.0 billion. The
reorganization value represents the fair value of an entity
before liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer
would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after
restructuring. This value is consistent with the voting
creditors and Court’s approval of the Plan of
Reorganization.

A separate plan of reorganization was filed for our Northeast
Generating and South Central Generating entities that was
confirmed by the bankruptcy court on November 25, 2003, and
became effective on December 23, 2003, when the final
conditions of the plan were completed. In connection with Fresh
Start on December 5, 2003, we have accounted for these
entities as if they had emerged from bankruptcy at the same time
that we emerged, as we believe that we continued to maintain
control over the Northeast Generating and South Central
Generating facilities throughout the bankruptcy process.

Due to the adoption of Fresh Start upon our emergence from
bankruptcy, the Reorganized NRG’s post-fresh start balance
sheet, statement of operations and statement of cash flows have
not been prepared on a consistent basis with the Predecessor
Company’s financial statements and are therefore not
comparable in certain respects to the financial statements prior
to the application of Fresh Start.

Capitalization Practices

Reorganized NRG

In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted
Fresh Start in accordance with the requirements of
SOP 90-7. The application of SOP 90-7 resulted in the
creation of a new reporting entity.



Under Fresh Start, the reorganization value of our company was
allocated to our assets and liabilities on a basis substantially
consistent with purchase accounting in accordance with
SFAS No. 141. We engaged a valuation specialist to
help us determine the fair value of our fixed assets. The
valuations were based on forecast power prices and operating
costs determined by us. The valuation specialist also determined
the estimated remaining useful lives of our fixed assets.

Predecessor Company

For those assets that were being constructed by us, the carrying
value reflects the application of our property, plant and
equipment policies which incorporate estimates, assumptions and
judgments by management relative to the capitalized costs and
useful lives of our generating facilities. Interest incurred on
funds borrowed to finance projects expected to require more than
three months to complete is capitalized. Capitalization of
interest is discontinued when the asset under construction is
ready for our intended use or when construction is terminated.
An insignificant amount of interest was capitalized during 2003.
Development costs and capitalized project costs include third
party professional services, permits and other costs that are
incurred incidental to a particular project. Such costs are
expensed as incurred until an acquisition agreement or letter of
intent is signed, and our board of directors has approved the
project. Additional costs incurred after this point are
capitalized.

Impairment of Long Lived Assets

We evaluate property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future
net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through
considering project specific assumptions for long-term power
pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and
expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability
weighting of different courses of action available to us.
Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation
techniques such as the present value of expected future cash
flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. For the
year ended December 31, 2004, the periods December 6,
2003 through December 31, 2003 and January 1, 2003
through December 5, 2003 and for the year ended
December 31, 2002, net income from continuing operations
was reduced by $44.7 million, $0 million,
$228.9 million and $2.5 billion, respectively, due to
asset impairments. Asset impairment evaluations are by nature
highly subjective.

Revenue Recognition and Uncollectible Receivables

We are primarily an electric generation company, operating a
portfolio of majority-owned electric generating plants and
certain plants in which our ownership is 50% or less which are
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We also
produce thermal energy for sale to customers. Both physical and
financial transactions are entered into to optimize the
financial performance of our generating facilities. Electric
energy revenue is recognized upon transmission to the customer.
In regions where bilateral markets exist and physical delivery
of electricity is common from our plants, we record revenue on a
gross basis. In certain markets, which are operated/controlled
by an independent system operator and in which we have entered
into a netting agreement with the ISO, which results in our
receiving a netted invoice, we have recorded purchased energy as
an offset against revenues received upon the sale of such
energy. Revenues derived from the buying and selling of
electricity not sourced from our facilities are reported net.
Capacity and ancillary revenue is recognized when contractually
earned. Revenues from operations and maintenance services are
recognized when the services are performed. We continually
assess the collectibility of our receivables, and in the event
we believe a receivable to be uncollectible, an allowance for
doubtful accounts is recorded or, in the event of a contractual
dispute, the receivable and corresponding revenue may be
considered unlikely of recovery and not recorded in the
financial statements until management is satisfied that it will
be collected.



Derivative Financial Instruments

In January 2001, we adopted FAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,”

or SFAS No. 133, as amended by
SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and
SFAS No. 149. SFAS No. 133, as amended,
requires us to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at
fair value. In some cases hedge accounting may apply. The
criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is
appropriate are a) the designation of the hedge to an
underlying exposure, b) whether or not the overall risk is
being reduced and c) if there is correlation between the
value of the derivative instrument and the underlying
obligation. Formal documentation of the hedging relationship,
the nature of the underlying risk, the risk management
objective, and the means by which effectiveness will be assessed
is created at the inception of the hedge. Changes in the fair
value of non-hedge derivatives are immediately recognized in
earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for
as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the
changes in the fair value of the related hedged assets,
liabilities and firm commitments or for forecasted transactions,
deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income, or OCI, until the hedged transactions
occur and are recognized in earnings. We primarily account for
derivatives under SFAS No. 133, as amended, such as
long-term power sales contracts, long-term gas purchase
contracts and other energy related commodities and financial
instruments used to mitigate variability in earnings due to
fluctuations in spot market prices, hedge fuel requirements at
generation facilities and to protect investments in fuel
inventories. SFAS No. 133, as amended, also applies to
interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange rate
contracts. The application of SFAS No. 133, as
amended, results in increased volatility in earnings due to the
recognition of unrealized gains and losses. In determining the
fair value of these derivative/financial instruments we use
estimates, various assumptions, judgment of management and when
considered appropriate third party experts in determining the
fair value of these derivatives.

Discontinued Operations

We classify our results of operations that either have been
disposed of or are classified as held for sale as discontinued
operations if both of the following conditions are met:
(a) the operations and cash flows have been (or will be)
eliminated from our ongoing operations as a result of the
disposal transaction and (b) we will not have any
significant continuing involvement in the operations of the
component after the disposal transaction. Prior periods are
restated to report the operations as discontinued.

Pensions

The determination of our obligation and expenses for pension
benefits is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions.
These assumptions determined by management include the discount
rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of
future compensation increases. Our actuarial consultants use
assumptions for such items as retirement age. The assumptions
used may differ materially from actual results, which may result
in a significant impact to the amount of pension obligation or
expense recorded by us.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS Statement No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”

or
SFAS No. 123. In accordance with SFAS Statement
No. 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure,”

or
SFAS No. 148, we adopted SFAS No. 123 under
the prospective transition method which requires the application
of the recognition provisions to all employee awards granted,
modified, or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in
which the recognition provisions are first applied. The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used for all non-qualified
stock options.

Recent Accounting Developments

In November 2004, the Emerging Issue Task Force, or EITF, issued
EITF No. 03-13, “Applying the Conditions in
Paragraph 42 of FASB Statement No. 144,

Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

in
Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations”.
EITF 03-13 clarifies the



definition of cash flows of a component in which the seller
engages in activities with the component after disposal, and
significant continuing involvement in the operations of the
component after the disposal transaction, and is effective for
fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2004. The
adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

“Inventory Costs — an amendment of ARB
No. 43, Chapter 4”.

This statement amends the
guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory
Pricing”, and requires that idle facility expense,
excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs be
recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they
meet the criterion of “so abnormal” established by ARB
No. 43. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory
costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2005. The adoption of this statement will not have a material
effect on our consolidated financial position and results of
operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,

“Share-Based Payment”

, a revision to
SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation”

, which supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”

and its related implementation guidance.
SFAS 123R establishes standards for the accounting for
transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments
for goods or services, including obtaining employee services in
share-based payment transactions. SFAS 123R applies to all
awards granted after the required effective date and to awards
modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date. Adoption of
the provisions of SFAS 123R is effective as of the
beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that
begins after June 15, 2005. We have previously adopted
SFAS No. 123, and we are currently in the process of
evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of
SFAS 123R will have on our consolidated financial position
and results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued two FASB Staff Positions, or
FSPs, regarding the accounting implications of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 related to (1) the deduction for
qualified domestic production activities (FSP FAS 109-1)
and (2) the one-time tax benefit for the repatriation of
foreign earnings (FSP FAS 109-2). In FSP FAS 109-1,

“Application of FASB Statement No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes,” to the Tax Deduction on
Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004”,

the Board decided that the
deduction for qualified domestic production activities should be
accounted for as a special deduction under FASB Statement
No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes”

and
rejected an alternative view to treat it as a rate reduction.
Accordingly, any benefit from the deduction should be reported
in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the tax
return. FSP FAS 109-2,

“Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004”,

addresses the
appropriate point at which a company should reflect in its
financial statements the effects of the one-time tax benefit on
the repatriation of foreign earnings. Because of the proximity
of the Act’s enactment date to many companies’
year-ends, its temporary nature, and the fact that numerous
provisions of the Act are sufficiently complex and ambiguous,
the Board decided that absent additional clarifying regulations,
companies may not be in a position to assess the impact of the
Act on their plans for repatriation or reinvestment of foreign
earnings. Therefore, the Board provided companies with a
practical exception to FAS 109’s requirements by
providing them additional time to determine the amount of
earnings, if any, that they intend to repatriate under the
Act’s beneficial provisions. The Board confirmed, however,
that upon deciding that some amount of earnings will be
repatriated, a company must record in that period the associated
tax liability, thereby making it clear that a company cannot
avoid recognizing a tax liability when it has decided that some
portion of its foreign earnings will be repatriated. We are
currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact that
the adoption of FSP FAS 109-1 and FSP FAS 109-2 will
have on our consolidated financial position and results of
operations.

Item 7A —

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

We are exposed to several market risks in our normal business
activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result
from market changes associated with our “merchant”
power generation or with an existing or forecasted financial or
commodity transaction. The types of market risks we are exposed
to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk and currency
exchange risk. In order to manage these risks we utilize various
fixed-



price forward purchase and sales contracts, futures and option
contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps
and options traded in the over-the-counter financial markets to:

Commodity Price Risk

Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot
prices, forward prices, volatilities in commodities, and
correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas,
electricity, coal and oil. A number of factors influence the
level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and
related derivative products. These factors include:

As part of our overall portfolio, we manage the commodity price
risk of our “merchant” generation by entering into
various derivative or non-derivative instruments to hedge the
variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of
electricity and purchases of fuel. These instruments include
forward purchase and sale contracts, futures and option
contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps
and options traded in the over-the-counter financial markets.
The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based
upon management’s assessment of market, weather,
operational, and other factors.

While some of the contracts we use to manage risk represent
commodities or instruments for which prices are available from
external sources, other commodities and certain contracts are
not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources
and modeling techniques to determine expected future market
prices, contract quantities, or both. We use our best estimates
to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative
contracts we hold and sell. These estimates consider various
factors including closing exchange and over-the-counter price
quotations, time value, volatility factors, and credit exposure.
However, it is likely that future market prices could vary from
those used in recording mark-to-market derivative instrument
valuation, and such variations could be material.

We measure the sensitivity of our portfolio to potential changes
in market prices using value at risk. Value at risk is a
statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on
market price volatility. We calculate value at risk using a
variance/covariance technique that models positions using a
linear approximation of their value. Our value at risk
calculation includes mark-to-market and non mark-to-market
energy assets and liabilities.

We utilize a diversified value at risk model to calculate the
estimate of potential loss in the fair value of our energy
assets and liabilities including generation assets, load
obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions.
The key assumptions for our diversified model include (1) a
lognormal distribution of price returns, (2) one-day
holding period, (3) a 95% confidence interval, (4) a
rolling 24-month forward looking period and (5) market
implied price volatilities and historical price correlations.



This model encompasses the following generating regions:
ENTERGY, NEPOOL, NYPP, PJM, WSCC and MAIN. The estimated maximum
potential loss in fair value of our commodity portfolio,
including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral
physical and financial transaction, calculated using the
diversified VAR model is as follows:

In order to provide additional information for comparative
purposes to our peers we also utilize value at risk to model the
estimate of potential loss of financial derivative instruments
included in derivative instruments valuation assets and
liabilities. This estimation includes those energy contracts
accounted for as a hedge under SFAS No. 133, as
amended. The estimated maximum potential loss in fair value of
the financial derivative instruments calculated using the
diversified VAR model as of December 31, 2004 is
$17.6 million.

Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as
value at risk, the relative immaturity of the competitive
markets for electricity and related derivatives, and the
seasonality of changes in market prices, the value at risk
calculation may not capture the full extent of commodity price
exposure. Additionally, actual changes in the value of options
may differ from the value at risk calculated using a linear
approximation inherent in our calculation method. As a result,
actual changes in the fair value of mark-to market energy assets
and liabilities could differ from the calculated value at risk,
and such changes could have a material impact on our financial
results.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through our
issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Exposures to
interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into
derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps,
collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure
to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate
debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the
variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument.
Our risk management policy allows us to reduce interest rate
exposure from variable rate debt obligations.

As of December 31, 2004, we had various interest rate swap
agreements with notional amounts totaling approximately
$1.3 billion. If the swaps had been discontinued on
December 31, 2004, we would have owed the counter-parties
approximately $35.6 million. Based on the investment grade
rating of the counter-parties, we believe that our exposure to
credit risk due to nonperformance by the counter-parties to our
hedging contracts is insignificant.

We have both long and short-term debt instruments that subject
us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market
interest rates. As of December 31, 2004, a 100 basis
point change in interest rates would result in a
$5.7 million change in interest expense.

At December 31, 2004, the fair value of our long-term debt
was $3.9 billion, compared with the carrying amount of
$3.8 billion. We estimate that a 1% decrease in market
interest rates would have increased the fair value of our
long-term debt by $76.3 million.

Currency Exchange Risk

We expect to continue to be subject to currency risks associated
with foreign denominated distributions from our international
investments. In the normal course of business, we may receive
distributions denomi-



nated in the Euro, Australian Dollar, British Pound and the
Brazilian Real. We have historically engaged in a strategy of
hedging foreign denominated cash flows through a program of
matching currency inflows and outflows, and to the extent
required, fixing the U.S. Dollar equivalent of net foreign
denominated distributions with currency forward and swap
agreements with highly credit worthy financial institutions. We
would expect to enter into similar transactions in the future if
management believes it to be appropriate.

As of December 31, 2004, neither we, nor any of our
consolidating subsidiaries, had any outstanding foreign currency
exchange contracts.

Credit Risk

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from
non-performance or non-payment by counter-parties pursuant to
the terms of their contractual obligations. We monitor and
manage the credit risk of NRG Energy, Inc. and its
subsidiaries through credit policies which include an
(i) established credit approval process, (ii) daily
monitoring of counter-party credit limits, (iii) the use of
credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, credit
derivatives or prepayment arrangements, (iv) the use of
payment netting agreements and (v) the use of master
netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and
negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single
counter-party. Risks surrounding counter-party performance and
credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected
cash flows. We have credit protection within various agreements
to call on additional collateral support if necessary. As of
December 31, 2004, we held collateral support of
$155.5 million from counterparties.

Additionally NRG has concentrations of suppliers and customers
among electric utilities, energy marketing and trading companies
and regional transmission operators. These concentrations of
counter-parties may impact NRG’s overall exposure to credit
risk, either positively or negatively, in that counter-parties
may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory and
other conditions.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer, principal financial
officer and principal accounting officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
our evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2004.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 has been audited by KPMG LLP, our
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its
report which is included in this Form 10-K.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

NRG Energy, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting,

that NRG Energy, Inc. and
subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
“criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)”. NRG
Energy, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that NRG Energy,
Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on “criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO)”. Also, in our opinion, NRG
Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2004, based on “criteria established
in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO)”.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheet of NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity/(deficit)
and comprehensive income/(loss), and cash flows for the year
then ended December 31, 2004, and our report dated
March 29, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.

the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of NRG Energy,
Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and
the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows
and stockholders’ equity/ (deficit) and comprehensive
income/(loss) present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of NRG Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(Reorganized NRG) at December 31, 2003 and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the period from
December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). These
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York confirmed the NRG Energy, Inc. Plan of
Reorganization on November 24, 2003. Confirmation of the
plan resulted in the discharge of all claims against the Company
that arose before May 14, 2003 and substantially alters
rights and interests of equity security holders as provided for
in the plan. The NRG Energy, Inc. Plan of Reorganization

Energy, Inc. emerged from bankruptcy. In connection with its
emergence from bankruptcy, NRG Energy, Inc. adopted fresh
start accounting as of December 5, 2003.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of NRG Energy,
Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows and stockholders’ equity/
(deficit) and comprehensive income/(loss) present fairly,
in all material respects, the results of operations and cash
flows of NRG Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Predecessor
Company) for the period from January 1, 2003 to
December 5, 2003, and for the year ended December 31,
2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). These
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company filed a petition on May 14, 2003
with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York for reorganization under the provisions of
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. NRG Energy,
Inc.’s Plan of Reorganization was substantially consummated
on December 5, 2003 and Reorganized NRG emerged from
bankruptcy. In connection with its emergence from bankruptcy,
the Company adopted fresh start accounting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 — Organization

General

NRG Energy, Inc., or “NRG Energy”, the
“Company”, “we”, “our”, or
“us” is a wholesale power generation company,
primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of power
generation facilities, the transacting in and trading of fuel
and transportation services and the marketing and trading of
energy, capacity and related products in the United States and
internationally. We have a diverse portfolio of electric
generation facilities in terms of geography, fuel type and
dispatch levels. Our principal domestic generation assets
consist of a diversified mix of natural gas-, coal- and
oil-fired facilities, representing approximately 40%, 31% and
29% of our total domestic generation capacity, respectively. In
addition, 23% of our domestic generating facilities have dual-
or multiple-fuel capacity, which may allow plants to dispatch
with the lowest cost fuel option.

We seek to maximize operating income through the generation of
energy, marketing and trading of energy, capacity and ancillary
services into spot, intermediate and long-term markets and the
effective transacting in and trading of fuel supplies and
transportation-related services. We perform our own power
marketing (except with respect to our West Coast Power and Rocky
Road affiliates), which is focused on maximizing the value of
our North American and Australian assets through the pursuit of
asset-focused power and fuel marketing and trading activities in
the spot, intermediate and long-term markets. Our principal
objectives are the management and mitigation of commodity market
risk, the reduction of cash flow volatility over time, the
realization of the full market value of the asset base, and
adding incremental value by using market knowledge to
effectively trade positions associated with our asset portfolio.
Additionally, we work with markets, independent system operators
and regulators to promote market designs that provide adequate
long-term compensation for existing generation assets and to
attract the investment required to meet future generation needs.

As of December 31, 2004, we owned interests in 52 power
projects in five countries having an aggregate net generation
capacity of approximately 15,400 MW. Approximately
7,900 MW of our capacity consisted of merchant power plants
in the Northeast region of the United States. Certain of these
assets are located in transmission constrained areas, including
approximately 1,400 MW of “in-city” New York City
generation capacity and approximately 750 MW of southwest
Connecticut generation capacity. We also own approximately
2,500 MW of capacity in the South Central region of the
United States, with approximately 1,900 MW of that capacity
supported by long-term power purchase agreements.

As of December 31, 2004, our assets in the West Coast
region of the United States consisted of approximately
1,300 MW of capacity with the majority of such capacity
owned via our 50% interest in West Coast Power LLC, or West
Coast Power. Our assets in the West Coast region were supported
by a power purchase agreement with the California Department of
Water Resources that expired on December 31, 2004. One-year
term reliability must-run, or RMR, agreements with the
California Independent System Operator for approximately
568 MW in the San Diego area have been renewed for
2005. On January 1, 2005, a new RMR agreement for the
670 MW gross capacity of the West Coast Power El Segundo
generating facility became effective. In January 2005, that
generating facility entered into a tolling agreement for its
entire gross generating capacity of 670 MW commencing
May 1, 2005 and extending through December 31, 2005.
During the term of this agreement, the purchaser will be
entitled to primary energy dispatch right for the
facility’s generating capacity. The agreement is subject to
the amendment of the El Segundo RMR agreement to switch to RMR
Condition I and to otherwise allow the purchaser to exercise its
primary dispatch rights under this agreement while preserving
Cal ISO’s ability to call on the El Segundo facility as a
reliability resource under the RMR agreement, if necessary.
Approximately 265 MW of capacity at the Long Beach
generating facility was retired January 1, 2005.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We own approximately 1,600 MW of net generating capacity in
other regions of the U.S. We also own interests in plants
having a net generation capacity of approximately 2,100 MW
in various international markets, including Australia, Europe
and Brazil. We operate substantially all of our generating
assets, including the West Coast Power plants.

We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation on May 29,
1992. In March 2004, our common stock was listed on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol “NRG”. Our
headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 211
Carnegie Center, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. Our telephone
number is (609) 524-4500. The address of our website is
www.nrgenergy.com. Our recent annual reports, quarterly reports,
current reports and other periodic filings are available free of
charge through our website.

We were formed in 1992 as the non-utility subsidiary of Northern
States Power Company, or NSP, which was itself merged into New
Century Energies, Inc. to form Xcel Energy, Inc., or Xcel
Energy, in 2000. While owned by NSP and later by Xcel Energy, we
pursued an aggressive high growth strategy focused on power
plant acquisitions, high leverage and aggressive development,
including site development and turbine orders. In 2002, a number
of factors, most notably the aggressive prices paid by us for
our acquisitions of turbines, development projects and plants,
combined with the overall downturn in the power generation
industry, triggered a series of credit rating downgrades which,
in turn, precipitated a severe liquidity crisis at the Company.
From May 14 to December 23, 2003, we and a number of our
subsidiaries undertook a comprehensive reorganization and
restructuring under chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code. With the exception of one subsidiary that
remains in bankruptcy to effect its liquidation, all NRG
entities had emerged from chapter 11 as of
December 31, 2004.

As part of our reorganization, Xcel Energy relinquished its
ownership interest in us, and we became an independent public
company. We no longer have any material affiliation or
relationship with Xcel Energy. As part of the reorganization, we
eliminated approximately $5.2 billion of corporate level
bank and bond debt and approximately $1.3 billion of
additional claims and disputes by distributing a combination of
equity and $1.04 billion in cash to our unsecured creditors.

As part of our restructuring, on December 23, 2003, we used
the proceeds of a new $1.25 billion offering of 8% second
priority senior secured notes due 2013, and borrowings under a
new $1.45 billion secured credit facility, to retire
approximately $1.7 billion of project-level debt. In
January 2004, we used proceeds of a tack-on bond offering of the
same notes to prepay $503.5 million of the outstanding
borrowings under the secured credit facility.

In 2004, we completed our post-confirmation bankruptcy
initiatives, including the liquidation of the chapter 11
subsidiaries deemed to be of no value to NRG Energy
(LSP-Nelson Energy LLC and NRG Nelson Turbines LLC); the
collection and distribution to creditors of amounts owing by our
pre-bankruptcy parent company, Xcel Energy, Inc., under the plan
of reorganization and related documents; and the settlement of
several large disputed claims. We are still litigating or
seeking to settle a number of unresolved disputed claims, for
which we believe we have established an adequate disputed claims
reserve pursuant to the NRG plan of reorganization. In all other
respects, the reorganization process was completed in 2004.

On December 24, 2004, we entered into an amendment and
restatement of our $1.45 billion seven-year secured credit
facility, recasting it as a $950 million seven-year secured
credit facility with more favorable covenants and interest
rates, scheduled to expire in December 2011. On
December 27, 2004, we completed the issuance of
$420 million of perpetual convertible preferred stock, and
used the proceeds to redeem $375 million of our
8% senior secured notes on February 4, 2005. In
January 2005 and in March 2005, we purchased an additional
$25 million and $15.8 million, respectively, of the
notes.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of
    Presentation

Between May 14, 2003 and December 5, 2003, we operated
as a debtor-in-possession under the supervision of the
bankruptcy court. Our financial statements for reporting periods
within that timeframe were prepared in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Position 90-7,

“Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under
the Bankruptcy Code”,

or SOP 90-7.

For financial reporting purposes, close of business on
December 5, 2003, represents the date of our emergence from
bankruptcy. As used herein, the following terms refer to the
Company and its operations:

“Predecessor Company”

The Company, pre-emergence from bankruptcy

The Company’s operations prior to December 6, 2003

“Reorganized NRG”

The Company, post-emergence from bankruptcy

The Company’s operations, December 6,
    2003-December 31, 2004

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No. 46,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,”

or FIN No. 46.
FIN No. 46 requires an enterprise’s consolidated
financial statements to include subsidiaries in which the
enterprise has a controlling interest. In December 2003, the
FASB has published a revision to Interpretation 46, or
FIN 46R, to clarify some of the provisions of FASB
Interpretation No. 46,

“Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities,”

and to exempt certain entities from
its requirements. As required by SOP 90-7, we adopted
FIN No. 46R as of the adoption of Fresh Start. The
nature of the operations consolidated consisted of hydropower
facilities on the East Coast.

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and
operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a
controlling interest. All significant intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Accounting
policies for all of our operations are in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. As discussed in Note 13, we have investments in
partnerships, joint ventures and projects. Earnings from equity
in international investments are recorded net of foreign income
taxes.

Fresh Start Reporting

In accordance with SOP 90-7, certain companies qualify for
fresh start reporting in connection with their emergence from
bankruptcy. Fresh start reporting is appropriate on the
emergence from chapter 11 if the reorganization value of
the assets of the emerging entity immediately before the date of
confirmation is less than the total of all post-petition
liabilities and allowed claims, and if the holders of existing
voting shares immediately before confirmation receive less than
50 percent of the voting shares of the emerging entity. We
met these requirements and adopted Fresh Start reporting
resulting in the creation of a new reporting entity designated
as Reorganized NRG.

The bankruptcy court issued a confirmation order approving our
plan of reorganization on November 24, 2003. Under the
requirements of SOP 90-7, the Fresh Start date is
determined to be the confirmation date unless significant
uncertainties exist regarding the effectiveness of the
bankruptcy order. Our plan of reorganization required completion
of the Xcel Energy settlement agreement prior to emergence from
bankruptcy. The Xcel Energy settlement agreement was entered
into on December 5, 2003. We believe this settlement
agreement was a significant contingency and thus delayed the
Fresh Start date until the Xcel Energy settlement agreement was
finalized on December 5, 2003.

Under the requirements of Fresh Start, we adjusted our assets
and liabilities, other than deferred income taxes, to their
estimated fair values as of December 5, 2003. As a result
of marking our assets and liabilities to their estimated fair
values, we determined that there was a negative reorganization
value that was reallocated back to our tangible and intangible
assets. Deferred taxes were determined in accordance with
SFAS No. 109,



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

“Accounting for Income Taxes.”

The net effect
of all Fresh Start adjustments resulted in a gain of
$3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from
continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from
discontinued operations), which is reflected in the Predecessor
Company’s results for the period January 1, 2003
through December 5, 2003. The application of the Fresh
Start provisions of SOP 90-7 created a new reporting entity
having no retained earnings or accumulated deficit.

As part of the bankruptcy process we engaged an independent
financial advisor to assist in the determination of our
reorganized enterprise value. The fair value calculation was
based on management’s forecast of expected cash flows from
our core assets. Management’s forecast incorporated forward
commodity market prices obtained from a third party consulting
firm. A discounted cash flow calculation was used to develop the
enterprise value of Reorganized NRG, determined in part by
calculating the weighted average cost of capital of the
Reorganized NRG. The Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, valuation
methodology equates the value of an asset or business to the
present value of expected future economic benefits to be
generated by that asset or business. The DCF methodology is a
“forward looking” approach that discounts expected
future economic benefits by a theoretical or observed discount
rate. The independent financial advisor prepared a 30-year cash
flow forecast using a discount rate of approximately 11%. The
resulting reorganization enterprise value as included in the
bankruptcy Disclosure Statement ranged from $5.5 billion to
$5.7 billion. The independent financial advisor then
subtracted our project-level debt and made several other
adjustments to reflect the values of assets held for sale,
excess cash and collateral requirements to estimate a range of
Reorganized NRG equity value of between $2.2 billion and
$2.6 billion.

In constructing our Fresh Start balance sheet upon our emergence
from bankruptcy, we used a reorganization equity value of
approximately $2.4 billion, as we believe this value to be
the best indication of the value of the ownership distributed to
the new equity owners. Our reorganization value of approximately
$9.1 billion was determined by adding our reorganized
equity value of $2.4 billion, $3.7 billion of interest
bearing debt and our other liabilities of $3.0 billion. The
reorganization value represents the fair value of an entity
before liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer
would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after
restructuring. This value is consistent with the voting
creditors and Court’s approval of the Plan of
Reorganization.

A separate plan of reorganization was filed for our Northeast
Generating and South Central Generating entities that was
confirmed by the bankruptcy court on November 25, 2003, and
became effective on December 23, 2003, when the final
conditions of the plan were completed. In connection with Fresh
Start on December 5, 2003, we have accounted for these
entities as if they had emerged from bankruptcy at the same time
that we emerged, as we believe that we continued to maintain
control over the Northeast Generating and South Central
Generating facilities throughout the bankruptcy process.

Due to the adoption of Fresh Start upon our emergence from
bankruptcy, the Reorganized NRG statement of operations and
statement of cash flows have not been prepared on a consistent
basis with the Predecessor Company’s financial statements
and are therefore not comparable to the financial statements
prior to the application of Fresh Start.

Nature of Operations

We are a wholesale power generation company, primarily engaged
in the ownership and operation of power generation facilities
and the sale of energy, capacity and related products in the
United States and internationally. We have a diverse portfolio
of electric generation facilities in terms of geography, fuel
type, and dispatch levels, which help us mitigate risk. We seek
to maximize operating income through the efficient procurement
and management of fuel supplies and maintenance services, and
the sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services into
attractive spot, intermediate and long-term markets.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments
(primarily commercial paper) with an original maturity of three
months or less at the time of purchase.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists primarily of funds held to satisfy the
requirements of certain debt agreements and funds held within
our projects that are restricted in their use.

Inventory

Inventory is valued at the lower of weighted average cost or
market and consists principally of fuel oil, spare parts, coal,
kerosene, emission allowance credits and raw materials used to
generate steam.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost however
impairment adjustments are recorded whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate carrying values may not be
recoverable. On December 5, 2003, we recorded adjustments
to the property, plant and equipment to reflect such items at
fair value in accordance with Fresh Start reporting. A new cost
basis was established with these adjustments. Significant
additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized,
while repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the
life of the respective asset are charged to expense as incurred.
Depreciation will be computed using the straight-line method
over the following estimated useful lives:

Facilities and equipment

6-40  years

Office furnishings and equipment

3-10  years

The assets and related accumulated depreciation amounts are
adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with the resulting
gain or loss included in operations.

Asset Impairments

Long-lived assets that are held and used are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
carrying values may not be recoverable. Such reviews are
performed in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Asset.”

An impairment loss is recognized if the total
future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from an asset
are less than its carrying value. An impairment charge is
measured by the difference between an asset’s carrying
amount and fair value and included in operating costs and
expenses in the statement of operations. Fair values are
determined by a variety of valuation methods, including
appraisals, sales prices of similar assets and present value
techniques.

Investments accounted for by the equity method are reviewed for
impairment in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18,

“The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock.”

APB Opinion No. 18 requires that a
loss in value of an investment that is other than a temporary
decline should be recognized. We identify and measure losses in
value of equity investments based upon a comparison of fair
value to carrying value.

Discontinued Operations

Long-lived assets are classified as discontinued operations when
all of the required criteria specified in SFAS No. 144
are met. These criteria include, among others, existence of a
qualified plan to dispose of an asset, an assessment that
completion of a sale within one year is probable and approval of
the appropriate level



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of management and board of directors. Discontinued operations
are reported at the lower of the asset’s carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell.

Capitalized Interest

Interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance projects expected
to require more than three months to complete is capitalized.
Capitalization of interest is discontinued when the asset under
construction is ready for its intended use or when a project is
terminated or construction ceased. Capitalized interest was
approximately $112.8 thousand, $1.5 thousand, $15.9 thousand and
$64.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004,
the periods December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003 and
January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, and for the year
ended December 31, 2002, respectively.

Capitalized Project Costs

Development costs and capitalized project costs include third
party professional services, permits, and other costs that are
incurred incidental to a particular project. Such costs are
expensed as incurred until an acquisition agreement or letter of
intent is signed, and our Board of Directors has approved the
project. Additional costs incurred after this point are
capitalized. When a project begins operations, previously
capitalized project costs are reclassified to equity investments
in affiliates or property, plant and equipment and amortized on
a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the
project’s related assets or revenue contract period.
Capitalized costs are charged to expense if a project is
abandoned or management otherwise determines the costs to be
unrecoverable.

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest
expense on a basis which approximates the effective interest
method over the terms of the related debt.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets represent contractual rights held by us.
Intangible assets are amortized over their economic useful life
and reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis.

Income Taxes

The Reorganized NRG’s income tax provision for the year
ended December 31, 2004 and for the period December 6,
2003 through December 31, 2003 have been recorded on the
basis that we and our U.S. subsidiaries will reconsolidate
for federal income tax purposes as of December 6, 2003. The
Reorganized NRG is no longer owned by Xcel Energy and thus, no
longer included in the Xcel Energy affiliated group. The change
in ownership allows us to file a consolidated federal income tax
return with our U.S. subsidiaries starting on
December 6, 2003.

The Predecessor Company’s income tax provision has been
recorded on the basis that Xcel Energy has not included us in
its consolidated federal income tax return following Xcel
Energy’s acquisition of our public shares on June 3,
2002. Since we and our U.S. subsidiaries will not be
included in the Xcel Energy’s consolidated tax group, each
of our U.S. subsidiaries that is classified as a
corporation for U.S. income tax purposes must file a
separate federal income tax return for the periods ended
December 31, 2002 and December 5, 2003.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in
future years of temporary differences between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at
each year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates
applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected
to affect taxable income. Income tax expense is the tax payable
for the period and the change during the period



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in deferred tax assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is
recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely
than not to be realized.

Revenue Recognition

We are primarily an electric generation company, operating a
portfolio of majority-owned electric generating plants and
certain plants in which our ownership interest is 50% or less
which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
In connection with our electric generation business, we also
produce thermal energy for sale to customers, principally
through steam and chilled water facilities. We also collect
methane gas from landfill sites, which are used for the
generation of electricity. In addition, we sell small amounts of
natural gas and oil to third parties.

Both physical and financial transactions are entered into to
optimize the financial performance of our generating facilities.
Electric energy revenue is recognized upon transmission to the
customer. In regions where bilateral markets exist and physical
delivery of electricity is common from our plants, we record
revenue on a gross basis. In certain markets, which are
operated/controlled by an independent system operator and in
which we have entered into a netting agreement with the ISO,
which results in our receiving a netted invoice, we have
recorded purchased energy as an offset against revenues received
upon the sale of such energy. Revenues derived from the buying
and selling of electricity not sourced from our facilities are
reported net. Capacity and ancillary revenue is recognized when
contractually earned. Disputed revenues are not recorded in the
financial statements until disputes are resolved and collection
is assured.

Revenue from long-term power sales contracts that provide for
higher pricing in the early years of the contract are recognized
in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 91-6,

“Revenue Recognition of Long-Term Power
Sales Contracts.”

This results in revenue deferrals and
recognition on a levelized basis over the term of the contract.

We provide contract operations and maintenance services to some
of our non-consolidated affiliates. Revenue is recognized as
contract services are performed.

We recognize other income for interest income on loans to our
non-consolidated affiliates, as the interest is earned and
realizable.

Derivative Financial Instruments

In January 2001, we adopted FAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,”

or SFAS No. 133, as amended by
SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and
SFAS No. 149. SFAS No. 133, as amended,
requires us to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at
fair value. In some cases hedge accounting may apply. The
criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is
appropriate are a) the designation of the hedge to an
underlying exposure, b) whether or not the overall risk is
being reduced and c) if there is correlation between the
value of the derivative instrument and the underlying
obligation. Formal documentation of the hedging relationship,
the nature of the underlying risk, the risk management
objective, and the means by which effectiveness will be assessed
is created at the inception of the hedge. Changes in the fair
value of non-hedge derivatives are immediately recognized in
earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for
as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the
changes in the fair value of the related hedged assets,
liabilities and firm commitments or for forecasted transactions,
deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income, or OCI, until the hedged transactions
occur and are recognized in earnings. We primarily account for
derivatives under SFAS No. 133, as amended, such as
long-term power sales contracts, long-term gas purchase
contracts and other energy related commodities and financial
instruments used to mitigate variability in earnings due to
fluctuations in spot market prices, hedge fuel requirements at
generation facilities and to protect investments in fuel
inventories. SFAS No. 133, as amended, also applies to
interest rate swaps and foreign currency



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

exchange rate contracts. The application of
SFAS No. 133, as amended, results in increased
volatility in earnings due to the recognition of unrealized
gains and losses. In determining the fair value of these
derivative/financial instruments we use estimates, various
assumptions, judgment of management and when considered
appropriate third party experts in determining the fair value of
these derivatives.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and
    Losses

The local currencies are generally the functional currency of
our foreign operations. Foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates of exchange.
Revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at
weighted-average rates of exchange for the period. The resulting
currency translation adjustments are accumulated and reported as
a separate component of stockholders’ equity and are not
included in the determination of the results of operations.
Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are reported in
results of operations. We recognized foreign currency
transaction gains (losses) of $(1.7) million,
$0.4 million, $(19.8) million and $(10.4) million
for the year ended December 31, 2004, the periods
December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003 and
January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, and for the year
ended December 31, 2002, respectively.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to
concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash,
accounts receivable, notes receivable and investments in debt
securities. Cash accounts are generally held in federally
insured banks. Accounts receivable, notes receivable and
derivative instruments are concentrated within entities engaged
in the energy industry. These industry concentrations may impact
our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or
negatively, in that the customers may be similarly affected by
changes in economic, industry or other conditions. Receivables
are generally not collateralized; however, we believe the credit
risk posed by industry concentration is offset by the
diversification and creditworthiness of our customer base.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables,
accounts payables, and accrued liabilities approximate fair
value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The
carrying amounts of long-term receivables approximate fair
value, as the effective rates for these instruments are
comparable to market rates at year-end, including current
portions. The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on
quoted market prices for those instruments which are traded or
on a present value method using current interest rates for
similar instruments with equivalent credit quality.

Pensions

The determination of our obligation and expenses for pension
benefits is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions.
These assumptions determined by management include the discount
rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of
future compensation increases. Our actuarial consultants use
assumptions for such items as retirement age. The assumptions
used may differ materially from actual results, which may result
in a significant impact to the amount of pension obligation or
expense recorded by us.

Stock Based Compensation

During the fourth quarter of 2003, in accordance with
SFAS Statement No. 148,

“Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosure”

we adopted SFAS No. 123 under the
prospective transition method which requires the application of
the recognition provisions to all employee awards granted,
modified, or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in
which the recognition provisions are first applied. As a result,
we applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123 as of January 1, 2003. As



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

discussed in Note 21, we recognized compensation expense
for the grants issued under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used for all non-qualified
stock options.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted
average of common shares outstanding during the period. Net
income per share, assuming dilution is computed by dividing net
income available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding. Our
common equivalent shares are those that result from dilutive
common stock options, issuance of restricted stock units,
conversion of deferred stock units and conversion of preferred
stock.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.

In recording transactions and balances resulting from business
operations, we use estimates based on the best information
available. Estimates are used for such items as plant
depreciable lives, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts,
actuarially determined benefit costs and the valuation of
long-term energy commodities contracts, among others. In
addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets for
impairment and to determine fair value of impaired assets. As
better information becomes available (or actual amounts are
determinable), the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently,
operating results can be affected by revisions to prior
accounting estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified for
comparative purposes. These reclassifications had no effect on
our net income or total stockholders’ equity as previously
reported.

Recent Accounting Developments

In November 2004, the Emerging Issue Task Force, or EITF, issued
EITF No. 03-13, “Applying the Conditions in
Paragraph 42 of FASB Statement No. 144,

Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

in
Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations”.
EITF 03-13 clarifies the definition of cash flows of a
component in which the seller engages in activities with the
component after disposal, and significant continuing involvement
in the operations of the component after the disposal
transaction, and is effective for fiscal periods beginning after
December 15, 2004. We are currently in the process of
evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this
standard will have on our consolidated financial position and
results of operations.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

“Inventory Costs — an amendment of ARB
No. 43, Chapter 4”.

This statement amends the
guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory
Pricing”, and requires that idle facility expense,
excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs be
recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they
meet the criterion of “so abnormal” established by ARB
No. 43. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory
costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2005. We are currently in the process of evaluating the
potential impact that the adoption of this statement will have
on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,

“Share-Based Payment”

, a revision to
SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation”

, which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”

and
its related implementation guidance. SFAS 123R establishes
standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services,
including obtaining employee services in share-based payment
transactions. SFAS 123R applies to all awards granted after
the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased,
or cancelled after that date. Adoption of the provisions of
SFAS 123R is effective as of the beginning of the first
interim or annual reporting period that begins after
June 15, 2005. We have previously adopted
SFAS No. 123, and we are currently in the process of
evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of
SFAS 123R will have on our consolidated financial position
and results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued two FASB Staff Positions, or
FSPs, regarding the accounting implications of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 related to (1) the deduction for
qualified domestic production activities (FSP FAS 109-1)
and (2) the one-time tax benefit for the repatriation of
foreign earnings (FSP FAS 109-2). In FSP FAS 109-1,

“Application of FASB Statement No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes,” to the Tax Deduction on
Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004”,

the Board decided that the
deduction for qualified domestic production activities should be
accounted for as a special deduction under FASB Statement
No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes”

and
rejected an alternative view to treat it as a rate reduction.
Accordingly, any benefit from the deduction should be reported
in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the tax
return. FSP FAS 109-2,

“Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004”,

addresses the
appropriate point at which a company should reflect in its
financial statements the effects of the one-time tax benefit on
the repatriation of foreign earnings. Because of the proximity
of the Act’s enactment date to many companies’
year-ends, its temporary nature, and the fact that numerous
provisions of the Act are sufficiently complex and ambiguous,
the Board decided that absent additional clarifying regulations,
companies may not be in a position to assess the impact of the
Act on their plans for repatriation or reinvestment of foreign
earnings. Therefore, the Board provided companies with a
practical exception to FAS 109’s requirements by
providing them additional time to determine the amount of
earnings, if any, that they intend to repatriate under the
Act’s beneficial provisions. The Board confirmed, however,
that upon deciding that some amount of earnings will be
repatriated, a company must record in that period the associated
tax liability, thereby making it clear that a company cannot
avoid recognizing a tax liability when it has decided that some
portion of its foreign earnings will be repatriated. We are
currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact that
the adoption of FSP FAS 109-1 and FSP FAS 109-2 will
have on our consolidated financial position and results of
operations.

Note 3 —

Emergence from Bankruptcy and Fresh Start Reporting

In accordance with the requirements of SOP 90-7, we
determined the reorganization value of NRG and subsidiaries
emerging from bankruptcy to be approximately $9.1 billion.
Reorganization value generally approximates fair value of the
entity before considering liabilities and approximates the
amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the entity
immediately after the restructuring. Several methods are used to
determine the reorganization value; however, generally it is
determined by discounting future cash flows for the
reconstituted business that will emerge from chapter 11
bankruptcy. Our approach was consistent in that our independent
financial advisor’s estimated reorganization enterprise
value of our ongoing projects used a discounted cash flow
approach.

We allocated the reorganization value of $9.1 billion to
our assets in conformity with the procedures specified by
SFAS No. 141. We used a third party to complete an
independent appraisal of our tangible assets, equity investments
and intangible assets and contracts. In completing the fair
value allocation our assets were calculated to be greater than
the reorganization value. As a result, we reallocated the
negative reorganization value to our tangible and intangible
assets in accordance with SFAS No. 141. In preparing
our balance sheet we also recorded each liability existing at
the plan confirmation date, other than deferred taxes, at the
present value of amounts to be paid determined at appropriate
current interest rates. Deferred taxes were reported in



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

conformity with generally accepted accounting principles under
SFAS No. 109. Our equity was recorded at approximately
$2.4 billion representing a price per share of $24.04 for
the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of common stock upon
emergence from bankruptcy. We pushed down the effects of fresh
start reporting to all of our subsidiaries.

In constructing our Fresh Start balance sheet using our
reorganization value upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we used
a reorganization equity value of approximately
$2.4 billion, as we believe this value to be the best
indication of the value of the ownership distributed to the new
equity owners. Accordingly, our reorganization value of
$9.1 billion was determined by adding our reorganized
equity value of $2.4 billion, $3.7 billion of interest
bearing debt and our other liabilities of $3.0 billion.
This value is consistent with the voting creditors and
Court’s approval of the Plan of Reorganization.

The determination of the enterprise value and the allocations to
the underlying assets and liabilities were based on a number of
estimates and assumptions, which are inherently subject to
significant uncertainties and contingencies.

We recorded approximately $3.9 billion of net
reorganization income (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain
from continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from
discontinued operations) in the Predecessor Company’s
statement of operations for 2003, which includes the gain on the
restructuring of debt and equity and the discharge of
obligations subject to compromise for less than recorded
amounts, as well as adjustments to the historical carrying
values of our assets and liabilities to fair market value.

Due to the adoption of Fresh Start as of December 5, 2003,
the Reorganized NRG statement of operations and statement of
cash flows have not been prepared on a consistent basis with the
Predecessor Company’s financial statements and are not
comparable in certain respects to the financial statements prior
to the application of Fresh Start. The accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements have been prepared to distinguish between
Reorganized NRG and the Predecessor Company.

APB No. 18,

“The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock”,

requires us to
effectively push down the effects of Fresh Start reporting to
our unconsolidated equity method investments and to recognize an
adjustment to our share of the earnings or losses of an investee
as if the investee was a consolidated subsidiary. As a result of
pushing down the impact of Fresh Start to our West Coast Power
affiliate we determined that a contract based intangible asset
with a one year remaining life, consisting of the value of West
Coast Power’s California Department of Water Resources
energy sales contract, must be established and recognized as a
basis adjustment to our share of the future earnings generated
by West Coast Power. This adjustment reduced our equity earnings
in the amount of approximately $10.4 million per month
during 2004 until the contract expired in December 2004.

Financial Instruments

The estimated fair values of our recorded financial instruments
are as follows:

For cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts
receivable and accounts payable, the carrying amount
approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of
those instruments. The fair value of notes receivable is based
on expected future cash flows discounted at market interest
rates. Decommissioning fund investments are comprised of various
U.S. debt securities carried at amortized cost, which
approximates their fair value. The fair value of long-term debt
is estimated based on quoted market prices for those instruments
which are traded or on a present value method using current
interest rates for similar instruments with equivalent credit
quality.

Note 6 —

Discontinued Operations

We have classified certain business operations, and
gains/(losses) recognized on sale, as discontinued operations
for projects that were sold or have met the required criteria
for such classification. The financial results for all of these
businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations.
Accordingly, current period operating results and prior periods
have been restated to report the operations as discontinued.

SFAS No. 144 requires that discontinued operations be
valued on an asset-by-asset basis at the lower of carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell. In applying those
provisions our management considered cash flow analyses, bids
and offers related to those assets and businesses. This amount
is included in income/(loss) on discontinued operations, net of
income taxes in the accompanying Statement of Operations. In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, assets
held for sale will not be depreciated commencing with their
classification as such.

$12.4 million for the NEO Landfill Gas, Inc. project and
$11.7 million for the TERI project offset by other credits
of $186.6 million. The pre-tax gain or loss on disposals of
discontinued components consist of the following:

McClain

— We reviewed the recoverability of our
McClain assets pursuant to SFAS No. 144 and recorded a
charge of $100.7 million in the second quarter of 2003. On
August 14, 2003, NRG’s Board of Directors approved a
plan to sell its 77% interest in McClain Generating Station, a
520-MW combined-cycle, natural gas-fired facility located in New
Castle, Oklahoma. On July 9, 2004, NRG McClain completed
the sale of its 77% interest in the McClain Generating Station
to Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company. The Oklahoma
Municipal Power Authority will continue to own the remaining 23%
interest in the facility. The proceeds of $160.2 million
from the sale were used to repay outstanding project debt under
the secured term loan and working capital facility. A loss of
$3.0 million was recognized as of June 30, 2004 based
upon the final terms of the sale.

Penobscot Energy Recovery Company (PERC)

—
During the first quarter of 2004, we received board
authorization to proceed with the sale of our interest in PERC
to SET PERC Investment LLC which reached financial closing in
April 2004. Upon completion of the transaction, we received net
proceeds of $18.4 million, resulting in a gain of
$3.2 million.

Cobee

— During the first quarter of 2004, we
entered into an agreement for the sale of our interest in our
Cobee project to Globeleq Holdings Limited, which reached
financial closing in April 2004. Upon completion of the
transaction, we received net proceeds of approximately
$50.0 million, resulting in a gain of $2.8 million.

LSP Energy — Batesville — On

August 24, 2004, we completed the sale of our
100 percent interest in an 837-megawatt generating plant in
Batesville, Mississippi to CEP Batesville Acquisition, LLC. CEP
Batesville Acquisition, LLC assumed approximately
$300 million of outstanding project debt. The transaction
resulted in the elimination of $289.3 million in
consolidated debt from NRG Energy’s balance sheet. In
exchange for the sale, we received cash proceeds of
$27.6 million. We recorded a gain of $11.0 million in
2004.

Hsin Yu

— During the second quarter of 2004, we
entered into an agreement for the sale of our interest in our
Hsin Yu project to a minority interest shareholder, Asia Pacific
Energy Development Company Ltd., which reached financial closing
in May 2004. Upon completion of the transaction, we received net
proceeds of $0.2 million, resulting in a gain of
approximately $10.3 million, resulting from our negative
equity in the project. In addition, although we have no
continuing involvement in the project, we retained the prospect
of receiving an additional $1.0 million in additional
proceeds upon final closing of Phase II of the project.

NEO Corporation

— In August of 1995, we entered
into a Marketing, Development and Joint Proposing Agreement, or
the Marketing Agreement, with Cambrian Energy Development LLC,
or Cambrian. Various claims had arisen in connection with this
Marketing Agreement. In November 2003, we entered into a
settlement agreement with Cambrian where we agreed to transfer
our 100% interest in three gasco projects (NEO Ft. Smith,
NEO Phoenix and NEO Woodville). During the third quarter of
2004, we completed the sale of four wholly-owned
entities — NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO
Prima Deshecha LLC and NEO Tajiguas LLC, as well as the sale of
several NEO investments — Four Hills LLC, Minnesota
Methane II LLC, NEO Montauk Genco LLC and NEO Montauk Gasco
LLC to Algonquin Power of Canada (see Note 7). Upon
completion of the transaction, we received cash proceeds of
$5.8 million, resulting in a $6.0 million gain
associated with the four wholly-owned entities sold and received
cash proceeds of $6.1 million resulting in a loss of
approximately $3.8 million attributable to the equity
investments sold. The sale of these equity investments do not
qualify for reporting purposes as discontinued operations.

Killingholme

— During third quarter 2002, we
recorded an impairment charge of $477.9 million. In January
2003, we completed the sale of our interest in the Killingholme
project to our lenders for a nominal value and forgiveness of
outstanding debt with a carrying value of approximately
$360.1 million at December 31, 2002. The sale of our
interest in the Killingholme project and the release of debt
obligations resulted in a gain on sale in the first quarter of
2003 of approximately $191.2 million. The gain results from
the write-down of the project’s assets in the third quarter
of 2002 below the carrying value of the related debt.

NLGI

— During 2002, we recorded an impairment
charge of $12.4 million related to subsidiaries of NLGI, an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG Energy. The charge was
related largely to asset impairments based on a revised project
outlook. During the quarter ended March 31, 2003, we
recorded impairment charges of $23.6 million related to
subsidiaries of NLGI and a charge of $14.5 million to write
off our 50% investment in Minnesota Methane, LLC. (See
Note 7). Through April 30, 2003, NRG Energy and
NLGI failed to make certain payments causing a default under
NLGI’s term loan agreements. In May 2003, the project
lenders to the wholly-owned subsidiaries of NLGI and Minnesota
Methane LLC foreclosed on our membership interest in the NLGI
subsidiaries and our equity interest in Minnesota Methane LLC.
There was no material gain or loss recognized as a result of the
foreclosure.

TERI

— During 2002, we recorded an impairment
charge of $11.7 million based on a revised project outlook.
In September 2003, we completed the sale of TERI, a biomass
waste-fuel power plant located in Florida and a wood processing
facility located in Georgia, to DG Telogia Power, LLC. The sale
resulted in net proceeds of approximately $1.0 million. We
entered into an agreement to sell the wood processing facility on

behalf of DG Telogia Power, LLC. This sale was completed during
fourth quarter 2003 and we received cash consideration of
approximately $1.0 million, resulting in a net gain on sale
of approximately $1.0 million.

Cahua and Energia Pacasmayo

— In November 2003,
we completed the sale of Cahua and Energia Pacasmayo resulting
in net cash proceeds of approximately $16.2 million and a
loss of $36.9 million. In addition, we received an
additional consideration adjustment of approximately
$0.7 million during 2004.

Crockett Cogeneration Project

— In September
2002, we announced that we had reached an agreement to sell our
57.7% interest in the Crockett Cogeneration Project, a
240 MW natural gas fueled cogeneration plant near
San Francisco, California, to Energy Investment
Fund Group, an existing LP, and a unit of GE Capital.
In November 2002, the sale closed and we realized net cash
proceeds of approximately $52.1 million (net of cash
transferred of $0.2 million) and a loss on disposal of
approximately $11.5 million.

Bulo Bulo

— In June 2002, we began negotiations
to sell our 60% interest in Compania Electrica Central Bulo Bulo
S.A. (Bulo Bulo), a Bolivian corporation. The transaction
reached financial close in the fourth quarter of 2002 resulting
in cash proceeds of $10.9 million (net of cash transferred
of $8.6 million) and a loss of $10.6 million.

Csepel and Entrade

— In September 2002, we
announced that we had reached agreements to sell our Csepel
power generating facilities (located in Budapest, Hungary) and
our interest in Entrade (an electricity trading business
headquartered in Prague) to Atel, an independent energy group
headquartered in Switzerland. The sales of Csepel and Entrade
closed before year-end 2002 and resulted in cash proceeds of
$92.6 million (net of cash transferred of
$44.1 million) and a gain of approximately
$24.0 million.

Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership
(CALP)

— In June 2004, we executed an agreement to
sell our 50% interest in CALP. During the third quarter of 2004,
we recorded an impairment charge of approximately
$3.7 million to write down the value of our investment in
CALP to its fair value. The sale closed in November 2004
resulting in net cash proceeds of $14.9 million. Total
impairment charges as a result of the sale were
$4.6 million.

James River Power LLC

— In September 2004, we
executed an agreement with Colonial Power Company LLC to sell
all of our outstanding shares of stock in Capistrano
Cogeneration Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
NRG Energy which owns a 50% interest in James River
Cogeneration Company. During the third quarter of 2004, we
recorded an impairment charge of approximately $6.0 million
to write down the value of our investment in James River to its
fair value. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the sales
agreement

was terminated. We continue to impair any additional equity
earnings based on its fair value. Total impairment charges for
2004 were $7.3 million.

NEO Corporation

— On September 30, 2004,
we completed the sale of several NEO investments —
Four Hills LLC, Minnesota Methane II LLC, NEO Montauk Genco
LLC and NEO Montauk Gasco LLC to Algonquin Power of Canada. The
sale also included four wholly-owned NEO subsidiaries (see
Note 6). We received cash proceeds of $6.1 million.
The sale resulted in a loss of approximately $3.8 million
attributable to the equity investment entities sold.

Calpine Cogeneration

— In January 2004, we
executed an agreement to sell our 20% interest in Calpine
Cogeneration Corporation to Calpine Power Company. The
transaction closed in March 2004 and resulted in net cash
proceeds of $2.5 million and a net gain of
$0.2 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we
received additional consideration on the sale of
$0.5 million, resulting in an adjusted net gain of
$0.7 million.

NLGI — Minnesota Methane —

We
recorded an impairment charge of $12.3 million during 2002
to write-down our 50% investment in Minnesota Methane. We
recorded an additional impairment charge of $14.5 million
during the first quarter of 2003. These charges were related to
a revised project outlook and management’s belief that the
decline in fair value was other than temporary. In May 2003, the
project lenders to the wholly-owned subsidiaries of NEO Landfill
Gas, Inc. and Minnesota Methane LLC foreclosed on our membership
interest in the NEO Landfill Gas, Inc. subsidiaries and our
equity interest in Minnesota Methane LLC. Upon completion of the
foreclosure, we recorded a gain of $2.2 million resulting
in a net impairment charge of $12.3 million. The gain upon
completion of the foreclosure resulted from the release of
certain obligations upon completion of the foreclosure.

NLGI — MM Biogas —

We recorded an
impairment charge of $3.2 million during 2002 to write-down
our 50% investment in MM Biogas. This charge was related to a
revised project outlook and management’s belief that the
decline in fair value was other than temporary. In November
2003, we entered into a sales agreement with Cambrian Energy
Development to sell our 50% interest in MM Biogas. We recorded
an additional impairment charge of $2.6 million during the
fourth quarter of 2003 due to developments related to the sale
that indicated an impairment of our book value that was
considered to be other than temporary.

Kondapalli

— In the fourth quarter of 2002, we
wrote down our investment in Kondapalli by $12.7 million
due to recent estimates of sales value, which indicated an
impairment of our book value that was considered to be other
than temporary. On January 30, 2003, we signed a sale
agreement with the Genting Group of Malaysia, or Genting, to
sell our 30% interest in Lanco Kondapalli Power Pvt Ltd, or
Kondapalli, and a 74% interest in Eastern Generation Services
(India) Pvt Ltd (the O&M company). Kondapalli is based in
Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India, and is the owner of a
368 MW natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine. In the
first quarter of 2003, we wrote down our investment in
Kondapalli by $1.3 million based on the final sale
agreement. The sale closed on May 30, 2003 resulting in net
cash proceeds of approximately $24 million and a gain of
approximately $1.8 million resulting in a net gain of
$0.5 million. The gain resulted from incurring lower
selling costs than estimated as part of the first quarter
impairment.

ECKG

— In September 2002, we announced that we
had reached agreement to sell our 44.5% interest in the ECKG
power station in connection with our Csepel power generating
facilities, and our interest in Entrade, an electricity trading
business, to Atel, an independent energy group headquartered in
Switzerland. The transaction closed in January 2003 and resulted
in cash proceeds of $65.3 million and a net loss of less
than $1.0 million. In accordance with the purchase
agreement, we were to receive additional consideration if Atel
purchased shares held by our partner. During the second quarter
of 2003, we received approximately $3.7 million of
additional consideration resulting in a net gain of
$2.9 million.

Loy Yang

— Based on a third party market
valuation and bids received in response to marketing Loy Yang
for possible sale, we recorded a write down of our investment of
approximately $111.4 million during 2002. This write-down
reflected management’s belief that the decline in fair
value of the investment was other

than temporary. In May 2003, we entered into negotiations that
culminated in the completion of a Share Purchase Agreement to
sell 100% of the Loy Yang project. Consequently, we recorded an
additional impairment charge of approximately
$146.4 million during 2003. In April 2004 we completed the
sale of Loy Yang which resulted in net cash proceeds of
$26.7 million and a loss of $1.3 million.

Mustang Station

— On July 7, 2003, we
completed the sale of our 25% interest in Mustang Station, a
gas-fired combined cycle power generating plant located in
Denver City, Texas, to EIF Mustang Holdings I, LLC. The
sale resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately
$13.3 million and a net gain of approximately
$12.1 million.

Energy Development Limited

— On July 25,
2002, we announced that we completed the sale of our ownership
interests in an Australian energy company, Energy Development
Limited, or EDL. EDL is a listed Australian energy company
engaged in the development and management of an international
portfolio of projects with a particular focus on renewable and
waste fuels. In October 2002, we received proceeds of AUD
78.5 million, or approximately $43.9 million (USD), in
exchange for our ownership interest in EDL with the closing of
the transaction. During the third quarter of 2002, we recorded
an impairment charge of approximately $14.2 million to
write down the carrying value of our equity investment due to
the pending sale.

Sabine River

— In September 2002, we agreed to
transfer our indirect 50% interest in SRW Cogeneration LP, or
SRW, to our partner in SRW, Conoco, Inc. in consideration for
Conoco’s agreement to terminate or assume all of our
obligations, in relation to SRW. SRW owns a cogeneration
facility in Orange County, Texas. We recorded a charge of
approximately $48.4 million during the quarter ended
September 30, 2002 to write down the carrying value of our
investment due to the pending sale. The transaction closed on
November 5, 2002.

Kingston

— In December 2002, we completed the
sale of our 25% interest in Kingston Cogeneration LP, based near
Toronto, Canada to Northland Power Income Fund. We received net
proceeds of $15.0 million resulting in a gain on sale of
approximately $9.9 million.

Mt. Poso

— In September 2002, we agreed to sell
our 39.5% indirect partnership interest in the Mt. Poso
Cogeneration Company, a California limited partnership, or Mt.
Poso, for approximately $10 million to Red Hawk Energy,
LLC. Mt. Poso owns a 49.5 MW coal-fired cogeneration power
plant and thermally enhanced oil recovery facility located
20 miles north of Bakersfield, California. The sale closed
in November 2002 resulting in a loss of approximately
$1.0 million.

Powersmith

— During the fourth quarter of 2002,
we wrote down our investment in Powersmith in the amount of
approximately $3.4 million due to recent developments,
which indicated impairment of our book value that was considered
to be other than temporary.

Collinsville Power Station

— Based on third
party market valuation and bids received in response to
marketing the investment for possible sale, we recorded a write
down of our investment of approximately $4.1 million during
the second quarter of 2002. In August 2002, we announced that we
had completed the sale of our 50% interest in the 192 MW
Collinsville Power Station in Australia, to our partner, a
subsidiary of Transfield Services Limited for AUD
8.6 million, or approximately $4.8 million (USD). Our
ultimate loss on the sale of Collinsville Power Station was
approximately $3.6 million.

Corporate Relocation Charges

On March 16, 2004, we announced plans to implement a new
regional business strategy and structure. The new structure
called for a reorganized leadership team and a corporate
headquarters relocation to Princeton, New Jersey. The corporate
headquarters staff were streamlined as part of the relocation,
as functions were either reduced or shifted to the regions. As
of December 31, 2004, the transition of our corporate
headquarters is substantially complete.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded
$16.2 million for charges related to our corporate
relocation activities, primarily for employee severance and
termination benefits and employee related transition costs.
These charges are classified separately in our statement of
operations, in accordance with SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities”.

We expect to incur an additional
$7.7 million of SFAS No. 146-classified expenses
in connection with corporate relocation charges for a total of
$23.9 million. Of this total, relocating, recruiting and
other employee-related transition costs are expected to be
approximately $11.9 million and have been and will continue
to be expensed as incurred. These costs and cash payments are
expected to be incurred through the second quarter of 2005.
Severance and termination benefits of $7.2 million are
expected to be incurred through the second quarter of 2005 with
cash payments being made through the fourth quarter of 2005.
Building lease termination costs are expected to be
$4.8 million. These costs are expected to be incurred
through the first quarter of 2005 with cash payments being made
through the fourth quarter of 2006.

As of December 31, 2004, the net restructuring liability
was $3.6 million, the majority of which is included in
other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
Charges related to the employee related transition costs,
severance and termination benefits and lease termination costs
are recorded at our corporate level within our All
Other — Other segment, in the corporate relocation
charges line on the consolidated statement of operations.

Reorganization Items

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded a net
credit of $13.4 million related primarily to the settlement
of obligations recorded under Fresh Start. For the periods
December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003 and
January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, we incurred
$2.5 million and $197.8 million, respectively, in
reorganization costs. All reorganization costs have been
incurred since we filed for bankruptcy in May 2003. The
following table provides the detail of the types of costs
incurred. There were no reorganization items in 2002.

Impairment Charges

We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets in
accordance with the guidelines of SFAS No. 144. As a
result of this review, we recorded impairment charges of
$44.7 million, $228.9 million and $2.5 billion,
for the year ended December 31, 2004, the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and for the
year ended December 31, 2002, respectively, as shown in the
table below.

To determine whether an asset was impaired, we compared
asset-carrying values to total future estimated undiscounted
cash flows. If an asset was determined to be impaired based on
the cash flow testing performed, an impairment loss was recorded
to write down the asset to its fair value.

Impairment charges (credits) included the following asset
impairments (realized gains) for the year ended
December 31, 2004, the period January 1, 2003 to
December 5, 2003 and for the year ended December 31,
2002. There were no impairment charges for the period
December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Louisiana Generating LLC

— In January 2004, we
closed the South Central regional office in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana and offered it for sale. During the fourth quarter of
2004, we recorded a charge of $0.5 million related to the
impairment to net realizable value based on two offers received.
Louisiana Generating is included in our South Central segment.

New Roads Holding LLC

— During the second
quarter of 2004, we reviewed the recoverability of our New Roads
assets pursuant to SFAS No. 144 and recorded a charge
of approximately $1.7 million related to the impairment to
realizable value of a turbine acquired in March 2000 from Cajun
Electric. During the third quarter of 2004, we recorded an
additional charge of $0.7 million to write the
turbine’s value down to its scrap value. New Roads Holding
is included in our South Central segment.

Connecticut Facilities (Devon Power LLC and Middletown Power
LLC)

— As a result of regulatory developments and
changing circumstances in the second quarter of 2003, we updated
the facilities’ cash flow models to incorporate changes to
reflect the impact of the April 25, 2003 FERC’s orders
on regional and locational pricing, and to update the estimated
impact of future locational capacity or deliverability
requirements. Based on these revised cash flow models,
management determined that the new estimates of pricing and cost
recovery levels were not projected to return sufficient revenue
to cover the fixed costs at Devon Power LLC and Middletown Power
LLC. As a consequence, during the second quarter of 2003 we
recorded $64.2 million and $157.3 million as
impairment charges for Devon Power LLC and Middletown



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Power LLC, respectively. In the third quarter of 2004, ISO-NE
informed the Company that it would not extend the RMR contract
for Devon units 7 and 8. As a result, both units have been
placed on deactivated reserve and we recorded an additional
impairment charge of $0.2 million for Devon Power LLC.
Devon Power and Middletown Power are included in our Northeast
segment.

Arthur Kill Power, LLC

— During the third
quarter of 2003, we cancelled our plans to re-establish fuel oil
capacity at our Arthur Kill plant. This resulted in a charge of
approximately $9.0 million to write-off assets under
development. Arthur Kill Power is included in our Northeast
segment.

Langage (UK)

— During the third quarter of
2002, we reviewed the recoverability of our Langage assets
pursuant to SFAS No. 144 and recorded a charge of
$42.3 million. In August 2003 we closed on the sale of
Langage to Carlton Power Limited resulting in net cash proceeds
of approximately $1.5 million, of which $1.0 million
was received in 2003 and $0.5 million was received during
the first quarter of 2004, and a net gain of approximately
$3.1 million. Langage is included in our All Other segment
under the Other International category.

Turbines

— In October 2003, we closed on the
sale of three turbines and related equipment. The sale resulted
in net cash proceeds of $70.7 million and a gain of
approximately $21.9 million. Turbines are included in our
All Other segment under the Other category.

Berrians Project

— During the fourth quarter of
2003, we cancelled plans to construct the Berrians peaking
facility on the land adjacent to our Astoria facility. Berrians
was originally scheduled to commence operations in the summer of
2005; however, based on the remaining costs to complete and the
current risk profile of merchant peaking units, the construction
project was terminated. This resulted in a charge of
approximately $14.3 million to write off the project’s
assets. Berrians is included in our Other North America segment.

TermoRio

— TermoRio was a green field
cogeneration project located in the state of Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. Based on the project’s failure to meet certain key
milestones, we exercised our rights under the project agreements
to sell our debt and equity interests in the project to our
partner, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. Petrobras, or Petrobras. On
May 17, 2002, Petrobras commenced an arbitration. On
March 8, 2003, the arbitral tribunal decided most, but not
all, of the issues in our favor and awarded us approximately
US $80 million. On June 4, 2004, NRG Energy
commenced a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York, seeking to enforce the arbitration award.
On February 16, 2005, a conditional settlement agreement
was signed with our former partner Petrobras, whereby Petrobras
is obligated to pay us US $70.8 million. Such payment
was received by us at a closing held on February 25, 2005.
We have a note receivable of $57.3 million related to the
arbitration award. The amounts received in excess of
$57.3 million will be recorded to earnings in the first
quarter of 2005. In addition to the settlement above, we retain
the right to continue to seek recovery of
US $12.3 million in a related dispute with a third
party in Brazil. TermoRio is included in our All Other segment
under the Other International category.

Meriden

— During the third quarter of 2004, we
reviewed the recoverability of our Meriden assets pursuant to
SFAS No. 144 and recorded a charge of
$15.0 million related to the impairment to realizable value
of a turbine. An agreement for the sale of equipment previously
located at the Meriden site has been executed and we expect to
complete the sale in the first quarter of 2005. Meriden is
included in our All Other segment under the Other category.

Kendall

— In September 2004, we executed an
agreement to sell our 1,160 MW generating plant in Minooka,
Illinois to an affiliate of LS Power Associates, L.P and
recorded a charge of approximately $24.5 million related to
the impairment to realizable value. Under the terms of the
agreement, we have the right to acquire a 40% interest in the
plant within a 10-year period for a nominal amount. Therefore,
the transaction was treated as a partial sale for accounting
purposes. In December 2004 we completed the sale and



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

received net proceeds of $1.0 million, resulting in a loss
on sale of $2.0 million and a total loss of
$26.5 million. Kendall is included in our Other North
America segment.

Credit rating downgrades, defaults under certain credit
agreements, increased collateral requirements and reduced
liquidity experienced during the third quarter of 2002 were
“triggering events” which required us to review the
recoverability of our long-lived assets. Adverse economic
conditions resulted in declining energy prices. Consequently, we
determined that many of our construction projects and
operational projects were impaired during the third quarter of
2002 and should be written down to fair market value. We
recorded total impairment charges of $2.5 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2002.

Restructuring Charges

We incurred $8.7 million of employee separation costs and
advisor fees during 2003 until we filed for bankruptcy in May
2003. Subsequent to that date we recorded all advisor fees as
reorganization costs. We incurred total restructuring charges of
approximately $111.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 consisting of employee separation costs
and advisor fees.

Fresh Start Adjustments

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a net credit of
$3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from
continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from
discontinued operations) in connection with fresh start
adjustments as discussed in Note 3.

Following is a summary of the significant effects of the
reorganization and Fresh Start:

Legal Settlement Charges

During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003,
we recorded $462.6 million of legal settlement charges
which consisted of the following. We recorded
$396.0 million in connection with the resolution of an
arbitration claim asserted by FirstEnergy Corp. As a result of
this resolution, FirstEnergy retained ownership of the Lake
Plant Assets and received an allowed general unsecured claim of
$396.0 million under NRG Energy’s Plan of
Reorganization. In November 2003, we settled litigation with
Fortistar Capital in which Fortistar Capital released us from
all litigation claims in exchange for a $60.0 million
pre-petition



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

bankruptcy claim and an $8.0 million post-petition
bankruptcy claim. We had previously recorded $10.8 million
in connection with various legal disputes with Fortistar
Capital; accordingly, we recorded an additional
$57.2 million during November 2003. In November 2003, we
settled our dispute with Dick Corporation in connection with
Meriden Gas Turbines LLC through the payment of a general
unsecured claim and a post-petition pre-confirmation payment.
This settlement resulted in our recording an additional
liability of $8.0 million in November 2003.

In August 1995, we entered into a Marketing, Development and
Joint Proposing Agreement, or the Marketing Agreement, with
Cambrian Energy Development LLC, or Cambrian. Various claims
arose in connection with the Marketing Agreement. In November
2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with Cambrian where
we agreed to transfer our 100% interest in three gasco projects
(NEO Ft. Smith, NEO Phoenix and NEO Woodville) and our 50%
interest in two genco projects (MM Phoenix and MM Woodville) to
Cambrian. In addition, we paid approximately $1.8 million
in settlement of royalties incurred in connection with the
Marketing Agreement. We had previously recorded a liability for
royalties owed to Cambrian, therefore, we recorded an additional
$1.4 million during November 2003.

Note 9 —

Asset Retirement Obligation

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted
SFAS No. 143,

“Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations”

or SFAS No. 143.
SFAS No. 143 requires an entity to recognize the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the
period in which it is incurred. Upon initial recognition of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation, an entity shall
capitalize an asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount as the
liability. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present
value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over
the useful life of the related asset. Retirement obligations
associated with long-lived assets included within the scope of
SFAS No. 143 are those for which a legal obligation
exists under enacted laws, statutes and written or oral
contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of
promissory estoppel.

We identified certain retirement obligations within our power
generation operations in the Northeast region, the South Central
region and Australia. We also identified retirement obligations
within our All Other segment under the Alternative Energy
category and the Non-Generation category. These asset retirement
obligations are related primarily to the future dismantlement of
equipment on leased property and environment obligations related
to ash disposal site closures and fuel storage facilities. We
also identified other asset retirement obligations including
plant dismantlement that could not be calculated because the
assets associated with the retirement obligations were
determined to have an indeterminate life. The adoption of
SFAS No. 143 resulted in recording a $2.6 million
increase to property, plant and equipment and a
$4.2 million increase to other long-term obligations. The
cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 was
recorded as a $0.6 million increase to depreciation expense
and a $1.6 million increase to cost of majority-owned
operations in the period from January 1, 2003 to
December 5, 2003 as we considered the cumulative effect to
be immaterial.

The following represents the balances of the asset retirement
obligation as of January 1, 2003 and the additions and
accretion of the asset retirement obligation for the period
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, the period
of December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 and the
year ended December 31, 2004. The asset retirement
obligation is included in other long-term obligations in the
consolidated balance sheet. Prior to December 5, 2003, we
completed our annual review of asset retirement obligations. As
part of that review we made revisions to our previously recorded
obligation in the amount of $4.0 million. The revisions
included identification of new obligations as well as changes in
costs required at retirement date. As a result of adopting Fresh
Start we revalued our asset retirement obligations on
December 6, 2003. We recorded an additional asset
retirement obligation of $7.3 million in connection with
fresh start reporting. This amount

Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method

We have investments in various international and domestic energy
projects. The equity method of accounting is applied to such
investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and
partnerships, because the ownership structure prevents us from
exercising a controlling influence over operating and financial
policies of the projects. Under this method, equity in pretax
income or losses of domestic partnerships and, generally, in the
net income or losses of international projects, are reflected as
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.

A summary of certain of our more significant equity-method
investments, which were in operation at December 31, 2004,
is as follows:



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During 2004, we sold our equity investments in Commonwealth
Atlantic Limited Partnership, four NEO investments (Four Hills
LLC, Minnesota Methane II LLC, NEO Montauk Genco LLC and
NEO Montauk Gasco LLC), Calpine Cogeneration, Loy Yang,
Kondapalli, and ECKG. Summarized financial information for
investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the
equity method is as follows:

We have ownership interests in two companies that were
considered significant as defined by applicable SEC regulations
as of December 31, 2004: West Coast Power LLC and Enfield
Energy Centre Limited. We account for our investments using the
equity method. Our carrying value of equity investments is
impacted by impairments, unrealized gains and losses on
derivatives and movements in foreign currency exchange rates as
well as other adjustments.

West Coast Power LLC Summarized Financial
    Information

We have a 50% interest in West Coast Power LLC. Upon adoption of
Fresh Start we adjusted our investment in West Coast Power to
fair value as of December 6, 2003. In accordance with APB
Opinion 18, we have reconciled the value of our investment
as of December 6, 2003 to our share of West Coast Powers
partner’s equity. As a result of pushing down the impact of
Fresh Start to the project’s balance sheet, we determined
that a contract based intangible asset with a one year remaining
life, consisting of the value of West Coast Power’s CDWR
energy sales contract, must be established and recognized as a
basis adjustment to our share of the future earnings generated
by West Coast Power. This adjustment reduced our equity earnings
in the amount of $115.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 until the contract expired in December
2004. Offsetting this reduction in earnings is a favorable
adjustment to reflect a lower depreciation expense resulting
from the corresponding reduced value of the project’s fixed
assets from Fresh Start reporting. During the year ended
December 31, 2004 we recorded equity earnings of
$68.9 million for West Coast Power after adjustments for
the reversal of $31.7 million project-level depreciation
expense, offset by a decrease in earnings related to
$115.8 million amortization of the intangible asset for the
CDWR contract. During the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 we recorded equity earnings of
$9.4 million for West Coast Power after adjustments for the
reversal of $2.6 million project-level depreciation
expense, offset by a decrease in earnings related to
$8.8 million amortization of the intangible asset for the
CDWR contract. The following table summarizes financial
information for West Coast Power LLC, including interests owned

Enfield Energy Centre Limited

We own a 25% interest in Enfield Energy Centre Limited, or EECL,
located in Enfield, North London, UK. EECL owns and operates a
396 MW, natural gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine power
station. EECL sells electricity generated from the plant in
North London and the gas generated from the plant under a long-

term gas supply contract. Enfield has a long-term agreement that
effectively fixes the purchase price of its gas supply. The
purpose of the contract, which was executed in August 1997 and
extends through October 2014, is to mitigate the risk associated
with fluctuations in the price of gas utilized in the generation
of electricity at our facility. This contract is considered a
derivative as defined by SFAS No. 133, and is afforded
mark-to-market accounting treatment. We are subject to
volatility in earnings associated with fluctuations in the
market price of gas. Enfield has the ability to consume the gas
for generation, and therefore our risk of loss associated with
the contract is minimal. Given an increase in the price of
natural gas in the UK market during the course of 2004, we
recorded gains of $23.3 million associated with the value
of this contract.

Note 14 —

Decommissioning Funds

We are required by the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality, or LADEQ, to rehabilitate our Big Cajun II ash and
wastewater impoundment areas, subsequent to the Big
Cajun II facilities’ removal from service. On
July 1, 1989, a guarantor trust fund, or the Solid Waste
Disposal Trust Fund, was established to accumulate the
estimated funds necessary for such purpose. Approximately
$1.1 million was initially deposited in the Solid Waste
Disposal Trust Fund in 1989, and $116,000 has been funded
annually thereafter, based upon an estimated future
rehabilitation cost (in 1989 dollars) of approximately
$3.5 million and the remaining estimated useful life of the
Big Cajun II facilities. At December 31, 2004 and
2003, the carrying value of the trust fund investments was
approximately $5.0 million and $4.8 million,
respectively. The trust fund investments are comprised of
various debt securities of the United States and are carried at
amortized cost, which approximates their fair value. The amounts
required to be deposited in this trust fund are separate from
our calculation of the asset retirement obligation recorded for
the Big Cajun II ash and wastewater impoundment areas
discussed in Note 9.

Note 15

— Intangible Assets

Reorganized NRG

Upon the adoption of Fresh Start, we established certain
intangible assets for power sales agreements and plant emission
allowances. These intangible assets will be amortized over their
respective lives based on a straight-line or units of production
basis to resemble our realization of such assets.

Power sale agreements are amortized as a reduction to revenue
over the terms and conditions of each contract. The weighted
average remaining amortization period is two years for the power
sale agreements. Emission allowances are amortized as additional
fuel expense based upon the actual level of emissions from the
respective plants through 2023. Aggregate amortization
recognized for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the
period December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003 was
approximately $49.8 million and $5.2 million,
respectively. The annual aggregate amortization for each of the
five succeeding years, starting with 2005, is expected to
approximate $22.6 million in 2005, $16.5 million in
2006, $15.9 million in 2007, $10.5 million in 2008 and
$10.0 million in 2009 for both the power sale agreements
and emission allowances. The expected annual amortization of
these amounts is expected to change as we relieve our tax
valuation allowance, as explained below.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reduced our
deferred tax valuation allowance by $64.3 million (see
Note 24) and recorded a corresponding reduction of
$55.5 million related to our intangible assets at our
wholly-owned subsidiaries. The remaining $8.8 million was
recorded as a reduction to our intangible asset related to our
equity investments in West Coast Power (see Note 13). In
accordance with SOP 90-7, any future income tax benefits
realized from reducing the valuation allowance should first
reduce intangible assets until exhausted, and thereafter be
recorded as a direct addition to paid-in capital. Intangible
assets were also reduced by $32.7 million consisting of a
$10.4 million reduction in connection with the recognition
of certain tax credits to be claimed on our New York state
franchise tax return and $22.3 million of adjustments
related

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

SFAS No. 133

“Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”

as amended by
SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and
SFAS No. 149 requires us to recognize all derivative
instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities
and measure them at fair value each reporting period. If certain
conditions are met, we may be able to designate our derivatives
as cash flow hedges and defer the effective portion of the
change in fair value of the derivatives in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (OCI) and subsequently recognize in
earnings when the hedged items impact income. The ineffective
portion of a cash flow hedge is immediately recognized in income.

For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets
or liabilities, the changes in fair value of both the
derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current
earnings. The ineffective portion of a hedging derivative
instrument’s change in fair values will be immediately
recognized in earnings.

For derivatives that are neither designated as cash flow hedges
or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in
the fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.

Under the guidelines established by SFAS No. 133, as
amended, certain derivative instruments may qualify for the
normal purchase and sale exception and are therefore exempt from
fair value accounting treatment.

SFAS No. 133 applies to our energy related commodity
contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts
discussed in further detail below.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Energy Related Commodities

As part of our risk management activities, we manage the
commodity price risk associated with our competitive supply
activities and the price risk associated with power sales from
our electric generation

facilities. In doing so, we may enter into a variety of
derivative and non-derivative instruments, including but not
limited to the following:

The objectives for entering into such hedges include:

•

Fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity
    sales at a level that provides an acceptable return on our
    electric generation operations.

•

Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for
    the operation of our power plants.

•

Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated energy purchases to
    supply our load-serving customers.

At December 31, 2004 we had hedge and non-hedge energy
related commodities financial instruments extending through
March 2025. Our energy related contracts that are components of
our derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31,
2004 are as follows:

•

Electric forward and futures contracts sales of electricity
    economically hedging our generation assets forecasted output
    through 2006.

•

Natural gas forward and futures contracts purchases of natural
    gas relating to the forecasted usage of our generation assets
    into 2005.

Also, at December 31, 2004 we had other energy related
contracts that did not qualify as derivatives under the
guidelines established by SFAS No. 133, or we elected
to apply the normal purchase and sale exception as follows:

•

Coal purchase contracts extending through 2007 (designated as
    normal purchases and disclosed as part of our contractual cash
    obligations. See Note 27 Commitments and Contingencies).

•

Natural gas transportation and storage agreements (these
    contracts are not derivatives and are disclosed as part of our
    contractual cash obligations. See Note 27 Commitments and
    Contingencies).

•

Load-following forward electric sales contracts extending
    through 2025 (these contracts are not considered derivatives).

No ineffectiveness was recognized on commodity cash flow hedges
during the year ended December 31, 2004, the periods
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 and
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, or during
the year ended December 31, 2002.

Our pre-tax earnings for the year ended December 31, 2004,
the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003,
the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003,
and the year ended December 31, 2002 were affected by an
unrealized gain of $80.8 million, an unrealized loss of
$0.7 million, an unrealized gain of $53.7 million and
a unrealized gain of $20.0 million, respectively,
associated with changes in the fair value of energy related
derivative instruments not accounted for as hedges in accordance
with SFAS No. 133.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, we reclassified
losses of $3.2 million from OCI to current period earnings.
During the period December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 no gains or losses were

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reclassified from OCI to current-period earnings. Our plan of
reorganization became effective December 5, 2003 and,
accordingly, we made adjustments for Fresh Start in accordance
with SOP 90-7. These Fresh Start adjustments resulted in a
write-off of net gains recorded in OCI of $61.0 million on
energy related derivative instruments accounted for as hedges.
During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5,
2003, we reclassified gains of $112.5 million from OCI to
current period earnings. During the year ended December 31,
2002, we reclassified gains of $83.7 million from OCI to
current-period earnings. We expect to reclassify an additional
$3.9 million of deferred gains to earnings during the next
twelve months on energy related derivative instruments accounted
for as hedges.

Interest Rates

We are exposed to changes in interest rates through our issuance
of variable rate and fixed rate debt. In order to manage this
interest rate risk, we have entered into interest-rate swap
agreements. At December 31, 2004 our consolidating
subsidiaries had various interest-rate swap agreements extending
through June 2019 with combined notional amounts of
$1.3 billion. If these swaps had been terminated at
December 31, 2004 we would have owed the counter-parties
$35.6 million.

At December 31, 2004 all of our interest rate swap
arrangements have been designated as either cash flow or fair
value hedges.

No ineffectiveness was recognized on interest rate swaps that
qualify as hedges during the year ended December 31, 2004,
the periods December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003
and January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and the
year ended December 31, 2002.

Our pre-tax earnings for the year ended December 31, 2004
were increased by an unrealized gain of $0.4 million
associated with changes in the fair value of interest rate
derivative instruments not accounted for as hedges in accordance
with SFAS No. 133. One of these instruments is a
$400 million swap to pay fixed, which was not designated as
a hedge of the expected cash flows at March 31, 2004. As of
April 1, 2004, this instrument was designated as a cash
flow hedge under SFAS No. 133. As a result, changes in
value subsequent to April 1, 2004 are deferred and recorded
as part of OCI.

Our pre-tax earnings for the period December 6, 2003
through December 31, 2003 and the period January 1,
2003 through December 5, 2003 were increased by an
unrealized gain of $2.0 million and decreased by an
unrealized loss of $15.1 million, respectively, associated
with changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative
instruments not accounted for as hedges in accordance with
SFAS No. 133.

Our pre-tax earnings for the year ended December 31, 2002
were decreased by an unrealized loss of $32.0 million
associated with changes in the fair value of interest rate
derivative instruments not accounted for as hedges in accordance
with SFAS No. 133.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, we reclassified
losses of $5.0 million from OCI to current period earnings.
During the periods December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 and January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003, losses of $0 and $29.7 million,
respectively, were reclassified from OCI to current-period
earnings. Our plan of reorganization became effective
December 5, 2003 and, accordingly, we made adjustments for
Fresh Start in accordance with SOP 90-7. These Fresh Start
adjustments resulted in a write-off of net losses recorded in
OCI of $65.9 million on interest rate swaps accounted for
as hedges. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we
reclassified gains of $0.9 million from OCI to
current-period earnings. We do not expect to reclassify any
deferred gains or losses to earnings during the next twelve
months associated with interest rate swaps accounted for as
hedges.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

To preserve the U.S. dollar value of projected foreign
currency cash flows, we may hedge, or protect those cash flows
if appropriate foreign hedging instruments are available. As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, neither we nor our
consolidating subsidiaries had any outstanding foreign currency
exchange contracts.

No ineffectiveness occurred on foreign currency cash flow hedges
during the year ended December 31, 2004, the periods
December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 and
January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, or during
the year ended December 31, 2002.

During the year ended December 31, 2004 and the period
December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003, our pre-tax
earnings were not affected by any gain or loss associated with
foreign currency hedging instruments not accounted for as hedges
in accordance with SFAS No. 133.

Our pre-tax earnings for the period January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003, and for the year ended December 31,
2002 were increased by an unrealized gain of $0.1 million
and $0.3 million, respectively, associated with foreign
currency hedging instruments not accounted for as hedges in
accordance with SFAS No. 133.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, we reclassified
losses of $0.2 million from OCI to current period earnings.
During the periods December 6, 2003 through
December 31, 2003 and January 1, 2003 through
December 5, 2003, no amounts were reclassified from OCI to
current period earnings. Our plan of reorganization became
effective December 5, 2003 and, accordingly, we made
adjustments for Fresh Start in accordance with SOP 90-7.
These Fresh Start adjustments resulted in a write-off of net
losses recorded in OCI of $0.2 million on foreign currency
swaps accounted for as hedges. During the year ended
December 31, 2002, we reclassified losses of
$2.1 million from OCI to current period earnings. We do not
expect to reclassify any deferred gains or losses to earnings
during the next twelve months on foreign currency swaps
accounted for as hedges.

for as hedges. The net balance in OCI relating to
SFAS No. 133, as amended, as of December 31, 2002
was an unrecognized gain of approximately $26.3 million.

Creditor Pool and Other Settlements

A principal component of our plan of reorganization is a
settlement with Xcel Energy in which Xcel Energy agreed to make
a contribution consisting of cash (and, under certain
circumstances, its stock) in the



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

aggregate amount of up to $640 million to be paid in three
separate installments following the effective date of our plan
of reorganization. The Xcel Energy settlement agreement resolves
any and all claims existing between Xcel Energy and us and/or
our creditors and, in exchange for the Xcel Energy contribution,
Xcel Energy received a complete release of claims from us and
our creditors, except for a limited number of creditors who have
preserved their claims as set forth in the confirmation order
entered on November 24, 2003. We received
$288.0 million, $328.5 million and $23.5 million
from Xcel Energy on February 20, 2004, April 30, 2004
and May 28, 2004, respectively. We used the proceeds from
the Xcel Energy settlement to reduce our creditor pool
obligation. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003 the balance of
our creditor pool obligation was $0.0 million and
$540.0 million, respectively. On February 20, 2004,
April 30, 2004, May 28, 2004 and October 29,
2004, we made payments of $163.0 million,
$328.5 million, $23.5 million and $25.0 million,
respectively. In addition, our other bankruptcy settlement
obligation as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was
$175.6 million and $220.0 million, respectively. This
obligation relates to the allowed claims against NRG Energy
related to our Audrain and Pike facilities. See
Note 27 — NRG FinCo Settlement. The net change in
the balance of $44.4 million reflects the sale of certain
of these assets, the proceeds of which were paid to the FinCo
lenders.

Note 18 — Debt and Capital Leases

Long-term debt and capital leases consist of the following:



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As a result of adopting Fresh Start on December 6, 2003,
the fair value of long-term debt was calculated using the
indicated effective interest rates which approximate market
rates. The fair value adjustments for these notes and capital
leases are amortized into interest expense using the effective
interest rate method. A fair value adjustment was not necessary
for the senior notes and the credit facility as both of these
obligations were entered into subsequent to Fresh Start. For
those notes and capital leases where market pricing was not
available, we used carrying amounts, which we believe
approximated the market values as of December 6, 2003.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2004, we have timely made scheduled
payments on interest and/or principal on all of our recourse
debt and were not in default under any of our related recourse
debt instruments. Additionally, we are not in default on any
obligations to post collateral.

While we were in bankruptcy, we ceased accruing interest on
unsecured debt that was not probable of being paid.

Short-Term Debt

Short-term debt at December 31, 2003 consisted of a
$19.0 million revolving loan undertaken by Itiquira
Energetica S.A., an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of ours.
This loan was replaced by a long-term financing arrangement on
July 15, 2004.

Long-term Debt and Capital Leases

Senior Securities

On December 23, 2003, we issued $1.25 billion in 8%
Second Priority Notes, due and payable on December 15,
2013. On January 28, 2004, we issued an additional
$475.0 million in Second Priority Notes, under the same
terms and indenture as our December 23, 2003 offering.
Proceeds of the offering were used to prepay $503.5 million
of the outstanding principal on the term loan under the New
Credit Facility. Included in refinancing expenses for the year
ended December 31, 2004 are $15 million of prepayment
penalties and a $15 million write-off of deferred financing
costs related to refinancing certain amounts of our term loans
with the additional $475.0 million in Second Priority Notes.

The Second Priority Notes are general obligations of ours. They
are secured on a second-priority basis by security interests in
all assets of ours, with certain exceptions, subject to the
liens securing our obligations under the Amended Credit
Agreement (described below) and any other priority lien debt.
The notes are effectively subordinated to our obligations under
the Amended Credit Facility and any other priority lien
obligation, which are secured on a first-priority basis by the
same assets that secure the Second Priority Notes. The Second
Priority Notes are senior in right of payment to any future
subordinated indebtedness. Interest on the Second Priority Notes
accrues at the rate of 8.0% per annum and is payable
semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15,
commencing on June 15, 2004. Accrued but unpaid interest
was $6.1 million and $2.2 million as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of
December 31, 2004, we had an interest rate swap in place to
exchange fixed-rate interest payments for floating-rate interest
payments. This swap agreement became effective March 26,
2004 and terminates December 15, 2013. The swap agreement
has provisions for early termination that are linked to any
prepayment of the Second Priority Notes. Under the agreement, we
agree to pay semi-annually in arrears, commencing June 15,
2004, a floating interest rate on a notional amount of
$400.0 million, and receive semi-annually in arrears a
fixed interest rate payment on the same notional amount. The
floating interest rate is based upon six-month LIBOR plus a
spread. Depending on market interest rates, we or the swap
counter-party may be required to post collateral on a daily
basis in support of this swaps, to the benefit of the other
party. On December 31, 2004 and as of March 21, 2005,
we had $0 and $4.1 million in collateral posted.

When we issued the Second Priority Senior Secured Notes in
December 2003, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement
with the purchasers of the Notes. Under the Registration Rights
Agreement, we were required to file a Registration Statement
with the SEC by May 21, 2004 (150 days after the
issuance of the Notes) to permit the bonds to be publicly
traded. When we did not meet this deadline, we were required to
accrue liquidated damages, starting May 22, 2004 until the
exchange is executed. Accrued amounts are due and payable on the
same dates that we pay interest (semi-annually on June 15 and
December 15, or upon early redemption). Liquidated damages
are calculated as a rate per $1000 outstanding on a weekly
basis, with the rate increasing from $0.05 up to $0.50 per
$1000 each 90 day period, commencing May 22, 2004.
Accrued



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

but unpaid liquidated damages were $0.6 million and
$0.0 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. As of December 31, 2004, we were accruing
liquidated damages of $0.15 per $1000 per week, or
$0.3 million per week.

In January 2005 and in March 2005, we used existing cash to
purchase, at market prices, $25 million and
$15.8 million, respectively, in face value of our Second
Priority Notes. On February 4, 2005, we redeemed
$375.0 million in Second Priority Notes. At the same time,
we paid $30.0 million for the early redemption premium on
the redeemed notes, $4.1 million in accrued but unpaid
interest on the redeemed notes and $0.4 million in accrued
but unpaid liquidated damages on the redeemed notes.

Also on December 23, 2003, concurrently with the initial
offering of the Second Priority Notes, we and PMI entered into
the New Credit Facility for up to $1.45 billion with Credit
Suisse First Boston, as Administrative Agent, and Lehman
Commercial Paper, Inc., as Syndication Agent and a group of
lenders. The New Credit Facility consisted of a
$950.0 million, six and a half-year senior secured term
loan facility, a $250.0 million funded letter of credit
facility, and a four-year revolving credit facility in an amount
up to $250.0 million. The balance outstanding under this
facility was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2003.

On December 24, 2004, the credit facility was amended and
restated, or the Amended Credit Facility, whereby we repaid
outstanding amounts and issued a $450.0 million, seven-year
senior secured term loan facility, a $350.0 million funded
letter of credit facility, and a three-year revolving credit
facility in an amount up to $150.0 million. At that time,
we paid $13.8 million in prepayment breakage costs,
$3.2 million in accrued but unpaid interest and fees, and
wrote off $27 million of deferred financing costs
associated with the amendment. Refinancing expenses for the year
ended December 31, 2004 included the $13.8 million of
prepayment penalties and the $27 million write-off of
deferred financing costs. The balance outstanding under this
facility was $800.0 million as of December 31, 2004.
Other expenses include commitment fees on the undrawn portion of
the revolving credit facility, participation fees for the
credit-linked deposit and other fees.

Refinancing expenses were $71.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. This amount includes $15 million of
prepayment penalties and a $15 million write-off of
deferred financing costs related to refinancing certain amounts
of our term loans with additional Second Priority Notes in
January 2004 and $13.8 million of prepayment penalties and
a $27 million write-off of deferred financing costs related
to refinancing the senior credit facility in December 2004.

As of December 31, 2004, the $350.0 million letter of
credit facility was fully funded and reflected as a funded
letter of credit on the December 31, 2004 balance sheet. As
of December 31, 2004, $157.1 million in letters of
credit had been issued under this facility, leaving
$192.9 million available for future issuances. Most of
these letters of credit are issued in support of our obligations
to perform under commodity agreements, financing or other
arrangements. These letters of credit expire within one year of
issuance, and it is not unusual for us to renew many of them on
similar terms.

The Amended Credit Facility is secured by, among other things,
first-priority perfected security interests in all of the
property and assets owned at any time or acquired by us and our
subsidiaries, other than the property and assets of certain
excluded project subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries and certain
other subsidiaries, with some exceptions.

The Amended Credit Facility bears interest at an interest rate
of 1.875% over LIBOR which was 2.42% as of December 31,
2004. We can elect to convert to a rate of 0.875% over prime at
the end of any LIBOR period. As of December 31, 2004, we
had an interest rate swap in place to hedge against fluctuations
in prime or LIBO rates. The swap agreement became effective
March 26, 2004 and terminates March 31, 2006. Under
the agreement, we agree to pay quarterly a fixed interest rate
on a notional amount of $400.0 million, commencing on
March 31, 2004, and receive quarterly a floating-rate
interest rate payment on the same notional amount. The floating
rate is based upon three-month LIBOR, subject to a floor.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Significant affirmative covenants of the Second Priority Notes
and the Amended Credit Facility include the provision of
financial reports, reports of any events of default or
developments that could have a material adverse effect,
provision of notice with respect to changes in corporate
structure or collateral. In addition, the borrower must maintain
segregated cash accounts for certain deposits or settlements and
meet certain ratio tests. Certain restricted payments are
permitted under both credit facilities, pursuant to our meeting
certain ratio tests and the absence of any defaults.

Significant negative covenants of the Second Priority Notes and
the Amended Credit Facility include limitations on additional
indebtedness, liens, acquisitions and certain asset dispositions.

Events of default under the Second Priority Notes and the
Amended Credit Facility include materially false representation
or warranty; payment default on principal or interest; covenant
defaults; cross-defaults to material indebtedness; our or a
material subsidiary’s bankruptcy and insolvency; material
unpaid judgments; ERISA events; failure to be perfected on any
material collateral; and a change in control.

On December 5, 2003, we entered into a $10 million
promissory note with Xcel Energy. The note accrues interest at a
rate of 3% per year, payable quarterly in arrears. All
principal is due at maturity on June 5, 2006.

Project Financings

The following are descriptions of certain indebtedness of
NRG’s project subsidiaries that remain outstanding on
December 31, 2004. The indebtedness described below is
non-recourse to NRG, unless otherwise described.

Peakers

In June 2002, NRG Peaker Financing LLC, or Peakers, an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $325 million in floating
rate bonds due June 2019. Peakers subsequently swapped such
floating rate debt for fixed rate debt at an all-in cost of
6.67% per annum. Principal, interest, and swap payments are
guaranteed by XL Capital Assurance, or XLCA, through a financial
guaranty insurance policy. Such notes are also secured by, among
other things, substantially all of the assets of and membership
interests in Bayou Cove Peaking Power LLC, Big Cajun I
Peaking Power LLC, NRG Sterlington Power LLC, NRG Rockford LLC,
NRG Rockford II LLC and NRG Rockford Equipment LLC (all
subsidiaries of NRG). As of December 31, 2004,
$300.9 million in principal remained outstanding on these
bonds. In January 2004, terms of the financing arrangement were
restructured, at which time we issued a $36.2 million
letter of credit, under our corporate funded letter of credit
facility to the Peakers’ Collateral Agent. The letter of
credit may be drawn if the project is unable to meet principal
or interest payments. There are no provisions requiring us to
replenish the letter of credit once it is fully drawn.

Flinders

At December 31, 2004, NRG Flinders, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of NRG, had AUD 315 million available in
senior debt bank financing pursuant to two bank facilities. The
first was an AUD 150 million floating-rate syndicated
facility that matured in September 2012. The second facility,
intended to fund the refurbishment of the Playford station,
allowed Flinders to draw up to AUD 137 million
(approximately US $107 million) at a floating-rate of
interest on drawn amounts and matures coterminous with the first
facility. As of December 31, 2004, outstanding principal
was AUD 259.2 million (approximately
US $202.9 million) on the two facilities. In addition,
Flinders had an AUD 20.0 million (approximately
US $15.7 million) working capital facility. At
December 31, 2004 the facility was undrawn. Flinders agreed
with the lenders to hedge not less than 60% of its floating
interest exposure until September 30, 2005 and not less
than 40% of its floating interest exposure through the end of
the loan. Under this financing arrangement, Flinders was
required to fully fund, and NRG was required to guarantee, a
debt service reserve account. The



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reserve amount of AUD 70 million (approximately
US $54.8 million) was fully funded as of
December 31, 2004.

In February 2005, Flinders amended its floating-rate debt
facility of AUD 279.4 million (approximately
US $218.5 million). The amendment extended the
maturity to February 2017, reduced borrowing costs and reserve
requirements, minimized debt service coverage ratios, removed
mandatory cash sharing arrangements, and made other minor
modifications to terms and conditions. The facility includes an
AUD 20 million (approximately
US $15.7 million) working capital and performance bond
facility. NRG Flinders is required to maintain interest-rate
hedging contracts on a rolling 5-year basis at a minimum level
of 60% of principal outstanding. Upon execution of the
amendment, a voluntary principal prepayment of
AUD 50 million (approximately
US $39.1 million) was made, reducing the principal
balance of the term loan to AUD 209.2 million
(approximately US $163.7 million). As of
March 21, 2005, the revolver remained undrawn.

NRG Thermal

NRG Thermal LLC, or NRG Thermal, has several subsidiaries with
outstanding long-term debt. Such indebtedness is secured
principally by the subsidiaries’ long-term assets and is
guaranteed by NRG Thermal and “cross-collateralized”
by NRG Thermal’s ownership interests in all of its
subsidiaries. In July 2002, NRG Energy Center Minneapolis LLC
issued $55 million of 7.25% Series A notes due August
2017, of which $50.0 million remained outstanding as of
December 31, 2004; $20 million of 7.12% Series B
notes due August 2017, of which $18.2 million remained
outstanding as of December 31, 2004; and in August 1993,
NRG Energy Center Minneapolis LLC issued $84 million of
7.31% senior secured notes due June 2013, of which
$50.8 million remained outstanding as of December 31,
2004. NRG Energy Center San Francisco LLC has issued
$360 thousand of 7.63% senior secured term notes due
September 2008, of which $129 thousand remained outstanding at
December 31, 2004. The NRG Energy Center
San Francisco LLC 10.61% senior secured term notes and
the NRG Energy Center Pittsburgh LLC 10.61% senior
secured term notes were paid in full on November 5, 2004.

STS Hydropower

STS Hydropower, LTD, or STS Hydropower, which is indirectly 50%
owned by NEO Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
NRG Energy, entered into a Note Purchase Agreement in
March 1995 with Allstate Life Insurance Co., or Allstate.
Allstate purchased from STS Hydropower $22 million of
9.155% senior secured debt due December 30, 2016. The
agreement was amended in 1996 to add $700,000 of
8.24% senior secured debt due March 2011. The debt is
secured by substantially all assets of and interest in STS
Hydropower. Because of poor hydroelectric output due to drought
conditions, no principal or interest payments have been made on
this loan facility since October 2001. In May 2003, the facility
was restructured and currently has a maturity of March 2023 and
an interest rate of 9.133%. As of December 31, 2004, all
required covenants under the restructured facility had been met
and $24.3 million was outstanding.

Northbrook Carolina Hydro and Northbrook New York

Northbrook Carolina Hydro, LLC, or NCH, which is indirectly 50%
owned by NEO, entered into a $2.6 million loan arrangement
in December 2001 with Heller Financial. In order to secure the
NCH financing, Heller Financial’s credit agreement with
Northbrook New York LLC, or NNY, was amended to
cross-collateralize the NCH and NNY notes. NNY is indirectly 70%
owned by the NEO Corporation. In 2002, GE Capital Services
purchased Heller Financial and assumed the loan facility. This
loan facility is secured by substantially all hydroelectric
assets of and membership interests in NCH and NNY. The NCH
facility bears interest at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 4% and
matures in December 2016. As of December 31, 2004, the
outstanding balance was $2.4 million.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In September 1999, NNY entered into a $17.5 million term
loan agreement with Heller Financial. In addition to the term
loan, there is a $1.5 million revolver, which was undrawn
as of December 31, 2004. In December 2001, the credit
agreement with Heller Financial was amended to include
$2.6 million of financing for NCH, an affiliated entity,
and to cross-collateralize the NNY and NCH notes. Heller
Financial was subsequently purchased by GE Capital Services,
which assumed the notes. The NNY facility bears an interest rate
of LIBOR plus 3% and matures in December 2018. It is secured by
substantially all of the assets of and membership interests in
the NNY and NCH facilities. The principal amount outstanding as
of December 31, 2004 was $16.9 million.

Camas

In November 1990, Clark County, Washington issued
$15.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.2% fixed
interest Series A tax-exempt bonds due August 15, 2007
to fund the construction of the Camas project. The bonds were
re-marketed with a 4.65% interest rate in August 1997 and again
at a 3.375% interest rate in August 2002. This facility pursuant
to the indenture, can no longer be re-marketed. As of
December 31, 2004, $4.5 million remains outstanding.
In 1997, Camas also acquired a $19.6 million floating-rate
bank loan from Fort James Corporation, maturing in June
2007. The principal outstanding on this facility was
$6.3 million as of December 31, 2004.

Itiquira Energetica S.A.

On July 15, 2004, Itiquira Energetica S. A., a
majority-owned subsidiary of ours, executed a long-term
financing arrangement with União de Bancos Brasileiros
S.A., or Unibanco, for a 55 million Brazilian reals term
loan maturing in January 2012. The facility bears a floating
interest rate and amortizes on a schedule that is indexed to
certain foreign exchange rates. The facility replaces a
revolving loan undertaken with Unibanco which was classified as
short-term debt on our balance sheet as of December 31,
2003. The current facility is classified as long-term debt as of
December 31, 2004. The principal obligation as of
December 31, 2004 was $20.1 million. Eletrobrãs
owns preferred shares in Itiquira, which for U.S. GAAP
purposes are reflected as debt. The preferred shares accrue
cumulative dividends of 12% per year, payable only at such
time Itiquira has sufficient retained profits or reserves. The
balance at December 31, 2004 was $31.0 million.

LSP Kendall

The LSP Kendall Energy LLC, or LSP Kendall, credit facility was
non-recourse to us and consisted of a construction and term
loan, working capital and letter of credit facilities. As of
December 31, 2003, there were borrowings totaling
$487.0 million outstanding under the facility at a weighted
average annual interest rate of 2.58%. LSP Kendall was sold on
December 1, 2004.

Capital Leases

Schkopau

The Kraftwerke Schkopau GbR, or Schkopau, partnership, which is
indirectly 41.9% owned by NRG, issued debt pursuant to multiple
facilities totaling
approximately

€

886.8 million
(approximately US $1,203.1 million) to finance a
construction project. As of December 31,
2004,

€

463.5 million
(approximately US $628.8 million) remained
outstanding. Interest on the individual loans accrues at fixed
rates averaging 6.68% per annum, with maturities occurring
between years 2005 and 2015. Schkopau is a partnership between
Saale Energie GmbH, an NRG subsidiary and German Limited
Liability Company, and E.ON Kraftwerke GmbH, a German Limited
Liability Company. As a result, lenders to the project rely
almost exclusively on the creditworthiness of E.ON Kraftwerke
GmbH. Saale Energie remains liable to the lenders as a partner
in the borrower, but there is no recourse to NRG.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Schkopau is not permitted to retain funds for its own account,
so funds received from electricity sales are retained by the
partners and Schkopau calls for funds from the partners on a pro
rata basis to meet debt service payments as they fall due. In
the early years of the project these were at a low level, which
allowed Saale Energie to accumulate cash that in 1999 was lent
upstream for use elsewhere within the NRG group. Saale Energie
is now projecting that cash calls to meet debt service payments
over the next four years will at times exceed the cash available
to meet them. NRG agreed to cover the periodic shortfalls by way
of partial repayments of an upstream loan followed by cash
dividend payments on high levels to NRG in 2007. For
U.S. GAAP purposes, the Schkopau debt obligations are
classified as capital leases on its balance sheet. As of
December 31, 2004 the capital lease obligation was
$303.8 million.

Audrain

In connection with our acquisition of the Audrain facilities, we
have recognized a capital lease on our balance sheet classified
within long-term debt in the amount of $239.9 million as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003. The capital lease obligation is
recorded at the net present value of the minimum lease
obligation payable. The lease terminates in December 2023.
During the term of the lease only interest payments are due, no
principal is due until the end of the lease. In addition, we
have recorded, in notes receivable, an amount of approximately
$239.9 million, which represents our investment in the
bonds that the county of Audrain issued to finance the project.
During December 2004, we received a notice of a waiver of a
$24.0 million interest payment due on the capital lease
obligation, allowing us to defer payment of the interest due in
December 2004, and waiving any default associated with the
deferral. In connection with the transfer of the security in the
Audrain projects to NRG FinCo Lenders, the Audrain entity will
be liquidated resulting in the termination of the lease
obligation and the note receivable.

Consolidated annual maturities and future minimum lease
payments:

Note 19 — Capital Stock

Reorganized Capital Structure

In connection with the consummation of our reorganization, on
December 5, 2003, all shares of our old common stock were
canceled and 100,000,000 shares of new common stock of
NRG Energy were distributed pursuant to such plan in
accordance with Section 1145 of the bankruptcy code to the
holders of certain classes of claims. We received no proceeds
from such issuance. A certain number of shares of common stock
were issued and placed in the Disputed Claims Reserve for
distribution to holders of disputed claims as such claims are
resolved or settled. See Item 3 — Legal
Proceedings — Disputed Claims Reserve. In the event
our disputed claims reserve is inadequate, it is possible we
would have to issue additional shares of our common stock to
satisfy such pre-petition claims or contribute additional cash
proceeds. Our authorized capital stock consists of
500,000,000 shares of NRG Energy common stock and
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. A total of
4,000,000 shares of our common stock are available for
issuance under our long-term incentive plan. We have also filed
with the Secretary of State of Delaware a Certificate of
Designation of our 4% Convertible Perpetual Preferred
Stock, or Preferred Stock, as more fully described in
Note 20.

Repurchase of Common Stock

Upon emergence from chapter 11, investment partnerships
managed by MatlinPatterson LLC owned approximately
21.5 million (21.5%) of our common shares. In December
2004, we used existing cash to repurchase 13 million
shares of common stock from MatlinPatterson at a purchase price
of $31.16 per share plus transaction costs of
$0.2 million. In addition to a reduction in total shares of
common stock outstanding by 13 million, the share
repurchase resulted in (i) the reduction of
MatlinPatterson’s share ownership of NRG Energy to
less than 10% from the prior 21.5%, (ii) termination of
MatlinPatterson’s registration rights, and
(iii) resignation from our Board of Directors of three
directors affiliated with MatlinPatterson. Our Board’s
Governance and Nominating Committee is in the process of
identifying appropriate independent directors to fill the three
vacancies.

Note 20 — Convertible Perpetual Preferred
Stock

On December 27, 2004, we completed the sale of
420,000 shares of convertible perpetual preferred stock
with a dividend coupon rate of 4%. The Preferred Stock has a
liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Preferred
Stock. Holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when
declared by our Board of Directors, cash dividends at the rate
of 4% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on
March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of
each year, commencing on March 15, 2005. The Preferred
Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time
into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price
of $40.00 per share, which is equal to an approximate
conversion rate of 25 shares of common stock per share of
Preferred Stock, subject to specified adjustments. On or after
December 20, 2009, we may redeem, subject to certain
limitations, some or all of the Preferred Stock with cash at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference,
plus accumulated but unpaid dividends, including liquidated
damages, if any, to the redemption date.

If we are subject to a fundamental change, as defined in the
Certificate of Designation of the 4.0% Convertible Perpetual
Preferred Stock, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock has
the right, subject to certain limitations, to require us to
purchase any or all of its shares of Preferred Stock at a
purchase price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, plus
accumulated and unpaid dividends, including liquidated damages,
if any, to the date of purchase. Final determination of a
fundamental change must be approved by the Board of Directors.

Each holder of Preferred Stock has one vote for each share of
Preferred Stock held by the holder on all matters voted upon by
the holders of our common stock, as well as voting rights
specifically provided for in our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation or as otherwise from time to time
required by law. In addition, whenever (1) dividends on the
Preferred Stock or any other class or series of stock ranking on
a parity with the Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of
dividends are in arrears for dividend periods, whether or not
consecutive, containing in the aggregate a number of days
equivalent to six calendar quarters, or (2) we fail to pay
the redemption price on the date shares of Preferred Stock are
called for redemption or the purchase price on the purchase date
for shares of Preferred Stock following a fundamental change,
then, in each case, the holders of Preferred Stock (voting
separately as a class with all other series of preferred stock
upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are
exercisable) are entitled to vote for the election of two of the
authorized number of our directors at the next annual meeting of
stockholders and at each subsequent meeting until all dividends
accumulated or the redemption price on the Preferred Stock have
been fully paid or set apart for payment. The term of office of
all directors elected by holders of the Preferred Stock
terminates immediately upon the termination of the rights of the
holders of the Preferred Stock to vote for directors. Upon
election of any additional directors, the number of directors
that comprise our Board of Directors will be increased by the
number of such additional directors.

The Preferred Stock is, with respect to dividend rights and
rights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution: junior to
all of our existing and future debt obligations; junior to each
other class or series of our capital stock other than
(1) our common stock and any other class or series of our
capital stock which provides that such class or series will rank
junior to the Preferred Stock and (2) any other class or
series of our capital stock the terms of which provide that such
class or series will rank on a parity with the Preferred Stock;
on a parity with any other class or series of our capital stock
the terms of which provide that such class or series will rank
on parity with the Preferred Stock; senior to our common stock
and any other class or series of our capital stock the terms of
which provide that such class or series will rank junior to the
Preferred Stock; and effectively junior to all of our
subsidiaries (1) existing and future liabilities and
(2) capital stock held by others.

The proceeds of $406.4 million net of issuance costs of
approximately $13.6 million, were used to redeem
$375.0 million of Second Priority Notes on February 4,
2005.

In December 2003, we adopted a new long-term incentive plan, or
the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which is described below.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

The Long-Term Incentive Plan became effective upon our emergence
from bankruptcy and was also approved by our stockholders on
August 4, 2004. The Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for
grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, performance awards, deferred stock units and dividend
equivalent rights. Our directors, officers and employees, as
well as other individuals performing services for, or to whom an
offer of employment has been extended by us, are eligible to
receive grants under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The purpose
of the Long-Term Incentive Plan is to promote our long-term
growth and profitability by providing these individuals with
incentives to maximize stockholder value and otherwise
contribute to our success and to enable us to attract, retain
and reward the best available persons for positions of
responsibility.

A total of 4,000,000 shares of our common stock are
available for issuance under the Long-Term Incentive Plan,
subject to adjustment in the event of a reorganization,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, combination of shares, merger or similar change in our
structure or our outstanding shares of common stock. There were
2,053,294 and 3,367,249 shares of common stock remaining
available for grants of stock options under our Long-Term
Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors administers
the Long-Term Incentive Plan. If for any reason a Compensation
Committee has not been appointed by our board to administer the
Long-Term Incentive Plan, our Board of Directors has the
authority to administer the plan and to take all actions under
the plan.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following is a summary of the material terms of the
Long-Term Incentive Plan, but does not include all of the
provisions of the plan.

Eligibility.

Our directors, officers and employees, as
well as other individuals performing services for, or to whom an
offer of employment has been extended by, us are eligible to
receive grants under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. In each case,
the Compensation Committee selects the actual grantees.

Stock Options.

Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the
Compensation Committee may award grants of incentive stock
options conforming to the requirements of Section 422 of
the Internal Revenue Code, or non-qualified stock options. The
Compensation Committee may not award to any one person in any
calendar year options to purchase more than
1,000,000 shares of common stock. In addition, it may not
award incentive stock options first exercisable in any calendar
year whose underlying shares have a fair market value greater
than $100,000, determined at the time of grant.

The Compensation Committee determines the exercise price of any
options granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. However, the
exercise price of any option may not be less than 100% of the
fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of
grant, and the exercise price of an incentive stock option
granted to a person who owns stock constituting more than 10% of
the voting power of all classes of our stock may not be less
than 110% of the fair market value of a share of our common
stock on the date of grant.

Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, the
exercise price of any option may be paid in any of the following
ways:

The Compensation Committee determines the term of each option in
its discretion. However, no term may exceed 10 years from
the date of grant or, in the case of an incentive stock option
granted to a person who owns stock constituting more than 10% of
the voting power of all classes of our stock, five years from
the date of grant. In addition, all options under the Long-Term
Incentive Plan, whether or not then exercisable, generally cease
vesting when a grantee ceases to be a director, officer or
employee of, or to otherwise perform services for, us. Vested
options generally expire 90 days after the date of
cessation of service.

There are exceptions depending upon the circumstances of
cessation. In the case of a grantee’s death, all options
become fully vested and remain exercisable for a period of one
year after the date of death. In the case of a grantee’s
termination due to disability, vested options remain exercisable
for a period of one year after the date of termination due to
disability while his or her unvested options are forfeited. In
the event of retirement, a grantee’s vested options remain
exercisable for a period of two years after the date of
retirement while his or her unvested options are forfeited. Upon
termination for cause, all options terminate immediately. Upon a
change in control of NRG Energy, all of the options become fully
vested and remain exercisable until the expiration date of the
options. In addition, the Compensation Committee has the
authority to grant options that become fully vested and
exercisable automatically upon a change in control, whether or
not the grantee is subsequently terminated.

Upon a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, the
Compensation Committee may cancel any or all outstanding options
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan in exchange for payment of an
amount equal to the portion of the consideration that would have
been payable to the grantees in the transaction if their options
had been fully exercised immediately prior to the transaction,
less the exercise price that would have been payable, or if the
exercise price is greater than the consideration that would have
been payable in the transaction, then for no consideration or
payment.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Stock Appreciation Rights.

Under the Long-Term Incentive
Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant stock appreciation
rights, or SARs, alone or in tandem with options, subject to
terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee may specify.
SARs granted in tandem with options become exercisable only
when, to the extent and on the conditions that the related
options are exercisable, and they expire at the same time the
related options expire. The exercise of an option results in the
immediate forfeiture of any related SAR to the extent the option
is exercised, and the exercise of a SAR results in the immediate
forfeiture of any related option to the extent the SAR is
exercised.

Upon exercise of a SAR, the grantee receives an amount in cash,
shares of our common stock or our other securities equal to the
difference between the fair market value of a share of common
stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the SAR
or, in the case of a SAR granted in tandem with options, of the
option to which the SAR relates, multiplied by the number of
shares as to which the SAR is exercised. Unless otherwise
provided in the grantee’s grant agreement, each SAR is
subject to the same termination and forfeiture provisions as the
stock options described above.

Restricted Stock.

Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the
Compensation Committee may award restricted stock in the amounts
that it determines in its discretion. Each grant of restricted
stock is evidenced by a grant agreement, which specifies the
applicable restrictions on such shares and the duration of the
restrictions (which is generally at least six months). A grantee
is required to pay us at least the aggregate par value of any
shares of restricted stock within ten days of the grant, unless
the shares are treasury shares. Unless otherwise provided in the
grantee’s grant agreement, each unit or share of restricted
stock is subject to the same termination and forfeiture
provisions as the stock options described above.

Performance Awards.

Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan,
the Compensation Committee may grant performance awards
contingent upon achievement by the grantee, us or any of our
divisions of specified performance criteria, such as return on
equity, over a specified performance cycle, as determined by the
Compensation Committee. Performance awards may include specific
dollar-value target awards; performance units, the value of
which is determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of
issuance; and/or performance shares, the value of which is equal
to the fair market value of common stock. The value of a
performance award may be fixed or may fluctuate based on
specified performance criteria. A performance award may be paid
out in cash, shares of our common stock or our other securities.

A grantee must be a director, officer or employee of, or
otherwise perform services for, us at the end of the performance
cycle in order to be entitled to payment of a performance award
issued in respect of such cycle, provided that unless otherwise
provided in the grantee’s grant agreement, each performance
award is subject to the same termination and forfeiture
provisions as the stock options described above.

Deferred Stock Units.

Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan,
the Compensation Committee may grant deferred stock units from
time to time in its discretion. A deferred stock unit entitles
the grantee to receive the fair market value of one share of
common stock at the end of the deferral period, which is no less
than one year. The payment of the value of deferred stock units
may be made by us in shares of our common stock, cash or both.
If a grantee ceases to be a director, officer or employee of, or
otherwise perform services for, us upon his or her death prior
to the end of the deferral period, the grantee receives payment
of his or her deferred stock units which would have matured or
been earned at the end of the deferral period as if the deferral
period has ended as of the date of his or her death. In the
event of a termination due to disability or retirement prior to
the end of the deferral period, the grantee receives payment of
his or her deferred stock units at the end of the deferral
period. If a grantee ceases to be a director, officer or
employee of, or otherwise perform services for, us for any other
reason, his or her unvested deferred stock units are immediately
forfeited. Upon a change in control in NRG Energy, a
grantee receives payment of his or her deferred stock units as
if the deferral period has ended as of the date of the change in
control.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Dividend Equivalent Rights.

Under the Long-Term Incentive
Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant a dividend equivalent
right entitling the grantee to receive amounts equal to all or
any portion of the dividends that would be paid on shares of our
common stock covered by an award if those shares had been
delivered to the grantee pursuant to the award, subject to terms
and conditions as the committee may specify.

Vesting, Withholding Taxes and Transferability of All
Awards.

The terms and conditions of each award made under
the Long-Term Incentive Plan, including vesting requirements, is
set forth consistent with the plan in a written agreement with
the grantee. Except in limited circumstances and unless the
Compensation Committee determines otherwise, no award under the
Long-Term Incentive Plan may vest and become exercisable within
six months of the date of grant.

Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, a
participant may elect to deliver shares of common stock, or to
have us withhold shares of common stock otherwise issuable upon
exercise of an option or a SAR or deliverable upon grant or
vesting of restricted stock or the receipt of common stock, in
order to satisfy our tax withholding obligations in connection
with any exercise, grant or vesting.

Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, no award
made under the Long-Term Incentive Plan is transferable other
than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and each
option, SAR or performance award may be exercised only by the
grantee or his or her executor, administrator, guardian or legal
representative, or by a family member of the grantee if he or
she has acquired the option, SAR or performance award by gift or
qualified domestic relations order.

Amendment and Termination of the Long-Term Incentive
Plan.

The Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee
may amend or terminate the Long-Term Incentive Plan in its
discretion, except that no amendment is effective without prior
approval of our stockholders if approval is required by
applicable law or regulations, including any NASDAQ or stock
exchange listing requirements, if the amendment would remove a
provision of the Long-Term Incentive Plan which, without giving
effect to the amendment, is subject to shareholder approval or
if the amendment would directly or indirectly increase the share
limit of 4,000,000 shares. If not otherwise terminated, the
Long-Term Incentive Plan terminates on the tenth anniversary of
the effective date of our plan of reorganization, which was
December 5, 2003.

In 2004, we issued stock options grants for a total of
330,000 shares of common stock under the Long-Term
Incentive Plan. These options have a three-year graded vesting
schedule and become exercisable through the year 2006 at an
average exercise price of $21.46. Total compensation expense
under all stock option grants is approximately
$11.7 million. Compensation expense for the year ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately
$6.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
Compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2005,
December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007 will be

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2004, we issued 750,100 restricted stock units
at fair values between $19.90 and $34.31, cancelled 40,500
restricted stock units at fair values between $19.90 and $25.90
and issued 1,255 shares of common stock, net of payroll
taxes withheld, due to accelerated vesting on 2,000 restricted
stock units at fair values between $23.20 and $27.43.
Compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2004
was approximately $5.2 million. Compensation expense for
the years ended December 31, 2005, December 31, 2006
and December 31, 2007 will be approximately
$6.1 million, $6.5 million and $1.2 million,
respectively. The weighted-average fair value of our restricted
stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2004 is $21.59.

During 2004, deferred stock units issued under the Long-Term
Incentive Plan totaled 100,961, and were issued solely to
members of our Board of Directors. The fair values of the
deferred stock units were between $19.95 and $21.05 per
unit. These units are fully vested at the date of issuance.
Total compensation expense attributable to the deferred stock
grants is approximately $2.1 million, and was recognized
entirely in 2004. Elections were made at the time of issuance to
immediately convert 6,798 deferred stock units to an equal
number of shares of our common stock. As a result of our common
stock repurchase in December 2004 and the termination of three
members of our Board of Directors, 33,882 deferred stock units
were converted into an equal number of shares of our common
stock. The weighted-average fair value of our deferred stock
units outstanding as of December 31, 2004 is $20.31.

Note 22 — Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per common share were computed by dividing net
income less accumulated preferred stock dividends by the
weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding.
Shares issued during the year are weighted for the portion of
the year that they were outstanding. Shares of common stock
granted to our officers and employees are included in the
computation only after the shares become fully vested. Diluted
earnings per share is computed in a manner consistent with that
of basic earnings per share while giving effect to all
potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during
the period. The dilutive effect of the potential exercise of
outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock is
calculated using the treasury stock method. The nonvested
restricted stock units are not considered outstanding for
purposes of computing basis earnings per share; however these
units are included in the denominator for purposes of computing
diluted earnings per share under the treasury method. The
deferred stock units are considered outstanding upon grant date
on a weighted average basis for computing basic earnings per
share. The reconciliation of basic earnings per common share to
diluted earnings per share is shown in the following table:

Note 23 — Segment Reporting

In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy and the new

our segment reporting disclosures to more closely align our
disclosures with the realignment of our management team.
Accordingly, we have expanded our domestic geographical
disclosures and collapsed our international geographical
disclosures related to our wholesale power generation segment.
In addition, our other segments have been further refined. As a
result of these changes, we have retroactively recast our prior
period disclosures in a consistent manner.

A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to our

which will expire through 2024. Cumulative foreign net operating
loss carryforwards of $200.6 million have no expiration
date.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We believe that it is more likely than not that no benefit will
be realized on a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets.
This assessment included consideration of positive and negative
evidence, including our current financial position and results
of current operations, projected future taxable income,
including projected operating and capital gains and our
available tax planning strategies. Therefore, a valuation
allowance of $707.9 million was recorded against the net
deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards.

Under SOP 90-7, any future benefits from reducing a
valuation allowance from preconfirmation deferred tax assets are
required to be reported as a direct addition to paid in capital
versus a benefit on our income statement. Consequently, our
effective tax rate in post-bankruptcy emergence years will not
benefit from the realization of our deferred tax assets, which
were fully valued as of the date of our emergence from
bankruptcy.

As of December 31, 2004, our management intends to
indefinitely reinvest the earnings from our foreign operations.
Accordingly, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding
taxes were not provided on the earnings from our foreign
subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2004, no U.S. income
tax benefit was provided on the cumulative losses from our
foreign subsidiaries of $110.0 million. Our management is
currently reviewing their reinvestment plan pursuant to the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. This legislation provides
for a low tax cost on earnings repatriated in 2005 and
reinvested in a company’s U.S. operations.

Note 25 — Related Party Transactions

Prior to our emergence from bankruptcy on December 5, 2003,
NRG Energy was an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Xcel
Energy. Prior to December 5, 2003, we had entered into
material transactions and agreements with Xcel Energy which are
described below. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we became an
independent public company with no material affiliation or
relationship to Xcel Energy. We have included amounts paid to or
received from Xcel Energy during the year ended
December 31, 2004 and for the period December 6, 2003
to December 31, 2003 only for comparative purposes, as
these transactions are not considered related party transactions
subsequent to December 5, 2003.

Stock Purchase Agreement

Upon emergence from chapter 11, investment partnerships
managed by MatlinPatterson LLC owned approximately
21.5 million (21.5%) of our common shares. We used existing
cash to repurchase 13 million shares of common stock
from MatlinPatterson pursuant to a stock purchase agreement
dated December 13, 2004 at a purchase price of
$31.16 per share. In addition to a reduction in total
shares of common stock outstanding by 13 million, the share
repurchase resulted in (i) the reduction of
MatlinPatterson’s share ownership of NRG Energy to less
than 10% from the prior 21.5%, (ii) termination of
MatlinPatterson’s registration rights, and
(iii) resignation from our Board of Directors of three
directors affiliated with MatlinPatterson. Our Board’s
Governance and Nominating Committee is in the process of
identifying appropriate independent directors to fill the three
vacancies.

Operating Agreements

We have two agreements with Xcel Energy for the purchase of
thermal energy. Under the terms of the agreements, Xcel Energy
charges us for certain costs (fuel, labor, plant maintenance,
and auxiliary power) incurred by Xcel Energy to produce the
thermal energy. We paid Xcel Energy $11.1 million,
$1.1 million, $9.6 million and $8.2 million
during the year ended December 31, 2004, the period
December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003, the period
January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, and the year
ended December 31, 2002, respectively, under these
agreements. One of these agreements expires in 2006 and the
other expires in 2010.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We have a renewable 10-year agreement with Xcel Energy, expiring
on December 31, 2006, whereby Xcel Energy agreed to
purchase refuse-derived fuel for use in certain of its boilers
and we agree to pay Xcel Energy a burn incentive. Under this
agreement, we received $1.4 million, $0, $1.4 million
and $1.2 million from Xcel Energy and paid
$3.7 million, $0.3 million, $3.9 million and
$3.3 million to Xcel Energy during the year ended
December 31, 2004, the period December 6, 2003 to
December 31, 2003, the period January 1, 2003 to
December 5, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002,
respectively.

Administrative Services and Other Costs

We had an administrative services agreement in place with Xcel
Energy. Under this agreement we reimbursed Xcel Energy for
certain overhead and administrative costs, including benefits
administration, engineering support, accounting and other shared
services as requested by us. In addition, our employees
participated in certain employee benefit plans of Xcel Energy as
discussed in Note 26. We reimbursed Xcel Energy in the
amounts of $7.3 million and $21.2 million during the
period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003 and the
year ended December 31, 2002, respectively, under this
agreement. This agreement was terminated December 5, 2003.

Natural Gas Marketing and Trading Agreement

We had an agreement with e prime, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Xcel Energy, under which e prime provided natural gas marketing
and trading from time to time at our request. We paid
$19.2 million to e prime in 2002 related to these services.
This agreement was terminated by e prime on December 12,
2002 and a termination charge of $0.3 million was paid in
the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003.

Note 26 — Benefit Plans and Other
Postretirement Benefits

Reorganized NRG

Substantially all employees hired prior to December 5, 2003
were eligible to participate in our defined benefit pension
plans. We have initiated a new NRG Energy noncontributory,
defined benefit pension plan effective January 1, 2004,
with credit for service from December 5, 2003. As of
December 31, 2004, our accumulated benefit obligation was
approximately $61.1 million. As of December 31, 2004,
we had plan assets of $716,000.

In addition, we provide postretirement health and welfare
benefits (health care and death benefits) for certain groups of
our employees. Generally, these are groups that were acquired in
recent years and for whom prior benefits are being continued (at
least for a certain period of time or as required by union
contracts). Cost sharing provisions vary by acquisition group
and terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements. As
of December 31, 2004, our accumulated benefit obligation
was approximately $45.5 million. We expect to contribute
approximately $12.8 million to our NRG pension plan and our
postretirement health and welfare plan in 2005.

NRG Flinders Retirement Plan

Employees of NRG Flinders, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
NRG Energy, are members of the multiemployer Electricity
Industry Superannuation Schemes, or EISS. Members of the EISS
make contributions from their salary and the EISS Actuary makes
an assessment of our liability. As a result of adopting Fresh
Start we recorded a liability of approximately
$13.8 million at December 5, 2003, to record our
accumulated benefit obligation plan assets on the balance sheet
at fair value. The balance sheet includes a liability related to
the Flinders retirement plan of $8.5 million and
$13.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. NRG Flinders contributed $10.2 million, $0,
$4.5 million and $5.8 million for the year

respectively.

The Superannuation Board is responsible for the investment of
EISS assets. The assets may be invested in government

Defined Contribution Plans

Our employees have also been eligible to participate in defined

approximately $4.3 million, $3.8 million and
$4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Predecessor Company

Prior to December 5, 2003, all eligible employees
participated in Xcel Energy’s multiemployer
noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan, which was
formerly sponsored by NSP. We sponsored two defined benefit
plans that were merged into Xcel Energy’s plan as of
June 30, 2002. Benefits were generally based on a
combination of an employee’s years of service and earnings.
Some formulas also took into account Social Security benefits.
Plan assets principally consisted of the common stock of public
companies, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities.

Prior to December 5, 2003, certain former NRG Energy
retirees were covered under the legacy Xcel Energy plan, which
was terminated for non-bargaining employees retiring after 1998
and for bargaining employees retiring after 1999.

As a result of our emergence from bankruptcy on December 5,
2003, we are no longer owned by or affiliated with Xcel Energy
and our employees are no longer participants of the Xcel Energy
plans.

Participation in Xcel Energy, Inc. Pension Plan and
    Postretirement Medical Plan

We did not make contributions to the Xcel Energy pension plan
and postretirement plan in 2002 or 2003. As of December 31,
2003, there are no liabilities recorded related to the Xcel
Energy plans. The liabilities associated with these plans were
settled as part of the NRG plan of reorganization. The net
annual periodic cost (credit) related to our portion of the
Xcel Energy pension plan and postretirement plans totaled
$0.2 million and $(8.9) million for 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Prior to December 5, 2003, certain employees also
participated in Xcel Energy’s noncontributory defined
benefit supplemental retirement income plan. This plan was for
the benefit of certain qualifying executive personnel. Benefits
for this unfunded plan were paid out of operating cash flows.
The liability related to this plan was not material as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

2003 Medicare Legislation

In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, FASB,
issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 106-2,

“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003”

(FSP 106-2). FSP 106-2 provides guidance on
accounting for the effects of the new Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 by employers
whose prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to
the drug benefit under Medicare Part D. FSP 106-2 is
effective as of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2004. NRG Energy adopted FSP 106-2 in the
third quarter of 2004 on a retroactive basis. Adoption of FSP
106-2 will reduce the



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

annual non-cash postretirement health expense by approximately
$0.2 million and reduce the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation by $2.2 million. The change in
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation has been reflected
as an actuarial gain and will be amortized in future periods.

Note 27 — Commitments and Contingencies

Operating Lease Commitments

We lease certain of our facilities and equipment under operating
leases, some of which include escalation clauses, expiring on
various dates through 2023. Rental expense under these operating
leases was $11.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004, $0.7 million for the period

2005, we entered into a ten-year operating lease agreement with
GE Railcar Services Corporation, or GE, for the lease of 1,500
railcars and delivery commenced in February 2005. We have
assigned certain of our rights and obligations for 1,500

agreement with the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway
Company and affiliates of American Commercial Lines LLC to
deliver low sulfur coal to our Big Cajun II facility in New
Roads, Louisiana beginning April 1, 2005. In December 2004,
we also entered into coal purchase contracts extending through
2007. In March 2005, we entered into an agreement to purchase
23.75 million tons of coal over a period of four years and
nine months from Buckskin Mining Company, or Buckskin. The coal
will be sourced from Buckskin’s mine in the Powder River
Basin, Wyoming, and will be used primarily in NRG Energy’s

Capital Commitments

review and modification. The timing and actual amount of
expenditures may differ significantly based upon plant operating
history, unexpected plant outages, and changes in the regulatory
environment, and the availability of cash.

International

Two of our wholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries are severally
responsible for the prorate payments of principal, interest and
related costs incurred in connection with the financing of our
equity investment in the unincorporated joint venture Gladstone
Power Station. At December 31, 2004, we were obligated for
the loan of AUD 108.4 million (approximately
US $84.8 million) in principal. This loan is scheduled
to be fully repaid on March 31, 2009.

NRG FinCo Settlement

In May 2001, our wholly-owned subsidiary, NRG FinCo, entered
into a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. The facility
was established to finance the acquisition, development and
construction of certain power generating plants located in the
United States and to finance the acquisition of turbines for
such facilities. The facility provided for borrowings of base
rate loans and Eurocurrency loans and was secured by mortgages
and security agreements in respect of the assets of the projects
financed under the facility, pledges of the equity interests in
the subsidiaries or affiliates of the borrower that own such
projects, and by guaranties from each such subsidiary or
affiliate. The NRG FinCo secured revolver was initially
scheduled to mature on May 8, 2006; however, due to
defaults hereunder by NRG FinCo and applicable guarantors, the
lenders accelerated all outstanding obligations on
November 6, 2002. As of our emergence from bankruptcy,
$1.1 billion was outstanding under the facility, and there
was an aggregate of approximately $58 million of accrued
but unpaid interest and commitment fees. Of this,
$842.0 million was allowed in unsecured claims under the
NRG plan of



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reorganization, and was settled at the time of our emergence.
The remaining balance will be satisfied when the NRG FinCo
lenders exercise their perfected security interests in our
Nelson, Audrain and Pike projects. During 2004, we sold our
Nelson assets for approximately $19.5 million and certain
assets of our Pike project for $17 million. The proceeds
from these sales were paid to the lenders. As of
December 31, 2004, we hold assets in our Audrain project,
principally property, plant and equipment, and some remaining
ancillary equipment in our Pike project of approximately
$172 million and $5 million, respectively. Any
proceeds from the sale of these assets are owed to the NRG FinCo
lenders, accordingly there are liabilities reflected in other
bankruptcy settlement for the same amount on our consolidated
balance sheet. We are in the process of marketing for sale the
Audrain project and the remaining Pike equipment on behalf of
the NRG FinCo lenders. The NRG FinCo lenders have authority
under their perfected security interest to accept or reject all
offers. As a result, these entities are not reflected as
discontinued operations. In accordance with a Term Sheet
Agreement with the NRG FinCo lenders, we are accruing a monthly
management fee and accruing for certain costs associated with
the caretaking and marketing of these assets. We believe we have
no additional risk of loss related to these entities.

Environmental Regulatory Matters

The construction and operation of power projects are subject to
stringent environmental and safety protection and land use laws
and regulation in the U.S. If such laws and regulations
become more stringent, or new laws, interpretations or
compliance policies apply and our facilities are not exempted
from coverage, we could be required to make extensive
modifications to further reduce potential environmental impacts.
In general, the effect of future laws or regulations is expected
to require the addition of pollution control equipment or the
imposition of restrictions on our operations.

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of any
facility may be required to investigate and remediate releases
or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or
petroleum products located at the facility, and may be held
liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property
damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs
incurred by the party in connection with any releases or
threatened releases. These laws impose strict (without fault)
and joint and several liability. The cost of investigation,
remediation or removal of any hazardous or toxic substances or
petroleum products could be substantial. To date, we have not
been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to
any off-site waste disposal matter.

As part of acquiring existing generating assets, we have
inherited certain environmental liabilities associated with
regulatory compliance and site contamination. Often potential
compliance implementation plans are changed, delayed or
abandoned due to one or more of the following conditions:
(a) extended negotiations with regulatory agencies,
(b) a delay in promulgating rules critical to dictating the
design of expensive control systems, (c) changes in
governmental/regulatory personnel, (d) changes in
governmental priorities or (e) selection of a less
expensive compliance option than originally envisioned.

Northeast Region

Significant amounts of ash are landfilled at on and off-site
locations. At Dunkirk, Huntley, Somerset and Indian River, ash
is disposed at landfills owned and operated by the Company. The
Company maintains financial assurance to cover costs associated
with closure, post-closure care and monitoring activities. The
Company has funded a trust in the amount of approximately
$5.9 million to provide such financial assurance in New
York and $6.7 million in Delaware. The Company must also
maintain financial assurance for closing interim status
“RCRA facilities” at the Devon, Middletown, Montville
and Norwalk Harbor Generating Stations and has funded a trust in
the amount of $1.5 million accordingly.

The Company inherited historical clean-up liabilities when it
acquired the Somerset, Devon, Middletown, Montville, Norwalk
Harbor, Arthur Kill and Astoria Generating Stations. During
installation of a sound wall



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

at Somerset Station in 2003, oil contaminated soil was
encountered. The Company has delineated the general extent of
contamination, determined it to be minimal, and has placed an
activity use limitation on that section of the property. Site
contamination liabilities arising under the Connecticut Transfer
Act at the Devon, Middletown, Montville and Norwalk Harbor
Stations have been identified. The Company has proposed a
remedial action plan to be implemented over the next two to
eight years (depending on the station) to address historical ash
contamination at the facilities. The total estimated cost is not
expected to exceed $1.5 million. Remedial obligations at
the Arthur Kill generating station have been established in
discussions between the Company and the NYSDEC and are estimated
to cost between $1 million and $2 million. Remedial
investigations continue at the Astoria generating station with
long-term clean-up liability expected to be within the range of
$2.5 million to $4.3 million. While installing
groundwater-monitoring wells at Astoria to track our remediation
of a historical fuel oil spill, the drilling contractor
encountered deposits of coal tar in two borings. The Company
reported the coal tar discovery to the NYSDEC in 2003 and
delineated the extent of this contamination. The Company may
also be required to remediate the coal tar contamination and/or
record a deed restriction on the property if significant
contamination is to remain in place.

We estimate that we will incur total environmental capital
expenditures of $197.6 million during 2005 through 2010 for
the facilities in New York, Connecticut, Delaware and
Massachusetts. These expenditures will be primarily related to
installation of particulate, SO


and NO

X

controls, as well as installation of BTA under the
Phase II 316(b) Rule.

Huntley Power LLC, Dunkirk Power LLC and Oswego Power LLC were
issued Notices of Violation for opacity exceedances and entered
into a Consent Order with NYSDEC, effective March 31, 2004.
The Consent Order required the respondents to pay a civil
penalty of $1.0 million which was paid in April 2004. The
Order also establishes stipulated penalties (payable quarterly)
for future violations of opacity requirements and a compliance
schedule. The Company is currently in dispute with NYSDEC over
the method of calculation for stipulated penalties. The Company
has placed $867,400 in a reserve as of December 31, 2004,
and does not believe that the final resolution will involve a
material larger amount.

South Central Region

Liabilities associated with closure, post-closure care and
monitoring of the ash ponds owned and operated on site at the
Big Cajun II Generating Station are addressed through the
use of a trust fund maintained by the Company in the amount of
approximately $5.0 million. Annual payments are made to the
fund in the amount of approximately $116,000.

We estimate approximately $149 million of capital
expenditures will be incurred during the period 2005 through
2010 for out South Central facilities, primarily related to
installation of particulate, SO


and NO

X

controls, as well as studies for installation of BTA under the
Phase II 316(b) Rule.

West Coast Region

The Asset Purchase Agreements for the Long Beach, El Segundo,
Encina, and San Diego gas turbine generating facilities
provide that SCE and SDG&E retain liability, and indemnify
the Company, for existing soil and groundwater contamination
that exceeds remedial thresholds in place at the time of
closing. The Company and its business partner conducted
Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessments at
each of these sites for purposes of identifying such existing
contamination and provided the results to the sellers. SCE and
SDG&E have agreed to address contamination identified by
these studies and are undertaking corrective action at the
Encina and San Diego gas turbine generating sites. Spills
and releases of various substances have occurred at these sites
since the Company established the historical baseline, all of
which have been, or will be, completely remediated. An oil leak
in 2002 from underground piping at the El Segundo Generating
Station contaminated soils adjacent to and underneath the Unit 1
and 2 powerhouse. The Company excavated and disposed of
contaminated soils that could be removed in accordance with
existing laws. Following the

Company’s formal request, the LARWQCB will allow
contaminated soils to remain underneath the building foundation
until the building is demolished.

NYISO Claims

In November 2002, NYISO notified us of claims related to New
York City mitigation adjustments, general NYISO billing
adjustments and other miscellaneous charges related to sales
between November 2000 and October 2002. New York City mitigation
adjustments totaled $11.4 million. The issue related to
NYISO’s concern that NRG would not have sufficient revenue
to cover subsequent revisions to its energy market settlements.
As of December 31, 2004, NYISO held $3.9 million in
escrow for such future settlement revisions.

Legal Issues

California Wholesale Electricity Litigation and Related
    Investigations

We, West Coast Power, LLC, or WCP, WCP’s four operating
subsidiaries, Dynegy, Inc. and numerous other unrelated parties
are the subject of numerous lawsuits arising based on events
occurring in the California power market. Through our
subsidiary, NRG West Coast Power LLC, we are a 50 percent
beneficial owner with Dynegy of WCP, which owns, operates and
markets the power of four California plants. Dynegy and its
affiliates and subsidiaries are responsible for gas procurement
and marketing and trading activities on behalf of WCP. The
complaints primarily allege that the defendants engaged in
unfair business practices, price fixing, antitrust violations,
and other market “gaming” activities. Certain of these
lawsuits, which seek unspecified treble damages and injunctive
relief, were consolidated and made a part of a Multi-District
Litigation proceeding before the U.S. District Court for
the Middle District of California. Defendants filed dispositive
motions in the fall of 2002 and in the first quarter of 2003,
the judge granted motions to dismiss in certain of these cases
based on federal preemption and the filed rate doctrine. On
September 10, 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal. On
November 5, 2004, the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ
of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court and on
February 22, 2005, the Supreme Court ordered the
U.S. Solicitor General to submit its views on the petition.

Regarding the remaining cases, in December 2002, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California
found that federal jurisdiction was absent and remanded the
cases back to state court. On December 8, 2004, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the
District Court in most respects. On March 3, 2005, the
Ninth Circuit denied a motion for rehearing. We anticipate that
the cases will be remanded to state court in 2005 at which time
the defendants will again raise file rate and federal preemption
challenges. In the Northern California cases, on
February 25, 2005, the Ninth Circuit approved the district
court’s decision to dismiss all of the defendants’
cases.

In addition to the Multi-District Litigation discussed above,
numerous other cases, including putative class actions, have
been filed in state and federal court on behalf of business and
residential electricity consumers which name us and/or WCP
and/or certain subsidiaries of WCP, in addition to numerous
other defendants. The complaints allege the defendants attempted
to manipulate gas indexes by reporting false and fraudulent
trades, and violated California’s antitrust law and unfair
business practices law. The complaints seek restitution and
disgorgement, civil fines, compensatory and punitive damages,
attorneys’ fees and declaratory and injunctive relief.
Motion practice is proceeding in these cases and dispositive
motions have been filed in several.

In certain of the above referenced cases, Dynegy is defending
WCP and/or it subsidiaries pursuant to a limited indemnification
agreement while in the others, Dynegy’s counsel is
representing it and WCP and/or it subsidiaries and with each
party responsible for half of the costs.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

FERC Proceedings

The FERC conducted an “Investigation of Potential
Manipulation of Electric and Natural Gas Prices,” which
involved hundreds of parties, including WCP. In June 2001, FERC
initiated proceedings related to California’s demand for
$8.9 billion in refunds from power sellers who allegedly
inflated wholesale prices during the energy crisis. After two
administrative law judge opinions and a March 26, 2003,
FERC Order adopting in part and modifying in part the last of
the two opinions, Dynegy, we and the WCP entities entered into
extensive settlement negotiations with several governmental
entities culminating in a comprehensive settlement which FERC
approved on October 25, 2004 (the FERC Settlement).

As part of the FERC Settlement, WCP placed into escrow for
distribution to California energy consumers a total of
$22.5 million, which includes the $3 million
settlement with FERC respecting trading techniques, announced on
January 20, 2004. In addition, WCP agreed to forego:
(1) past due receivables from the California Independent
System Operator and the California Power Exchange related to the
settlement period; and (2) natural gas cost recovery claims
against the settling parties related to the settlement period.
In exchange, the various California settling parties agreed to
forego: (1) all claims relating to refunds or other
monetary damages for sales of electricity during the settlement
period; (2) claims alleging that WCP received unjust or
unreasonable rates for the sale of electricity during the
settlement period; and (3) FERC dismissed numerous
investigations respecting market transactions. For a two year
period following FERC’s acceptance of the settlement
agreement, WCP will retain an independent engineering company to
perform semi-annual audits of the technical and economic basis,
justification and rationale for outages that occurred at its
California generating plants during the previous six month
period, and to have the results of such audits provided to the
FERC Office of Market Oversight and Investigation without any
prior review by WCP.

West Coast Power previously established significant reserves on
its balance sheet and will not incur any further loss associated
with the FERC Settlement. We will pay no cash from corporate
funds, nor will the FERC Settlement have any direct impact on
our profit and loss statement.

There are a number of additional, related proceedings in which
WCP subsidiaries are parties, which are either pending before
FERC or on appeal from FERC to various U.S. Courts of
Appeal. These cases involve, among other things, allegations of
physical withholding, a FERC-established price mitigation plan
determining maximum rates for wholesale power transactions in
certain spot markets, and the enforceability of, and obligations
under, various contracts with, among others, the California
Independent System Operator and the State of California.

California Attorney General

The California Attorney General has undertaken an investigation
entitled “In the Matter of the Investigation of Possibly
Unlawful, Unfair, or Anti-Competitive Behavior Affecting
Electricity Prices in California.” As has Dynegy, we and
subsidiaries of WCP have responded to interrogatories, document
requests, and to requests for interviews.

NRG Bankruptcy Cap on California Claims

On November 21, 2003, in conjunction with confirmation of
the NRG plan of reorganization, we reached an agreement with the
Attorney General and the State of California, generally, whereby
for purposes of distributions, if any, to be made to the State
of California under the NRG plan of reorganization, the
liquidated amount of any and all allowed claims shall not exceed
$1.35 billion in the aggregate. The agreement neither
affects our right to object to these claims on any and all
grounds nor admits any liability whatsoever. We further agreed
to waive any objection to the liquidation of these claims in a
non-bankruptcy forum having proper jurisdiction.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We believe that we have valid defenses to the legal proceedings
and investigations described above and intend to defend them
vigorously. We cannot predict with certainty whether we incur
any liability or estimate a range of possible loss, if any, that
might be incurred in connection with these matters. However, an
adverse result in one or more of these proceedings could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

New York Operating Reserve Markets

Consolidated Edison and others petitioned the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of
FERC’s refusal to order a re-determination of prices in the
New York Independent System Operator, or NYISO, operating
reserve markets for a two month period in 2000. On
November 7, 2003, the court found that NYISO’s method
of pricing spinning reserves violated the NYISO tariff. On
March 4, 2005, FERC issued an order stating that no refunds
would be required for the tariff violation associated with the
pricing of spinning reserves. In the order, FERC also stated
that the exclusion of the Blenheim-Gilboa facility and western
reserves from the non-spinning market was not a market flaw and
NYISO was correct not to use its TEP authority to revise the
prices in this market. Motions for rehearing of the Order must
be filed by April 3, 2005. If the March 4, 2005 order
is reversed and refunds are required, NRG entities which may be
affected include NRG Power Marketing, Inc., Astoria Gas Turbine
Power LLC and Arthur Kill Power LLC. Although non-NRG-related
entities would share responsibility for payment of any such
refunds, under the petitioners’ theory the cumulative
exposure to our above-listed entities could exceed
$23 million.

Connecticut Congestion Charges

CL&P withheld approximately $30 million from amounts
owed to NRG Power Marketing, Inc., or PMI under an
October 29, 1999, contract and PMI counterclaimed.
CL&P’s motion for summary judgment, which PMI opposed,
remains pending. We cannot estimate at this time the overall
exposure for congestion charges for the full term of the
contract, however, such amount has been fully reserved as a
reduction to outstanding accounts receivable.

New York Environmental Settlement

In January 2002, the New York Department of Environmental
Conservation, or NYSDEC, sued Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation,
or NiMo, and us in federal court in New York asserting that
projects undertaken at our Huntley and Dunkirk plants by NiMo,
the former owner of the facilities, violated federal and state
laws. On January 11, 2005, we reached an agreement to
settle this matter whereby we will reduce levels of sulfur
dioxide by over 86 percent and nitrogen oxide by over
80 percent in aggregate at the Huntley and Dunkirk plants.
We are not subject to any penalty as a result of the settlement.
Through the end of the decade, we expect that our ongoing
compliance with the emissions limits set out in the settlement
will be achieved through capital expenditures already planned.
This includes our conversion to low sulfur western coal at the
Huntley and Dunkirk plants that will be completed by Spring
2006. In a related case, on October 18, 2004, the parties
reached a confidential settlement with respect to NiMo’s
obligation to indemnify us for any related compliance costs
associated with resolution of the NYSDEC action.

Station Service Disputes

On October 2, 2000, NiMo commenced an action against us in
New York state court seeking damages related to our alleged
failure to pay retail tariff amounts for utility services at the
Dunkirk Plant between June 1999 and September 2000. The parties
agreed to consolidate this action with two other actions against
the Huntley and Oswego Plants. On October 8, 2002, by
Stipulation and Order, this action was stayed pending submission
to FERC of some or all of the disputes in the action. The
potential loss inclusive of amounts paid to NiMo and accrued is
approximately $23.2 million. In a companion action at FERC,
NiMo asserted the



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

same claims and legal theories and on November 19, 2004,
FERC denied NiMo’s petition and ruled that the NRG
facilities could net their service station obligations over a 30
calendar day period from the day NRG acquired the facilities. In
addition, FERC ruled that neither NiMo nor the New York Public
Service Commission could impose a retail delivery charge on the
NRG facilities, because they are interconnected to transmission
and not to distribution. NiMo filed a motion for rehearing.

On December 14, 1999, NRG Energy acquired certain
generating facilities from CL&P. A dispute arose over
station service power and delivery services provided to the
facilities. On December 20, 2002, as a result of a petition
filed at FERC by Northeast Utilities Services Company on behalf
of itself and CL&P, FERC issued an Order finding that at
times when NRG Energy is not able to self-supply its
station power needs, there is a sale of station power from a
third-party and retail charges apply. In August 2003, the
parties agreed to submit the dispute to binding arbitration,
however, the parties have yet to agree on a description of the
dispute and on the appointment of a neutral arbitrator. The
potential loss inclusive of amounts paid to CL&P and accrued
could exceed $6 million.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

On January 27, 2004, our subsidiaries, Louisiana
Generating, LLC and Big Cajun II, received a request under
Section 114 of the federal Clean Air Act from USEPA Region
6 seeking information primarily relating to physical changes
made at Big Cajun II. Louisiana Generating, LLC and Big
Cajun II submitted several responses to the USEPA in
response to follow-up requests. On February 15, 2005,
Louisiana Generating, LLC received a Notice of Violation
alleging violations of the New Source Review provisions of the
Clean Air Act at Big Cajun 2 Units 1 and 2 from 1998 through the
Notice of Violation date. Given the preliminary stage of this
NOV process, the Company cannot predict the outcome of this
matter at this time, but it is actively engaged with USEPA to
address the issues.

TermoRio Litigation

TermoRio was a green field cogeneration project located in the
state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Based on the project’s
failure to meet certain key milestones, we exercised our rights
under the project agreements to sell our debt and equity
interests in the project to our partner Petroleo Brasileiro
S.A.–Petrobras, or Petrobras. On March 8, 2003, the
arbitral tribunal decided most, but not all, of the issues in
our favor and awarded us approximately US$80 million. On
June 4 2004, NRG Energy commenced a lawsuit in federal
court seeking to enforce the arbitration award. On
February 16, 2005, a conditional settlement agreement was
signed with our former partner Petrobras, whereby Petrobras is
obligated to pay us US$70.825 million. Such payment was
received by us at a closing held on February 25, 2005. The
settlement is being accounted for as a gain contingency. As of
December 31, 2004, we had a note receivable from Petrobras
of $57.3 million related to the arbitral award. The amounts
paid in excess of the $57.3 million will be recognized in
earnings in the first quarter of 2005. In addition to the
settlement figure, we have the right to continue to seek
recovery of US$12.3 million in a related dispute with a
third-party.

Itiquira Energetica, S.A.

Our Brazilian project company, Itiquira Energetica S.A., the
owner of a 156 MW hydro project in Brazil, is in
arbitration with the former EPC contractor for the project,
Inepar Industria e Construcoes, or Inepar. The dispute was
commenced by Itiquira in September of 2002 and pertains to
certain matters arising under the former EPC contract. Itiquira
seeks $40 million and asserts that Inepar breached the
contract. Inepar seeks $10 million and alleges that
Itiquira breached the contract. Final written arguments were
submitted on January 28, 2005, to the court of arbitration
and a decision is expected during the first quarter of 2005.



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

CFTC Trading Litigation

On July 1, 2004, the CFTC filed a civil complaint against
us in Minnesota federal district court, alleging false reporting
of natural gas trades from August 2001 to May 2002, and seeking
an injunction against future violations of the Commodity
Exchange Act On November 17, 2004, a Bankruptcy Court
hearing was held on the CFTC’s motion to reinstate its
expunged bankruptcy claim, and on our motion to enforce the
provisions of the NRG plan of reorganization thereby precluding
the CFTC from continuing its federal court action. Although the
bankruptcy court has not yet ruled on those motions, on
December 6, 2004, a federal magistrate judge issued a
report and recommendation that our motion to dismiss be granted.
That motion to dismiss was granted by the federal district court
in Minnesota on March 16, 2005. The Bankruptcy Court has
yet to schedule for a hearing or rule on the CFTC’s pending
motion to reinstate its expunged claim.

Additional Litigation

In addition to the foregoing, we are parties to other litigation
or legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
In management’s opinion, the disposition of these ordinary
course matters will not materially adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal
proceedings and investigations described above and intends to
defend them vigorously. However, litigation is inherently
subject to many uncertainties. There can be no assurance that
additional litigation will not be filed against the Company or
its subsidiaries in the future asserting similar or different
legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages
and relief. Unless specified above, the Company is unable to
predict the outcome these legal proceedings and investigations
may have or reasonably estimate the scope or amount of any
associated costs and potential liabilities. An unfavorable
outcome in one or more of these proceedings could have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company also
has indemnity rights for some of these proceedings to reimburse
the Company for certain legal expenses and to offset certain
amounts deemed to be owed in the event of an unfavorable
litigation outcome.

Pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies,” and related guidance, we record reserves
for estimated losses from contingencies when information
available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of
the loss is reasonably estimable. Management has assessed each
of these matters based on current information and made a
judgment concerning its potential outcome, considering the
nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought and
the probability of success. Management’s judgment may, as a
result of facts arising prior to resolution of these matters or
other factors, prove inaccurate and investors should be aware
that such judgment is made subject to the known uncertainty of
litigation.

Disputed Claims Reserve

As part of the NRG plan of reorganization, we have funded a
disputed claims reserve for the satisfaction of certain general
unsecured claims that were disputed claims as of the effective
date of the plan. Under the terms of the plan, to the extent
such claims are resolved now that we have emerged from
bankruptcy, the claimants will be paid from the reserve on the
same basis as if they had been paid out in the bankruptcy. That
means that their allowed claims will be reduced to the same
recovery percentage as other creditors would have received and
will be paid in pro rata distributions of cash and common stock.
We believe we have funded the disputed claims reserve at a
sufficient level to settle the remaining unresolved proofs of
claim we received during the bankruptcy proceedings. However, to
the extent the aggregate amount of these payouts of disputed
claims ultimately exceeds the amount of the funded claims
reserve, we are obligated to provide additional cash, notes and
common stock to the claimants. We will continue to monitor our
obligation as the disputed claims are settled. If excess funds
remain in the disputed claims reserve after payment of all
obligations, such amounts will be reallocated to the creditor
pool. We have contributed common stock and cash to an escrow



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

agent to complete the distribution and settlement process. Since
we have surrendered control over the common stock and cash
provided to the disputed claims reserve, we recognized the
issuance of the common stock as of December 6, 2003 and
removed the cash amounts from our balance sheet. Similarly, we
have removed the obligations relevant to the claims from our
balance sheet when the common stock was issued and cash
contributed.

Note 29 — Guarantees and Other Contingent
Liabilities

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No. 45,

“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others.”

In connection with the
adoption of Fresh Start, all outstanding guarantees were
considered new; accordingly, we applied the provisions of
FIN 45 to all of the guarantees.

We and our subsidiaries enter into various contracts that
include indemnification and guarantee provisions as a routine
part of our business activities. Examples of these contracts
include asset purchase and sale agreements, commodity sale and
purchase agreements, joint venture agreements, operations and
maintenance agreements, service agreements, settlement
agreements, and other types of contractual agreements with
vendors and other third parties. These contracts generally
indemnify the counter-party for tax, environmental liability,
litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in these
agreements. In many cases, our maximum potential liability
cannot be estimated, since some of the underlying agreements
contain no limits on potential liability.

The material guarantees, within the scope of FIN 45, are as
follows:

•

Standby letters of credit and surety bonds

— At
    December 31, 2004, we and our consolidated subsidiaries
    were contingently obligated for approximately
    $173.2 million under standby letters of credit. Most of
    these letters of credit are issued in support of our obligations
    to perform under commodity agreements, financing or other
    arrangements. These letters of credit expire within one year of
    issuance, and it is typical for us to renew many of them on
    similar terms.

As of December 31, 2004, standby letters of credit in
    amounts totaling approximately $157.1 million were issued
    under our $350.0 million corporate funded letter of credit
    facility, which is reflected in our



NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

financial statements. This amount includes a $33.3 million
    letter of credit issued to the benefit of Xcel to cover
    potential obligations from which Xcel was not released when we
    ceased to be an affiliate of theirs, though our maximum exposure
    under this arrangement is indeterminate. In addition,
    $2.4 million was issued to support performance obligations
    of an unconsolidated affiliate of ours.

Approximately $16.1 million in letters of credit were
    issued separately and are not supported by collateral. Of the
    uncollateralized letters of credit, approximately
    $4.8 million was issued to support the obligations of an
    unconsolidated affiliate of ours. We were also contingently
    obligated for $4.5 million under surety bonds to support
    our prepayment, completion, license, tax or performance bonding
    requirements. Most of the bonds are supported by collateral,
    which is reflected in our financial statements. All of the bonds
    expire within one year; however, we expect to renew many of
    these bonds on a rolling twelve-month basis.

•

Asset purchases and divestitures

— In the
    normal course of business, we may be asked to provide certain
    assurances to the counter-parties of our asset sale and purchase
    agreements. Such assurances may take the form of a guarantee
    issued by us on behalf of a directly or indirectly held
    majority-owned subsidiary. Due to the inter-company nature of
    such arrangements (NRG Energy is essentially guaranteeing
    its own performance) and the nature of the guarantee being
    provided (usually the typical representations and warrantees
    that are provided in any asset sales agreement), it is not our
    policy to recognize the value of such an obligation in our
    consolidated financial statements. Most of these guarantees
    provide an explicit cap on our maximum liability, as well as an
    expiration period, exclusive of breach of representations and
    warranties. At December 31, 2004, our maximum known
    exposure under asset sales guarantees was $73.5 million. On
    February 18, 2005 we executed a guarantee to the benefit of
    our counter-party under the railcar lease described in
    Items 7 — Contractual Obligations and Commercial
    Commitments. This guarantee covers NRG PMI payment and
    performance obligations under the relevant lease documents, and
    is of indeterminate exposure.

•

Commercial sales arrangements

— In connection
    with the purchase and sale of fuel, emission credits and power
    generation products to and from third parties with respect to
    the operation of some of our generation facilities in the U.S.,
    we may be required to guarantee a portion of the obligations of
    certain of our subsidiaries. These obligations may include
    liquidated damages payments or other unscheduled payments. As of
    December 31, 2004, we estimate the maximum liability for
    this category of guarantee was $57.6 million. We have
    subsequently issued additional guarantees of the performance of
    NRG PMI, with a maximum liability of $0.3 million. These
    guarantees terminate on May 31, 2005 and December 31,
    2005.

•

Other types of guarantees

— We have issued
    guarantees of obligations our subsidiaries may incur in
    provision of environmental site remediation, funding reserve
    accounts, payment of debt obligations, and performance under
    operating and maintenance agreements. Maximum quantifiable
    liability under the environmental guarantees is approximately
    $65.9 million, most of which is a guarantee for plant
    removal and site remediation obligations at our Flinders
    facilities. The maximum quantifiable exposure under the
    operational guarantees is $25.8 million, primarily related
    to our role as operator at the Gladstone power plant. In
    addition, we have a maximum liability exposure of
    $0.6 million under a tax indemnity guarantee to a third
    party, reserve funding guarantee exposure of $1.0 million
    and third-party debt guarantee exposure of $0.8 million.

The material indemnities, within the scope of FIN 45, are
as follows:

•

Asset purchases and divestitures —

The purchase
    and sale agreements which govern our asset or share investments
    and divestitures customarily contain indemnifications of the
    transaction to third parties. The contracts indemnify the
    parties for liabilities incurred as a result of a breach of a
    representation or warranty by the indemnifying party, or as a
    result of a change in tax laws. These obligations generally have
    a discrete term and are intended to protect the parties against
    risks that are difficult to predict or quantify at the time of
    the transaction. In several cases, the contract limits the
    liability of the indemnitor. For those indemnities in which
    liability is capped, the exposure ranges from $1.0 million
    up to $50.0 million. We have no reason to believe that we
    currently have any material liability relating to such routine
    indemnification obligations.

•

Other indemnities

— Other indemnifications we
    have provided cover operational, tax, litigation and breaches of
    representations, warranties and covenants. We have also
    indemnified, on a routine basis in the ordinary course of
    business, consultants or other vendors who have provided
    services to us. Our maximum potential exposure under these
    indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an
    unlimited amount, depending on the nature of the transaction.
    Total maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications is
    not estimable due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be
    made or how they will be resolved. We do not have any reason to
    believe that we will be required to make any material payments
    under these indemnity provisions.

Because many of the guarantees and indemnities we issue to third
parties do not limit the amount or duration of our obligations
to perform under them, there exists a risk that we may have
obligations in excess of the amounts described above. For those
guarantees and indemnities that do not limit our liability
exposure, we may not be able to estimate what our liability
would be, until a claim was made for payment or performance, due
to the contingent nature of these contracts.

Note 31 — Jointly Owned Plants

Big Cajun II Unit 3

On March 31, 2000, we acquired a 58% interest in the Big
Cajun II, Unit 3 generation plant. Entergy Gulf States owns
the remaining 42%. Big Cajun II, Unit 3 is operated and
maintained by Louisiana Generating pursuant to a joint ownership
participation and operating agreement. Under this agreement,
Louisiana Generating and Entergy Gulf States are each entitled
to their ownership percentage of the hourly net electrical
output of Big Cajun II, Unit 3. All fixed costs are shared
in proportion to the ownership interests. All variable costs are
incurred in proportion to the energy delivered to the owners.
Our income statement includes its share of all fixed and
variable costs of operating the unit.

Reorganized NRG

$183.2 million, respectively, and the corresponding
accumulated depreciation and amortization was $11.5 million
and $0.5 million, respectively.

Keystone and Conemaugh

In June 2001, we completed the acquisition of an approximately
3.7% interest in both the Keystone and Conemaugh coal-fired
generating facilities. The Keystone and Conemaugh facilities are
located near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and are jointly owned by a
consortium of energy companies. We purchased our interest from
Conectiv, Inc. Keystone and Conemaugh are operated by GPU
Generation, Inc., which sold its assets and operating
responsibilities to Sithe Energies. Keystone and Conemaugh both
consist of two operational coal-fired steam power units with a
combined net output of 1,700 MW, four diesel units with a
combined net output of 11 MW and an on-site landfill. The
units are operated pursuant to a joint ownership participation
and operating agreement. Under this agreement each joint owner
is entitled to its ownership ratio of the net available output
of the facility. All fixed costs are shared in proportion to the
ownership interests. All variable costs are incurred in
proportion to the energy delivered to the owners. Our income
statement includes our share of all fixed and variable costs of
operating the facilities.

Reorganized NRG

Our 3.70% and 3.72% share of the Keystone and Conemaugh
facilities original cost included in property, plant and
equipment and construction in progress at December 31, 2004
was $58.6 million and $70.7 million, respectively. The
corresponding accumulated depreciation and amortization at
