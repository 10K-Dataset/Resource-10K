PART I

Item 1 —

Business

General

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a wholesale power
    generation company with a significant presence in major
    competitive power markets in the United States. NRG is engaged
    in the ownership, development, construction and operation of
    power generation facilities, the transacting in and trading of
    fuel and transportation services, and the trading of energy,
    capacity and related products in the United States and select
    international markets. As of December 31, 2007, NRG had a
    total global portfolio of 191 active operating generation units
    at 49 power generation plants, with an aggregate generation
    capacity of approximately 24,115 MW, and approximately
    740 MW under construction which includes partners’
    interests. Within the United States, NRG has one of the largest
    and most diversified power generation portfolios in terms of
    geography, fuel-type and dispatch levels, with approximately
    22,880 MW of generation capacity in 175 active generating
    units at 43 plants. These power generation facilities are
    primarily located in Texas (approximately 10,805 MW), the
    Northeast (approximately 6,980 MW), South Central
    (approximately 2,850 MW), and West (approximately
    2,130 MW) regions of the United States, with approximately
    115 MW of additional generation capacity from the
    Company’s thermal assets. NRG’s principal domestic
    power plants consist of a mix of natural gas-, coal-, oil-fired
    and nuclear facilities, representing approximately 46%, 33%, 16%
    and 5% of the Company’s total domestic generation capacity,
    respectively. In addition, 15% of NRG’s domestic generating
    facilities have dual or multiple fuel capacity, which allows
    plants to dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option. NRG’s
    domestic generation facilities consist of baseload, intermediate
    and peaking power generation facilities, the ranking of which is
    referred to as Merit Order, and include thermal energy
    production plants. The sale of capacity and power from baseload
    generation facilities accounts for the majority of the
    Company’s revenues and provides a stable source of cash
    flow. In addition, NRG’s generation portfolio provides the
    Company with opportunities to capture additional revenues by
    selling power during periods of peak demand, offering capacity
    or similar products to retail electric providers and others, and
    providing ancillary services to support system reliability.

NRG’s
    Major Initiatives

The Company’s strategy is reflected in its five major
    initiatives, four of which were announced and began
    implementation in 2006. The fifth, “Focus on ROIC
    @NRG”, or

FOR

NRG, successfully concluded its third
    year in 2007. NRG’s five major initiatives, described
    below, are designed to enhance the Company’s competitive
    advantages of the opportunities and surmount the challenges
    faced by the power industry.

I.

FOR

NRG

is a companywide effort, introduced in
    2005, and is designed to increase the return on invested
    capital, or ROIC, through operational performance improvements
    to the Company’s asset fleet, along with a range of
    initiatives at plants and at corporate offices to reduce costs
    or, in some cases, generate revenue. The

FOR

NRG earnings
    accomplishments disclosed in NRG’s SEC filings and press
    releases include both recurring and one time improvements
    measured from a 2004 baseline, with the exception of the Texas
    region where benefits are measured using 2005 as the base year.
    For plant operations, the program measures cumulative current
    year benefits using current gross margins times the change in
    baseline levels of certain key performance indicators. The plant
    performance benefits include both positive and negative results
    for plant reliability, capacity, heat rate and station service.

FOR

NRG contributed $39 million to pre-tax earnings
    in 2005 and $144 million were achieved through the end of
    2006. For 2007, the Company attained its previously announced
    target of $220 million which includes $11 million of
    one-time benefits.

lI.

Repowering

NRG

is a comprehensive portfolio
    redevelopment program designed to develop, construct and operate
    new multi-fuel, multi-technology, highly efficient and
    environmentally responsible generation capacity over the next
    decade. Through this initiative, the Company anticipates
    retiring certain existing units and adding new generation to
    meet growing demand in the Company’s core markets, with an
    emphasis on new baseload capacity that is expected to be
    supported by long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, and
    financed with limited or non-recourse project financing.



llI.

econrg

represents NRG’s commitment to
    environmentally responsible power generation. econrg seeks to
    find ways to meet the challenges of climate change, clean air
    and water, and protecting our natural resources while taking
    advantage of business opportunities. This initiative builds upon
    its foundation in environmental compliance and embraces
    environmental initiatives for the benefit of our communities,
    employees and shareholders, such as encouraging investment in
    new environmental technologies, pursuing activities that
    preserve and protect the environment and encouraging changes in
    the daily lives of our employees.

IV.

Future NRG

is the Company’s workforce planning and
    development initiative and represents NRG’s strong
    commitment to planning for future staffing requirements to meet
    the on-going needs of the Company’s current operations in
    addition to the Company’s

Repowering

NRG initiatives.
    Future NRG encompasses analyzing the demographics, skill set and
    size of the Company’s workforce in addition to the
    organizational structure with a focus on succession planning
    requirements, training, development, staffing and recruiting
    needs. Included under the Future NRG umbrella is NRG University,
    which develops leadership, managerial, supervisory and technical
    training programs and includes individual skill development
    courses.

V.

NRG Global Giving

- Respect for the community is one of
    NRG’s core values. NRG’s Global Giving Program invests
    the Company’s resources to strengthen the communities where
    NRG does business and seeks to make investments in four focus
    areas: community and economic development, education,
    environment and human welfare.

Business
    Strategy

NRG’s strategy is to optimize the value of the
    Company’s generation assets while using its asset base as a
    platform for growth and enhanced financial performance which can
    be sustained and expanded upon in the years to come. NRG plans
    to maintain and enhance the Company’s position as a leading
    wholesale power generation company in the United States in a
    cost-effective and risk-mitigating manner in order to serve the
    bulk power requirements of NRG’s existing customer base and
    other entities that offer load or otherwise consume wholesale
    electricity products and services in bulk. NRG’s strategy
    includes the following principles:

Increase value from existing assets —

NRG
    has a highly diversified portfolio of power generation assets in
    terms of region, fuel-type and dispatch levels. Through the

FOR

NRG initiative, NRG will continue to focus on
    extracting value from its portfolio by improving plant
    performance, reducing costs and harnessing the Company’s
    advantages of scale in the procurement of fuels and other
    commodities, parts and services, and in doing so improving the
    Company’s ROIC.

Reduce the volatility of the Company’s cash flows
    through asset-based commodity hedging
    activities —

NRG will continue to execute
    asset-based risk management, hedging, marketing and trading
    strategies within well-defined risk and liquidity guidelines in
    order to manage the value of the Company’s physical and
    contractual assets. The Company’s marketing and hedging
    philosophy is centered on generating stable returns from its
    portfolio of baseload power generation assets while preserving
    an ability to capitalize on strong spot market conditions and to
    capture the extrinsic value of the Company’s intermediate
    and peaking facilities and portions of its baseload fleet. NRG
    believes that it can successfully execute this strategy by
    leveraging its (i) expertise in marketing power and
    ancillary services, (ii) its knowledge of markets,
    (iii) its balanced financial structure and (iv) its
    diverse portfolio of power generation assets.

Pursue additional growth opportunities at existing
    sites —

NRG is favorably positioned to pursue
    growth opportunities through expansion of its existing
    generating capacity and development of new generating capacity
    at its existing facilities. NRG intends to invest in its
    existing assets through plant improvements, repowerings,
    brownfield development and site expansions to meet anticipated
    requirements for additional capacity in NRG’s core markets.
    Through the

Repowering

NRG initiative, NRG will continue
    to develop, construct and operate new and enhanced power
    generation facilities at its existing sites, with an emphasis on
    new baseload capacity that is supported by long-term power sales
    agreements and financed with limited or non-recourse project
    financing. NRG expects that these efforts will provide one or
    more of the following benefits: improved heat rates; lower
    delivered costs; expanded electricity production capability; an
    improved ability to dispatch economically across the regional



general portfolio; increased technological and fuel diversity;
    and reduced environmental impacts, including facilities that
    either have near zero greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions or can
    be equipped to capture and sequester GHG emissions.

Reduce carbon intensity of portfolio while taking advantage
    of carbon-driven business opportunities —

NRG
    continues to actively pursue investments in new generating
    facilities and technologies that will be highly efficient and
    will employ no and low carbon technologies to limit
    CO


emissions and other air emission. Through the

Repowering

NRG and econrg initiatives, NRG is focused on
    the development of low or no GHG emitting energy generating
    sources, such as nuclear, wind, ’clean’ coal and gas,
    and the employment of post-combustion capture technologies,
    which represent significant commercial opportunities.

Maintain financial strength and
    flexibility —

NRG remains focused on cash
    flow and maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity, debt and
    equity in order to ensure continued access to capital for
    investment, to enhance risk-adjusted returns and to provide
    flexibility in executing NRG’s business strategy. NRG will
    continue to focus on maintaining operational and financial
    controls designed to ensure that the Company’s financial
    position remains strong. At the same time, the Company’s
    ongoing capital allocation objective includes scheduled
    repayment of debt based on the amount of cash flow by the
    Company each year, as well as an annual return of capital to
    shareholders, targeted at an average rate of 3% of market
    capitalization, of approximately $250 million to
    $300 million per year.

Pursue strategic acquisitions and
    divestures —

NRG will continue to pursue
    selective acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures to
    enhance its asset mix and competitive position in the
    Company’s core markets. NRG intends to concentrate on
    opportunities that present attractive risk-adjusted returns. NRG
    will also opportunistically pursue other strategic transactions,
    including mergers, acquisitions or divestitures.

Competition
    and Competitive Strengths

Competition —

Wholesale power generation
    is a capital-intensive, commodity-driven business with numerous
    industry participants. NRG competes on the basis of the location
    of its plants and ownership of multiple plants in various
    regions, which increases the stability and reliability of its
    energy supply. Wholesale power generation is basically a local
    business that is currently highly fragmented relative to other
    commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure.
    As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities,
    resources, nature and identity of the companies NRG competes
    with depending on the market.

Scale and diversity of assets —

NRG has
    one of the largest and most diversified power generation
    portfolios in the United States, with approximately
    22,880 MW of generation capacity in 175 active generating
    units at 43 plants as of December 31, 2007. The
    Company’s power generation assets are diversified by
    fuel-type, dispatch level and region, which help mitigate the
    risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand
    cycles. NRG’s U.S. baseload facilities, which consist
    of approximately 8,700 MW of generation capacity measured
    as of December 31, 2007, provide the Company with a
    significant source of stable cash flow, while its intermediate
    and peaking facilities, with approximately 14,180 MW of
    generation capacity as of December 31, 2007, provide NRG
    with opportunities to capture the significant upside potential
    that can arise from time to time during periods of high demand.
    In addition, approximately 15% of the Company’s domestic
    generation facilities have dual or multiple fuel capability,
    which allows most of these plants to dispatch with the lowest
    cost fuel option.



The following chart demonstrates the diversification of
    NRG’s domestic power generation assets as of
    December 31, 2007:

Reliability of future cash flows —

NRG has
    sold forward or otherwise hedged a significant portion of its
    expected baseload generation capacity through 2013. The Company
    has the capacity and intent to enter into additional hedges in
    later years when market conditions are favorable. In addition,
    as of December 31, 2007, the Company had purchased forward
    under fixed price contracts (with contractually-specified price
    escalators) to provide fuel for approximately 59% of its
    expected baseload coal generation output from 2008 to 2013. The
    hedge percentage is reflective of the current agreement of the
    Jewett mine in which NRG has the contractual ability to adjust
    volumes in future years. These forward positions provide a
    stable and reliable source of future cash flow for NRG’s
    investors, while preserving a portion of its generation
    portfolio for opportunistic sales to take advantage of market
    dynamics.

Favorable cost dynamics for baseload power
    plants —

In 2007, approximately 87% of the
    Company’s domestic generation output was from plants fueled
    by coal or nuclear fuel. In many of the competitive markets
    where NRG operates, the price of power is typically set by the
    marginal costs of natural gas-fired and oil-fired power plants
    that currently have substantially higher variable costs than
    solid fuel baseload power plants. As a result of NRG’s
    lower marginal cost for baseload coal and nuclear generation
    assets, the Company expects the baseload assets in ERCOT to
    generate power nearly 100% of the time they are available.

Locational advantages —

Many of NRG’s
    generation assets are located within densely populated areas
    that are characterized by significant constraints on the
    transmission of power from generators outside the particular
    region. Consequently, these assets are able to benefit from the
    higher prices that prevail for energy in these markets during
    periods of transmission constraints. NRG has generation assets
    located within New York City, southwestern Connecticut, Houston
    and the Los Angeles and San Diego load basins; all areas
    with constraints on the transmission of electricity. This gives
    the Company the opportunity to capture additional revenues by
    offering capacity to retail electric providers and others,
    selling power at prevailing market prices during periods of peak
    demand and providing ancillary services in support of system
    reliability. These facilities also are often ideally situated
    for repowering or the addition of new capacity, because their
    location and existing infrastructure give them significant
    advantages over newly developed sites in their regions.

In understanding NRG’s business, the Company believes that
    certain performance metrics are particularly important. These
    are industry statistics defined by the North American Electric
    Reliability Council and are more fully described below:

Annual Equivalent Availability Factor, or
    EAF: —

Measures the percentage of maximum
    generation available over time as the fraction of net maximum
    generation that could be provided over a defined period of time
    after all types of outages and deratings, including seasonal
    deratings, are taken into account.

Gross heat rate: —

NRG calculates the
    gross heat rate for the Company’s fossil-fired power plants
    by dividing the average amount of fuel in BTUs required to
    generate one kWh of electricity by the generator output.

Net Capacity Factor: —

The net amount of
    electricity that a generating unit produces over a period of
    time divided by the net amount of electricity it could have
    produced if it had run at full power over that time period. The
    net amount of electricity produced is the total amount of
    electricity generated minus the amount of electricity used
    during generation.

The tables below present the North American power generation
    performance metrics for the Company’s power plants
    discussed above for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006:

As of December 31, 2007, NRG had 3,412 employees,
    approximately 1,639 of whom were covered by U.S. bargaining
    agreements. During 2007, the Company did not experience any
    labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of its facilities.

Generation
    Asset Overview

NRG has a significant power generation presence in major
    competitive power markets of the United States as set forth in
    the map below:

(1)

Includes 115 MW as part of
    NRG’s Thermal assets. For combined scale, approximately
    3,450 MW is dual-fuel capable. Reflects only domestic
    generation capacity as of December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company’s power
    generation assets consisted of approximately 10,490 MW of
    gas-fired; 7,525 MW of coal-fired; 3,690 MW of
    oil-fired and 1,175 MW of nuclear generating capacity in
    the United States. In addition, NRG also owns approximately
    115 MW of thermal capacity domestically as well as
    1,235 MW of power generation capacity overseas. The
    Company’s North American power generation portfolio by



dispatch level is comprised of approximately 38% baseload, 37%
    intermediate and 25% of peaking units. NRG uses hedging
    strategies which may include power and natural gas forward sales
    contracts to manage the commodity price risk associated with the
    Company’s generation assets, and are primarily around the
    Company’s baseload generation assets. In addition, these
    hedging strategies also provide for stable cash flow and
    earnings predictability.

The following table summarizes NRG’s North American
    baseload capacity and the corresponding revenues and average
    natural gas prices resulting from baseload hedge agreements
    extending beyond December 31, 2007 and through 2013:

The following is a discussion of NRG’s generation assets by
    segment for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Texas Region

— As of December 31,
    2007, NRG’s generation assets in the Texas region consisted
    of approximately 5,325 MW of baseload generation assets and
    approximately 5,480 MW of intermediate and peaking natural
    gas-fired assets. NRG realizes a substantial portion of its
    revenue and cash flow from the sale of power from the
    Company’s three baseload power plants located in the ERCOT
    market that use solid fuel: W.A. Parish which uses coal,
    Limestone which uses lignite and coal, and an undivided 44%
    interest in two nuclear generating units at South Texas Project,
    or STP, which uses nuclear fuel. Power plants are generally
    dispatched in order of lowest operating cost and as of
    December 31, 2007, approximately 72% of the net generation
    capacity in the ERCOT market was natural gas-fired. In the
    current natural gas price environment, NRG’s three baseload
    facilities have



significantly lower operating costs than gas plants. NRG expects
    these three facilities to operate nearly 100% of the time when
    available, subject to planned and forced outages.

Northeast Region

— As of
    December 31, 2007, NRG generation assets in the Northeast
    region of the United States consisted of approximately
    6,980 MW generation capacity from the Company’s power
    plants within the control areas of the New York Independent
    System Operator, or NYISO, the Independent System
    Operator — New England, or ISO-NE, and the PJM
    Interconnection LLC, or PJM. Certain of these assets are located
    in transmission constrained areas, including approximately
    1,415 MW of in-city New York City generation capacity and
    approximately 535 MW of southwest Connecticut generation
    capacity. As of December 31, 2007, NRG’s generation
    assets in the Northeast region consisted of approximately
    1,870 MW of baseload generation assets and approximately
    5,110 MW of intermediate and peaking assets.

South Central Region

— As of
    December 31, 2007, NRG generation assets in the South
    Central region of the United States consisted of approximately
    2,405 MW of generation capacity, making NRG the third
    largest generator in the Southeastern Electric Reliability
    Council/Entergy, or SERC-Entergy, region. The Company’s
    generation assets in the South Central region consists of its
    primary asset, Big Cajun II, a coal-fired plant located near
    Baton Rouge, Louisiana which has approximately 1,490 MW of
    baseload generation assets and 1,360 MW of intermediate and
    peaking assets. A significant portion of the region’s
    generation capacity has been sold to eleven cooperatives within
    the region through 2025. In addition, the region also operates
    445 MW of peaking generation in Rockford, Illinois under
    the PJM region.

West Region

— As of December 31,
    2007, NRG generation assets in the West region of the United
    States consisted of approximately 2,130 MW. On
    January 3, 2007, NRG completed the sale of the Red Bluff
    and Chowchilla II power plants with a combined generation
    capacity of approximately 95 MW to an entity controlled by
    Wayzata Investment Partners LLC. On August 1, 2007, the
    Company successfully completed and commissioned the repowering
    of 260 MW of new gas-fired generating capacity at its Long
    Beach Generating Station.

International Region

— As of
    December 31, 2007, NRG had net ownership in approximately
    1,235 MW of power generating capacity outside the United
    States in Australia, Brazil, and Germany. In addition to
    traditional power generation facilities, NRG also owns equity
    interests in certain coal mines in Germany. On December 18,
    2007, NRG entered into a sale and purchase agreement to sell its
    100% interest in Tosli Acquisition B.V., which holds all of
    NRG’s interest in ITISA, to Brookfield Asset Management
    Inc. for the purchase price of $288 million, plus the
    assumption of approximately $60 million in debt. NRG
    anticipates the completion of the sale transaction during the
    first half 2008.

Thermal

— NRG owns thermal and chilled
    water businesses that generate approximately 1,040 MW
    thermal equivalents. In addition, NRG’s thermal segment
    owns certain power plants with approximately 116 MW of
    power generating capacity located in Delaware and in
    Pennsylvania.

Commercial
    Operations Overview

NRG seeks to maximize profitability and manage cash flow
    volatility through the marketing, trading and sale of energy,
    capacity and ancillary services into spot, intermediate and
    long-term markets and through the active management and trading
    of emissions allowances, fuel supplies and
    transportation-related services. The Company’s principal
    objectives are the realization of the full market value of its
    asset base, including the capture of its extrinsic value, the
    management and mitigation of commodity market risk and the
    reduction of cash flow volatility over time.

NRG enters into power sales and hedging arrangements via a wide
    range of products and contracts, including power purchase
    agreements, fuel supply contracts, capacity auctions, natural
    gas swap agreements and other financial instruments. The power
    purchase agreements that NRG enters into require the Company to
    deliver MWh of power to its counterparties. In addition, because
    changes in power prices in the markets where NRG operates are
    generally correlated to changes in natural gas prices, the
    Company hedges a portion of its generation portfolio power using
    natural gas swaps and other financial instruments.



Fuel
    Supply and Transportation

NRG’s fuel requirements consist primarily of nuclear fuel
    and various forms of fossil fuel including oil, natural gas and
    coal, including lignite. The prices of oil, natural gas and coal
    are subject to macro- and micro-economic forces that can change
    dramatically in both the short- and long-term. The Company
    obtains its oil, natural gas and coal from multiple suppliers
    and transportation sources. Although availability is generally
    not an issue, localized shortages, transportation availability
    and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur. Issues
    related to the sources and availability of raw materials are
    fairly uniform across the Company’s business segments.

Coal

The Company is largely hedged for
    its domestic coal consumption over the next few years. Coal
    hedging is dynamic, and is based on forecasted generation and
    market volatility. As of December 31, 2007, NRG had
    purchased forward contracts to provide fuel for approximately
    59% of the Company’s requirement from 2008 through 2013.
    NRG arranges for the purchase, transportation and delivery of
    coal for the Company’s baseload coal plants via a variety
    of coal purchase agreements, rail transportation agreements and
    rail car lease arrangements. The Company purchased approximately
    38 million tons of coal in 2007, and is one of the largest
    coal purchasers in the United States.

The following table shows the percentage of the Company’s
    coal and lignite requirements from 2008 through 2013 that have
    been purchased forward:

Percentage of

Company’s

Requirement

The hedge percentages reflect the
    current plan for the Jewett mine. NRG has the contractual
    ability to change volumes and may do so in the future.

As of December 31, 2007, NRG had approximately 7,600
    privately leased or owned rail cars in the Company’s
    transportation fleet. NRG has entered into rail transportation
    agreements with varying tenures that provide for substantially
    all of the Company’s rail transportation requirements
    through the end of the decade.

Natural Gas

NRG operates a fleet of
    natural gas plants in the Texas, Northeast, South Central and
    West regions which are primarily comprised of peaking assets
    that run in times of high power demand. Due to the uncertainty
    of their dispatch, the fuel needs are managed on a spot basis as
    it is not prudent to forward purchase fixed price natural gas on
    units that may not run. The Company contracts for natural gas
    storage services as well as natural gas transportation services
    to ensure delivery of natural gas when needed.

Nuclear Fuel

STP’s owners satisfy
    STP’s fuel supply requirements by (i) acquiring
    uranium concentrates and contracting for conversion of the
    uranium concentrates into uranium hexafluoride,
    (ii) contracting for enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and
    (iii) contracting for fabrication of nuclear fuel
    assemblies. NRG is party to a number of long-term forward
    purchase contracts with many of the world’s largest
    suppliers covering STP requirements for uranium and conversion
    services for the next five years, and with substantial portions
    of STP’s requirements procured through the end of the next
    decade. NRG is party to long term contracts to procure
    STP’s requirements for enrichment services and fuel
    fabrication for the life of the operating license.

Seasonality
    and Price Volatility

Annual and quarterly operating results can be significantly
    affected by weather and energy commodity price volatility.
    Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas,
    interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels
    of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power
    price volatility. NRG derives a majority of its annual revenues
    in the months of May through September, when demand for
    electricity is at its



highest in the Company’s core domestic markets. Further,
    power price volatility is generally higher in the summer months,
    traditionally NRG’s most important season. The
    Company’s second most important season is the winter months
    of December through March when volatility and price spikes in
    underlying fuel prices have tended to drive seasonal electricity
    prices. Issues related to seasonality and price volatility are
    fairly uniform across the Company’s business segments.

Operations
    Overview

NRG provides support services to the Company’s generation
    facilities to ensure that high-level performance goals are
    developed, best practices are shared and resources are
    appropriately balanced and allocated to maximize results for the
    Company. NRG sets performance goals for equivalent forced outage
    rates, or EFOR, availability, procurement costs, operating
    costs, safety and environmental compliance.

Support services include safety, security, and systems. These
    services also include operations planning and the development
    and dissemination of consistent policies and practices relating
    to plant operations.

To support

Repowering

NRG initiatives, the Company has
    organized its project execution process into one centralized
    group consisting of engineering, procurement and construction,
    or EPC. This group combines regional engineering functions with
    corporate project engineering, project management, procurement
    and construction functions to provide a consistent and
    standardized execution of the repowering initiative. This has
    enabled NRG to leverage both the procurement of major equipment
    as well as outside engineering resources through standardized
    work processes and work packaging. This process has led to
    identifying commonality in major equipment that can be procured
    from Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, as well as
    design processes. As a result, NRG expects to achieve cost
    savings by minimizing the number of outside engineering and
    construction resources, which provide detailed design and
    construction services required to complete projects, in addition
    to and by ensuring a consistent engineering and construction
    approach across all projects.

Environmental
    Capital Expenditures

Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated
    that environmental capital expenditures to be incurred from 2008
    through 2012 to meet NRG’s environmental commitments will
    be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion. These
    capital expenditures, in general, are related to installation of
    particulate,
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury controls to comply with Clean Air Interstate Rule,
    or CAIR, the Clean Air Mercury Rule, or CAMR, and related state
    requirements as well as installation of Best Technology
    Available under the Phase II 316(b) rule. NRG continues to
    explore cost effective alternatives that can achieve desired
    results. The range reflects alternative strategies available
    with respect to the Company’s Indian River plant.

The following table summarizes the upper end of the estimated
    range for major environmental capital expenditures for the
    referenced periods by region:

NRG plans to reduce the impact of a portion of the above
    environmental capital expenditures. NRG has the ability to
    monetize a portion of the Company’s excess allowances over
    the 2008 through 2012 timeframe and still hold sufficient
    allowances to operate the fleet with proposed controls through
    at least 2020. In addition, NRG’s current contracts with
    the Company’s rural electrical customers in the South
    Central region allow for recovery of a significant portion of
    the capital costs, along with a capital return incurred by
    complying with new laws, including interest over the asset life
    of the required expenditures. Actual recoveries will depend,
    among other things, on the duration of the contracts and the
    treatment of these expenditures.



Carbon
    Update

There is a growing consensus in the U.S. and globally that
    GHG emissions are a major cause of global warming. At the
    national level and at various regional and state levels,
    policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions,
    thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to
    create financial incentive to reduce them. In addition, earlier
    this year, the U.S. Supreme Court found that
    CO


,
    the most common GHG, could be regulated as a pollutant and that
    the USEPA should regulate
    CO


emissions from mobile sources. Since power plants, particularly
    coal-fired plants, are a significant source of GHG emissions
    both in the United States and globally, it is almost certain
    that GHG regulatory actions will encompass power plants as well
    as other GHG emitting stationary sources. In 2007, in the course
    of producing approximately 80 million MWh of electricity,
    NRG’s power plants emitted 68 million tonnes of
    CO


,
    of which 61 million tonnes were emitted in the United
    States, 3 million tonnes in Australia and 4 million
    tonnes in Germany.

Federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could
    have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    performance. The actual impact on the Company’s financial
    performance will depend on a number of factors, including the
    overall level of GHG reductions required under any such
    regulations, the price and availability of offsets, and the
    extent to which NRG would be entitled to receive GHG emissions
    allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on
    the open market. For example, the U.S. Senate is currently
    considering climate change legislation sponsored by Senators
    Lieberman and Warner. If legislation with the same level of
    allocations to existing generation resources and emissions
    reductions as those contained in the current version of the
    Lieberman-Warner legislation were enacted, NRG expects that the
    legislation will have a minimal impact on the Company’s
    financial performance through the next decade. Thereafter, under
    such legislation, the impact on NRG would depend on the
    Company’s level of success in developing and deploying low
    and no carbon technologies being pursued as part of our

Repowering

NRG and econrg initiatives. Additionally,
    NRG’s current contracts with its South Central
    region’s cooperative customers allows for the recovery of
    emission-based costs.

State and regional initiatives such as the Regional Greenhouse
    Gas Initiative, or RGGI, in the Northeast, and the Western
    Climate Initiative, or WCI, are developing market-based programs
    to counteract climate change. The RGGI states are in the process
    of promulgating state regulations needed for implementation with
    six of the ten states issuing drafts for comment. With state
    legislation and regulation in place, the first regional auction
    of RGGI allowances needed by power generators could be held as
    early as the summer of 2008. WCI is in the formative stages of
    the regional effort. California has enacted Assembly Bill
    32 — California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006,
    or AB32, which requires the California Air Resources Board to
    develop a GHG reduction program to reduce emissions to 1990
    levels by 2020, a reduction of approximately 25%. This reduction
    program will be phased in beginning 2012 pursuant to regulations
    to be adopted by 2011.

NRG does not expect that implementation of AB32 in California
    will have a significant adverse financial impact on the Company
    for a variety of reasons, including the fact that NRG’s
    California portfolio consists of natural gas-fired peaking
    facilities and will likely be able to pass through any costs of
    purchasing allowances in power prices. However, of the
    approximately 61 million tonnes of
    CO


emitted by NRG in the United States in 2007, approximately
    12 million tonnes were emitted from the Company’s
    generating units in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland,
    Massachusetts and New York that will likely be subject to RGGI
    in 2009. The impact of RGGI on power prices (and thus on the
    Company’s financial performance), indirectly through
    generators seeking to pass through the cost of their
    CO


emissions, cannot be predicted. However, NRG believes that due
    to the absence of any significant allowance allocations under
    RGGI, the direct financial impact on NRG is likely to be
    negative as the Company will incur costs in the course of
    securing the necessary allowances and offsets at auction and in
    the market.

In this regard, the Company has a multifold strategy with
    respect to climate change and related GHG regulation. First, the
    Company is seeking to influence public policy as it emerges at
    various levels of government in order to ensure that such
    legislation is fair and effective in reducing GHG emissions. To
    ensure such effectiveness, NRG believes it is particularly
    important that legislation be supportive of the research,
    development, demonstration and deployment of low and no carbon
    power generation technologies. The Company is carrying out its
    efforts to influence public policy on its own and as part of two
    collective efforts. In July 2007, NRG joined the United States
    Climate Action Partnership, or USCAP, an alliance of major
    businesses and leading climate and environmental



groups which are calling for federal legislation requiring
    significant reductions of GHG emissions. Also in January 2007,
    the Company joined with 46 other global business leaders to
    support a new initiative, Combating Climate Change, or 3C. This
    initiative calls for the global business community to take a
    leadership role in designing the road map to a low carbon
    society.

Second, the Company is actively pursuing investments in new
    generating facilities and technologies that will be highly
    efficient and will employ no and low carbon technologies to
    limit
    CO


emissions and other air emissions through its

Repowering

NRG program. The Company anticipates that these
    investments will result in long-term GHG intensity reductions in
    its generating portfolio. The most notable of these projects in
    terms of the potential impact on the GHG intensity of the
    Company’s portfolio is the 2,700 MW (gross) STP units
    3 and 4 nuclear project in Texas. In addition to the nuclear
    development project, the Company has other low and no GHG
    emitting wind, ’clean’ coal and gas projects under
    active development. The extent to which these projects, and our
    remaining coal projects under development, impact our overall
    carbon exposure will depend on our ability to complete
    development of these projects, the nature and geographic reach
    of any GHG regulation which goes into effect and the extent to
    which the carbon risk associated with our development projects
    are allocated between the Company and any offtakers under power
    purchase agreements or similar arrangements.

Third, the Company is seeking to demonstrate through its econrg
    program the large scale viability of post-combustion carbon
    capture technologies. For example, NRG is working with Powerspan
    Corp, or Powerspan, to deploy a scaled up demonstration of their
    ammonium-based
    ECO


tm

carbon capture technology at the Company’s W.A. Parish
    facility in Texas. The captured
    CO


would be either sequestered or used in enhanced oil recovery
    operations. The Company believes that there may be significant
    commercial opportunity in participating in such a project.

Fourth, the Company is preparing for the commercial operations
    activities which will be required as part of any climate change
    regulatory scheme that is implemented. In May 2007, the Company
    joined the Chicago Climate Exchange, a GHG emissions reduction,
    registry and trading system, as part of the Company’s
    ongoing program to increase its climate change awareness, track
    its
    CO


emissions and address climate change proactively.

Fifth, and finally, the Company has for the past year, and will
    going forward, factor into its capital investment decision
    making process assumptions regarding the costs of complying with
    anticipated GHG regulations. As a result, all decisions with
    respect to acquisitions, repowerings, project development and
    further investment in our existing facilities will be made on
    the assumption that there will be a cost associated with GHG
    emissions in the future.

FORNRG
    Update

For 2007, NRG attained its previously announced target of
    $220 million which includes $11 million of

one-time

benefits. The 2007 results were largely driven by corporate
    initiatives and improved performance of the generating fleet
    particularly in the area of generating capacity, heat rate and
    station service. During 2007, the Company announced the
    acceleration and planned conclusion of the

FOR

NRG 1.0
    program by bringing forward the previously announced 2009 target
    of $250 million in pre tax income improvements to 2008.
    During 2008, the Company will launch the next phase of the
    program under the banner

FOR

NRG 2.0.

RepoweringNRG
    Update

In 2006, NRG announced a comprehensive portfolio redevelopment
    program, referred to as

Repowering

NRG, which involves the
    development, construction and operation of new multi-fuel,
    multi-technology generation capacity at NRG’s existing
    domestic sites to meet the growing demand in the Company’s
    core markets. Through this initiative, the Company anticipates
    retiring certain existing units and adding new generation, with
    an emphasis on new baseload capacity that is expected to be
    supported by long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, and
    financed with limited or non-recourse project financing. NRG
    continues to expect that these repowering investments will
    provide one or more of the following benefits: improved heat
    rates; lower delivered costs; expanded electricity production
    capability; an improved ability to dispatch economically across
    the Merit Order; increased technological and fuel diversity; and
    reduced environmental impacts. The Company anticipates that the

Repowering

NRG program will also result in indirect
    benefits, including the continuation of operations and retention
    of key personnel at its existing facilities.



A critical aspect of the

Repowering

NRG program is the
    extent to which the Company is actively pursuing investments in
    new generating facilities that will be highly efficient and will
    employ no

and/or

low
    carbon technologies to limit
    CO


emissions and other air emissions. The Company anticipates that
    these investments will result in long-term GHG intensity
    reductions in its generating portfolio.

Although NRG believes it is unlikely that the program will be
    fully implemented as originally proposed, the Company expects
    that the overall capital expenditures in connection with the
    program will be substantial. The Company plans to mitigate the
    capital cost of the program through equity partnerships and
    public-private partnerships, as well as through the
    reimbursement of development fees for certain projects. To
    further mitigate the investment risks, NRG anticipates entering
    into long-term PPAs and engineering, procurement and
    construction, or EPC, contracts. In addition, the proposed
    increase in generation capacity and capital costs resulting from

Repowering

NRG could change as proposed projects are
    included or removed from the program due to a number of factors,
    including successfully obtaining required permits, long-term
    PPAs, availability of financing on favorable terms, and
    achieving targeted project returns. The projects that have been
    identified as part of the

Repowering

NRG program are also
    subject to change as NRG refines the program to take into
    account the success rate for completion of projects, changes in
    the targeted minimum return thresholds, and evolving market
    dynamics.

The following is a summary of repowering projects that have
    either been completed and are operating, under construction or
    in certain stages of development. In addition, NRG continues to
    participate in active bids in response to requests for proposals
    in markets in which it operates, particularly in the West and
    Northeast regions.

Plants
    Completed and Operating

Long Beach

— On August 1, 2007, the
    Company successfully completed and commissioned the repowering
    of 260 MW of new gas-fired generating capacity at its Long
    Beach Generating Station. This new generation will provide
    needed support for the summer peak demand to Southern California
    Edison, or SCE, and California Independent System Operator, or
    CAISO. This project is backed by a

10-year

PPA
    executed with SCE in November 2006. The total incremental
    capital cost for the project was approximately $78 million.

Plants
    under Construction

Cedar Bayou Generating Station

— In
    August 2007, NRG Cedar Bayou Development Company LLC, or NRG
    Cedar Bayou, a subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc., and EnergyCo
    Cedar Bayou 4, LLC, or EnergyCo Cedar Bayou, a subsidiary of
    EnergyCo, LLC, which is a joint venture between PNM Resources
    Inc. and a subsidiary of Cascade Investment, LLC, agreed to
    jointly develop, construct, operate and own, on a 50/50
    undivided interest basis, a new 550 MW combined cycle
    natural gas turbine generating plant at NRG’s Cedar Bayou
    Generating Station in Chambers County, Texas.

NRG will also provide various ongoing services related to
    construction management, plant operations and maintenance, and
    use of existing NRG facilities in return for a fixed fee plus
    reimbursement of the Company’s costs.

On July 26, 2007, the Texas Commission on Environmental Air
    Quality, or TCEQ, granted an air permit required for
    construction and operation of the new plant, and on
    August 1, 2007, NRG Cedar Bayou and EnergyCo Cedar Bayou
    entered into an EPC agreement with Zachry Construction
    Corporation to construct the plant which is expected to be
    completed in 2009.

Sherbino Wind Farm

— On February 1,
    2008, NRG, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Padoma Wind
    Power LLC., entered into a fifty percent partnership with BP
    Alternative Energy North America Inc. to build the first phase
    of the Sherbino Wind Farm, a 150 MW wind project. The
    Sherbino I Wind Farm will be located on a more than
    9,000 acre mesa with an elevation of approximately
    3,000 feet above sea level, approximately 40 miles
    east of Fort Stockton in Pecos County, Texas. Initial
    construction of the Sherbino I Wind Farm commenced in November
    2007 and will utilize 50 Vestas V90 3 MW wind turbine
    generators. The project is scheduled to reach commercial
    operations by the end of 2008 with NRG’s 50 percent
    ownership providing a net capacity of 75 MW or the
    equivalent of 25 generators.



Cos Cob —

The Company continues to
    proceed with the repowering project at its Cos Cob site in
    Connecticut, with the construction of 40 MW of peaking
    capacity following the receipt of the siting and air permits.
    The Company anticipates completion and commissioning of the unit
    in the summer of 2008.

STP Units 3 and 4

— On November 30,
    2007, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, accepted the
    Company’s Combined Construction and Operating License
    Application, or COLA, which was filed September 24, 2007,
    together with San Antonio’s CPS Energy and South Texas
    Project Nuclear Operating Company, or STPNOC, to build and
    operate two new nuclear units at the STP nuclear power station
    site. The total rated capacity of the new units, STP units 3 and
    4, will equal or exceed 2,700 MW. The acceptance review
    confirms that the application, the first to be filed with the
    NRC in 29 years, is technically complete and sufficiently
    addresses all necessary subject areas. With the COLA accepted or
    docketed, the NRC begins a comprehensive and detailed review
    process that includes requests for additional information, site
    visits, responses from NRG, public hearings, NRC Environmental
    Impact Statements and NRC Safety Evaluation Reports. The Company
    expects to achieve commercial operation for Unit 3 approximately
    48 months after issuance of the COLA, and commercial
    operation for Units 4 approximately 12 months thereafter.

On October 29, 2007, NRG and the City of San Antonio,
    acting through the City Public Service Board of
    San Antonio, or CPS Energy, entered into an agreement
    whereby the parties agreed to be equal partners in the
    development of the two new units, and, in the event either party
    chooses at any time not to proceed, gives the other party the
    right to proceed with the project on its own. The agreement
    provides for CPS Energy, based on its ownership percentage, to
    reimburse NRG for a pro rata share of project costs NRG has
    incurred, and to pay a pro rata share of future development
    costs.

The Company and STPNOC have also signed a project services
    agreement with Toshiba Corporation, a diversified major Japanese
    manufacturer. Under this agreement, Toshiba will support NRG in
    the design, engineering, construction, and procurement of two
    nuclear reactors. STPNOC and NRG are engaged in continuing
    negotiations with Toshiba and its potential consortium members
    about a definitive EPC agreement. In addition, NRG has also
    reserved for major, long-lead components for the STP expansion
    projects, including the first reactor pressure vessel.

Huntley IGCC

— In December 2006, NRG won
    a conditional award of a power purchase agreement in support of
    the construction of a 600MW IGCC plant in a competitive bid
    process with the New York Power Authority, or NYPA. This plant
    would be built at the Company’s existing Huntley facility.
    The bid included selling capacity and energy to NYPA under a
    long-term PPA. As part of the conditional award, NYPA entered
    into a strategic alliance with NRG to pursue support from
    federal, state and local programs in order to close the
    perceived pricing gap between NRG’s proposal and
    NYPA’s requirements, while preserving the material benefits
    of NRG’s proposal relating to innovative clean coal power
    generation, including
    CO


capture and geologic sequestration plans which the State of New
    York subsequently required as part of the overall award.

Since the announcement of the conditional award, NRG has worked
    with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, or MHI, as a technology
    provider for this project. To date the initial engineering, or
    feasibility study has been completed for the project. The next
    phase includes front-end engineering design, or FEED. During
    this phase, NRG will determine specific design requirements and
    costing for the project, including
    CO


capture. At the same time, NRG and MHI would negotiate the form
    of an EPC agreement. NRG has also completed its detailed
    geological assessment of target sequestration sites which
    indicates that no fatal flaws exist for the long term injection
    and storage of the captured
    CO


.
    NRG is working with the State of New York to build the legal and
    regulatory infrastructure for the injection of the
    CO


and the future responsibility for sequestered carbon.

With respect to the price gap closure initiative, the Company
    has identified existing local and state incentives and programs
    that can effectively close the price gap. It has submitted these
    initiatives to the State, where analysis against the
    State’s budget has begun. NRG expects the State to formally
    respond to the price gap analysis during the first half of 2008.
    Any remaining price gaps will need to be closed through federal
    initiatives and the Company has a federal outreach effort in
    place to address these initiatives in Washington D.C.



The next significant phase of this project, particularly the
    FEED work, will require monthly spending at a level that could
    not be a supported without the State formally approving the
    award. NRG is working with NYPA and the Governor’s staff to
    secure this award before moving to the next phase of the project.

Big Cajun I

— NRG is continuing its
    development efforts to repower the Big Cajun I site with a 207
    net MW circulating fluidized bed boiler, or CFB. NRG has
    signed a memorandum of understanding with potential co-owners
    for approximately 50% of the plants’ capacity and has also
    signed term sheets for long-term PPAs for the remaining 50%. In
    January 2008, the Company received the Title V air permit
    for the project from the Louisiana Department of Environmental
    Quality, or LDEQ, however in February 2008, certain
    environmental advocacy groups initiated a state court proceeding
    to challenge of the LDEQ’s decision to issue the air permit
    and stay the effectiveness of the air permit. NRG believes that
    claims of the environmental advocacy groups are without merit,
    and NRG plans to intervene in the state court proceedings.
    Subject to the favorable resolution of the state court
    proceedings, the project timeline anticipates an engineering and
    construction start date in late 2008.

Connecticut Peakers

— In 2007, the
    Connecticut legislature passed a law that required state
    utilities, and permitted others, to submit plans for new peaking
    generation facilities in Connecticut subject to a regulated

long-term

contract. In the fall of 2007, NRG and United Illuminating
    Company, or UI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of UIL Holding
    Corporation, announced a joint venture to respond to this
    procurement process. NRG and UI subsequently formed GenConn
    Energy LLC as their joint venture vehicle and submitted a joint
    qualification package, as required, on February 1, 2008
    with the Department of Public Utility Control, or DPUC. UI and
    NRG are evaluating the optimal combination of project size and
    locations that might be offered into their proposal. Binding
    bids are due March 3, 2008, with a final decision
    anticipated by June 2008.

econrg
    Update

econrg is a complementary program to

Repowering

NRG.
    econrg seeks to reduce the Company’s carbon intensity
    through the implementation of low and no carbon repowering
    projects and through the investment in and demonstration of
    carbon capture and other environmentally advanced technologies.
    econrg is also focused on increasing environmental awareness,
    the advocacy of sound environmental policy and reducing the
    environmental footprint of the Company, its assets and its
    employees. The following is a summary of the Company’s
    econrg projects.

Commercial
    Scale Carbon Capture and Sequestration
    Demonstration

On November 2, 2007, NRG signed a memorandum of
    understanding with Powerspan Corp., or Powerspan, to jointly
    design, construct, and operate a demonstration facility that
    will be among the largest carbon capture and sequestration
    projects in the world and may be the first to achieve commercial
    scale from an existing coal-fueled power plant. The project will
    be constructed at NRG’s W.A. Parish plant near Sugar Land,
    Texas, and is designed to capture and sequester up to 90% of the
    carbon dioxide from flue gas equal in quantity to that from a
    125 MW unit using Powerspan’s proprietary
    ECO


tm

technology, a post-combustion, regenerative process which uses
    an ammonia-based solution to capture
    CO


from the flue gas and release it in a form that is ready for
    safe transportation and permanent geological storage. The
    CO


from the process would either be sequestered or sold for use in
    enhanced oil recovery projects. The project, which is expected
    to be operational in 2012, will be funded by NRG, potential
    partners and federal and state grants.

Plasma
    Gasification Technology

On April 3, 2007, NRG purchased approximately
    2.2 million shares at CAD$2.25 per share for a 6% interest
    in Alter Nrg Corporation, a Canadian company that provides
    alternative energy solutions using plasma gasification, a
    process that converts carbon-containing materials into synthetic
    gas. As part of the transaction NRG has been granted an
    exclusive license to use Alter Nrg Corporation’s plasma
    torch technology to (i) gasify fossil fuel and biomass in
    power projects in the United States, and (ii) develop other
    gasification projects in the vicinity of existing NRG plants. In
    January 2008, the Company received a qualified approval from the
    Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to convert
    the Somerset, MA facility to a coal and biomass gasification
    power facility.



Regional
    Business Descriptions

NRG is organized into business units, with each of the
    Company’s core regions operating as a separate business
    segment as discussed below.

TEXAS

NRG’s largest business segment is located in Texas and is
    comprised of investments in generation facilities located in the
    physical control areas of the ERCOT market. These assets were
    acquired on February 2, 2006, as part of the acquisition of
    Texas Genco LLC.

Operating
    Strategy

The Company’s business in Texas is comprised of two sets of
    assets: a set of three large solid-fuel baseload plants and a
    set of gas-fired plants located in and around Houston.
    NRG’s operating strategy to maximize value and opportunity
    across these assets is to (i) ensure the availability of
    the baseload plants to fulfill their commercial obligations
    under long-term forward sales contracts already in place,
    (ii) manage the natural gas assets for profitability while
    ensuring the reliability and flexibility of power supply to the
    Houston market, (iii) take advantage of the skill sets and
    market/regulatory knowledge to grow the business through
    incremental capacity uprates and repowering development of
    solid-fuel baseload and gas-fired units, and (iv) play a
    leading role in the development of the ERCOT market by active
    membership and participation in market and regulatory issues.

NRG’s strategy is to sell forward a majority of its
    solid-fuel baseload capacity in the ERCOT market under long-term
    contracts or to enter into hedges by using natural gas as a
    proxy for power prices. Accordingly, the Company’s primary
    focus will be to keep these solid-fuel baseload units running
    efficiently. With respect to gas-fired assets, NRG will continue
    contracting forward a significant portion of gas-fired capacity
    one to two years out while holding a portion for

back-up

in
    case there is an operational issue with one of the baseload
    units and to provide upside for expanding heat rates. For the
    gas-fired capacity sold forward, the Company will offer a range
    of products tailored to our customers needs. For the gas-fired
    capacity that NRG will continue to sell commercially into the
    market, the Company will focus on making this capacity available
    to the market whenever it is economical to run.

The following is a description of NRG’s most significant
    revenue generating plants in the Texas region:

W.A. Parish —

NRG’s W.A. Parish plant
    is one of the largest fossil-fired plants in the United States
    based on total MWs of generation capacity. This plant’s
    power generation units include four coal-fired steam generation
    units with an aggregate generation capacity of 2,460 MW as
    of December 31, 2007. Two of these units are 645/650 MW
    steam units that were placed in commercial service in December
    1977 and December 1978, respectively. The other two units are
    565 MW and 600 MW steam units that were placed in
    commercial service in June 1980 and December 1982, respectively.
    All four units are serviced by two competing railroads that
    diversify NRG’s coal transportation options at competitive
    prices. Each of the four coal-fired units have
    low-NO

x

burners and Selective Catalytic Reductions, or SCRs, installed
    to reduce
    NO

x

emissions and baghouses to reduce particulates. In addition,
    W.A. Parish Unit 8 has a scrubber installed to reduce
    SO


emissions.

Limestone

— NRG’s Limestone plant is
    a lignite and coal-fired plant located approximately
    140 miles northwest of Houston. This plant includes two
    steam generation units with an aggregate generation capacity of
    1,690 MW as of December 31, 2007. The first unit is an
    830 MW steam unit that was placed in commercial service in
    December 1985. The second unit is an 860 MW steam unit that
    was placed in commercial service in December 1986. Limestone
    burns lignite from an adjacent mine, but also burns low sulfur
    coal and petroleum coke. This serves to lower average fuel costs
    by eliminating fuel transportation costs, which can represent up
    to two-thirds of delivered fuel costs for plants of this type.
    Both units have installed
    low-NO

x

burners to reduce
    NO

x

emissions and scrubbers to reduce
    SO


emissions.

NRG owns the mining equipment and facilities and a portion of
    the lignite reserves located at the adjacent mine. Mining
    operations are conducted by Texas Westmoreland Coal Co., a
    single purpose, wholly-owned



subsidiary of Westmoreland Coal Company and the owner of a
    substantial portion of the remaining lignite reserves. The
    contract, entered into August 1999, ended December 31,
    2007. Effective January 1, 2008, NRG entered into an
    agreement with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co. to continue to supply
    lignite from the same surface mine adjacent to the facility for
    a nominal term of ten years with an option for future year
    supply purchases. This is a “cost-plus” arrangement
    under which NRG will pay all of Westmoreland’s agreed upon
    production costs, capital expenditures, and a per ton mark up.
    The annual volume demand is determined by NRG. The agreement
    ensures lignite supply to NRG and confirms NRG’s
    responsibility for the final reclamation at the mine.

South Texas Project Electric Generating
    Station —

STP is one of the newest and
    largest nuclear-powered generation plants in the United States
    based on total megawatts of generation capacity. This plant is
    located approximately 90 miles south of downtown Houston,
    near Bay City, Texas and consists of two generation units each
    representing approximately 1,335 MW of generation capacity.
    STP’s two generation units commenced operations in August
    1988 and June 1989, respectively. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, STP had a zero percent forced outage
    rate and a 97% net capacity factor.

STP is currently owned as a tenancy in common between NRG and
    two other co-owners. NRG owns a 44%, or approximately
    1,175 MW, interest in STP, the City of San Antonio
    owns a 40% interest and the City of Austin owns the remaining
    16% interest. Each co-owner retains its undivided ownership
    interest in the two nuclear-fueled generation units and the
    electrical output from those units. Except for certain plant
    shutdown and decommissioning costs and NRC licensing
    liabilities, NRG is severally liable, but not jointly liable,
    for the expenses and liabilities of STP. The four original
    co-owners of STP organized South Texas Project Nuclear Operating
    Company, or STPNOC, to operate and maintain STP. STPNOC is
    managed by a board of directors composed of one director
    appointed by each of the three co-owners, along with the chief
    executive officer of STPNOC. STPNOC is the NRC-licensed operator
    of STP. No single owner controls STPNOC and most significant
    commercial as well as asset investment decisions for the
    existing units must be approved by two or more owners who
    collectively control more than 60% of the interests.

The two STP generation units operate under licenses granted by
    the NRC that expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively. These
    licenses may be extended for additional

20-year

terms if the project satisfies NRC requirements. Adequate
    provisions exist for long-term

on-site

storage of spent nuclear fuel throughout the remaining life of
    the existing STP plant licenses.

Market
    Framework

The ERCOT market is one of the nation’s largest and fastest
    growing power markets. It represents approximately 85% of the
    demand for power in Texas and covers the whole state, with the
    exception of the far west (El Paso), a large part of the
    Texas Panhandle and two small areas in the eastern part of the
    state. For the past ten years, peak hourly demand in the ERCOT
    market grew at a compound annual rate of 2.5%, compared to a
    compound annual rate of growth of 2.1% in the United States for
    the same period. For 2007, hourly demand ranged from a low of
    21,790 MW to a high of 62,188 MW. ERCOT has limited
    interconnections compared to other markets in the United
    States — currently limited to 1,106 MW of
    generation capacity, and wholesale transactions within the ERCOT
    market are not subject to regulation by the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Any wholesale producer of power
    that qualifies as a power generation company under the Texas
    electric restructuring law and that accesses the ERCOT electric
    power grid is allowed to sell power in the ERCOT market at
    unregulated rates.

The ERCOT market experienced significant construction of new
    generation plants, with over 29,000 MW of new generation
    capacity added to the market since 1996. As of December 31,
    2007, aggregate net generation capacity of approximately
    76,800 MW existed in the ERCOT market, of which 71.7% was
    natural gas-fired. Approximately 20,600 MW, or 26.9%, was
    lower marginal cost generation capacity such as coal, lignite
    and nuclear plants. NRG’s coal and nuclear fuel baseload
    plants represent approximately 5,325 MW gross, or 25.9%, of
    the total solid fuel baseload net generation capacity in the
    ERCOT market. ERCOT has established a target equilibrium reserve
    margin level of approximately 12.5%. The reserve margin for 2007
    was 14.6% forecast to drop to 13.1% for 2008 per ERCOT’s
    latest Capacity Demand and Reserve Report. With the exception of
    wind generation units, there has been very little generation
    that has come online since 2004, and ERCOT projects reserve
    margins to decrease in



2009 primarily due to load growth. Several new projects have
    been announced or are under construction for 2010 and beyond,
    and there are currently plans being considered by the PUCT to
    build a significant amount of transmission from west Texas and
    continuing across the state to enable wind generation to reach
    load. The ultimate impact on the reserve margin and wholesale
    dynamics from these plans are unknown.

In the ERCOT market, buyers and sellers enter into bilateral
    wholesale capacity, power and ancillary services contracts or
    may participate in the centralized ancillary services market,
    including balancing energy, which ERCOT administers. An
    October 1, 2005

“Report on Existing and Potential
    Electric System Constraints and Needs”

found that
    natural gas-fired power plants set the market price of power
    more than 90% of the time in the ERCOT market. As a result of
    NRG’s lower marginal cost for baseload coal and nuclear
    generation assets, the Company expects these ERCOT assets to
    generate power nearly 100% of the time they are available.

The ERCOT market is currently divided into four regions or
    congestion zones, namely: North, Houston, South and West, which
    reflect transmission constraints that are commercially
    significant and which have limits as to the amount of power that
    can flow across zones. NRG’s W.A. Parish plant, STP, and
    all its natural gas-fired plants are located in the Houston
    zone. NRG’s Limestone plant is located in the North zone.

The ERCOT market operates under the reliability standards set by
    the North American Electric Reliability Council, or NERC. The
    PUCT has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure
    the adequacy and reliability of power supply across Texas’s
    main interconnected power transmission grid. ERCOT is
    responsible for facilitating reliable operations of the bulk
    electric power supply system in the ERCOT market. Its
    responsibilities include ensuring that power production and
    delivery are accurately accounted for among the generation
    resources and wholesale buyers and sellers. Unlike power pools
    with independent operators in other regions of the country, the
    ERCOT market is not a centrally dispatched power pool and ERCOT
    does not procure power on behalf of its members other than to
    maintain the reliable operations of the transmission system.
    ERCOT also serves as an agent for procuring ancillary services
    for those who elect not to provide their own ancillary services.

Power sales or purchases from one location to another may be
    constrained by the power transfer capability between locations.
    Under current ERCOT protocol, the commercially significant
    constraints and the transfer capabilities along these paths are
    reassessed every year and congestion costs are directly assigned
    to those parties causing the congestion. This has the potential
    to increase power generators’ exposure to the congestion
    costs associated with transferring power between zones.

The PUCT has adopted a rule directing ERCOT to develop and
    implement a wholesale market design that, among other things,
    includes a day-ahead energy market and replaces the existing
    zonal wholesale market design with a nodal market design that is
    based on locational marginal prices for power. See also,

Regional Regulatory Developments — Texas Region.

One of the stated purposes of the proposed market
    restructuring is to reduce local (intra-zonal) transmission
    congestion costs. The market redesign project is expected to
    take effect in December 2008. NRG expects that implementation of
    any new market design will require modifications to its existing
    procedures and systems. Although NRG does not expect the
    Company’s competitive position in the ERCOT market to be
    materially adversely affected by the proposed market
    restructuring, the Company does not know for certain how the
    planned market restructuring will affect its revenues, and some
    of NRG’s plants in ERCOT may experience adverse pricing
    effects due to their location on the transmission grid.

NORTHEAST

NRG’s second largest asset base is located in the Northeast
    region of the United States and is comprised of investments in
    generation facilities primarily located in the physical control
    areas of NYISO, the ISO-NE and PJM.

Operating
    Strategy

The Northeast region’s strategy is focused on optimizing
    the value of NRG’s broad and varied generation portfolio in
    the three interconnected and actively traded competitive
    markets: the NYISO, the ISO-NE and the PJM. In the Northeast
    markets, load-serving entities generally lack their own
    generation capacity, with much of the generation base aging and
    the current ownership of the generation highly disaggregated.
    Thus, commodity prices are more volatile on an as-delivered
    basis than in other NRG regions due to the distance and
    occasional physical



constraints that impact the delivery of fuel into the region. In
    this environment, NRG seeks both to enhance its ability to be
    the low cost wholesale generator capable of delivering wholesale
    power to load centers within the region from multiple locations
    using multiple fuel sources, and to be properly compensated for
    delivering such wholesale power and related services.

The generation performance by fuel-type for the recent
    three-year period is as shown below:

NRG’s Northeast region assets are located in or near load
    centers and inside chronic transmission constraints such as New
    York City, Southwest Connecticut and the Delmarva Peninsula.
    Assets in these areas tend to attract higher capacity revenues
    and higher energy revenues and thus present opportunities for
    repowering these sites. The Company seeks to enhance the value
    of these sites primarily through the advocacy of capacity market
    reforms that better reflect their locational value. Over the
    past year, the Company has benefited from the introduction of
    more robust capacity market reforms in both the New England
    Power Pool, or NEPOOL, and PJM. The Locational Forward Reserve
    Markets, or LFRM, in the NEPOOL, was effective October 1,
    2006, and the transition capacity payments were effective
    December 1, 2006 with an initial price of $3.05/kw month.
    In all three LFRM auctions to date, the market has cleared at
    the administratively set price of $14/kw month reflecting the
    shortage of peaking generation especially in the Connecticut
    zone. These relatively new markets serve as a prelude to the
    full implementation of the Forward Capacity Market, or FCM,
    which begins June 1, 2010, and for which the first auction
    was conducted in February 2008. PJM’s reliability pricing
    model, or RPM, was effective June 1, 2007 and the Company
    has participated in auctions providing capacity price certainty
    through May 2011.

RMR Agreements

— Several of the Northeast
    region’s Connecticut assets are located in
    transmission-constrained load pockets and have been designated
    as required to be available to ISO-NE to ensure reliability.
    These assets are subject to reliability must-run, or RMR,
    agreements, which are contracts under which NRG agrees to
    maintain its facilities to be available to run when needed, and
    are paid to provide these capability services based on the
    Company’s costs. During 2007, Middletown and Montville were
    covered by an RMR agreement. Unless terminated earlier, these
    agreements will terminate on June 1, 2010 which coincides
    with the commencement of the FCM in NEPOOL. On July 16,
    2007, FERC conditionally accepted, subject to refund, the
    Company’s RMR filing for its Norwalk plant. This RMR was
    retroactive to June 19, 2007, which coincides with the FERC
    decision to eliminate PUSH bidding. The Company is engaged in
    settlement discussions with FERC to determine the actual value
    of the RMR payment this plant should receive. In the
    recently-concluded FCM auction for delivery year 2010/2011, the
    Company sought to de-list Norwalk’s units 1 and 2. ISO-NE
    declined to accept that de-list bid on the grounds these units
    were needed for reliability. Norwalk will likely operate
    pursuant to an RMR agreement after June 1, 2010.

Generation
    Facilities

As of December 31, 2007, NRG’s generation facilities
    in the Northeast region consisted of approximately 6,980 MW
    of generation capacity, including assets located in transmission
    constrained areas, such as New York City —
    1,415 MW, and Southwest Connecticut — 535 MW.

The following is a description of NRG’s most significant
    revenue generating plants in the Northeast region:

Arthur Kill

— NRG’s Arthur Kill plant is a
    natural gas-fired power plant consisting of three units and is
    located on the west side of Staten Island, New York. The plant
    produces an aggregate generation capacity of 865 MW from
    two intermediate load units (Units 20 and 30) and one peak
    load unit (Unit GT-1). Unit 20 produces an aggregate generation
    capacity of 350 MW and was installed in 1959. Unit 30
    produces an aggregate generation capacity of 500 MW and was
    installed in 1969. Both Unit 20 and Unit 30 were converted from
    coal-fired to natural gas-fired facilities in the early 1990s.
    Unit GT-1 produces an aggregate generation capacity of
    15 MW and is activated when ConEd issues a maximum
    generation alarm on hot days and during thunderstorms.

Astoria Gas Turbine

— Located in Astoria,
    Queens, New York, the NRG Astoria Gas Turbine facility occupies
    approximately 15 acres within the greater Astoria
    Generating complex which includes several competing generating
    facilities. NRG’s Astoria Gas Turbine facility has an
    aggregate generation capacity of approximately 550 MW from
    19 operational combustion turbine generators classified into
    three types of turbines. The first group consists of 12
    gas-fired Pratt & Whitney GG-4 Twin Packs in Buildings
    2, 3 and 4, which have a net generation capacity of 145 MW
    per building. The second group consists of Westinghouse
    Industrial Combustion Turbines #191A in Buildings 5, 7 and
    8 that fire on liquid distillate with a net generation capacity
    of approximately 12 MW per building. The third group
    consists of Westinghouse Industrial Gas Turbines #251GG
    located in Buildings 10, 11, 12 and 13 and fired on liquid
    distillate with a net generation capacity of 20 MW per
    building. The Astoria units also supply Black Start Service to
    the NYISO. The site also contains tankage for distillate fuel
    with a capacity of 86,000 barrels.

Dunkirk

— The Dunkirk plant is a coal-fired
    plant located on Lake Erie in Dunkirk, New York. This plant
    produces an aggregate generation capacity of 530 MW from
    four baseload units. Units 1 and 2 produce up to 75 MW each
    and were put in service in 1950, and Units 3 and 4 produce
    approximately 190 MW each and were put in service in 1959
    and 1960, respectively. In the spring of 2006, the plant
    completed changes to switch from eastern bituminous coal to low
    sulfur PRB coal in order to comply with various federal and
    state emissions standards, as well as the New York Department of
    Environmental Conservation, or NYSDEC, settlement referred to in
    the following paragraph.



Huntley

— The Huntley plant is a coal-fired
    plant consisting of six units and is located in Tonawanda,
    New York, approximately three miles north of Buffalo. The
    plant has a net generation capacity of 380 MW from two
    baseload units (Units 67 and 68). Units 67 and 68 generate a net
    capacity of approximately 190 MW each, and were put in
    service in 1957 and 1958, respectively. Units 63 and 64 are
    inactive and were officially retired in May 2006. NRG retired
    Units 65 and 66 effective June 3, 2007 pursuant to a
    settlement agreement reached with NYSDEC in January 2005. Per
    that agreement, NRG will reduce
    NO

x

and
    SO


emissions from the Company’s Huntley and Dunkirk plants
    through 2013 in the aggregate by over 8,090 lbs and 8,690 lbs,
    respectively. A large portion of these reductions will be
    achieved through the use of low sulfur PRB coal and through
    installation of back end control facilities referred to as
    baghouses. Construction of the back end control facilities
    commenced in 2007 and is anticipated to be completed in fall of
    2008 for the Huntley facility and fall of 2009 for the Dunkirk
    facility.

Indian River

— The Indian River Power plant is
    a coal-fired plant located in southern Delaware on a
    1,170 acre site. The plant consists of four coal-fired
    electric steam units, Units 1 through 4 and one 15 MW
    combustion turbine, bringing total plant capacity to
    approximately 740 MW. Units 1 and 2 are each 80 MW of
    capacity and were placed in service in 1957 and 1959,
    respectively. Unit 3 is 155 MW of capacity and was placed
    in service in 1970, while Unit 4 is 410 MW of capacity and
    was placed in service in 1980. Units 3 and 4 are equipped with
    selective non-catalytic reduction systems, for the reduction of
    NO

x

emissions. All four units are equipped with electrostatic
    precipitators to remove fly ash from the flue gases as well as
    low
    NO

x

burners with over fired air to control
    NO

x

emissions. Units 1, 2 and 3 combust eastern bituminous coal,
    while Unit 4 is fueled with low sulfur compliance coal. Pursuant
    to a consent order dated September 25, 2007, between NRG
    and DNREC, NRG agreed to operate the units in a manner that
    would limit the emissions of
    NO

x

,
    SO


and mercury. Further, the Company agreed to mothball unit 2 by
    May 1, 2010, and unit 1 by May 1, 2011, and has
    notified PJM of the plan to mothball these units. In the absence
    of the appropriate control technology installed at this
    facility, Units 3 and 4 totaling approximately 565 MW,
    could not operate beyond December 31, 2011, per terms of
    the consent order.

Market
    Framework

Although each of the three Northeast ISOs and their respective
    energy markets are functionally, administratively and
    operationally independent, they all follow, to a certain extent,
    similar market designs. Each ISO dispatches power plants to meet
    system energy and reliability needs, and settles physical power
    deliveries at Locational Marginal Prices, or LMPs, which reflect
    the value of energy at a specific location at the specific time
    it is delivered. This value is determined by an ISO-administered
    auction process, which evaluates and selects the least costly
    supplier offers or bids to create a reliable and least-cost
    dispatch. The ISO-sponsored LMP energy markets consist of two
    separate and characteristically distinct settlement time frames.
    The first is a financially firm, day-ahead unit commitment
    market. The second is a financially settled, real-time dispatch
    and balancing market. Prices paid in these LMP energy markets,
    however, are affected by, among other things, market mitigation
    measures, which can result in lower prices associated with
    certain generating units that are mitigated because they are
    deemed to have locational market power, and by $1,000/MWh energy
    market price caps that are in place in all three Northeast ISOs.

SOUTH
    CENTRAL

As of December 31, 2007, NRG owned approximately
    2,850 MW of generating capacity in the South Central region
    of the United States. The region lacks a regional transmission
    organization or ISO and, therefore, remains a bilateral market,
    making it less efficient than a region with an ISO-administered
    energy market using large scale economic dispatch, such as the
    Northeast region. NRG operates the LaGen Control Area which
    encompasses the generating facilities and the Company’s
    cooperative load. As a result, the LaGen control area is capable
    of providing control area services, in addition to wholesale
    power, that allows NRG to provide full requirement services to
    load-serving entities, thus making the LaGen Control Area a
    competitive alternative to the integrated utilities operating in
    the region.

Operating
    Strategy

NRG’s South Central region seeks to capitalize on three
    factors: (1) its position as a significant coal-fired
    generator in a market that is highly dependent on natural gas
    for power generation, (2) its long-term contractual and



historical service relationship with eleven rural cooperatives
    around Louisiana, and (3) its ability to make incremental
    wholesale energy sales during periods when its coal-fired
    capacity exceeds the cooperative contract requirements. The
    South Central region works with its cooperative customers to
    expand their and the Company’s customer bases on terms
    advantageous to all parties. The Company also works within the
    confines of the Entergy Transmission System to obtain paths for
    these incremental sales as well as secure transmission service
    for long-term sales or expansions.

The generation performance by fuel-type for the recent
    three-year period is as shown below:

    New Roads, Louisiana, which is referred to as Big Cajun II, and
    also includes the Sterlington, Rockford, Bayou Cove and Big
    Cajun peaking facilities.

Big Cajun II —

NRG’s Big
    Cajun II plant is a coal-fired, sub-critical baseload plant
    located along the banks of the Mississippi River, near Baton
    Rouge, Louisiana. This plant includes three coal-fired
    generation units (Units 1, 2 and 3) with an aggregate
    generation capacity of 1,730 MW as of December 31,
    2007, and generation capacity per unit of 580 MW,
    575 MW and 575 MW, respectively. The plant uses coal
    supplied from the Powder River Basin and was commissioned
    between 1981 and 1983. NRG owns 100% of Units 1 and 2 and a 58%
    undivided interest in Unit 3 for an aggregate owned
    capacity of 1,490 MW of the plant. All three units have
    been upgraded with advanced
    low-NO

x

burners and overfire air systems. The generators on Units 1 and
    3 have been rewound, and the turbine controls on these units
    have been replaced with a modern digital control system. Unit 2
    is scheduled for a generator rewind and turbine controls
    replacement in future years. Additionally, the turbine high and
    intermediate pressure steam path on Unit 3 was replaced with a
    high-efficiency design. Units 1 and 2 are scheduled for similar
    upgrades in future years. These improvements are expected to
    cost approximately $28 million. As part of future CAIR and
    CAMR emission reductions, work is being finalized in the
    evaluation of installation of new environmental equipment

and/or

participation in Cap and Trade as allowed in Louisiana’s
    implementation plan.



Market
    Framework

NRG’s assets in the South Central region are located within
    the franchise territories of vertically integrated utilities,
    primarily Entergy Corp., or Entergy. In the South Central
    region, all power sales and purchases are consummated
    bilaterally between individual counterparties. Transacting
    counterparties are required to procure transmission service from
    the relevant transmission owners at their FERC-approved tariff
    rates.

As of December 31, 2007, NRG had long-term all-requirements
    contracts with eleven Louisiana distribution cooperatives with
    initial terms ranging from five to twenty-five years. The South
    Central region has seven contracts in the region that expire in
    2025, with the remaining four contracts expiring between 2009
    and 2014. In addition, NRG also has certain long-term contracts
    with the Municipal Energy Authority of Mississippi, South
    Mississippi Electric Power Association, and Southwestern
    Electric Power Company, which collectively comprise an
    additional 13% of the region’s contract load requirement.

During limited peak demand periods, the load requirements of
    these contract customers exceed the baseload capacity of
    NRG’s coal-fired Big Cajun II plant. During such peak
    demand periods, NRG typically employs its own gas-fired assets,
    or alternatively purchases power from external sources
    frequently at higher prices than can be recovered under the
    Company’s contracts. As the load of the region’s
    customers grows, the Company can expect this imbalance to
    worsen, unless NRG is successful in renegotiating the terms of
    these long-term contracts or purchasing other low-cost
    generation to meet demand. NRG has been successful in
    negotiating contract modifications with several of the
    region’s long-term cooperative customers, which has
    prevented the addition of large industrial or municipal loads at
    the contract rates. Also, to minimize this risk during the peak
    summer and winter seasons, the Company has been successful in
    entering into structured agreements to reduce or eliminate the
    need for spot market purchases.

WEST

NRG’s portfolio in the West region currently consists of
    the Long Beach Generating Station, the El Segundo Generating
    Station, the Encina Generating Station and Cabrillo II, which
    consists of 12 combustion turbines located in San Diego
    county. In addition, NRG owns a 50% interest in the Saguaro
    power plant located in Nevada. On March 31, 2006, NRG
    purchased Dynegy Inc’s 50% ownership interest in WCP and
    became the sole owner of the WCP assets. On January 3,
    2007, NRG sold the Red Bluff and the Chowchilla II power
    plants to Wayzata Investment Partners LLC.

Operating
    Strategy

NRG’s West region strategy is focused on maximizing the
    cash flow and value associated with its generating plants and
    the development of repowering projects that leverage off of
    existing assets and sites, and the preservation of the
    commercial value of the underlying real estate. There are three
    principal components to this strategy: (1) responding to
    expected market demand, initially in load serving entity RFPs
    and eventually into a capacity market, and (2) using
    existing emission allowances to permit new, more efficient
    generating units at existing sites or siting plants at less
    valuable property and (3) optimizing the value of the
    region’s coastal property for other purposes.

The Company’s Encina Generating Station has sold all energy
    and capacity, 965 MW, in the aggregate, to a load-serving
    entity through 2009, on a tolling basis, and recovers its
    operating costs plus a capacity payment. The tolling agreement
    includes the sale of Resource Adequacy, or RA, capacity and
    consequently the RMR contract with the CAISO on the Encina units
    has been terminated effective December 31, 2007. CAISO and
    Cabrillo Power I, LLC, Encina’s owner, entered into
    dual fuel and black start agreements to supplement the
    availability obligations to the CAISO provided for under the
    tolling agreements. The El Segundo Station has sold all energy
    and capacity, 670 MW, in the aggregate, to a load-serving
    entity through April 30, 2008, on a tolling basis, and
    recovers its operating costs plus a capacity payment. For
    calendar year 2008, the El Segundo station has entered into
    Resource Adequacy, or RA, contracts with multiple load-serving
    entities or power marketers, and a tolling agreement with a
    power marketer for the period May 1, 2008 through
    December 31, 2008, covering 387 MW of the available
    670 MW. Cabrillo II sold 28 MW of RA capacity for
    2008 and 88 MW of RA capacity from January 1, 2009
    through November 30, 2013. To the extent not covered by an
    RA agreement, Cabrillo II’s cost of operations including a



return on investment is covered by an RMR agreement that extends
    through December 31, 2008. It is expected that Cabrillo
    II’s RMR status will be renewed in 2009.

The Saguaro power plant is located in Henderson, Nevada, and is
    contracted to Nevada Power and two steam hosts. The Saguaro
    plant is contracted to Nevada Power through 2022, one steam
    host, referred to as Olin (formerly known as Pioneer), whose
    contract was extended in 2007 for an additional two years, and a
    steam off taker, Ocean Spray, whose contract runs through 2015.
    Saguaro Power Company, LP, the project company, procures fuel in
    the open market. NRG manages its share of any fuel price risk
    through NRG’s commodity price risk strategy.

The following are descriptions of the Company’s most
    significant revenue generating plants in the West region:

Encina —

The Encina Station is located in
    Carlsbad, California and has a combined generating capacity of
    965 MW from five fossil-fuel steam-electric generating
    units and one combustion turbine. The five fossil-fuel
    steam-electric units provide intermediate load services and
    primarily use natural gas but also maintain dual fuel capability
    for use only during gas supply force majeure conditions. Also
    located at the Encina Station is a combustion turbine that
    provides peaking services of 15 MW. Units 1, 2 and 3 each
    have a generation capacity of approximately 107 MW and were
    installed in 1954, 1956 and 1958, respectively. Units 4 and 5
    have a generation capacity of approximately 300 MW and
    330 MW respectively, and were installed in 1973 and 1978.
    The combustion turbine was installed in 1966. Units 1, 2 and 3
    are projected to be retired after 2010. Low
    NO

x

burner modifications and SCR equipment have been installed on
    Units 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

El Segundo —

The El Segundo plant is
    located in El Segundo, California and produces an aggregate
    generation capacity of 670 MW from two gas-fired
    intermediate load units (Units 3 and 4). These units, which have
    a generation capacity of 335 MW each, were installed in
    1964 and 1965, respectively. SCR equipment has been installed on
    Units 3 and 4.

Long Beach —

On August 1, 2007, the
    Company successfully completed and commissioned the repowering
    of 260 MW of new gas-fired generating capacity at its Long
    Beach Generating Station. This new generation provides needed
    support for the summer peak demand to Southern California
    Edison, or SCE, and California Independent System Operator
    systems. This project is backed by a

10-year

PPA
    executed with SCE in November 2006. Total capital spending for
    the project was approximately $78 million.

Cabrillo II —

Cabrillo II consists of
    12 combustion turbines located on 4 sites throughout
    San Diego county with an aggregate generating capacity of
    190 MW. The combustion turbines were installed between 1968
    and 1972 and are operated under a license agreement with
    SDG&E through 2013. The combustion turbines provide peaking
    services and serve a reliability function for the CAISO.

Market
    Framework

NRG’s assets in the West region primarily consist of older,
    higher heat rate, natural gas-fired plants in southern
    California. These plants, while older and less efficient than
    newer combined cycle plants, provide an important



reliability function and were under tolling agreements for 2007.
    CAISO has designated all of the units comprising El Segundo,
    Encina and Cabrillo II to be capacity that meets the local
    capacity procurement requirements of the local load-serving
    entities. At times, all of the plants have been designated as
    RMR, which entitles designated plants to certain fixed-cost
    payments from the CAISO for the right to dispatch those units
    during periods of locational constraints. Although CAISO retains
    the option of renewing units as RMR, the current market
    framework obligates Load Serving Entities to buy a portion of
    their capacity requirements in the local areas where their load
    resides. This local procurement obligation drives in part demand
    for RA or tolling agreements on the units.

California’s investor-owned utilities are sponsoring
    competitive solicitations for new fossil and renewable
    generating capacity. NRG has submitted offers for new generation
    capacity to be constructed at the El Segundo and Encina sites.
    The new projects are in the process of siting permit review by
    the California Energy Commission and their respective regional
    air districts, and are supported by air emissions credits that
    have been banked after the retirement of older generating units.
    While neither project will be constructed without a long-term
    off-take agreement with a credit worthy counter-party, both
    projects have cost and location advantages that enhance their
    competitive prospects.

INTERNATIONAL

As of December 31, 2007, NRG, through certain foreign
    subsidiaries, had investments in power generation projects
    located in Australia, Germany and Brazil with approximately
    1,235 MW of generation capacity. In addition, NRG owns
    interests in coal mines located in Germany. The Company’s
    strategy is to maximize its return on investment and therefore
    concentrates on contract management; monitoring of its facility
    operators to ensure safe, profitable and sustainable operations;
    management of cash flow and finances; and growth of its
    businesses through investments in projects related to current
    businesses.

    announced the sale of the Company’s 37.5% equity interest
    in the Gladstone power station, Gladstone, and NRG subsidiary,
    Gladstone Operating Services, to Transfield Services —
    an Australia-based company, for a purchase price of
    approximately $209 million (AU$239 million), subject
    to customary purchase price adjustments. The members of the
    Gladstone joint venture have withheld consent to NRG’s sale
    of its equity interest in the venture and the transfer of
    NRG’s rights and obligations in the operation and
    maintenance contract. NRG will continue to seek to close the
    transaction in 2008 as agreed or on alternative terms.

Germany —

NRG’s interests in Germany
    include a 50% equity interest in MIBRAG, which mines
    approximately 16 million metric tonnes of lignite per year
    and owns 150 MW of electric generation capacity, and a
    41.9% interest in Schkopau, a 900 MW generating plant
    fueled with lignite from MIBRAG. NRG does not have direct
    operational control of either of these facilities.

Approximately 84% of MIBRAG’s revenues is generated from
    lignite sales. MIBRAG’s generation capacity comprises three
    plants, 33% of their output is used to power MIBRAG’s
    mining operations and the balance is sold, either under a
    contract or at spot, primarily to EnviaM, the local distribution
    utility. NRG, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Saale Energie
    GmbH, or SEG, owns 400 MW of the Schkopau plant’s
    electric capacity which is sold under a long-term contract to
    Vattenfall Europe Generation, AG.



Brazil —

Through its wholly-owned
    subsidiary Tosli Acquisition B.V., or Tosli, a Netherlands
    private limited liability company, NRG owns a 99.2% voting
    equity interest in a 156 MW hydroelectric power plant
    through Itiquira Energetica S.A., or ITISA, which is located in
    the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. On December 18, 2007, NRG
    entered into a sale and purchase agreement to sell its 100%
    interest in Tosli to Brookfield Power Inc., a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management Inc., a Canadian asset
    management company, focused on property, power and
    infrastructure assets, for a purchase price of approximately
    $288 million, plus the assumption of approximately
    $60 million in debt. The sale is subject to the receipt of
    regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. NRG
    anticipates completion of the sale transaction during first half
    2008 and as discussed in Item 3 — Note 3,

Discontinued Operations

, the activities of Tosli and
    ITISA have been classified as discontinued operations.

THERMAL

Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NRG Thermal LLC, or NRG
    Thermal, the Company owns thermal and chilled water businesses
    that have a steam and chilled water capacity of approximately
    1,040 megawatts thermal equivalent, or MWt. As of
    December 31, 2007, NRG Thermal provided steam heating to
    approximately 525 customers and chilled water to 100 customers
    in five cities in the United States. The Company’s thermal
    businesses in Pittsburgh, Harrisburg and San Francisco are
    regulated by their respective state Public Utility Commission.
    The other thermal businesses are subject to contract terms with
    their customers. In addition, NRG Thermal owns and operates a
    thermal project that serves an industrial customer with
    high-pressure steam. NRG Thermal also owns an 88 MW
    combustion turbine peaking generation facility and a 16 MW
    coal-fired cogeneration facility in Dover, Delaware as well as a
    12 MW gas-fired project in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
    Approximately 36% of NRG Thermal’s revenues are derived
    from its district heating and chilled water business in
    Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Regulatory
    Matters

As operators of power plants and participants in wholesale
    energy markets, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation
    by various federal and state government agencies. These include
    CFTC, FERC, NRC, PUCT and other public utility commissions in
    certain states where NRG’s generating assets are located.
    In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures, and
    protocols of the various ISO markets in which it participates.

The operations of, and wholesale electric sales from, NRG’s
    Texas region are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they
    are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in
    interstate commerce. As discussed below, these operations are
    subject to regulation by PUCT, as well as to regulation by the
    NRC with respect to the Company’s ownership interest in STP.

Commodities
    Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC

CFTC, among other things, has regulatory oversight authority
    over the trading of electricity and gas commodities, including
    financial products and derivatives, under the Commodity Exchange
    Act, or CEA. Specifically, under existing statutory authority,
    CFTC has the authority to commence enforcement actions and seek
    injunctive relief against any person, whenever that person
    appears to be engaged in the communication of false or
    misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market
    information or conditions that affected or tended to affect the
    price of natural gas, a commodity in interstate commerce, or
    actions intended to or attempting to manipulate commodity
    markets. CFTC also has the authority to seek civil monetary
    penalties, as well as the ability to make referrals to the
    Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, in connection
    with any conduct that violates the CEA. Proposals are pending in
    Congress to expand CFTC oversight of the over-the-counter
    markets and bilateral financial transactions.

Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission

FERC, among other things, regulates the transmission and the
    wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the
    authority of the Federal Power Act, or FPA. In addition, under
    existing regulations, FERC determines whether an entity owning a
    generation facility is an Exempt Wholesale Generator, or EWG, as
    defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, or
    PUHCA of 2005. FERC also determines whether a



generation facility meets the ownership and technical criteria
    of a Qualifying Facility, or QF, under Public Utility Regulatory
    Policies Act of 1978, or PURPA. Each of NRG’s
    U.S. generating facilities has either been determined by
    FERC to qualify as a QF, or the subsidiary owning the facility
    has been determined to be a EWG.

Federal Power Act —

The FPA gives FERC
    exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over the wholesale sale of
    electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate
    commerce. Under the FPA, FERC, with certain exceptions,
    regulates the owners of facilities used for the wholesale sale
    of electricity or transmission in interstate commerce as public
    utilities. The FPA also gives FERC jurisdiction to review
    certain transactions and numerous other activities of public
    utilities. NRG’s QFs are currently exempt from FERC’s
    rate regulation under Sections 205 and 206 of the FPA to
    the extent that sales are made pursuant to a state regulatory
    authority’s implementation of PURPA.

Public utilities under the FPA are required to obtain
    FERC’s acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA,
    of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity.
    All of NRG’s non-QF generating and power marketing
    companies in the United States make sales of electricity
    pursuant to market-based rates authorized by FERC. FERC’s
    orders that grant NRG’s generating and power marketing
    companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to
    revoke or revise that authority if FERC subsequently determines
    that NRG can exercise market power, create barriers to entry, or
    engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition,
    NRG’s market-based sales are subject to certain market
    behavior rules and, if any of its generating or power marketing
    companies were deemed to have violated any one of those rules,
    they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits
    associated with the violation

and/or

suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority,
    as well as criminal and civil penalties. As a condition to the
    orders granting NRG market-based rate authority, every three
    years NRG is required to file a market update to demonstrate
    that it continues to meet FERC’s standards with respect to
    generating market power and other criteria used to evaluate
    whether its entities qualify for market-based rates. NRG is also
    required to report to FERC any material changes in status that
    would reflect a departure from the characteristics that FERC
    relied upon when granting NRG’s various generating and
    power marketing companies market-based rates. If NRG’s
    generating and power marketing companies were to lose their
    market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to
    obtain FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule
    and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and
    reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with
    cost-based rate schedules.

NRG filed the most recent triennial update of its market power
    analysis on March 26, 2007, and this filing was accepted by
    FERC on August 9, 2007. On June 21, 2007, FERC issued
    its long-awaited final rule on market-based rates for wholesale
    sales of electric energy, capacity, and ancillary services. Of
    particular note to NRG, the new rule now requires applicants to
    use submarkets within an RTO region as the relevant geographic
    market, specifically identifying Southwest Connecticut (and the
    Connecticut Import interface), New York City, and PJM East as
    such submarkets. The impact of this rule, and any additional
    mitigation that may be imposed by FERC as a result of a
    determination of market power in a submarket, cannot be
    determined at this time.

Section 203 of the FPA requires FERC’s prior approval
    for the transfer of control of assets subject to FERC’s
    jurisdiction. Section 204 of the FPA gives FERC
    jurisdiction over a public utility’s issuance of securities
    or assumption of liabilities. However, FERC typically grants
    blanket approval for future securities issuances and the
    assumption of liabilities to entities with market-based rate
    authority. In the event that one of NRG’s generating and
    power marketing companies were to lose its market-based rate
    authority, such company’s future securities issuances or
    assumption of liabilities could require prior approval from FERC.

In compliance with Section 215 of the Energy Policy Act of
    2005, or EPAct of 2005, FERC has approved the North American
    Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, as the National
    Energy Reliability Organization, or ERO. As the ERO, NERC is
    responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory
    reliability standards for the wholesale electric power system.
    NRG is responsible for complying with the standards in the
    regions in which it operates. As the ERO, NERC has the ability
    to assess financial penalties for non-compliance. In addition to
    complying with NERC requirements, each NRG entity must comply
    with the requirements of the regional reliability council for
    the region in which it is located.

Public Utility Holding Company Act of
    2005 —

PUHCA of 2005 provides FERC with
    certain authority over and access to books and records of public
    utility holding companies not otherwise exempt by virtue of
    their ownership of EWGs, QFs, and Foreign Utility Companies, or
    FUCOs. NRG is a public utility holding company, but



because all of the Company’s generating facilities have QF
    status or are owned through EWGs, it is exempt from the
    accounting, record retention, and reporting requirements of
    PUHCA.

Public Utility Regulatory Policies
    Act —

PURPA was passed in 1978 in large part
    to promote increased energy efficiency and development of
    independent power producers. PURPA created QFs to further both
    goals, and FERC is primarily charged with administering PURPA as
    it applies to QFs. As discussed above, under current law, some
    categories of QFs may be exempt from regulation under the FPA as
    public utilities. PURPA incentives also initially included a
    requirement that utilities must buy and sell power to QFs. Among
    other things, EPAct of 2005 provides for the elimination of the
    obligation imposed on certain utilities to purchase power from
    QFs at an avoided cost rate under certain conditions. However,
    the purchase obligation is only eliminated if FERC first finds
    that a QF has non-discriminatory access to wholesale energy
    markets having certain characteristics, including
    nondiscriminatory transmission and interconnection services
    provided by a regional transmission entity in certain
    circumstances. Existing contracts entered into under PURPA are
    not expected to be impacted. NRG currently owns only one QF,
    Saguaro Power Company, a Limited Partnership, which is
    interconnected to and has a contact with Nevada Power Company.
    Nevada Power Company is not located in a region with an ISO
    market.

Nuclear
    Regulatory Commission, or NRC

The NRC is authorized under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
    amended, or the AEA, among other things, to grant licenses for,
    and regulate the operation of, commercial nuclear power
    reactors. As a holder of an ownership interest in STP, NRG is an
    NRC licensee and is subject to NRC regulation. The NRC license
    gives the Company the right to only possess an interest in STP
    but not to operate it. Operating authority under the NRC
    operating license for STP is held by STPNOC. NRC regulation
    involves licensing, inspection, enforcement, testing,
    evaluation, and modification of all aspects of plant design and
    operation including the right to order a plant shutdown,
    technical and financial qualifications, and decommissioning
    funding assurance in light of NRC safety and environmental
    requirements. In addition, NRC’s written approval is
    required prior to a licensee transferring an interest in its
    license, either directly or indirectly. As a possession-only
    licensee, i.e., non-operating co-owner, the NRC’s
    regulation of NRG is primarily focused on the Company’s
    ability to meet its financial and decommissioning funding
    assurance obligations. In connection with the NRC license, the
    Company and its subsidiaries have a support agreement to provide
    up to $120 million to support operations at STP.

Decommissioning Trusts

− Upon expiration of
    the operation licenses for the two generating units at STP,
    currently scheduled for 2027 and 2028, the co-owners of STP are
    required under federal law to decontaminate and decommission the
    STP facility. Under NRC regulations, a power reactor licensee
    generally must pre-fund the full amount of its estimated NRC
    decommissioning obligations unless it is a rate-regulated
    utility, or a state or municipal entity that sets its own rates,
    or has the benefit of a state-mandated non-bypassable charge
    available to periodically fund the decommissioning trust such
    that the trust, plus allowable earnings, will equal the
    estimated decommissioning obligations by the time the
    decommissioning is expected to begin.

As a result of the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, NRG through
    its 44% ownership interest has become the beneficiary of
    decommissioning trusts that have been established to provide
    funding for decontamination and decommissioning of STP.
    CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, or CenterPoint, and
    American Electric Power, or AEP, collect, through rates or other
    authorized charges to their electric utility customers, amounts
    designated for funding NRG’s portion of the decommissioning
    of the facility.

In the event that the funds from the trusts are ultimately
    determined to be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities,
    the original owners of the Company’s STP interests,
    CenterPoint and AEP, each will be required to collect, through
    their PUCT-authorized non-bypassable rates or other charges to
    customers, additional amounts required to fund NRG’s
    obligations relating to the decommissioning of the facility.
    Following the completion of the decommissioning, if surplus
    funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, those excesses will
    be refunded to the respective rate payers of CenterPoint or AEP,
    or their successors.

Public
    Utility Commission of Texas, or PUCT

NRG’s Texas generation subsidiaries are registered as power
    generation companies with PUCT. The companies within the Texas
    region are also regulated as a Qualified Scheduling Entity. PUCT
    also has jurisdiction over



power generation companies with regard to their sales in the
    wholesale markets, the implementation of measures to address
    undue market power or price volatility, and the administration
    of nuclear decommissioning trusts. The PUCT exercises its
    jurisdiction both directly, and indirectly, through its
    oversight of ERCOT, the regional transmission organization. NRG
    Power Marketing LLC, or PMI, is registered as a power marketer
    with the PUCT and thus is also subject to the jurisdiction of
    the PUCT with respect to its sales in ERCOT.

Regional
    Regulatory Developments

In New England, New York, the Mid-Atlantic region, the Midwest
    and California, FERC has approved regional transmission
    organizations, also commonly referred to as independent system
    operators, or ISOs. Most of these ISOs administer a wholesale
    centralized bid-based spot market in their regions pursuant to
    tariffs approved by FERC and associated ISO market rules. These
    tariffs/market rules dictate how the capacity and energy markets
    operate, how market participants may make bilateral sales with
    one another, and how entities with market-based rates are
    compensated within those markets. The ISOs in these regions also
    control access to and the operation of the transmission grid
    within their regions. In Texas, pursuant to a 1999 restructuring
    statute, the PUCT granted similar responsibilities to ERCOT.

NRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO
    regions. The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power
    markets have in the past imposed, and may in the future continue
    to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms to address
    market power or volatility in these markets. These types of
    price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may adversely
    affect the profitability of NRG’s generation facilities
    that sell capacity and energy into the wholesale power markets.
    In addition, new approaches to the sale of electric power are
    being implemented, and it is not clear whether they will operate
    effectively or whether they will provide adequate compensation
    to generators over the long-term.

Texas
    Region

ERCOT has adopted “Texas Nodal Protocols” that will
    revise the wholesale market design to incorporate locational
    marginal pricing (in place of the current ERCOT zonal market).
    Major elements of the Texas Nodal Protocols include the
    continued capability for bilateral contracting of energy and
    ancillary services, a financially binding day-ahead market,
    resource-specific energy and ancillary service bid curves, the
    direct assignment of all congestion rents, nodal energy prices
    for resources, aggregation of nodal to zonal energy prices for
    loads, congestion revenue rights (including pre-assignment for
    public power entities), and pricing safeguards. The PUCT
    approved the Texas Nodal Protocols on April 5, 2006, and
    full implementation of the new market design is expected in
    December 2008. In other rulemakings, the PUCT has expanded its
    enforcement policy, increased market oversight, and established
    market and generator-specific data disclosure requirements
    designed to increase market transparency.

Northeast
    Region

New England —

NRG’s Middletown and
    Montville facilities continue to be operated pursuant to RMR
    agreements that were accepted by the Commission on
    February 1, 2006 (effective January 1, 2006). Unless
    terminated earlier, the Middletown and Montville RMR agreements
    will terminate upon the commencement of the Forward Capacity
    Market, or FCM, as discussed below. The Devon RMR Agreement
    terminated on December 31, 2006. On July 16, 2007,
    FERC conditionally accepted, subject to refund, an RMR agreement
    filed on April 26, 2007 by Norwalk Power for its units 1
    and 2, specifying a June 19, 2007 effective date.
    Norwalk’s RMR rate, as well as its eligibility for the RMR
    agreement determined based upon the facility’s projected
    market revenues and costs, are subject to further proceedings.
    Norwalk filed for the RMR agreement in response to FERC’s
    order eliminating the Peaking Unit Safe Harbor bidding mechanism
    which took effect on June 19, 2007. In the
    recently-concluded FCM auction for delivery year 2010/2011, the
    Company sought to de-list Norwalk’s units 1 and 2. ISO-NE
    declined to accept that de-list bid on the grounds these units
    were needed for reliability. Norwalk will likely operate
    pursuant to an RMR agreement after June 1, 2010.

On December 28, 2006, the Attorneys General of the State of
    Connecticut and Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed in the U.S.
    Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit an appeal of the FERC
    orders accepting



the settlement of the New England capacity market design. The
    settlement, filed March 7, 2006, by a broad group of New
    England market participants, provides for interim capacity
    transition payments for all generators in New England for
    the period starting December 1, 2006 through May 31,
    2010, and the establishment of a FCM commencing May 31,
    2010. On June 16, 2006, FERC issued an order accepting the
    settlement, which was reaffirmed on rehearing by order dated
    October 31, 2006. Interim capacity transition payments
    provided for under the FCM settlement commenced December 1,
    2006, as scheduled. The first FCM auction for the 2010/2011
    delivery year was concluded on February 6, 2008, and
    bidding reached the minimum floor price of $4.50 per kW-month. A
    successful appeal by the Attorneys General could disturb the
    settlement and create a refund obligation of interim capacity
    transition payments. Oral arguments were held on
    February 14, 2008.

New York —

On July 6, 2007, FERC
    issued an order establishing an approximately six-month paper
    hearing process to address reforms to the in-city Installed
    Capacity, or ICAP, market and to formulate comprehensive
    solutions. On October 4, 2007, the NYISO filed its proposal
    for revisions to the ICAP market for the New York City zone.
    While the NYISO’s proposal will retain the existing ICAP
    market structure, it will impose additional market power
    mitigation on the current owners of Consolidated Edison’s
    divested generation units in New York City (which include
    NRG’s Arthur Kill and Astoria facilities) who are deemed to
    be pivotal suppliers. Specifically, the NYISO proposal will
    impose a reference price on pivotal suppliers and require bids
    to be submitted at or below the reference price. The reference
    price will be the expected clearing price based upon the
    intersection of the supply curve and the ICAP Demand Curve if
    all suppliers bid as price-takers. The NYISO proposal is
    expected to result in a significant decrease in the clearing
    price for New York City ICAP. Earlier this year, FERC had
    rejected proposed mitigation that would have effectively lowered
    the capacity offer cap for those units from $105/kW-year to
    $82/kW-year. Although that proposal was rejected on
    March 6, 2007, FERC initiated an investigation to determine
    the justness and reasonableness of the NYISO’s in-city
    installed capacity market, setting a refund effective date of
    May 12, 2007. The NYISO’s October 4, 2007, filing
    proposes that any market reforms should be implemented only
    prospectively and that no refunds should be required.

The state-wide Installed Reserve Margin, or IRM, is set annually
    by the New York State Reliability Council, or NYSRC, and affects
    the overall demand for capacity in the New York market. On
    December 14, 2007, the NYSRC approved a 2008 IRM of 15%,
    which is a reduction of 1.5% from last year’s requirement
    and effectively offsets any increased demand for capacity that
    would have occurred due to load growth. Additionally, on
    January 29, 2008, FERC accepted the NYISO’s installed
    capacity demand curves for 2008/2009, 2009/2010, and 2010/2011.
    The demand curves serve as a critical determinant of capacity
    market prices, and if approved, would potentially increase
    prices slightly in the rest-of-state market while reducing
    prices below their current levels in the New York City market
    for the next two years, all other factors remaining constant.

PJM —

On December 22, 2006, FERC issued an
    order approving the settlement agreement filed
    September 29, 2006, in the Reliability Pricing Model, or
    RPM, proceeding establishing a new capacity market mechanism,
    the key components of which include the determination of
    capacity prices through use of a downward-sloping demand curve,
    locational pricing, and a forward capacity market. PJM has
    conducted the RPM auctions for the 2007/2008, 2008/2009,
    2009/2010, and 2010/2011 delivery years, and has been operating
    under the RPM since June 1, 2007. Several parties, however,
    have appealed the FERC’s order accepting the settlement. A
    successful appeal could potentially disrupt RPM implementation
    and create a refund obligation. On January 31, 2008, PJM
    submitted to FERC a proposal to increase its Cost of New Entry,
    which is a critical component of the demand curve in the RPM
    market, for the 2011/2012 delivery year. PJM’s proposed
    increase is opposed by consumer interests.

South
    Central Region

Entergy has begun to implement its Independent Coordinator of
    Transmission, or ICT, proposal that will provide
    (i) independent oversight over the operations of the
    Entergy transmission system, including the processing of
    interconnection and transmission requests; (ii) a new
    process and standard for assigning cost responsibility for
    transmission upgrades; and (iii) a new weekly procurement
    process that will allow both Entergy and NRG, as a purchaser of
    power, to more efficiently utilize the transmission system. The
    Southwest Power Pool has been selected as the ICT and began
    performing its responsibilities in November 2006.



Entergy’s ICT proposal will impact the region’s
    existing operations by revising the manner in which transmission
    service is obtained. Compounding the uncertainty caused by the
    transition to the ICT, FERC has promulgated new regulations with
    respect to its pro-forma open access transmission tariff,
    referred to as Order No. 890, that may affect South
    Central’s ability to transmit, and thus buy and sell, power.

West
    Region

California has transitioned to a market structure where
    load-serving entities, or LSEs, have an obligation to procure a
    portion of their Resource Adequacy, or RA, capacity requirements
    in transmission-constrained areas. All of NRG’s California
    assets operate in one or more of these constrained areas. This
    local procurement obligation is leading to a phase-out of RMR
    agreements with the CAISO, although CAISO retains the option of
    renewing RMR agreements as necessary to maintain local
    reliability. During 2008, only Cabrillo Power II LLC will
    be operating under an RMR agreement, and only for ten of its
    twelve peaking units. Cabrillo Power I LLC’s Encina
    facility terminated its RMR agreement with CAISO effective
    December 31, 2007. Please see the

Regional Business
    Description

for a discussion of the contracting activities
    that have occurred on the units pursuant to the state’s RA
    program.

There is no organized capacity market in California. As noted
    above, the CPUC has imposed local capacity requirements on
    load-serving entities but the application of this Resource
    Adequacy Capacity Product obligation is uneven. On
    December 20, 2007, FERC ordered the CAISO to extend its
    Reliability Capacity Services Tariff, which was set to expire on
    December 31, 2007, until the implementation of the
    CAISO’s Market Redesign and Technology Upgrade, or MRTU, or
    an alternate backstop capacity procurement mechanism, and
    initiated an investigation into the justness and reasonableness
    of the existing capacity procurement process. It is unclear what
    compensation will be provided to generators needed for
    reliability purposes. In addition, several generators, including
    El Segundo Power, LLC, filed a complaint at FERC on
    November 30, 2007, similarly seeking just and reasonable
    compensation for the value of capacity-related reliability
    services.

On September 21, 2006, FERC conditionally accepted the MRTU
    proposal which is currently scheduled to go into effect during
    2008. Significant components of the MRTU include
    (i) locational marginal pricing of energy; (ii) a more
    effective congestion management system; (iii) a day-ahead
    market; and (iv) an increase to the existing bid caps. NRG
    considers these market reforms to be a positive development for
    its assets in the region. Several parties have appealed
    FERC’s orders accepting the MRTU proposal, seeking to
    materially modify the proposal

and/or

delay
    its implementation.

Environmental
    Matters

NRG is subject to a wide range of environmental regulations
    across a broad number of jurisdictions in the development,
    ownership, construction and operation of domestic and
    international projects. These laws and regulations generally
    require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained
    before construction and during operation of power plants.
    Environmental laws have become increasingly stringent in recent
    years, especially around the regulation of air emissions from
    power generators. Such laws generally require regular capital
    expenditures for power plant upgrades, modifications and the
    installation of certain pollution control equipment. In general,
    future laws and regulations are expected to require the addition
    of emission controls or other environmental quality equipment or
    the imposition of certain restrictions on the operations of the
    Company’s facilities. NRG expects that future liability
    under, or compliance with, environmental requirements could have
    a material effect on the Company’s operations or
    competitive position.

Federal
    Environmental Initiatives

Air

— On May 18, 2005, the U.S
    Environmental Protection Authority, or USEPA, published the
    Clean Air Mercury Rule, or CAMR, to permanently cap and reduce
    mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. CAMR imposes



limits on mercury emissions from new and existing coal-fired
    plants and creates a market-based

cap-and-trade

program that will reduce nationwide utility emissions of mercury
    in two phases, 2010 and 2018. The rule was challenged by New
    Jersey and ten other states. On February 8, 2008, the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated
    USEPA’s rule delisting coal- and oil-fired electric
    generating units from regulation under CAA §112 (the
    “Delisting Rule”) and CAMR. More specifically, cap and
    trade, allowing power plants to meet emission targets by buying
    credits, was struck. The three-judge panel agreed with the
    states that challenged the rule that the USEPA did not have the
    authority to exempt power plants. Certain states in which NRG
    operates coal plants, such as Delaware, Massachusetts and New
    York adopted state implementation plans which did not permit
    trading in lieu of the CAMR federal implementation plan. Texas
    and Louisiana adopted the federal CAMR through the state
    implementation plan, or SIP process. USEPA has already approved
    the Louisiana SIP, but Texas has not yet been approved. At this
    time, it is unclear how programs in these states will be
    affected by the Court’s actions.

On May 12, 2005, the USEPA published the Clean Air
    Interstate Rule, or CAIR. This rule applies to 28 eastern states
    and the District of Columbia, or D.C., and caps both
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions from power plants in two phases; 2010 and 2015 for
    SO


and 2009 and 2015 for
    NO

x

.
    CAIR will apply to some of the Company’s power plants in
    New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana,
    Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Texas. On August 24,
    2005, the USEPA published a proposed FIP to ensure that
    generators affected by CAIR reduce emissions on schedule.
    Furthermore: (i) on December 20, 2005, the USEPA signed
    proposed revisions to address attainment for fine particulates,
    or NAAQS for PM2.5, which will require affected states to
    implement further rules to address
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions; and (ii) on November 9, 2005, the USEPA proposed
    the second phase of the 8-hour ozone NAAQS rule relating to
    NO

x

emissions. A number of environmental groups, states and industry
    organizations challenged aspects of CAIR. The challenges were
    consolidated into

South Coast Air Quality Management
    District v. EPA.

In a ruling on December 22, 2006,
    the D.C. Circuit overturned portions of USEPA’s Phase I
    implementation rule for the new 8-hour ozone standard.
    Specifically, the court ruled that USEPA could revoke the 1-hour
    standard as long as there was no backsliding from more stringent
    control measures. This ruling could result in the imposition of
    fees under Section 185 of the Clean Air Act, or the CAA, on
    volatile organic carbon, or VOC, and
    NO

x

emissions in severe non-attainment areas. The fees could be as
    high as $7,700/ton for emissions above 80% of baseline emissions
    levels. Depending on the determination of baseline emission
    levels, this could materially impact NRG’s operations in
    California, New York City and Texas.

The clean air visibility rule was published by the USEPA on
    July 6, 2005. The rule requires regional haze controls by
    targeting
    SO


and
    NO

x

emissions from sources including power plants of a certain
    vintage through the installation of Best Available Retrofit
    Technology, or BART, in certain cases. States were required to
    develop implementation plans by December 2007. Most of the
    Company’s facilities will likely be able to satisfy their
    obligations under the BART rule through compliance with the more
    stringent CAIR. Accordingly, no material additional expenditures
    are anticipated by the Company beyond those required by CAIR.

In the 1990s, the USEPA commenced an industry-wide investigation
    of coal-fired electric generators to determine compliance with
    environmental requirements under the CAA associated with
    repairs, maintenance, modifications and operational changes made
    to facilities over the years. As a result, the USEPA and several
    states filed suits against a number of coal-fired power plants
    in mid-western and southern states alleging violations of the
    CAA New Source Review, or NSR, and Prevention of Significant
    Deterioration, or PSD, requirements. The USEPA has issued an NOV
    against NRG’s Big Cajun II plant alleging that
    NRG’s predecessors had undertaken projects that triggered
    requirements under the PSD program, including the installation
    of emission controls. NRG has evaluated the claims and believes
    they have no merit. Nonetheless, NRG has had discussions with
    the USEPA about resolving the claims. See the South Central
    region below for a further discussion.

There is a growing consensus in the U.S. and globally that
    GHG emissions are a major cause of global warming. At the
    national level and at various regional and state levels,
    policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions,
    thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to
    create financial incentives to reduce them. In addition, earlier
    this year, the U.S. Supreme Court found that
    CO


,
    the most common GHG, could be regulated as a pollutant and that
    the USEPA should regulate
    CO


emissions from mobile sources. Since power plants, particularly
    coal-fired plants, are a significant source of GHG emissions
    both in the United States and globally, it is almost certain
    that GHG regulatory actions will encompass power plants as well
    as other GHG emitting stationary sources. In 2007, in the course
    of producing approximately 80 million MWh of electricity,



NRG’s power plants emitted 68 million tonnes of
    CO


,
    of which 61 million tonnes were emitted in the United
    States, 3 million tonnes in Australia and 4 million
    tonnes in Germany.

Federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could
    have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    performance. The actual impact on the Company’s financial
    performance will depend on a number of factors, including the
    overall level of GHG reductions required under any such
    regulations, the price and availability of offsets, and the
    extent to which NRG would be entitled to receive GHG emissions
    allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on
    the open market. For example, the U.S. Senate is currently
    considering climate change legislation sponsored by Senators
    Lieberman and Warner. If legislation with the same level of
    allocations to existing generation resources and emissions
    reductions as those contained in the current version of the
    Lieberman-Warner legislation were enacted, NRG expects that the
    legislation will have minimal impact on the Company’s
    financial performance through the next decade. Thereafter, under
    such legislation as currently drafted, the impact on NRG would
    depend on the Company’s level of success in developing and
    deploying low and no carbon technologies being pursued as part
    of our

Repowering

NRG and econrg initiatives.

Water

— In July 2004, the USEPA published
    rules governing cooling water intake structures at existing
    power facilities commonly referred to as the Phase II
    316(b) rules. These rules specify standards for cooling water
    intake structures at existing power plants using the largest
    amounts of cooling water. These rules will require
    implementation of the Best Technology Available, or BTA, for
    minimizing adverse environmental impacts unless a facility shows
    that such standards would result in very high costs or little
    environmental benefit. On January 25, 2007, the

2nd Circuit Court of Appeals

made its decision in
    the

Riverkeeper vs. USEPA

appeal over the Phase II
    316(b) regulation. Riverkeeper prevailed on nearly all issues
    and the decision essentially remands all of the important
    aspects of the rule back to the USEPA for reconsideration and
    restricted their ability to allow generators to substitute
    mitigation for aquatic specie losses through habitat restoration
    or other measures. In July 2007, the USEPA suspended the rule,
    except for the requirement that permitting agencies develop best
    professional judgment controls for existing facility cooling
    water intake structures that reflect the best technology
    available for minimizing adverse environmental impact. The
    Phase II 316(b) rule affects a number of NRG’s plants,
    specifically those with once-through cooling systems. While NRG
    has included the capital costs associated with the rule within
    the Company’s estimated environmental capital expenditures
    based on good faith estimates, until consultations on the plans
    have occurred with USEPA or its delegated state or regional
    agencies, and the USEPA has concluded its reconsideration of the
    Phase II 316(b) rules, it is not possible to estimate with
    certainty the capital costs that will be required for compliance
    with the Phase II 316(b) rules.

Nuclear Waste

— Under the U.S. Nuclear
    Waste Policy Act of 1982, the federal government must remove and
    ultimately dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level
    radioactive waste from nuclear plants. Consistent with the Act,
    owners of nuclear plants, including the owners of STP, entered
    into contracts setting out the obligations of the owners and the
    U.S. Department of Energy, or DOE, including the fees to be
    paid by the owners for DOE’s services. Since 1998, the DOE
    has been in default on its obligations to begin removing spent
    nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from reactors. On
    January 28, 2004, the owners of STP filed a breach of
    contract suit against the DOE in order to protect against the
    running of a statute of limitations.

Under the federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of
    1980, as amended, the state of Texas is required to provide,
    either on its own or jointly with other states in a compact, for
    the disposal of all low-level radioactive waste generated within
    the state. The state of Texas has agreed to a compact with the
    state of Vermont for a disposal facility that would be located
    in Texas. That compact was ratified by Congress and signed by
    President Clinton in 1998. In 2003, the state of Texas enacted
    legislation allowing a private entity to be licensed to accept
    low-level radioactive waste for disposal. NRG intends to
    continue to ship low-level waste material from STP offsite for
    as long as an alternative disposal site is available. Should
    existing off-site disposal become unavailable, the low-level
    waste material will then be stored

on-site.

STP’s

on-site

storage capacity is expected to be adequate for STP’s needs
    until other off-site facilities become available.



Regional
    U.S. Environmental Initiatives

Northeast
    Region

NRG’s facilities in the eastern U.S. are subject to a

cap-and-trade

program governing
    NO

x

emissions during the ozone season, which typically begins May 1
    and lasts through September 30. These rules essentially
    require that one
    NO

x

allowance be held for each ton of
    NO

x

emitted. Each of NRG’s facilities that are subject to these
    rules have been allocated
    NO

x

emission allowances. NRG currently estimates that its total
    NO

x

emission allowances is sufficient to generally cover operations
    at these facilities through 2009, reflecting the fact that
    NO

x

allowances are allocated on a three-year, look-back basis.
    However, if at any point the Company’s
    NO

x

emission allowances are insufficient for the anticipated
    operation of each of these facilities, NRG must purchase
    NO

x

allowances. Any obligation to purchase a substantial number of
    additional
    NO

x

emission allowances could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations, financial position and
    cash flows.

The Ozone Transport Commission, or OTC, was established by
    Congress and governs ozone and the
    NO

x

budget program in certain eastern states, including
    Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and Delaware. The OTC
    proposes to implement a regional plan containing emission
    reduction targets for power plants that exceed those under CAIR.
    The OTC targets and timelines are implemented on a state by
    state basis. Current attention is focused on
    NO

x

emissions from units run primarily on High Energy Demand Days,
    or HEDD, of which NRG owns facilities in Connecticut, Delaware
    and New York. NRG continues to be actively engaged in the OTC
    stakeholder process including providing technical expertise to
    improve policy decision making. While it is not possible to
    predict the outcome of this regional effort, to the extent that
    the OTC is successful in implementing emission requirements that
    are more stringent than existing regimes, NRG could be
    materially impacted.

On December 20, 2005, several northeastern states entered
    into a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU, to create a RGGI to
    establish a

cap-and-trade

GHG program for electric generators. The RGGI states are now in
    the process of promulgating state regulations needed for
    implementation. To date, all declared states have selected, with
    the exception of specific set asides, to auction all of the
    allowances. With state legislation and regulation in place, the
    first regional auction of RGGI allowances needed by power
    generators could be held as early as the summer of 2008.
    Approximately 12 million tonnes of
    CO


were emitted from the Company’s generating units in
    Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York that
    will likely be subject to RGGI in 2009. The impact of RGGI on
    power prices (and thus on the Company’s financial
    performance), indirectly through generators seeking to pass
    through the cost of their
    CO


emissions, cannot be predicted. However, NRG believes that due
    to the absence of allowance allocations under RGGI, the direct
    financial impact on NRG is likely to be negative as the Company
    will incur costs in the course of securing the necessary
    allowances and offsets at auction and in the market.

New England —

Massachusetts air
    regulations prescribe schedules under which six existing
    coal-fired power plants in-state are required to meet stringent
    emission limits for
    NO

x

,
    SO


,
    mercury, and
    CO


.
    NRG’s Somerset plant is subject to these regulations. NRG
    has installed natural gas reburn technology to meet the
    NO

x

and
    SO


limits. On June 4, 2004, the Massachusetts Department of
    Environmental Protection, or MADEP, issued its regulation on the
    control of mercury emissions. The effect of this regulation is
    that starting October 1, 2006, Somerset will be capped at
    13.1 lbs/year of mercury as of January 1, 2008 and must
    achieve a reduction in its mercury inlet-to-outlet concentration
    of 85%. NRG plans to meet the requirements through the
    management of its fuels and the use of early and off-site
    reduction credits. Additionally, NRG has entered into an
    agreement with MADEP to retire or repower the Somerset station
    by the end of 2009. A permit for repowering the facility was
    approved by the MADEP in 2007.

The Massachusetts carbon regulation 310 CMR 7.29 Emissions
    Standards for Power Plants requires coal-fired generation
    located within the state to comply with
    CO


emissions restrictions. A carbon emissions rate requirement will
    apply in 2008. It is expected that Somerset will purchase
    offsets to comply.

New York —

NRG’s Huntley Power LLC,
    Dunkirk Power LLC and Oswego Power LLC entered into a Consent
    Order with the New York State Department of Environmental
    Conservation, or NYSDEC, effective March 31, 2004,
    regarding certain alleged opacity exceedances. The Order
    stipulates penalties for future violations of opacity
    requirements and compliance will be achieved with the
    installation of baghouses to further control particulates at



the Huntley and Dunkirk facilities in 2008 and 2009,
    respectively. In 2007, NRG accrued amounts payable to NYSDEC of
    $0.3 million to cover the stipulated penalty payments.

Delaware —

In November 2006, the Delaware
    Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, or
    DNREC, promulgated Regulation No. 1146, or Reg 1146,
    Electric Generating Unit Multi-Pollutant Regulation and
    Section 111(d) of the State Plan for the Control of Mercury
    Emissions from Coal-Fired Electric Steam Generating Units. These
    regulations govern the control of
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury emissions from electric generating units. NRG’s
    plan to install controls at the Company’s Indian River
    facility, while on an accelerated basis, was unable to meet
    certain deadlines, taking into account the time required, as a
    practical matter, to design, install and commission the
    necessary equipment. NRG filed a challenge to Reg 1146 with the
    Environmental Appeals Board, or EAB, on December 6, 2006.
    In addition, NRG also filed a protective appeal with the
    Delaware Superior Court on December 29, 2006. This
    challenge was settled when DNREC and NRG signed a Consent Order
    on September 25, 2007, and filed that document with the
    Delaware Superior Court thereby ending the case. Under this
    agreement, continued operations at the Company’s Indian
    River Generating Station are conditioned upon installation of
    controls on Units 1 and 2 by May 1, 2008, to reduce
    NO

x

;
    installation of controls on Units 1-4 by January 1, 2009 to
    meet mercury requirements; mothball of Units 1 and 2 by
    May 1, 2011, and May 1, 2010, respectively; and
    installation of advanced controls on Units 3 and 4 in 2011 to
    further reduce
    NO

x

and
    SO


.
    If the plant emits
    NO

x

in excess of 1,700 tons in any given ozone season, it will be
    subject to a graduated scale of stipulated penalties, up to a
    maximum $2,500/ton. The capital costs associated with this
    settlement are included in the Company’s estimated
    environmental capital expenditures. In the absence of the
    appropriate control technology installed at this facility, Units
    3 and 4 totaling approximately 565 MW, could not operate
    beyond December 31, 2011, per terms of the consent order.

West
    Region

On September 27, 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger
    signed Assembly Bill 32, or AB32, California Global Warming
    Solutions Act of 2006. AB 32 requires the California Air
    Resources Board, or CARB, to develop a GHG reduction program to
    reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, a reduction of
    approximately 25%. The reductions are to be phased in beginning
    2012 pursuant to regulations to be adopted by 2011. NRG does not
    expect that implementation of AB32 in California will have a
    significant adverse financial impact on the Company for a
    variety of reasons, including the fact that NRG’s
    California portfolio consists of natural gas-fired peaking
    facilities and will likely be able to pass through any costs of
    purchasing allowances in power prices.

South
    Central Region

On January 27, 2004, NRG’s Louisiana Generating, LLC
    and the Company’s Big Cajun II plant received a
    request under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act from the
    United States Environmental Protection Agency, or USEPA, seeking
    information primarily related to physical changes made at the
    Big Cajun II plant, and subsequently received a notice of
    violation, or NOV, on February 15, 2005, alleging that
    NRG’s predecessors had undertaken projects that triggered
    requirements under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration
    program, including the installation of emission controls. NRG
    submitted multiple responses commencing February 27, 2004
    and ending on October 20, 2004. On May 9, 2006, these
    entities received from the Department of Justice, or DOJ, a
    Notice of Deficiency related to their responses, to which NRG
    responded on May 22, 2006. A document review was conducted
    at NRG’s Louisiana Generating, LLC offices by the DOJ
    during the week of August 14, 2006. On December 8,
    2006, the USEPA issued a supplemental NOV updating the original
    February 15, 2005 NOV. Discussions with the USEPA are
    ongoing and the Company cannot predict with certainty the
    outcome of this matter.

Nuclear
    Insurance

STPNOC purchases insurance coverage on behalf of NRG and the
    other owners of STP. STP maintains property, decontamination
    liability and nuclear hazard liability insurance coverage as
    required by law and periodically reviews available limits and
    coverage for additional protection. Currently, STP has a
    $2.75 billion limit in property and decontamination
    liability insurance coverage, which is above the legally
    required minimum of $1.06 billion. The $2.75 billion
    includes $1 billion excess blanket coverage that is shared
    with two other nuclear power plants, namely Diablo Canyon and
    D.C. Cook. The deductible for property damage is
    $2.5 million. STP also



carries a primary accidental outage policy, which allows for six
    weeks of indemnity at $3.5 million per week after a
    17 week deductible is met. The $3.5 million weekly
    indemnity would be allocated between the three owners of STP
    according to their ownership percentages. NRG has purchased
    additional accidental outage coverage for its 44% ownership
    stake in STP. This policy provides coverage after the six week
    indemnity period has been paid under the primary policy, and
    will provide NRG $1.98 million weekly indemnity per unit
    for 52 weeks and $1.58 million per week for the next
    71 weeks. If both units at STP are affected by an outage
    arising out of the same accident, weekly indemnity per unit is
    limited to 80% of the single unit recovery. There is no coverage
    for partial outages, and the outage must be the result of a
    property damage caused by a sudden and fortuitous event.

The Price-Anderson Act, as amended through 2025 by the Energy
    Policy Act of 2005, requires owners of nuclear power plants in
    the U.S. to purchase the maximum amount of insurance
    available (currently $300 million) in the insurance market
    for liability claims that arise in the event of a nuclear
    accident. In addition, the Act provides a secondary layer of
    protection of up to $10.5 billion. Under this provision,
    each licensed reactor company is obliged to contribute up to
    approximately $101 million per unit per accident in
    retrospective premiums for any single incident at any nuclear
    power plant. Annual installments per reactor cannot exceed
    $15 million. STP is a two reactor facility but NRG’s
    liability would be capped at 44% due to the Company’s
    ownership interest in STP. The Price-Anderson Act only covers
    nuclear liability associated with an accident in the course of
    operation of the nuclear reactor, transportation of nuclear fuel
    to the reactor site, storage of nuclear fuel and waste at the
    reactor site and the transportation of the spent nuclear fuel
    and nuclear waste from the nuclear reactor. Any substantial
    retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act or
    losses not covered by insurance could have a materially adverse
    effect on NRG’s financial condition, the results of
    operations and statement of cash flows.

Domestic
    Site Remediation Matters

Under certain federal, state and local environmental laws and
    regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of any
    facility, including an electric generating facility, may be
    required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened
    releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products
    at the facility. NRG may also be held liable to a governmental
    entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury
    and investigation and remediation costs incurred by a party in
    connection with hazardous material releases or threatened
    releases. These laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, as
    amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of
    1986, or SARA, impose liability without regard to whether the
    owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous
    substances, and the courts have interpreted liability under such
    laws to be strict (without fault) and joint and several. Cleanup
    obligations can often be triggered during the closure or
    decommissioning of a facility, in addition to spills or other
    occurrences during its operations.

In January 2006, NRG’s Indian River Operations, Inc.
    received a letter of informal notification from DNREC stating
    that it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to a
    historic captive landfill. On October 1, 2007, NRG filed a
    Facility Evaluation with DNREC, through the Voluntary

Clean-up

Program to investigate the site. DNREC responded to the Facility
    Evaluation on February 4, 2008 finding no further action is
    required in relation to surface water and that a previously
    planned shoreline stabilization project would adequately address
    shore line erosion. The landfill itself will require a further
    Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study to determine the
    type and scope of any additional work required. Until the
    Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study is completed, the
    Company is unable to predict the impact of any required
    remediation.

, to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

International
    Environmental Matters

Most of the foreign countries in which NRG owns or may acquire
    or develop independent power projects have environmental and
    safety laws or regulations relating to the ownership or
    operation of electric power generation facilities. These laws
    and regulations, like those in the U.S., are constantly evolving
    and have a significant impact on international wholesale power
    producers. In particular, NRG’s international power
    generation facilities will likely be affected by emissions
    limitations and operational requirements imposed by the Kyoto
    Protocol, an international



treaty related to greenhouse gas emissions enacted on
    February 16, 2005, as well as country-based restrictions
    pertaining to global climate change concerns.

NRG retains appropriate advisors in foreign countries and seeks
    to design its international asset management strategy to comply
    with each country’s environmental and safety laws and
    regulations. There can be no assurance that changes in such laws
    or regulations will not adversely affect the Company’s
    international operations.

MIBRAG/Schkopau, Germany

— On June 22,
    2007, Germany enacted the German National
    CO


Allocation Plan 2008 — 2012, in which MIBRAG was
    granted
    CO


allocations that are less than the needs of its three generating
    plants. The financial impact of this regulation on MIBRAG’s
    results is not yet clear and management of MIBRAG is
    implementing a number of options to minimize any adverse impact.
    MIBRAG has also submitted an application under the hardship
    clause of the law to receive a higher allocation of the
    CO


allowances. The cost of compliance with the
    CO


regulation for NRG’s Schkopau plant is expected to be
    passed through to its off-taker of energy under its existing PPA.

Gladstone, Australia

— On December 3,
    2007, Australia ratified the Kyoto Protocol that commits to
    targets for GHG reductions. Australia also set a target to
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 60% of 2000 levels by 2050.
    The government is establishing a single national system for
    reporting of GHG, abatement actions, and energy consumption and
    generation starting July 1, 2008. This will underpin the
    Australian Emissions Trading Scheme, currently in the early
    stages of design that will be operational no later than 2010.

Item 1A —

Risk
    Factors Related to NRG Energy, Inc.

Many
    of NRG’s power generation facilities operate, wholly or
    partially, without long-term power sale
    agreements.

Many of NRG’s facilities operate as “merchant”
    facilities without long-term power sales agreements for some or
    all of their generating capacity and output, and therefore are
    exposed to market fluctuations. Without the benefit of long-term
    power sales agreements for these assets, NRG cannot be sure that
    it will be able to sell any or all of the power generated by
    these facilities at commercially attractive rates or that these
    facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead
    to future impairments of the Company’s property, plant and
    equipment or to the closing of certain of its facilities,
    resulting in economic losses and liabilities, which could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations, financial condition or cash flows.

NRG’s
    financial performance may be impacted by changing natural gas
    prices, significant and unpredictable price fluctuations in the
    wholesale power markets and other market factors that are beyond
    the Company’s control.

A significant percentage of the Company’s domestic revenues
    are derived from baseload power plants that are fueled by coal.
    In many of the competitive markets where NRG operates, the price
    of power typically is set by marginal cost natural gas-fired
    power plants that currently have substantially higher variable
    costs than NRG’s coal-fired baseload power plants. The
    current pricing and cost environment allows the Company’s
    baseload coal generation assets to earn attractive operating
    margins compared to plants fueled by natural gas. A decrease in
    natural gas prices could result in a corresponding decrease in
    the market price of power but would generally not affect the
    cost of the coal that the plants use. This could significantly
    reduce the operating margins of the Company’s baseload
    generation assets and materially and adversely impact its
    financial performance.

In addition, because changes in power prices in the markets
    where NRG operates are generally correlated with changes in
    natural gas prices, NRG’s hedging portfolio includes
    natural gas derivative instruments to hedge power



prices for its baseload generation. If this correlation between
    power prices and natural gas prices is not maintained and a
    change in gas prices is not proportionately offset by a change
    in power prices, the Company’s natural gas hedges may not
    fully cover this differential. This could have a material
    adverse impact on the Company’s cash flow and financial
    position.

Market prices for power, generation capacity and ancillary
    services tend to fluctuate substantially. Unlike most other
    commodities, electric power can only be stored on a very limited
    basis and generally must be produced concurrently with its use.
    As a result, power prices are subject to significant volatility
    from supply and demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead
    and spot markets. Long- and short-term power prices may also
    fluctuate substantially due to other factors outside of the
    Company’s control, including:

•

increases and decreases in generation capacity in the
    Company’s markets, including the addition of new supplies
    of power from existing competitors or new market entrants as a
    result of the development of new generation plants, expansion of
    existing plants or additional transmission capacity;

•

changes in power transmission or fuel transportation capacity
    constraints or inefficiencies;

•

electric supply disruptions, including plant outages and
    transmission disruptions;

•

heat rate risk;

•

weather conditions;

•

changes in the demand for power or in patterns of power usage,
    including the potential development of demand-side management
    tools and practices;

•

development of new fuels and new technologies for the production
    of power;

•

regulations and actions of the ISOs; and

•

federal and state power market and environmental regulation and
    legislation.

These factors have caused the Company’s operating results
    to fluctuate in the past and will continue to cause them to do
    so in the future.

NRG’s
    costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows
    could be adversely impacted by disruption of its fuel
    supplies.

NRG relies on coal, oil and natural gas to fuel a majority of
    its power generation facilities. Delivery of these fuels to the
    facilities is dependent upon the continuing financial viability
    of contractual counterparties as well as upon the infrastructure
    (including rail lines, rail cars, barge facilities, roadways,
    and natural gas pipelines) available to serve each generation
    facility. As a result, the Company is subject to the risks of
    disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at its
    generation facilities if a counterparty fails to perform or if
    there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.

NRG has sold forward a substantial portion of its baseload power
    in order to lock in long-term prices that it deemed to be
    favorable at the time it entered into the forward sale
    contracts. In order to hedge its obligations under these forward
    power sales contracts, the Company has entered into long-term
    and short-term contracts for the purchase and delivery of fuel.
    Many of the forward power sales contracts do not allow the
    Company to pass through changes in fuel costs or discharge the
    power sale obligations in the case of a disruption in fuel
    supply due to force majeure events or the default of a fuel
    supplier or transporter. Disruptions in the Company’s fuel
    supplies may therefore require it to find alternative fuel
    sources at higher costs, to find other sources of power to
    deliver to counterparties at a higher cost, or to pay damages to
    counterparties for failure to deliver power as contracted. Any
    such event could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial performance.

NRG also buys significant quantities of fuel on a short-term or
    spot market basis. Prices for all of the Company’s fuels
    fluctuate, sometimes rising or falling significantly over a
    relatively short period of time. The price NRG can obtain for
    the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate, or may not
    rise at all, to match a rise in fuel or



delivery costs. This may have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial performance. Changes in market prices
    for natural gas, coal and oil may result from the following:

•

weather conditions;

•

seasonality;

•

demand for energy commodities and general economic conditions;

•

disruption or other constraints or inefficiencies of
    electricity, gas or coal transmission or transportation;

•

additional generating capacity;

•

availability and levels of storage and inventory for fuel stocks;

•

natural gas, crude oil, refined products and coal production
    levels;

•

changes in market liquidity;

•

federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and
    legislation; and

•

the creditworthiness and liquidity and willingness of fuel
    suppliers/transporters to do business with the Company.

NRG’s plant operating characteristics and equipment,
    particularly at its coal-fired plants, often dictate the
    specific fuel quality to be combusted. The availability and
    price of specific fuel qualities may vary due to supplier
    financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions
    and force majeure. At times, coal of specific quality may not be
    available at any price, or the Company may not be able to
    transport such coal to its facilities on a timely basis. In this
    case, the Company may not be able to run the coal facility even
    if it would be profitable. Operating a coal facility with
    different quality coal can lead to emission or operating
    problems. If the Company had sold forward the power from such a
    coal facility, it could be required to supply or purchase power
    from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. This could have a
    material adverse impact on the financial results of specific
    plants and on the Company’s results of operations.

There
    may be periods when NRG will not be able to meet its commitments
    under forward sale obligations at a reasonable cost or at
    all.

A substantial portion of the output from NRG’s baseload
    facilities has been sold forward under fixed price power sales
    contracts through 2013, and the Company also sells forward the
    output from its intermediate and peaking facilities when its
    deems it commercially advantageous to do so. Because the
    obligations under most of these agreements are not contingent on
    a unit being available to generate power, NRG is generally
    required to deliver power to the buyer, even in the event of a
    plant outage, fuel supply disruption or a reduction in the
    available capacity of the unit. To the extent that the Company
    does not have sufficient lower cost capacity to meet its
    commitments under its forward sale obligations, the Company
    would be required to supply replacement power either by running
    its other, higher cost power plants or by obtaining power from
    third-party sources at market prices that could substantially
    exceed the contract price. If NRG fails to deliver the
    contracted power, it would be required to pay the difference
    between the market price at the delivery point and the contract
    price, and the amount of such payments could be substantial.

In the South Central region, NRG has long-term contracts with
    rural cooperatives that require it to serve all of the
    cooperatives’ requirements at prices that generally reflect
    the costs of coal-fired generation. At times, the output from
    NRG’s coal-fired Big Cajun II facility has been and
    will continue to be inadequate to serve these obligations, and
    when that happens the Company has typically purchased power from
    other power producers, often at a loss. NRG’s financial
    returns from its South Central region are likely to deteriorate
    over time as the rural cooperatives grow their customer base,
    unless the Company is able to amend or renegotiate its contracts
    with the cooperatives or add generating capacity.



NRG’s
    trading operations and the use of hedging agreements could
    result in financial losses that negatively impact its results of
    operations.

The Company typically enters into hedging agreements, including
    contracts to purchase or sell commodities at future dates and at
    fixed prices, in order to manage the commodity price risks
    inherent in its power generation operations. These activities,
    although intended to mitigate price volatility, expose the
    Company to other risks. When the Company sells power forward, it
    gives up the opportunity to sell power at higher prices in the
    future, which not only may result in lost opportunity costs but
    also may require the Company to post significant amounts of cash
    collateral or other credit support to its counterparties.
    Further, if the values of the financial contracts change in a
    manner that the Company does not anticipate, or if a
    counterparty fails to perform under a contract, it could harm
    the Company’s business, operating results or financial
    position.

NRG does not typically hedge the entire exposure of its
    operations against commodity price volatility. To the extent it
    does not hedge against commodity price volatility, the
    Company’s results of operations and financial position may
    be improved or diminished based upon movement in commodity
    prices.

NRG may engage in trading activities, including the trading of
    power, fuel and emissions allowances that are not directly
    related to the operation of the Company’s generation
    facilities or the management of related risks. These trading
    activities take place in volatile markets and some of these
    trades could be characterized as speculative. The Company would
    expect to settle these trades financially rather than through
    the production of power or the delivery of fuel. This trading
    activity may expose the Company to the risk of significant
    financial losses which could have a material adverse effect on
    its business and financial condition.

NRG
    may not have sufficient liquidity to hedge market risks
    effectively.

The Company is exposed to market risks through its power
    marketing business, which involves the sale of energy, capacity
    and related products and the purchase and sale of fuel,
    transmission services and emission allowances. These market
    risks include, among other risks, volatility arising from
    location and timing differences that may be associated with
    buying and transporting fuel, converting fuel into energy and
    delivering the energy to a buyer.

NRG undertakes these marketing activities through agreements
    with various counterparties. Many of the Company’s
    agreements with counterparties include provisions that require
    the Company to provide guarantees, offset of netting
    arrangements, letters of credit, a second lien on assets

and/or

cash
    collateral to protect the counterparties against the risk of the
    Company’s default or insolvency. The amount of such credit
    support that must be provided typically is based on the
    difference between the price of the commodity in a given
    contract and the market price of the commodity. Significant
    movements in market prices can result in the Company being
    required to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in
    very large amounts. The effectiveness of the Company’s
    strategy may be dependent on the amount of collateral available
    to enter into or maintain these contracts, and liquidity
    requirements may be greater than the Company anticipates or will
    be able to meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital
    to post as collateral in support of performance guarantees or as
    a cash margin, the Company may not be able to manage price
    volatility effectively or to implement its strategy. An increase
    in the amount of letters of credit or cash collateral required
    to be provided to the Company’s counterparties may
    negatively affect the Company’s liquidity and financial
    condition.

Further, if any of NRG’s facilities experience unplanned
    outages, the Company may be required to procure replacement
    power at spot market prices in order to fulfill contractual
    commitments. Without adequate liquidity to meet margin and
    collateral requirements, the Company may be exposed to
    significant losses, may miss significant opportunities, and may
    have increased exposure to the volatility of spot markets.

The
    accounting for NRG’s hedging activities may increase the
    volatility in the Company’s quarterly and annual financial
    results.

NRG engages in commodity-related marketing and price-risk
    management activities in order to financially hedge its exposure
    to market risk with respect to electricity sales from its
    generation assets, fuel utilized by those assets, and emission
    allowances.



NRG generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical and
    financial purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract
    volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations
    through the use of financial and physical derivative contracts.
    These derivatives are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities,

as amended, or SFAS 133, which
    requires the Company to record all derivatives on the balance
    sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value resulting
    from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices immediately
    recognized in earnings, unless the derivative qualifies for cash
    flow hedge accounting treatment. Whether a derivative qualifies
    for cash flow hedge accounting treatment depends upon it meeting
    specific criteria used to determine if the cash flow hedge is
    and will remain appropriate for the term of the derivative.
    Economic hedges will not necessarily qualify for cash flow hedge
    accounting treatment. As a result, the Company may be unable to
    accurately predict the impact that its risk management decisions
    may have on its quarterly and annual operating results.

Competition
    in wholesale power markets may have a material adverse effect on
    NRG’s results of operations, cash flows and the market
    value of its assets.

NRG has numerous competitors in all aspects of its business, and
    additional competitors may enter the industry. Because many of
    the Company’s facilities are old, newer plants owned by the
    Company’s competitors are often more efficient than
    NRG’s aging plants, which may put some of these plants at a
    competitive disadvantage to the extent the Company’s
    competitors are able to consume the same or less fuel as the
    Company’s plants consume. Over time, the Company’s
    plants may be squeezed out of their markets, or may be unable to
    compete with these more efficient plants.

In NRG’s power marketing and commercial operations, it
    competes on the basis of its relative skills, financial position
    and access to capital with other providers of electric energy in
    the procurement of fuel and transportation services, and the
    sale of capacity, energy and related products. In order to
    compete successfully, the Company seeks to aggregate fuel
    supplies at competitive prices from different sources and
    locations and to efficiently utilize transportation services
    from third-party pipelines, railways and other fuel transporters
    and transmission services from electric utilities.

Other companies with which NRG competes with may have greater
    liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial
    resources, lower cost structures, more effective risk management
    policies and procedures, greater ability to incur losses,
    longer-standing relationships with customers, greater potential
    for profitability from ancillary services or greater flexibility
    in the timing of their sale of generation capacity and ancillary
    services than NRG does.

NRG’s competitors may be able to respond more quickly to
    new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote
    greater resources to the construction, expansion or
    refurbishment of their power generation facilities than NRG can.
    In addition, current and potential competitors may make
    strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships
    among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is
    possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new
    competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market
    share. There can be no assurance that NRG will be able to
    compete successfully against current and future competitors, and
    any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flow.

Operation
    of power generation facilities involves significant risks and
    hazards customary to the power industry that could have a
    material adverse effect on NRG’s revenues and results of
    operations. NRG may not have adequate insurance to cover these
    risks and hazards.

The ongoing operation of NRG’s facilities involves risks
    that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes,
    performance below expected levels of output or efficiency and
    the inability to transport the Company’s product to its
    customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission
    capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including
    extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or
    other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk
    of the Company’s business. Unplanned outages typically
    increase the Company’s operation and maintenance expenses
    and may reduce the Company’s revenues as a result of
    selling fewer MWh or require NRG to incur significant costs as a
    result of running one of its higher cost units or obtaining
    replacement power from third parties in the open market to
    satisfy the Company’s forward power sales obligations.



NRG’s inability to operate the Company’s plants
    efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs, and generate
    earnings and cash flow from the Company’s asset-based
    businesses could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations, financial condition or
    cash flows. While NRG maintains insurance, obtains warranties
    from vendors and obligates contractors to meet certain
    performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties
    or performance guarantees may not be adequate to cover the
    Company’s lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated
    damages payments should the Company experience equipment
    breakdown or non-performance by contractors or vendors.

Power generation involves hazardous activities, including
    acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large
    pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to
    transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural
    risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind,
    other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and
    machinery failure are inherent risks in the Company’s
    operations. These and other hazards can cause significant
    personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and
    destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of,
    or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The
    occurrence of any one of these events may result in NRG being
    named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for
    substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs,
    personal injury and property damage and fines

and/or

penalties. NRG maintains an amount of insurance protection that
    it considers adequate, but the Company cannot provide any
    assurance that its insurance will be sufficient or effective
    under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities
    to which it may be subject. A successful claim for which the
    Company is not fully insured could hurt its financial results
    and materially harm NRG’s financial condition. Further, due
    to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets,
    NRG cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage
    will continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms
    similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by
    insurance could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Maintenance,
    expansion and refurbishment of power generation facilities
    involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power
    outages or reduced output and could have a material adverse
    effect on NRG’s results of operations, cash flow and
    financial condition.

Many of NRG’s facilities are old and require periodic
    upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including
    failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any
    unanticipated capital expenditures could result in reduced
    profitability.

NRG cannot be certain of the level of capital expenditures that
    will be required due to changing environmental and safety laws
    and regulations (including changes in the interpretation or
    enforcement thereof), needed facility repairs and unexpected
    events (such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks). The
    unexpected requirement of large capital expenditures could have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and
    financial condition.

If NRG makes any major modifications to its power generation
    facilities, the Company may be required to install the best
    available control technology or to achieve the lowest achievable
    emissions rates, as such terms are defined under the new source
    review provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Any such
    modifications would likely result in substantial additional
    capital expenditures.

The
    Company may incur additional costs or delays in the construction
    and operation of new plants, improvements to existing plants, or
    the implementation of environmental control equipment at
    existing plants and may not be able to recover their investment
    or complete the project.

The Company is in the process of constructing new generation
    facilities, improving its existing facilities and adding
    environmental controls to its existing facilities. The
    construction, expansion, modification and refurbishment of power
    generation facilities involve many additional risks, including:

•

delays in obtaining necessary permits and licenses;

•

environmental remediation of soil or groundwater at contaminated
    sites;

•

interruptions to dispatch at the Company’s facilities;

•

supply interruptions;



•

work stoppages;

•

labor disputes;

•

weather interferences;

•

unforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems;

•

unanticipated cost overruns;

•

exchange rate risks; and

•

performance risks.

Any of these risks could cause NRG’s financial returns on
    new investments to be lower than expected, or could cause the
    Company to operate below expected capacity or availability
    levels, which could result in lost revenues, increased expenses,
    higher maintenance costs and penalties. Insurance is maintained
    to protect against these risks, warranties are generally
    obtained for limited periods relating to the construction of
    each project and its equipment in varying degrees, and
    contractors and equipment suppliers are obligated to meet
    certain performance levels. The insurance, warranties or
    performance guarantees, however, may not be adequate to cover
    increased expenses. As a result, a project may cost more than
    projected and may be unable to fund principal and interest
    payments under its construction financing obligations, if any. A
    default under such a financing obligation could result in losing
    the Company’s interest in a power generation facility.

If the Company is unable to complete the development or
    construction of a facility or environmental control, or decides
    to delay or cancel such project, it may not be able to recover
    its investment in that facility or environmental control.
    Furthermore, if construction projects are not completed
    according to specification, the Company may incur liabilities
    and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs and
    reduced net income.

The
    Company’s RepoweringNRG program is subject to financing
    risks that could adversely impact NRG’s financial
    performance.

While NRG currently intends to develop and finance the more
    capital intensive, solid fuel-fired projects included in the

Repowering

NRG program on a non-recourse or limited
    recourse basis through separate project financed entities, and
    intends to seek additional investments in most of these projects
    from third parties, NRG anticipates that it will need to make
    significant equity investments in these projects. NRG may also
    decide to develop and finance some of the projects, such as
    smaller gas-fired and renewable projects, using corporate
    financial resources rather than non-recourse debt, which could
    subject NRG to significant capital expenditure requirements and
    to risks inherent in the development and construction of new
    generation facilities. In addition to providing some or all of
    the equity required to develop and build the proposed projects,
    NRG’s ability to finance these projects on a non-recourse
    basis is contingent upon a number of factors, including the
    terms of the EPC contracts, construction costs, PPAs and fuel
    procurement contracts, capital markets conditions, the
    availability of tax credits and other government incentives for
    certain new technologies. To the extent NRG is not able to
    obtain non-recourse financing for any project or should the
    credit rating agencies attribute a material amount of the
    project finance debt to NRG’s credit, the financing of the

Repowering

NRG projects could have a negative impact on
    the credit ratings of NRG.

As part of the

Repowering

NRG program, NRG may also choose
    to undertake the repowering, refurbishment or upgrade of current
    facilities based on the Company’s assessment that such
    activity will provide adequate financial returns. Such projects
    often require several years of development and capital
    expenditures before commencement of commercial operations, and
    key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an
    investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding
    construction costs, timing, available financing and future fuel
    and power prices.



Supplier
    and/or customer concentration at certain of NRG’s
    facilities may expose the Company to significant financial
    credit or performance risks.

NRG often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small
    number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of
    fuel and other services required for the operation of certain of
    its facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, the Company
    utilizes the marketplace to provide these services. There can be
    no assurance that the marketplace can provide these services as,
    when and where required.

At times, NRG relies on a single customer or a few customers to
    purchase all or a significant portion of a facility’s
    output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account
    for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a
    given facility. The Company has also hedged a portion of its
    exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price
    power sales and natural gas price swap agreements.
    Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable
    to perform their obligations. NRG may not be able to enter into
    replacement agreements on terms as favorable as its existing
    agreements, or at all. If the Company was unable to enter into
    replacement PPA’s, the Company would sell its plants’
    power at market prices. If the Company is unable to enter into
    replacement fuel or fuel transportation purchase agreements, NRG
    would seek to purchase the Company’s fuel requirements at
    market prices, exposing the Company to market price volatility
    and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available
    during certain periods at any price.

The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its
    contractual obligations to NRG could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial results. Consequently,
    the financial performance of the Company’s facilities is
    dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance
    by, suppliers and customers.

NRG
    relies on power transmission facilities that the Company does
    not own or control and that are subject to transmission
    constraints within a number of the Company’s core regions.
    If these facilities fail to provide NRG with adequate
    transmission capacity, the Company may be restricted in its
    ability to deliver wholesale electric power to its customers and
    the Company may either incur additional costs or forego
    revenues. Conversely, improvements to certain transmission
    systems could also reduce revenues.

NRG depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by
    others to deliver the wholesale power it sells from the
    Company’s power generation plants to its customers. If
    transmission is disrupted, or if the transmission capacity
    infrastructure is inadequate, NRG’s ability to sell and
    deliver wholesale power may be adversely impacted. If a
    region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate,
    the Company’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may
    be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is
    imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient
    incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.
    The Company cannot also predict whether transmission facilities
    will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive
    access to those markets.

In addition, in certain of the markets in which NRG operates,
    energy transmission congestion may occur and the Company may be
    deemed responsible for congestion costs if it schedules delivery
    of power between congestion zones during times when congestion
    occurs between the zones. If NRG were liable for such congestion
    costs, the Company’s financial results could be adversely
    affected.

In the California ISO, New York ISO and New England ISO markets,
    the Company has a significant amount of generation located in
    load pockets, making that generation valuable, particularly with
    respect to maintaining the reliability of the transmission grid.
    Expansion of transmission systems to reduce or eliminate these
    load pockets could negatively impact the value or profitability
    of our existing facilities in these areas.

Because
    NRG owns less than a majority of some of its project
    investments, the Company cannot exercise complete control over
    their operations.

NRG has limited control over the operation of some project
    investments and joint ventures because the Company’s
    investments are in projects where it beneficially owns less than
    a majority of the ownership interests. NRG seeks to exert a
    degree of influence with respect to the management and operation
    of projects in which it owns less than a majority of the
    ownership interests by negotiating to obtain positions on
    management committees or to receive certain limited governance
    rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, the
    Company may not always succeed in such negotiations. NRG may be
    dependent on its co-venturers to operate such projects. The



Company’s co-venturers may not have the level of
    experience, technical expertise, human resources management and
    other attributes necessary to operate these projects optimally.
    The approval of co-venturers also may be required for NRG to
    receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer the
    Company’s interest in projects.

Future
    acquisition activities may have adverse effects.

NRG may seek to acquire additional companies or assets in the
    Company’s industry. The acquisition of power generation
    companies and assets is subject to substantial risks, including
    the failure to identify material problems during due diligence,
    the risk of over-paying for assets and the inability to arrange
    financing for an acquisition as may be required or desired.
    Further, the integration and consolidation of acquisitions
    requires substantial human, financial and other resources and,
    ultimately, the Company’s acquisitions may not be
    successfully integrated. There can be no assurances that any
    future acquisitions will perform as expected or that the returns
    from such acquisitions will support the indebtedness incurred to
    acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them.

NRG’s
    business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and
    may be adversely affected by legislative or regulatory changes,
    as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply
    with, existing or future regulations or
    requirements.

NRG’s business is subject to extensive foreign, and
    U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulation.
    Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory
    regimes may cause the Company to incur significant additional
    costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result
    in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of
    liens, fines,

and/or

civil
    or criminal liability.

Public utilities under the Federal Power Act, or FPA, are
    required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for
    wholesale sales of electricity. All of NRG’s non-qualifying
    facility generating companies and power marketing affiliates in
    the United States make sales of electricity in interstate
    commerce and are public utilities for purposes of the FPA. FERC
    has granted each of NRG’s generating and power marketing
    companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based
    rates. The FERC’s orders that grant NRG’s generating
    and power marketing companies market-based rate authority
    reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if FERC
    subsequently determines that NRG can exercise market power in
    transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage
    in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, NRG’s
    market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules,
    and if any of NRG’s generating and power marketing
    companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they
    are subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with
    the violation

and/or

suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority.
    If NRG’s generating and power marketing companies were to
    lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be
    required to obtain FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-service
    rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting,
    record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on
    utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an
    adverse effect on the rates NRG charges for power from its
    facilities.

NRG is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as
    well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost
    allocations, and bidding rules that occur in the existing ISOs.
    The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets
    impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation,
    including price limitations, offer caps, and other mechanisms to
    address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of
    market power in these markets. These types of price limitations
    and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on
    the profitability of NRG’s generation facilities that sell
    energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets.

The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power
    industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several
    years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state
    and federal levels. These changes are ongoing and the Company
    cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets
    or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment
    will have on NRG’s business. In addition, in some of these
    markets, interested parties have proposed material market design
    changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price
    mechanism, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets or
    require divestiture by generating companies to reduce their
    market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and
    legislative or other attention to the electric power market
    restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation
    process. If competitive restructuring of



the electric power markets is reversed, discontinued, or
    delayed, our business prospects and financial results could be
    negatively impacted.

NRG’s
    ownership interest in a nuclear power facility subjects the
    Company to regulations, costs and liabilities uniquely
    associated with these types of facilities.

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or AEA,
    operation of STP, of which NRG indirectly owns a 44.0% interest,
    is subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
    or NRC. Such regulation includes licensing, inspection,
    enforcement, testing, evaluation and modification of all aspects
    of nuclear reactor power plant design and operation,
    environmental and safety performance, technical and financial
    qualifications, decommissioning funding assurance and transfer
    and foreign ownership restrictions. NRG’s 44% share of the
    output of STP represents approximately 1,175 MW of
    generation capacity.

There are unique risks to owning and operating a nuclear power
    facility. These include liabilities related to the handling,
    treatment, storage, disposal, transport, release and use of
    radioactive materials, particularly with respect to spent
    nuclear fuel, and uncertainties regarding the ultimate, and
    potential exposure to, technical and financial risks associated
    with modifying or decommissioning a nuclear facility. The NRC
    could require the shutdown of the plant for safety reasons or
    refuse to permit restart of the unit after unplanned or planned
    outages. New or amended NRC safety and regulatory requirements
    may give rise to additional operation and maintenance costs and
    capital expenditures. STP may be obligated to continue storing
    spent nuclear fuel if the Department of Energy continues to fail
    to meet its contractual obligations to STP made pursuant to the
    U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept and dispose
    of STP’s spent nuclear fuel. See also

“Environmental Matters — U.S. Federal
    Environmental Initiatives — Nuclear Waste”

in
    Item 1. Costs associated with these risks could be
    substantial and have a material adverse effect on NRG’s
    results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. In
    addition, to the extent that all or a part of STP is required by
    the NRC to permanently or temporarily shut down or modify its
    operations, or is otherwise subject to a forced outage, NRG may
    incur additional costs to the extent it is obligated to provide
    power from more expensive alternative sources — either
    NRG’s own plants, third party generators or the
    ERCOT — to cover the Company’s then existing
    forward sale obligations. Such shutdown or modification could
    also lead to substantial costs related to the storage and
    disposal of radioactive materials and spent nuclear fuel.

NRG and the other owners of STP maintain nuclear property and
    nuclear liability insurance coverage as required by law. The
    Price-Anderson Act, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005,
    requires owners of nuclear power plants in the United States to
    be collectively responsible for retrospective secondary
    insurance premiums for liability to the public arising from
    nuclear incidents resulting in claims in excess of the required
    primary insurance coverage amount of $300 million per
    reactor. The Price-Anderson Act only covers nuclear liability
    associated with any accident in the course of operation of the
    nuclear reactor, transportation of nuclear fuel to the reactor
    site, in the storage of nuclear fuel and waste at the reactor
    site and the transportation of the spent nuclear fuel and
    nuclear waste from the nuclear reactor. All other non-nuclear
    liabilities are not covered. Any substantial retrospective
    premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act or losses not
    covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on
    NRG’s financial condition, results of operations or cash
    flows.

NRG is
    subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose
    extensive and increasingly stringent requirements on the
    Company’s ongoing operations, as well as potentially
    substantial liabilities arising out of environmental
    contamination. These environmental requirements and liabilities
    could adversely impact NRG’s results of operations,
    financial condition and cash flows.

NRG’s business is subject to the environmental laws and
    regulations of foreign, federal, state and local authorities.
    The Company must comply with numerous environmental laws and
    regulations and obtain numerous governmental permits and
    approvals to operate the Company’s plants. Should NRG fail
    to comply with any environmental requirements that apply to its
    operations, the Company could be subject to administrative,
    civil

and/or

criminal liability and fines, and regulatory agencies could take
    other actions seeking to curtail the Company’s operations.
    In addition, when new requirements take effect or when existing
    environmental requirements are revised, reinterpreted or subject
    to changing enforcement policies, NRG’s business, results
    of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be
    adversely affected.



Environmental laws and regulations have generally become more
    stringent over time, and the Company expects this trend to
    continue. Future federally imposed changes in the National
    Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone could result in
    additional reduction of
    NO

x

limits or reduced compliance flexibility for power generating
    units. Challenges to CAMR, if successful, could result in a unit
    by unit command and control approach to mercury resulting in
    additional controls to NRG coal facilities in Louisiana and
    Texas.

Furthermore, certain environmental laws impose strict, joint and
    several liability for costs required to clean up and restore
    sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise
    released. The Company is generally responsible for all
    liabilities associated with the environmental condition of its
    power generation plants, including any soil or groundwater
    contamination that may be present, regardless of when the
    liabilities arose and whether the liabilities are known or
    unknown, or arose from the activities of predecessors or third
    parties.

Policies
    at the national, regional and state levels to regulate GHG
    emissions could adversely impact NRG’s result of
    operations, financial condition and cash flows.

There is a growing consensus in the U.S. and globally that
    GHG emissions are a major cause of global warming. At the
    national level and at various regional and state levels,
    policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions,
    thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to
    create financial incentive to reduce them. Earlier this year,
    the U.S. Supreme Court found that
    CO


,
    the most common GHG, could be regulated as a pollutant and that
    the USEPA should regulate
    CO


emissions from mobile sources. Since power plants, particularly
    coal-fired plants, are a significant source of GHG emissions
    both in the United States and globally, it is almost certain
    that GHG regulatory actions will encompass power plants as well
    as other GHG emitting stationary sources. In 2007, in the course
    of producing approximately 80 million MWh of electricity,
    NRG’s power plants emitted 68 million tonnes of
    CO


,
    of which 61 million tonnes were emitted in the United
    States, 3 million tonnes in Australia and 4 million
    tonnes in Germany.

Federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could
    have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    performance. The actual impact on the Company’s financial
    performance will depend on a number of factors, including the
    overall level of GHG reductions required under any such
    regulations, the price and availability of offsets, and the
    extent to which NRG would be entitled to receive GHG emissions
    allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on
    the open market.

State and regional initiatives such as the RGGI, in the
    Northeast, and the Western Climate Initiative, or WCI, are
    developing market based programs to counteract climate change.
    The RGGI states are in the process of promulgating state
    regulations needed for implementation with six of the ten states
    issuing drafts for comment. With state legislation and
    regulation in place, the first regional auction of RGGI
    allowances needed by power generators could be held as early as
    the summer of 2008.

However, of the approximately 61 million tonnes of
    CO


emitted by NRG in the United States in 2007, approximately
    12 million tonnes were emitted from the Company’s
    generating units in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland,
    Massachusetts and New York that will likely be subject to RGGI
    in 2009. The impact of RGGI on power prices (and thus on the
    Company’s financial performance), indirectly through
    generators seeking to pass through the cost of their
    CO


emissions, cannot be predicted. However, NRG believes that due
    to the absence of allowance allocations under RGGI, the direct
    financial impact on NRG is likely to be negative as the Company
    will incur costs in the course of securing the necessary
    allowances and offsets at auction and in the market.

NRG’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by its unionized
    employees or inability to replace employees as they
    retire.

As of December 31, 2007, approximately 66% of NRG’s
    employees at its U.S. generation plants were covered by
    collective bargaining agreements. In the event that the
    Company’s union employees strike, participate in a work
    stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strife or
    disruption, NRG would be responsible for procuring replacement
    labor or the Company could experience reduced power generation
    or outages. NRG’s ability to procure such labor is
    uncertain. Strikes, work stoppages or the inability to negotiate
    future collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms could
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
    financial condition,



results of operations and cash flow. In addition, a number of
    our employees at our plants are close to retirement. Our
    inability to replace those workers could create potential
    knowledge and expertise gaps as those workers retire.

Changes
    in technology may impair the value of NRG’s power
    plants.

Research and development activities are ongoing to provide
    alternative and more efficient technologies to produce power,
    including fuel cells, clean coal and coal gasification,
    micro-turbines, photovoltaic (solar) cells and improvements in
    traditional technologies and equipment, such as more efficient
    gas turbines. Advances in these or other technologies could
    reduce the costs of power production to a level below what the
    Company has currently forecasted, which could adversely affect
    its cash flow, results of operations or competitive position.

Acts
    of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on NRG’s
    financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

NRG’s generation facilities and the facilities of third
    parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist
    activities, as well as events occurring in response to or in
    connection with them, that could cause environmental
    repercussions

and/or

result in full or partial disruption of the facilities ability
    to generate, transmit, transport or distribute electricity or
    natural gas. Strategic targets, such as energy-related
    facilities, may be at greater risk of future terrorist
    activities than other domestic targets. Any such environmental
    repercussions or disruption could result in a significant
    decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or
    remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flow.

NRG’s
    international investments are subject to additional risks that
    its U.S. investments do not have.

NRG has investments in power projects in Australia, Germany and
    Brazil. International investments are subject to risks and
    uncertainties relating to the political, social and economic
    structures of the countries in which it invests. The likelihood
    of such occurances and their overall effect upon NRG may vary
    greatly from country to country and are not predictable. Risks
    specifically related to our investments in international
    projects may include:

•

fluctuations in currency valuation;

•

currency inconvertibility;

•

expropriation and confiscatory taxation;

•

restrictions on the repatriation of capital; and

•

approval requirements and governmental policies limiting returns
    to foreign investors.

NRG’s
    level of indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to
    raise additional capital to fund its operations, or return
    capital to stockholders. It could also expose it to the risk of
    increased interest rates and limit its ability to react to
    changes in the economy or its industry.

NRG’s substantial debt could have important consequences,
    including:

•

increasing NRG’s vulnerability to general economic and
    industry conditions;

•

requiring a substantial portion of NRG’s cash flow from
    operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and
    interest on its indebtedness, therefore reducing NRG’s
    ability to pay dividends to holders of its preferred or common
    stock or to use its cash flow to fund its operations, capital
    expenditures and future business opportunities;

•

limiting NRG’s ability to enter into long-term power sales
    or fuel purchases which require credit support;

•

exposing NRG to the risk of increased interest rates because
    certain of its borrowings, including borrowings under its new
    senior secured credit facility are at variable rates of interest;

•

limiting NRG’s ability to obtain additional financing for
    working capital including collateral postings, capital
    expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and
    general corporate or other purposes; and



•

limiting NRG’s ability to adjust to changing market
    conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared
    to its competitors who have less debt.

The indentures for NRG’s notes and senior secured credit
    facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants that
    may limit the Company’s ability to return capital to
    stockholders or otherwise engage in activities that may be in
    its long-term best interests. NRG’s failure to comply with
    those covenants could result in an event of default which, if
    not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of
    the Company’s indebtedness.

In addition, NRG’s ability to arrange financing, either at
    the corporate level or at a non-recourse project-level
    subsidiary, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on
    numerous factors, including:

•

general economic and capital market conditions;

•

credit availability from banks and other financial institutions;

•

investor confidence in NRG, its partners and the regional
    wholesale power markets;

•

NRG’s financial performance and the financial performance
    of its subsidiaries;

•

NRG’s level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants
    in debt agreements;

•

maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;

•

cash flow; and

•

provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising
    capital.

NRG may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for
    these or other reasons. The failure to obtain additional capital
    from time to time may have a material adverse effect on its
    business and operations.

Goodwill
    and/or other intangible assets not subject to amortization that
    NRG has recorded in connection with its acquisitions are subject
    to mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result, the
    Company could be required to write off some or all of this
    goodwill and other intangible assets, which may adversely affect
    the Company’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standard No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, goodwill is not
    amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for
    impairment and other intangibles are also reviewed at least
    annually or more frequently, if certain conditions exist, and
    may be amortized. Any reduction in or impairment of the value of
    goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge
    against earnings which could materially adversely affect
    NRG’s reported results of operations and financial position
    in future periods.

Because
    the historical financial information may not be representative
    of the results of operation as a combined company or capital
    structure after the Acquisition, and NRG’s and Texas Genco
    LLC’s historical financial information are not comparable
    to their current financial information, you have limited
    financial information on which to evaluate the combined company,
    NRG and Texas Genco LLC.

Texas Genco LLC did not exist prior to July 19, 2004, and
    Texas Genco LLC and its subsidiaries had no operations and no
    material activities until December 15, 2004 when Texas
    Genco LLC acquired its gas- and coal-fired assets. Consequently,
    Texas Genco LLC’s historical financial information is not
    comparable to the Texas region’s current financial
    information.

NRG and Texas Genco LLC had been operating as separate companies
    prior to February 2, 2006. NRG and Texas Genco LLC had no
    prior history as a combined company, nor have they been
    previously managed on a combined basis. The historical financial
    statements may not reflect what the combined company’s
    results of operations, financial position and cash flows would
    have been had both companies operated on a combined basis and
    may not be indicative of what the combined company’s
    results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be
    in the future.

The defendants in all of the above referenced cases include WCP
    and various Dynegy entities. NRG is not a defendant. The
    Complaints allege that defendants attempted to manipulate
    natural gas prices in California, and allege violations of
    California’s antitrust law, conspiracy, and unjust
    enrichment. The relief sought in all of these cases includes
    treble damages, restitution and injunctive relief.
    Defendants’ motion to dismiss was denied by the Court on
    June 22, 2005, and the cases are in discovery. Dynegy is
    defending WCP pursuant to an indemnification agreement. In
    October 2007 Dynegy reached a tentative agreement with
    plaintiffs to settle these cases. Such settlement requires court
    approval and proceedings seeking court approval are ongoing. If
    such settlement was approved, WCP would pay no funds towards
    that settlement as Dynegy is defending and indemnifying WCP.

    Indemnification —

In the above cases relating
    to natural gas, Dynegy’s counsel is defending WCP

and/or

its
    subsidiaries and will be the responsible party for any loss.
    There are no further cases relating to electricity, but should
    any such new cases arise, Dynegy’s counsel would represent
    it and WCP

and/or

its
    subsidiaries with Dynegy and WCP each responsible for half of
    the costs and each party responsible for half of any loss.

The
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed FERC
    and remanded the case to FERC for further proceedings consistent
    with the decision. This matter concerns, among other contracts
    and other defendants, the California Department of Water
    Resources, or CDWR, and its wholesale power contract with
    subsidiaries of WCP. The case originated with a February 2002
    complaint filed by the State of California alleging that many
    parties, including WCP subsidiaries, overcharged the State. For
    WCP, the alleged overcharges totaled approximately
    $940 million for 2001 and 2002. With respect to WCP, the
    complaint demanded that FERC abrogate the CDWR contract and
    sought refunds associated with revenues collected under the
    contract. In 2003, FERC rejected this demand, denied rehearing,
    and the case was appealed to the Ninth Circuit where oral
    argument was held December 8, 2004. The Ninth Circuit held
    that in FERC’s review of the contracts at issue, FERC could
    not rely on the Mobile-Sierra standard presumption of just and
    reasonable rates, as such contracts were not reviewed by FERC
    with full knowledge of the then-existing market conditions. On
    May 3, 2007, WCP and the other defendants filed separate
    petitions for certiorari seeking review by the U.S. Supreme
    Court and on September 25, 2007, the Court agreed to



hear two of the filed petitions. Although WCP’s petition
    was not selected for review, the Court’s ultimate decision
    with respect to the other defendants’ petitions will apply
    equally to WCP. Briefs on behalf of the petitioners, the United
    States, and friends of the Court were filed in November 2007.
    Oral argument took place on February 19, 2008, with a
    decision expected by the end of the year. At this time, while
    NRG cannot predict with certainty whether WCP will be required
    to make refunds for rates collected under the CDWR contract or
    estimate the range of any such possible refunds, a
    reconsideration of the CDWR contract by FERC with a resulting
    order mandating significant refunds could have a material
    adverse impact on NRG’s financial condition, results of
    operations, and statement of cash flows. As part of the 2006
    acquisition of Dynegy’s share of the WCP assets, WCP and
    NRG assumed responsibility for any risk of loss arising from
    this case unless any such loss is deemed to have resulted from
    certain acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
    part of Dynegy, in which case any such loss would be shared
    equally by WCP and Dynegy.

Connecticut Light & Power Company v. NRG
    Energy, Inc.,

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Docket

No. EL03-10-000-Station

Service Dispute

(filed October 9, 2002);

Binding Arbitration —

On July 1, 1999,
    Connecticut Light & Power Company, or CL&P, and
    the Company agreed that we would purchase certain CL&P
    generating facilities. The transaction closed on
    December 14, 1999, whereupon NRG took ownership of the
    facilities. CL&P began billing NRG for station service
    power and delivery services provided to the facilities and NRG
    refused to pay, asserting that the facilities self-supplied
    their station service needs. On October 9, 2002, Northeast
    Utilities Services Company, on behalf of itself and CL&P,
    filed a complaint at FERC seeking an order requiring NRG Energy
    to pay for station service and delivery services. On
    December 20, 2002, FERC issued an Order finding that at
    times when NRG is not able to self-supply its station power
    needs, there is a sale of station power from a third-party and
    retail charges apply. CL&P renewed its demand for payment
    which was again refused by NRG. In August 2003, the parties
    agreed to submit the dispute to binding arbitration. In July and
    August 2006, the parties submitted their respective statements
    to the three member arbitration panel. On September 11,
    2007, the parties argued the dispute before a three judge
    arbitration panel. On February 19, 2008, the parties
    executed a settlement agreement ending the arbitration. A
    component of the settlement requires approval from ISO-NE.

Station Service Dispute

(filed October 2, 2000)

—

NiMo sought to recover damages less
    payments received through the date of judgment, as well as
    additional amounts for electric service provided to the Dunkirk
    Plant. NiMo claimed that we failed to pay retail tariff amounts
    for utility services commencing on or about June 11, 1999,
    and continuing to September 18, 2000, and thereafter. On
    October 8, 2002, a Stipulation and Order was entered,
    staying this action pending resolution by FERC of the disputes
    in this matter.

    Commission Docket No. EL

(filed November 26, 2002)

—

This is the companion action to the above
    referenced action filed by NiMo at FERC asserting the same
    claims and legal theories. On November 19, 2004, FERC
    denied NiMo’s petition and ruled that the Huntley, Dunkirk
    and Oswego plants could net their service station obligations
    over a 30 calendar day period from the day NRG Energy acquired
    the facilities. In addition, FERC ruled that neither NiMo nor
    the New York Public Service Commission could impose a retail
    delivery charge on the NRG facilities because they are
    interconnected to transmission and not to distribution. On
    April 22, 2005, FERC denied NiMo’s motion for
    rehearing and on October 23, 2006, the U.S. Court of
    Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied rehearing. On April 30,
    2007, the U.S. Supreme Court denied NiMo’s request for
    review of the D.C. Circuit decision thus ending further avenues
    to appeal FERC’s ruling in this matter. NRG believes it is
    adequately reserved.

U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming-Cheyenne
    Division

(filed July 30, 2007

,

amended
    compliant filed December 3, 2007)

—

The complaint alleges multiple breaches
    in 2007 of a 1978 coal supply agreement as amended by a later
    1987 agreement, which plaintiff alleges is a “take or
    pay” contract. Plaintiff is seeking damages of
    approximately $18 million. Certain of the defendants filed
    a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and
    certain other defendants filed a motion to



dismiss for lack of a case in controversy. The court will hear
    oral argument on these and other motions on July 11, 2008.
    The trial has been scheduled to begin on September 8, 2008.

Native Village of Kivalina and City of Kivalina v.
    ExxonMobil Corporation, et. al

, U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of California

(filed February 26,
    2008)

—

Numerous electric generating
    companies and oil and gas companies have been named as
    defendants in this complaint, which has been filed but not yet
    served on NRG. Damages of up to $400 million have been
    asserted. The complaint alleges that the carbon dioxide
    emissions of defendants contribute to global climate change
    which has harmed the plaintiffs. The complaint is filed on
    behalf of an Alaskan town made up of native tribes and seeks
    damages associated with those tribes having to relocate from the
    northern coast of Alaska, purportedly because of the effects of
    global warming.

Additional Litigation —

In addition to
    the foregoing, NRG is party to other litigation or legal
    proceedings. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to
    the legal proceedings and investigations described above and
    intends to defend them vigorously. However, litigation is
    inherently subject to many uncertainties. There can be no
    assurance that additional litigation will not be filed against
    the Company or its subsidiaries in the future asserting similar
    or different legal theories and seeking similar or different
    types of damages and relief. Unless specified above, the Company
    is unable to predict the outcome these legal proceedings and
    investigations may have or reasonably estimate the scope or
    amount of any associated costs and potential liabilities. An
    unfavorable outcome in one or more of these proceedings could
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The
    Company also has indemnity rights for some of these proceedings
    to reimburse the Company for certain legal expenses and to
    offset certain amounts deemed to be owed in the event of an
    unfavorable litigation outcome.

Disputed Claims Reserve —

As part of
    NRG’s plan of reorganization, NRG funded a disputed claims
    reserve for the satisfaction of certain general unsecured claims
    that were disputed claims as of the effective date of the plan.
    Under the terms of the plan, as such claims are resolved, the
    claimants are paid from the reserve on the same basis as if they
    had been paid out in the bankruptcy. To the extent the aggregate
    amount required to be paid on the disputed claims exceeds the
    amount remaining in the funded claims reserve, NRG will be
    obligated to provide additional cash and common stock to satisfy
    the claims. Any excess funds in the disputed claims reserve will
    be reallocated to the creditor pool for the pro rata benefit of
    all allowed claims. The contributed common stock and cash in the
    reserves are held by an escrow agent to complete the
    distribution and settlement process. Since NRG has surrendered
    control over the common stock and cash provided to the disputed
    claims reserve, NRG recognized the issuance of the common stock
    as of December 6, 2003, and removed the cash amounts from
    the Company’s balance sheets. Similarly, NRG removed the
    obligations relevant to the claims from the balance sheets when
    the common stock was issued and cash contributed.

On April 3, 2006, the Company made a supplemental
    distribution to creditors under the Company’s
    Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan totaling $25 million in
    cash and 5,082,000 shares of common stock. As of
    February 7, 2008, the reserve held approximately
    $10 million in cash and approximately 1,317,138 shares
    of common stock. NRG believes the cash and stock together
    represent sufficient funds to satisfy all remaining disputed
    claims.

    Information and Holders

NRG’s authorized capital stock consists of
    500,000,000 shares of NRG common stock and
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. A total of
    16,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock are
    available for issuance under NRG’s Long-Term Incentive
    Plan. NRG has also filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware
    a Certificate of Designation for each of the following shares of
    the Company’s preferred stock: (i) 4% Redeemable
    Perpetual Preferred Stock, (ii) 3.625% Convertible
    Perpetual Preferred Stock, and (iii) 5.75% Mandatory
    Convertible Preferred Stock.

On April 25, 2007, NRG’s Board of Directors approved a
    two-for-one stock split of the Company’s outstanding shares
    of common stock which was effected through a stock dividend. The
    stock split entitled each stockholder of record at the close of
    business on May 22, 2007 to receive one additional share
    for every outstanding share of common stock held. The additional
    shares resulting from the stock split were distributed by the
    Company’s transfer agent on May 31, 2007. All share
    and per share amounts within this

Form 10-K

retroactively reflect the effect of the stock split.

NRG’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
    and has been assigned the symbol: NRG. NRG has submitted to the
    New York Stock Exchange its annual certificate from its Chief
    Executive Officer certifying that he is not aware of any
    violation by the Company of New York Stock Exchange corporate
    governance listing standards. The high and low sales prices, as
    well as the closing price for the Company’s common stock on

NRG Energy, Inc.’s Long-Term
    Incentive Plan, or the LTIP, became effective upon the
    Company’s emergence from bankruptcy. The LTIP was
    subsequently approved by the Company’s stockholders on
    August 4, 2004 and was amended on April 28, 2006 to
    increase the number of shares available for issuance to
    16,000,000, on a post-split basis, and again on December 8,
    2006 to make technical and administrative changes. The LTIP
    provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
    restricted stock, performance units, deferred stock units and
    dividend equivalent rights. NRG’s directors, officers and
    employees, as well as other individuals performing services for,
    or to whom an offer of employment has been extended by the
    Company, are eligible to receive grants under the LTIP. The
    purpose of the LTIP is to promote the Company’s long-term
    growth and profitability by providing these individuals with
    incentives to maximize stockholder value and otherwise
    contribute to the Company’s success and to enable the
    Company to attract, retain and reward the best available persons
    for positions of responsibility. The Compensation Committee of
    the Board of Directors administers the LTIP. There were
    7,941,758 and 8,602,978 shares of common stock remaining
    available for grants of awards under NRG’s LTIP as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In addition, on April 25, 2007, NRG’s Board of
    Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of the
    Company’s outstanding shares of common stock which was
    effected through a stock dividend. The stock split entitled each
    stockholder of record at the close of business on May 22,
    2007 to receive one additional share for every outstanding share
    of common stock held. The additional shares resulting from the
    stock split were distributed by the Company’s transfer
    agent on May 31, 2007. All share and per share amounts

Energy revenue consists of revenues received from third parties
    for sales in the day-ahead and real-time markets, as well as
    bilateral sales. Beginning in 2006, energy revenues also
    included revenues from the settlement of financial instruments
    that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment.

Capacity revenue consists of revenues received from a third
    party at either the market or negotiated contract rates for
    making installed generation capacity available in order to
    satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements. In
    addition, capacity revenue includes revenue received under
    tolling arrangements, which entitle third parties to dispatch
    NRG’s facilities and assume title to the electrical
    generation produced from that facility.

Risk management activities are comprised of fair value changes
    of financial instruments that have yet to be settled as well as
    ineffectiveness on financial transactions accorded cash flow
    hedge accounting treatment. It also includes the settlement of
    all derivative transactions that do not qualify for cash flow
    hedge accounting treatment. Prior to 2006, risk management
    activities included the settlement of financial instruments that
    qualified for cash flow hedge accounting treatment.

Thermal revenue consists of revenues received from the sale of
    steam, hot and chilled water generally produced at a central
    district energy plant and sold to commercial, governmental and
    residential buildings for space heating, domestic hot water
    heating and air conditioning. It also includes the sale of
    high-pressure steam produced and delivered to industrial
    customers that is used as part of an industrial process.

Contract amortization revenues consists of acquired power
    contracts, gas swaps, and certain power sales agreements assumed
    at Fresh Start related to the sale of electric capacity and
    energy in future periods, which are amortized into revenue over
    the term of the underlying contracts based on actual generation
    or contracted volumes.

Hedge Reset is the impact from the net settlement of long-term
    power contracts and gas swaps by negotiating prices to current
    market. This transaction was completed in November 2006. Also
    see Item 15 — Note 5,

Accounting for
    Derivatives and Hedging Activities

, to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a further discussion.

Other revenue primarily consists of operations and maintenance
    fees, or O&M fees, sale of natural gas and emission
    allowances, and revenue from ancillary services. O&M fees
    consist of revenues received from providing certain
    unconsolidated affiliates with services under long-term
    operating agreements. Ancillary services are comprised of the
    sale of energy-related products associated with the generation
    of electrical energy such as spinning reserves, reactive power
    and other similar products.

Executive
    Summary

Overview

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a wholesale power
    generation company with a significant presence in major
    competitive power markets in the United States. NRG is engaged
    in the ownership, development, construction and operation of
    power generation facilities, the transacting in and trading of
    fuel and transportation services, and the trading of energy,
    capacity and related products in the United States and select
    international markets. As of December 31, 2007, NRG had a
    total global portfolio of 191 active operating generation units
    at 49 power generation plants, with an aggregate generation
    capacity of approximately 24,115 MW and approximately
    740 MW under construction which includes partnership
    interests. Within the United States, NRG has one of the largest
    and most diversified power generation portfolios in terms of
    geography, fuel-type and dispatch levels, with approximately
    22,880 MW of generation capacity in 175 active generating
    units at 43 plants. These power generation facilities are
    primarily located in Texas (approximately 10,805 MW), the
    Northeast (approximately 6,980 MW), South Central
    (approximately 2,850 MW), and West (approximately
    2,130 MW) regions of the United States, with approximately
    115 MW of additional generation capacity from the
    Company’s thermal assets. NRG’s principal domestic
    power plants consist of a mix of natural gas-, coal-, oil-fired
    and nuclear facilities, representing approximately 46%, 33%, 16%
    and 5% of the Company’s total domestic generation capacity,
    respectively. In addition, 15% of NRG’s domestic generating
    facilities have dual or multiple fuel capacity, which allows
    plants to



dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option. NRG’s domestic
    generation facilities consist of baseload, intermediate and
    peaking power generation facilities, the ranking of which is
    referred to as Merit Order, and include thermal energy
    production plants. The sale of capacity and power from baseload
    generation facilities accounts for the majority of the
    Company’s revenues and provides a stable source of cash
    flow. In addition, NRG’s generation portfolio provides the
    Company with opportunities to capture additional revenues by
    selling power during periods of peak demand, offering capacity
    or similar products to retail electric providers and others, and
    providing ancillary services to support system reliability.

Business
    Strategy

NRG’s strategy is to optimize the value of the
    Company’s generation assets while using its asset base as a
    platform for growth and enhanced financial performance which can
    be sustained and expanded upon in the years to come. NRG plans
    to maintain and enhance the Company’s position as a leading
    wholesale power generation company in the United States in a
    cost-effective and risk-mitigating manner in order to serve the
    bulk power requirements of NRG’s existing customer base and
    other entities that offer load or otherwise consume wholesale
    electricity products and services in bulk. NRG’s strategy
    includes the following principles:

Increase value from existing assets

— NRG has a
    highly diversified portfolio of power generation assets in terms
    of region, fuel-type and dispatch levels. Through the

FOR

NRG initiative, NRG will continue to focus on
    extracting value from its portfolio by improving plant
    performance, reducing costs and harnessing the Company’s
    advantages of scale in the procurement of fuels and other
    commodities, parts and services, and in doing so improving the
    Company’s return on invested capital, or ROIC.

Reduce the volatility of the Company’s cash flows
    through asset-based commodity hedging activities

— NRG will continue to execute asset-based risk
    management, hedging, marketing and trading strategies within
    well-defined risk and liquidity guidelines in order to manage
    the value of the Company’s physical and contractual assets.
    The Company’s marketing and hedging philosophy is centered
    on generating stable returns from its portfolio of baseload
    power generation assets while preserving an ability to
    capitalize on strong spot market conditions and to capture the
    extrinsic value of the Company’s intermediate and peaking
    facilities and portions of its baseload fleet. NRG believes that
    it can successfully execute this strategy by (i) leveraging
    its expertise in marketing power and ancillary services,
    (ii) its knowledge of markets, (iii) its balanced
    financial structure and (iv) its diverse portfolio of power
    generation assets.

Pursue additional growth opportunities at existing
    sites

— NRG is favorably positioned to pursue
    growth opportunities through expansion of its existing
    generating capacity and development of new generating capacity
    at its existing facilities. NRG intends to invest in its
    existing assets through plant improvements, repowerings,
    brownfield development and site expansions to meet anticipated
    requirements for additional capacity in NRG’s core markets.
    Through the

Repowering

NRG initiative, NRG will continue
    to develop, construct and operate new and enhanced power
    generation facilities at its existing sites, with an emphasis on
    new baseload capacity that is supported by long-term power sales
    agreements and financed with limited or non-recourse project
    financing. NRG expects that these efforts will provide one or
    more of the following benefits: improved heat rates; lower
    delivered costs; expanded electricity production capability; an
    improved ability to dispatch economically across the Merit
    Order; increased technological and fuel diversity; and reduced
    environmental impacts, including facilities that either have
    near zero GHG, emissions or can be equipped to capture and
    sequester GHG emissions.

Reduce carbon intensity of portfolio while taking advantage
    of carbon-driven business opportunities

— NRG
    continues to actively pursue investments in new generating
    facilities and technologies that will be highly efficient and
    will employ no and low carbon technologies to limit
    CO


emissions and other air emission. Through the

Repowering

NRG and econrg initiatives, NRG is focused on
    the development of low or no GHG emitting energy generating
    sources, such as nuclear, wind, ‘clean’ coal and gas,
    and the employment of post-combustion capture technologies,
    which represents significant commercial opportunities.

Maintain financial strength and flexibility

—
    NRG remains focused on cash flow and maintaining appropriate
    levels of liquidity, debt and equity in order to ensure
    continued access to capital for investment, to enhance
    risk-adjusted returns and to provide flexibility in executing
    NRG’s business strategy. NRG will continue to focus on
    maintaining operational and financial controls designed to
    ensure that the Company’s financial position remains



strong. At the same time, the Company’s ongoing capital
    allocation objective includes scheduled repayment of debt based
    on the amount of cash flow by the Company each year, as well as
    an annual return of capital to shareholders, targeted at an
    average rate of 3% of market capitalization, of approximately
    $250 million to $300 million per year.

Pursue strategic acquisitions and divestures

—
    NRG will continue to pursue selective acquisitions, joint
    ventures and divestitures to enhance its asset mix and
    competitive position in the Company’s core markets. NRG
    intends to concentrate on opportunities that present attractive
    risk-adjusted returns. NRG will also opportunistically pursue
    other strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions or
    divestitures.

Business
    Environment

General Industry

— Emerging trends impacting
    the power industry include (a) increased regulatory and
    political scrutiny, (b) financial credit market disruptions
    triggered by sub-prime investment losses which may have, in
    part, contributed to current recessionary pressures, and
    (c) the development of power capacity markets intended to
    induce new investment in order to address tightening reserve
    margins. The industry dynamics and external influences that will
    affect the Company and the power generation industry in 2008 and
    for the medium term include:

Carbon

— At the national level and at various
    regional and state levels, policies are under development to
    regulate GHG emissions, including
    CO


,
    the most common pollutant, thereby effectively putting a cost on
    such emissions in order to create financial incentive to reduce
    them. It is almost certain that GHG regulatory schemes will
    encompass power plants, with the impact on the Company’s
    financial performance depending on a number of factors,
    including the overall level of GHG reductions required under any
    such regulation, the price and availability of offsets, and the
    extent to which NRG would be entitled to receive GHG emissions
    allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on
    the open market. While the passing and timing of legislation
    remains uncertain, the Company expects that the impact of such
    legislation on the Company’s financial performance, as such
    legislation is currently proposed, to have a minimal impact
    through the next decade. Thereafter, the impact would depend on
    the level of success of the Company’s multifold strategy,
    which includes (a) shaping public policy with the objective
    being constructive and effective federal GHG regulatory policy,
    and (b) pursuing its

Repowering

NRG and econrg
    programs. The Company’s multifold strategy is discussed in
    greater detail in Item 1,

Business

under Carbon
    Update.

Financial Credit Market Availability and Domestic
    Recessionary Pressures.

Triggered largely by the
    decay in sub-prime credit markets, the cost of credit has
    sharply increased while credit availability has declined.
    Capital intensive generators rely on the credit markets for
    liquidity and for the financing of power generation investments.
    Concurrently, economic indicators are pointing towards a
    potential slowdown in the United States economy. A sharp
    downturn in U.S. housing, the tighter credit conditions,
    and disappointing employment numbers, amongst other data have
    highlighted the risk of economic recession. Historically, an
    economic recession results in lower power demand and power
    prices. If an economic recession does occur in the near term it
    is unlikely to have a material impact on the Company due to the
    hedged position of its portfolio.

Consolidation

— Over the long-term, industry
    consolidation is expected to occur, with mergers and
    acquisitions activity in the power generation sector likely to
    involve utility-merchant or merchant-merchant combinations.
    There may also be interest by foreign power companies,
    particularly European utilities, in the American power
    generation sector. However, for the near-term, and particularly
    in the coming year, given the current financial market
    environment along with the uncertainty surrounding domestic
    carbon legislation, consolidation is less likely.

Infrastructure Development

— In response to
    record peak power demand, tightening reserve margins, and
    volatile natural gas prices, the power generation industry has
    announced significant expansion plans for both transmission and
    generation. In addition to traditional gas-fired capacity, much
    of the new generation announced would be from non-gas fuel
    sources, including nuclear and renewable sources. During 2007,
    18 gigawatts of previously announced pulverized coal generation
    projects were canceled due to increasing public and political
    concern regarding carbon emissions. The Energy Policy Act of
    2005 created financial incentives for non-traditional baseload
    generation, such as advance nuclear and “clean coal”
    technologies in order to reduce reliance on the more traditional
    pulverized coal technologies. Depending on the timing and
    location of this new construction, as well as



the construction activity in the oil and petrochemical sectors,
    access to experienced engineers, skilled operators, and
    maintenance workers could impact the timing and costs of these
    projects.

Market Developments

— A number of the markets
    NRG serves are currently undergoing changes. NE-ISO held its
    first auction in February 2008 for 2010 capacity commitments as
    part of its FCM, while in California, MRTU is scheduled to go
    into effect on April 1, 2008. PJM completed its first RPM
    auctions during 2007. The primary objective of these market
    re-designs are to provide timely and accurate market signals to
    encourage new investment in transmission and new generation in
    the locations where the new investment is needed. In addition to
    these capacity market developments, in December 2008, ERCOT is
    expected to fully implement the “Texas Nodal
    Protocols,” which will revise the wholesale market design
    to incorporate locational marginal pricing, replacing the
    existing zonal wholesale market design. The ERCOT market design
    is expected to reduce local transmission congestion costs, with
    impacts on pricing uncertain at this time.

Competition

Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive,
    commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants.
    NRG competes on the basis of the location of its plants and
    owning multiple plants in its regions, which increases the
    stability and reliability of its energy supply. Wholesale power
    generation is basically a local business that is currently
    highly fragmented relative to other commodity industries and
    diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide
    variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and
    identity of the companies NRG competes against depending on the
    market.

Weather

Weather conditions in the different regions of the United States
    influence the financial results of NRG’s businesses.
    Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for
    electricity and fuels. Changes in energy supply and demand may
    impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot
    and forward markets, which may affect the Company’s results
    in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of
    electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when
    temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of
    natural gas and oil are higher in the winter. However, all
    regions of North America typically do not experience extreme
    weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG is typically not
    exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its
    business at once.

Other
    Factors

A number of other factors significantly influence the level and
    volatility of prices for energy commodities and related
    derivative products for NRG’s business. These factors
    include:

•

seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand;

•

extreme peak demands;

•

available supply resources;

•

transportation and transmission availability and reliability
    within and between regions;

•

location of NRG’s generating facilities relative to the
    location of its load-serving opportunities;

•

procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical
    electricity system during extreme conditions; and

•

changes in the nature and extent of federal and state
    regulations.

These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices
    in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may
    vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences
    in:

•

weather conditions;

•

market liquidity;



•

capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas
    systems;

•

local transportation systems; and

•

the nature and extent of electricity deregulation.

Stock
    Split

On April 25, 2007, NRG’s Board of Directors approved a
    two-for-one stock split of the Company’s outstanding shares
    of common stock which was effected through a stock dividend. The
    stock split entitled each stockholder of record at the close of
    business on May 22, 2007 to receive one additional share
    for every outstanding share of common stock held. The additional
    shares resulting from the stock split were distributed by the
    Company’s transfer agent on May 31, 2007. All share
    and per share amounts within this

Form 10-K

retroactively reflect the effect of the stock split.

Impact
    of inflation on NRG’s results

Unless discussed specifically in the relevant segment, for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the impact of
    inflation and changing prices (due to changes in exchange rates)
    on NRG’s revenues and income from continuing operations was
    immaterial.

Capital
    Allocation Strategy

NRG’s capital allocation philosophy includes reinvestment
    in its core facilities, maintenance of prudent debt levels and
    interest coverage, the regular return of capital to shareholders
    and investment in repowering opportunities. Each of these
    components are described further as follows:

•

Reinvestment in existing assets — Opportunities to
    invest in the existing business, including maintenance and
    environmental capital expenditures that improve operational
    performance, ensure compliance with environmental laws and
    regulations, and expansion projects.

•

Management of debt levels — The Company uses several
    metrics to measure the efficiency of its capital structure and
    debt balances, including the Company’s targeted net debt to
    total capital ratio range of 45% to 60% and certain cash flow
    and interest coverage ratios. The Company intends in the normal
    course of business to continue to manage its debt levels towards
    the lower end of the range and may, from time to time, pay down
    its debt balances for a variety of reasons.

•

Return of capital to shareholders — The Company’s
    debt instruments include restrictions on the amount of capital
    that can be returned to shareholders. The Company has in the
    past returned capital to shareholders while maintaining
    compliance with existing debt agreements and indentures. The
    Company expects to regularly return capital to shareholders
    through opportunistic share repurchases, while exploring other
    prospects to increase its flexibility under restrictive debt
    covenants.

•

Repowering, econrg and new build opportunities — The
    Company intends to pursue repowering initiatives that enhance
    and diversify its portfolio and provide a targeted economic
    return to the Company.



Significant
    events during the year ended December 31, 2007

Results
    of Operations

•

Impact of Hedge Reset

— in November 2006, the
    Company reset legacy Texas hedges which resulted in an increase
    in energy revenue of $449 million as the period’s
    average contract prices increased by approximately $13 per MWh
    as compared to the 2006 average contract prices.

•

Development costs

— NRG incurred
    $101 million in net development costs primarily due to
    required engineering studies to obtain the Combined Construction
    and Operating License Application, or COLA, as well as
    development costs for other

Repowering

NRG projects. On
    September 24, 2007, NRG filed a COLA with the NRC to build
    and operate two new nuclear units at the STP site. Effective
    October 29, 2007, the City of San Antonio agreed to
    partner with NRG in the development and ownership of these new
    units, to reimburse NRG for a pro rata share of certain project
    costs NRG had incurred, and to pay a pro rata share of future
    development costs. NRG was reimbursed $42 million for costs
    incurred to develop STP 3 and 4 through October 31, 2007;
    $39 million of the total $42 million was recorded as a
    reduction to development costs.

•

Acquisition of Texas and WCP

— the inclusion of
    a full year of activity for the Texas region and WCP in 2007,
    contributed to an increase in operating income of approximately
    $76 million, compared to 2006.

•

New capacity markets

— the introduction of the
    Locational Forward Reserve Market, or LFRM, the Reliability
    Pricing Model market, or RPM, and transition capacity payment
    markets, increased capacity revenues in the Northeast region by
    $78 million.

•

Refinancing expense

— the Company recognized a
    $35 million write-off of previously deferred financing cost
    due to the refinancing of the Company’s Senior Credit
    Facility.

•

Interest expense

— the increase in debt due to
    the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, Hedge Reset transaction and
    the Capital Allocation Program increased interest expense by
    approximately $99 million.

•

Sale of ITISA

— on December 18, 2007, NRG
    entered into a sale and purchase agreement to sell its 100%
    interest in Tosli, which holds all of NRG’s interest in
    ITISA, to Brookfield Asset Management Inc. for the purchase
    price of $288 million, plus the assumption of approximately
    $60 million in debt. NRG anticipates the completion of the
    sale transaction during the first half of 2008. As discussed in
    Note 3 —

Discontinued Operations, Business
    Acquisitions and Dispositions

the activities of Tosli and
    ITISA have been classified in discontinued operations.

Other

•

STP Repowerings

— The NRC docketed the
    Company’s COLA on November 30, 2007, signaling the
    beginning of their comprehensive and detailed review process.
    The Company expects to achieve commercial operation for Unit 3
    approximately 48 months after issuance of the COLA, and
    commercial operation for Unit 4 approximately 12 months
    thereafter.

•

Cedar Bayou Generating Station

— on
    August 1, 2007, NRG and a partner entered into definitive
    agreements pursuant to which the two parties will jointly
    develop, construct, operate and own, on a


/


undivided interest basis, a new 550 MW combined cycle
    natural gas turbine generating plant at NRG’s Cedar Bayou
    Generating Station in Chambers County, Texas. In exchange for a
    50% undivided interest in certain tangible and intangible assets
    and rights to use facilities owned by NRG, the partner agreed to
    pay NRG $45 million during a

24-month

period.

•

Long Beach

— on August 1, 2007, the
    Company successfully completed and commissioned the repowering
    of 260 MW of new gas-fired generating capacity at its Long
    Beach Generating Station. This project is supported by a

10-year

PPA.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $404 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This was due to:

•

Energy revenues

— energy revenues increased by
    $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006:

•

Texas

— energy revenues increased by
    $972 million of which $217 million was due to the
    inclusion of twelve months activity in 2007 compared to eleven
    months in 2006. Of the remaining $755 million increase,
    $449 million was due to the Hedge Reset transaction which
    resulted in higher 2007 average contracted prices of
    approximately $13 per MWh. In addition, revenues from
    8.8 million MWh of generation moved from capacity revenue
    to energy revenue. Prior to the Acquisition, PUCT regulations
    required that Texas sell 15% of its capacity by auction at
    reduced rates. In March 2006, the PUCT accepted NRG’s
    request to no longer participate in these auctions and that
    capacity is now being sold in the merchant market. These
    favorable results were partially offset by lower sales from the
    region’s natural gas-fired units due to a cooler summer
    which resulted in lower generation of approximately
    2.7 million MWh.

•

Northeast

— energy revenues increased by
    approximately $138 million, of which $61 million was
    due to a 6% increase in generation, primarily driven by
    increases at the region’s Arthur Kill, Oswego and Indian
    River plants. The Arthur Kill plant increased generation by 448
    thousand MWh due to transmission constraints around New York
    City, the Oswego plants’ generation increased by 127
    thousand MWh due to a colder winter during 2007 compared to
    2006, and the Indian River plants’ generation increased by
    418 thousand MWh due to stronger pricing and fewer outages in
    the second half of 2007 compared to the second half of 2006.

•

South Central

— energy revenues increased by
    approximately $70 million, due to a new contract which
    increased contract sales volume by approximately
    1.3 million MWh and energy revenues by $69 million.
    Following a contractual fuel adjustment charge, energy revenues
    increased by $11 million from the region’s cooperative
    customers. This was offset by a $12 million decrease in
    merchant energy revenue.

•

West

— energy revenues decreased by
    approximately $72 million, excluding the first quarter
    2007, due to the tolling agreement at the Encina plant that has
    resulted in the receipt of fixed monthly capacity payment in
    return for the right to schedule and dispatch from the plant.
    The Encina tolling agreement replaced an RMR agreement under
    which the plant was called upon to generate and earn energy
    revenues for such dispatch.

•

Capacity revenues

— capacity revenues decreased
    by $320 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006, due to a decrease in Texas capacity revenues
    that were partially offset by increases in capacity revenues in
    the Northeast, South Central and West regions:

•

Texas

— capacity revenues decreased by
    $486 million due to a reduction of capacity auction sales
    mandated by the PUCT in prior years as previously discussed.

•

Northeast

— capacity revenues increased by
    $81 million of which $39 million of the increase was
    from the region’s NEPOOL assets and $36 million was
    from the region’s PJM assets. The NEPOOL assets benefited
    from the new LFRM market and transition capacity market, both
    introduced in the fourth quarter 2006. Capacity revenues
    increased by $24 million from the LFRM market and
    $18 million from transition capacity payments, which was
    offset by a $3 million reduction in capacity payments due
    to the expiration of the Devon plant’s RMR agreement on
    December 31, 2006. On June 1, 2007, the new RPM
    capacity market became effective in PJM increasing capacity
    revenues by $36 million as compared to 2006.

•

South Central

— capacity revenues increased by
    approximately $22 million. Of this increase,
    $15 million was due to higher billing rates as a result of
    the region’s market setting new summer peaks hit in 2006
    and 2007, $6 million was due to higher contractual
    transmission pass-though costs to the region’s cooperative
    customers and $3 million was due to improved market
    conditions at the region’s Rockford plants. In



August 2007, the region set a new system peak of 2,123 MW
    which will continue to impact capacity revenue in the first half
    of 2008.

•

West

— capacity revenues increased by
    approximately $54 million, of which $26 million was
    related to the inclusion of the first quarter 2007 compared to
    2006. New tolling agreements at the region’s Encina and
    Long Beach plants accounted for the remaining difference, with
    the Encina facility contributing approximately $15 million
    and the newly-repowered Long Beach facility contributing
    approximately $13 million.

•

Contract amortization

— revenues from contract
    amortization decreased by $386 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, as a result of the
    November 2006 Hedge Reset transaction, which resulted in a
    write-off of a large portion of the Company’s out-of-market
    power contracts during the fourth quarter 2006.

•

Other revenues —

other revenues decreased by
    $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006 due to:

•

Sale of emission allowances

— net sales of
    SO


emission allowances decreased by approximately $33 million.
    In 2006, we sold emissions in lieu of generation due to an
    unseasonably warm first quarter. Since that time the average
    market price for
    SO


allowances decreased by 28%.

•

Physical gas sales

— decreased by
    $7 million due to the lower sales of excess natural gas.

•

Ancillary revenues

— ancillary services revenue
    increased by approximately $27 million due to a change in
    strategy to actively provide ancillary services in the Texas
    region which increased revenues by $33 million. This was
    partially offset by a $4 million reduction in ancillary
    services in the Northeast region due to higher transmission
    costs following transmission constraints in the New York City
    area.

•

Risk management activities —

gains/losses from
    risk management activities include all derivative activity that
    do not qualify for hedge accounting as well as the ineffective
    portion associated with hedged transactions. Such gains were
    $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The
    breakdown of changes by region are as follows:

Risk management activities that did not qualify for hedge
    accounting treatment resulted in a total derivative gain of
    approximately $4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to a $124 million gain for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. NRG’s 2007
    derivative gain was comprised of $77 million mark-to-market
    losses and $81 million in settled gains, or financial
    revenue. Of the $77 million of mark-to-market losses,
    $128 million represents the reversal of mark-to-market
    gains previously recognized on economic hedges and
    $32 million from the reversal of mark-to-market gains
    previously recognized on trading activity. Both of these losses
    ultimately settled as financial revenues during 2007. The
    $34 million gain from economic hedge positions was
    comprised of a



$20 million increase in the value of forward sales of
    electricity and fuel due to favorable power and gas prices and a
    $14 million gain from hedge accounting ineffectiveness.
    This ineffectiveness was primarily related to gas swaps and
    collars in the Texas region due to a change in the correlation
    between natural gas and power prices. NRG also recognized a
    $49 million unrealized gain associated with the
    Company’s trading activity.

Since these hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk
    of commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy
    sold, the changes in such results should not be viewed in
    isolation, but rather taken together with the effects of pricing
    and cost changes on energy revenues. In late 2006 and during the
    course of 2007, NRG hedged a portion of the Company’s 2007
    and 2008 generation. Since that time, the settled and forward
    prices of electricity and natural gas have decreased, resulting
    in the recognition of unrealized mark-to-market forward gains
    and the settlement of realized positions at a gain. In 2006, NRG
    recognized forward mark-to-market gains as forward prices of
    electricity decreased relative to its positions forward; settled
    loss positions were driven by the out-of-market gas swaps
    acquired with the Texas Genco purchase.

Cost
    of Operations

Cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    increased by $113 million compared to 2006, but as a
    percentage of revenues it was 56% for 2007 compared to 58% for
    2006.

•

Cost of energy —

cost of energy decreased by
    approximately $24 million, to $2,428 million, for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, and as a
    percentage of revenue it decreased from 44% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, to 41% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. This decrease was due to:

•

Texas —

decreased by $95 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This
    included an additional month’s expense of $96 million
    in 2007, without which cost of energy would have decreased by
    $191 million. This decrease was due to a reduction in
    natural gas expense and fuel contract amortization, partially
    offset by increased ancillary service expense.

—

Fuel expense and purchased power expense

—
    Natural gas expense decreased by $170 million, which
    excludes January 2007 natural gas expense of $27 million.
    This was due to a decrease of 2.7 million MWh in gas-fired
    generation as a result of cooler summer weather, coupled with
    greater economic purchases from ERCOT and increased baseload
    generation. Despite higher coal-fired generation at the
    region’s W.A. Parish and Limestone plants, the
    region’s coal expenses, excluding January 2007, decreased
    by $13 million due to a 9% reduction in average contracted
    coal prices.

—

Fuel contract amortization

— decreased by
    approximately $43 million, excluding January 2007, due to
    declining forward fuel price curves below the contracted prices
    used at Acquisition.

—

Purchased ancillary service expense

— increased
    by approximately $34 million due to favorable market prices
    in purchasing this service in the market compared to providing
    the service from internal resources.

•

Northeast

— cost of energy increased by
    $26 million primarily due to $30 million in higher
    natural gas costs related to increased generation at the
    region’s Arthur Kill plant due to its locational advantage
    to New York City following transmission constraints during the
    last three quarters of 2007.

•

South Central

— Cost of energy increased by
    $104 million due to increases in purchased energy, coal
    costs and transmission costs.

—

Purchased energy

— increased by approximately
    $69 million due to increased market purchases following
    increased cooperative load requirements and planned maintenance
    at the region’s Big Cajun II facility.

—

Coal costs

— increased by approximately
    $17 million, of which $11 million was related to a 9%
    increase in coal prices and $7 million due to higher coal
    transportation costs.

—

Transmission costs

— increased by approximately
    $16 million of which $6 million was due to contractual
    increases related to network transmission service.
    Point-to-point transmission costs also increased by
    $10 million reflecting more off-system sales.



•

West

— Cost of energy decreased by
    approximately $76 million, excluding the first quarter
    2007, due to new tolling agreement entered into at the Encina
    plant in 2007, which requires the counterparty to supply their
    own fuel. Under the previous arrangement in 2006, the plant
    supplied the fuel.

•

Other operating costs —

Other operating costs
    which includes operations and maintenance expenses, or O&M,
    increased by $137 million, to $950 million, for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This
    increase was due to:

•

Texas

— other operating costs increased by
    $75 million, after excluding January 2007 expense of
    $39 million, other operating costs increased by
    $36 million. This $36 million increase was due to
    $25 million in higher O&M expense as a result of
    increased maintenance associated with planned outages and fuel
    handling at the W.A. Parish facility and $10 million in
    higher property tax expenses following an increased valuation
    after the Acquisition.

•

Northeast

— other operating costs increased by
    $18 million due to increased staffing costs and higher
    maintenance costs.

•

South Central —

other operating costs
    increased by approximately $28 million, $19 million of
    which was due to increased maintenance expense primarily related
    to planned outages. Additionally, the region disposed of
    $4 million in assets in conjunction with the outage.

•

Acquisition of WCP —

these results include
    $15 million of WCP expenses that were not included in the
    Company’s results in 2006.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

NRG’s depreciation and amortization expense for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, increased by $68 million
    compared to 2006. This increase was due to:

•

Texas acquisition —

the inclusion of Texas
    results for twelve months in 2007 compared to eleven months in
    2006 resulted in an increase of approximately $38 million.

•

Impact of new environmental legislation —

due
    to new and more restrictive environmental legislation, the
    useful life of certain pollution control equipment has been
    reduced. The Company accelerated depreciation on certain
    equipment in its Northeast region to reflect the remaining
    useful life, resulting in increased depreciation of
    approximately $13 million.

General
    and Administrative

NRG’s G&A costs for the year ended December 31,
    2007, increased by $33 million compared to 2006, and as a
    percentage of revenues was 5% in both 2007 and 2006. This
    increase was due to:

•

Texas and WCP acquisitions —

the inclusion
    of Texas results for twelve months in 2007 compared to eleven
    months in 2006 and the consolidation of WCP for the last three
    quarters of 2006 resulted in an increase of approximately
    $9 million.

•

Wage and benefit costs —

due to the
    expansion of the Company, including

Repowering

NRG
    initiatives, wages and related benefits costs resulted in a
    $28 million increase in G&A. Additionally, information
    technology and other office services to support this expansion
    increased by $8 million.

•

Franchise tax —

the Company’s
    Louisiana state franchise tax increased by approximately
    $6 million. This was because the state’s franchise tax
    is assessed based on the Company’s total debt and equity
    that increased significantly following the acquisition of Texas
    Genco LLC.

•

Non-recurring expenses during 2006 —

for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, G&A included
    non-recurring fees of $20 million of which $6 million
    were related to the unsolicited takeover attempt by Mirant
    Corporation and $14 million associated with the Texas
    integration efforts.



Development
    Costs

NRG’s development costs for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, increased by $65 million. These
    costs were due to the Company’s

Repowering

NRG
    projects:

•

Texas —

on September 24, 2007, NRG filed a
    COLA with the NRC to build and operate two new nuclear units at
    the STP site. During the period, NRG incurred $91 million
    in development costs related to STP units 3 and 4 project in
    2007. These development costs were reduced by a $39 million
    reimbursement related to a partnership agreement signed during
    the fourth quarter 2007.

•

Wind projects —

approximately $13 million
    in development costs related to wind projects primarily in Texas.

•

Other project —

approximately $4 million
    in development costs related to other

Repowering

NRG
    projects in the West region.

Gain
    on Sale of Assets

NRG’s net gain on sale of assets for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, was approximately $17 million. On
    January 3, 2007, NRG completed the sale of the
    Company’s Red Bluff and Chowchilla II power plants
    resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $18 million.

Equity
    in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates

NRG’s equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, decreased by
    $6 million compared to 2006. This decrease was due to the
    sale of multiple equity investments from which the Company
    earned $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Other
    Income, Net

NRG’s other income for the year ended December 31,
    2007, decreased by $101 million compared to 2006. This
    decrease was due to the non-cash settlement during the first
    quarter 2006 where NRG recorded $67 million of other income
    associated with a settlement with an equipment manufacturer
    related to turbine purchase agreements entered into in 1999 and
    2001. The settlement resulted in the reversal of accounts
    payable totaling $35 million resulting from the discharge
    of the previously recorded liability, and an adjustment to write
    up the value of the equipment received to its fair value,
    resulting in income of approximately $32 million.
    Additionally, in 2006, other income was favorably impacted by a
    $13 million non-cash gain associated with the discharge of
    liabilities upon dissolution of an inactive legal entity and a
    $5 million non-cash gain due to a favorable settlement with
    respect to post closing adjustments on the acquisition of the
    Company’s western New York plants.

During 2007, the Company recorded an $11 million impairment
    charge in the fourth quarter related to an investment in
    commercial paper reducing its carrying value to approximately
    $32 million. The Company earned $10 million less in
    interest income in 2007 compared to 2006, due to lower average
    cash balances.

Interest
    Expense

NRG’s interest expense for the year ended December 31,
    2007, increased by $99 million compared to 2006. This
    increase was due to:

•

Refinancing for the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC in
    February 2006 —

the Company significantly
    increased its corporate debt facilities from approximately
    $2 billion as of December 31, 2005, to approximately
    $7 billion as of February 2, 2006. This increased
    interest expense by approximately $12 million compared to
    2006.

•

Increase of $1.1 billion in debt for Hedge
    Reset —

the Company issued $1.1 billion
    in Senior Notes due 2017 in November 2006 related to the Hedge
    Reset, which increased interest expense by approximately
    $72 million.



•

Capital Allocation Program —

the Company
    issued a total of $330 million of debt to fund Phase I
    of the Capital Allocation Program during the second half of
    2006. This increased interest expense by $20 million
    compared to 2006.

In the first quarter 2006, NRG entered into interest rate swaps
    with the objective of fixing the interest rate on a portion of
    NRG’s Senior Credit Facility. These swaps were designated
    as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, and the impact
    associated with ineffectiveness was immaterial to NRG financial
    results. For the year ended December 31, 2007, NRG had a
    deferred loss of $31 million in other comprehensive income
    compared to deferred gains of $16 million in 2006.

Refinancing
    Expense

Refinancing expense decreased by $152 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to higher
    expense for the refinancing of the Company’s corporate debt
    for the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC on February 2, 2006,
    compared to the refinancing of the Company’s Senior Credit
    Facility during 2007.

On June 8, 2007, NRG completed a $4.4 billion
    refinancing of the Company’s Senior Credit Facility
    previously announced on May 2, 2007. The transaction
    resulted in a 0.25% reduction on the spread that the Company
    pays on its term loan and Synthetic Letter of Credit facility, a
    $200 million reduction in the Synthetic Letter of Credit
    Facility to $1.3 billion, and various amendments to provide
    improved flexibility, efficiency for returning capital to
    shareholders, asset repowering and investment opportunities. The
    pricing on the Company’s term loan and Synthetic Letter of
    Credit are also subject to further reductions upon the
    achievement of certain financial ratios. The refinancing
    resulted in a charge of approximately $35 million to the
    Company’s results of operations that were primarily related
    to the write-off of deferred financing costs as the lenders for
    approximately 45% of the Term B loan either exited the financing
    or reduced their holdings and were replaced by other
    institutions.

Income
    Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased by $55 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. The effective
    tax rate was 39.9% and 37.2% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to:

•

Increase in profits —

income before tax
    increased by $81 million, with a corresponding increase of
    approximately $32 million in income tax expense.

•

Permanent differences —

the Company’s
    effective tax rate differs from the US statutory rate of 35% due
    to:

•

Change in German tax rate

— due to a reduction
    in the German statutory and resulting effective tax rate, income
    tax expense benefited by $29 million for the year-ended
    2007.

•

Taxable dividends from foreign subsidiaries

— in January 2007, the Company transferred the
    proceeds from the sale of its Flinders assets to the
    U.S. creating additional income tax expense of
    approximately $25 million.

•

Lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions

— lower income tax rates at the Company’s
    foreign locations resulted in additional income tax expense
    during 2007 compared to 2006 of $8 million.

•

Non-deductible interest

— interest expense from
    the stock buybacks from Phase I of the Company’s Capital
    Allocation Program were non-deductible for income tax purposes,
    thus increasing income tax expense by approximately
    $7 million.

•

Change in state effective tax rate

— the state
    effective tax rate remains unchanged for 2007. This resulted in
    a net decrease in income tax expense of approximately
    $5 million as compared to 2006, after taking into account
    the movement in valuation allowance as a result of the change in
    rate from 2005 to 2006.

•

Subpart F taxable income

— a dividend was
    declared and paid in 2007 by NRGenerating International B.V. As
    result of this dividend, there was no Subpart F income compared
    to 2006. This resulted in a decrease to income tax expense of
    approximately $11 million.

•

Disputed claims reserve

— During 2007 as
    compared to 2006, the Company made no distribution from its
    disputed claims reserve, this increased income tax expense by
    approximately $28 million.

The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period
    depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business
    mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances
    in accordance with SFAS 109. These factors and others,
    including the Company’s history of pre-tax earnings and
    losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to
    realize deferred tax assets.

Income
    from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax
    Expense

NRG classifies as discontinued operations the income from
    operations and gains/losses recognized on the sale of projects
    that were sold or were deemed to have met the required criteria
    for such classification pending final disposition. For the years
    ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, NRG recorded income from
    discontinued operations, net of income tax expense of
    $17 million and $78 million, respectively.
    Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,
    2007 were comprised of the results of ITISA. Discontinued
    operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 were
    comprised of the results of ITISA, Flinders, Audrain and
    Resource Recovery. NRG closed on the sale of Flinders during the
    third quarter 2006 and recognized an after-tax gain of
    approximately $60 million from the sale.

Operating revenues increased by $3,185 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005. However,
    excluding the Company’s Texas region, the Hedge Reset
    transaction and WCP, total operating revenues decreased by
    approximately $44 million.

•

Energy revenues —

energy revenues
    increased by $1,315 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006, compared to 2005 with 50% contracted in 2006 compared to
    13% in 2005. Excluding the Texas region and WCP, energy revenues
    decreased by approximately $483 million or 26%.

•

Texas —

The acquisitions of Texas Genco LLC now
    referred to as the Company’s Texas region, contributed
    $3,088 million to operating revenues including
    $1,726 million of energy revenues.

•

West —

The acquisition of Dynegy’s 50%
    interest in WCP contributed $72 million to total energy
    revenues.

•

Northeast —

generation demand for the Northeast
    region’s intermediate and peaking plants declined by 54%,
    accompanied by a 19% to 23% year over year decline in power
    prices in the Northeast region’s three major markets.

•

Capacity revenues

— capacity revenues were
    $1,516 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to $563 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, an increase of $953 million. This
    was due to:

•

Texas —

the acquisitions of Texas Genco LLC now
    referred to as the Company’s Texas region, contributed
    $3,088 million to operating revenues including
    $849 million of capacity revenues.

•

West —

The acquisition of Dynegy’s 50%
    interest in WCP contributed $64 million to total capacity
    revenues.

•

Northeast —

Higher capacity prices for the New
    York Rest of State market, led to a $30 million increase in
    the Northeast region’s 2006 capacity revenues.



•

South Central —

The region’s capacity
    revenues also grew by $9 million as pricing increased due
    to increased peak demand.

Hedge Reset —

In November 2006, NRG
    executed a series of transactions designed to both extend and
    strengthen the Company’s baseload hedging positions and to
    enable further optimization of the Company’s ongoing
    Capital Allocation Program. It involved net settling legacy
    Texas region long-term power contracts and gas swaps by
    negotiating prices to current market levels with certain
    counterparties. This resulted in the accelerated amortization of
    approximately $1,073 million of out-of-market power
    contracts and $145 million of gas swaps derivative
    liability offset by a payment of approximately
    $1,347 million to the counterparties, for a net reduction
    of approximately $129 million in the Company’s total
    operating revenues. In addition, as part of NRG’s Hedge
    Reset transactions, the Company recorded $6 million of
    costs related to the transaction.

Risk management activities that do not qualify for hedge
    accounting treatment resulted in a total derivative gain of
    approximately $124 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to a $292 million loss for
    the year ended December 31, 2005. These losses were
    comprised of $171 million in settled financial revenue
    losses and $295 million of mark-to-market gains. The
    $171 million loss in financial revenues represents the
    settled value for financial instruments that do not qualify for
    hedge accounting treatment and were primarily related to
    $152 million in losses of gas swaps acquired with the
    purchase of Texas Genco LLC. Of the $295 million in
    mark-to-market gains, $172 million represents the change in
    the fair value of forward sales of electricity and fuel,
    including $28 million of hedge accounting ineffectiveness
    related to hedge contracts in the Company’s Texas region
    due to a decline in the correlation between natural gas and
    power prices. In addition, $90 million of the
    $295 million mark-to-market gains represents the reversal
    of mark-to-market losses, which ultimately settled as financial
    revenues. NRG also recognized a $33 million unrealized gain
    associated with the Company’s trading activity.

Since NRG’s risk management activities are intended to
    mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on revenues and
    cost of energy sold, the changes in these results should not be
    viewed in isolation, but rather taken together with the effects
    of pricing and cost changes on energy revenues (which are
    recorded net of financial instrument hedges that qualify for
    hedge accounting treatment). In late 2005 and during the course
    of 2006, NRG hedged a portion of the Company’s 2007
    generation. After entering into those transactions the forward
    prices of electricity decreased, mainly due to mild weather for
    much of the year in the Northeast region and the downward trend
    in natural gas prices in 2006. While settled prices also
    decreased, the Company’s 2007 settled loss position was
    driven by the out-of-market gas swaps acquired with the Texas
    Genco purchase. In 2005, forward mark-to-market losses and the
    settlement of positions at losses was related to the

run-up

in
    natural gas prices which occurred in the wake of hurricane
    Katrina and Rita resulting in the recognition of mark-to-market
    forward sales as gains.



Cost
    of Operations

Cost of operations includes cost of energy, operating and
    maintenance expenses, and non-income tax expenses. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, cost of operations was
    $3,265 million or 58% of total operating revenues compared
    to $1,829 million, or 76%, of total operating revenues for
    2005, an increase of $1,436 million. This increase in
    absolute terms, but decrease in relative percentage terms, was
    primarily due to the acquisition of the Company’s Texas
    region which incurred costs of $1,669 million. Cost of
    energy which includes fuels, purchased power, and cost contract
    amortization increased from $1,427 million for 2005 to
    $2,452 million in 2006. The increase of $1,025 million
    was primarily due to:

•

Texas —

The acquisitions of Texas Genco
    LLC now referred to as the Company’s Texas region,
    increased cost of energy by approximately $1,276 million.

•

West —

The acquisition of Dynegy’s
    50% interest in WCP increased cost of energy by approximately
    $79 million.

This was partially offset by lower cost of energy in the:

•

Northeast

— cost of energy decreased by
    $254 million, due to $143 million lower oil costs and
    $101 million in lower gas fuel costs as a result of lower
    generation from oil- and gas-fired assets of approximately 70%
    and 45%, respectively.

•

South Central —

cost of energy decreased
    by $66 million in 2006, as higher coal plant availability
    and increased utilization of the region’s tolling
    agreements reduced the need to purchase energy to support
    contract load requirements.

Other operating costs increased in 2006 by $411 million to
    $813 million, $393 million related to the acquisition
    of the Company’s Texas region and $33 million for WCP.
    Excluding the impact of NRG Texas and WCP, other operating costs
    were $15 million lower than last year primarily due to
    lower operating and maintenance costs, which benefited in the
    second quarter 2006 from an accrual reversal of $18 million
    related to a favorable court decision in a station service
    dispute at NRG’s Western New York plants. In addition, as
    part of NRG’s Hedge Reset transactions, the Company
    recorded $6 million of costs related to the transaction.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

NRG’s annual depreciation and amortization expense for 2006
    and 2005 was $590 million and $158 million,
    respectively. The Texas region’s depreciation and
    amortization comprised $413 million of the
    $432 million year-over-year increase.

General
    and Administrative

•

NRG’s G&A costs for 2006 were $276 million
    compared to $176 million in the previous year. Corporate
    costs represented $143 million, or 3% of 2006 total
    operating revenues and $112 million, or 5% of the
    Company’s 2005 total operating revenues. Excluding WCP and
    the Company’s Texas region G&A was lower by
    $17 million, despite having been adversely impacted by
    $6 million of costs associated with the unsolicited
    acquisition offer by Mirant Corporation and approximately
    $14 million of NRG Texas integration costs.

NRG incurred approximately $36 million in development
    expenses in 2006 to support its

Repowering

NRG program.

Equity
    in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates

Equity earnings from NRG’s investments in unconsolidated
    affiliates were $60 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to $104 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005, a decline of approximately
    42%. The decline in earnings was primarily due to:



•

Purchase of remaining 50% interest in
    WCP —

NRG’s purchase of the remaining
    50% interest in WCP accounted for $21 million of the
    decline, as the results of WCP were fully consolidated as of
    March 31, 2006. As part of that transaction, NRG sold its
    50% interest in the Rocky Road investment, which accounted for
    $7 million of the decline in total equity earnings.

•

Sale of Non-Core Assets —

NRG’s
    Enfield investment, which was sold on April 1, 2005, earned
    $16 million during 2005. Sales of other equity investments
    in 2006 included James River, Cadillac and certain Latin
    American power funds.

This was partially offset by a $4 million improvement in
    equity income from the Company’s MIBRAG investment which
    experienced improved results compared to 2005 as a result of
    fewer customer outages.

Write
    Downs and Gains/(Losses) on Sales of Equity Method
    Investments

During 2006, NRG continued to divest of its non-core assets by
    selling the Company’s interests in James River and
    Cadillac, as well as interests in certain Latin American power
    funds for a pre-tax loss of $6 million, a pre-tax gain of
    $11 million and a pre-tax gain of $3 million,
    respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, NRG recorded a
    $31 million loss due to the sale and impairment of certain
    equity investments. On April 1, 2005, NRG sold its 25%
    interest in Enfield, resulting in net pre-tax proceeds of
    $65 million and a pre-tax gain of $12 million. In
    2005, NRG also sold its interest in Kendall and recorded a
    pre-tax gain of approximately $4 million. These gains on
    sales were offset by approximately $47 million in
    impairment charges recorded last year. In December 2005, NRG
    executed an agreement with Dynegy to sell the Company’s 50%
    interest in Rocky Road LLC in conjunction with NRG’s
    purchase of Dynegy’s 50% interest in WCP. Based on the
    terms of the transaction which valued the Company’s
    investment in Rocky Road at $45 million, NRG impaired its
    interest in Rocky Road by writing down the value of the
    investment by approximately $20 million. The sale of Rocky
    Road closed on March 31, 2006. In 2005, NRG also recorded
    an impairment of $27 million on its investment in the
    Saguaro power plant. With the expiration of the plant’s
    long-term gas supply contract, the Saguaro power plant became
    exposed to the risk of fluctuating natural gas prices beginning
    in the second half of 2005, triggering a permanent write down of
    NRG’s investment value in Saguaro.

Other
    Income, Net

Other income increased by $102 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 to $156 million compared to the same
    period in 2005. Other income in 2006 was favorably impacted by
    $67 million of income associated with a non-cash settlement
    with an equipment manufacturer related to turbine purchase
    agreements entered into in 1999 and 2001, a $13 million
    non-cash gain associated with the discharge of liabilities upon
    dissolution of an inactive legal entity, and $5 million
    from the favorable settlement with respect to post closing
    adjustments on the acquisition of the Company’s western New
    York plants in 1998 and 1999. Other income was also favorably
    impacted in 2006 by $25 million of higher interest income
    related to higher levels of cash and more efficient management
    of cash balances.

Refinancing
    Expenses

Refinancing expenses incurred in 2006 and 2005 were
    $187 million and $65 million, respectively. In the
    first quarter 2006, this was due to:

•

Refinancing for the acquisition of Texas Genco
    LLC —

NRG partially financed the acquisition
    of Texas Genco LLC through borrowings under new debt facilities
    and repaid and terminated previous debt facilities. As a result
    of this financing, the Company incurred $178 million of
    refinancing expenses: $127 million was related to the
    premium paid to NRG’s previous debt holders,
    $34 million for the amortization of the remaining balance
    of a bridge loan commitment entered into on September 30,
    2005, and $31 million related to write-offs of deferred
    financing costs associated with NRG’s previous debt, and a
    credit of $14 million related to a debt premium write-off.

•

Redemption of Second Priority Notes —

In
    2005, NRG redeemed and purchased a total of approximately
    $645 million of the Company’s second priority notes.
    As a result of the redemption and purchases, NRG



incurred approximately $54 million in premiums and
    write-offs of deferred financing costs. NRG also incurred an
    additional $11 million in refinancing fees during the
    fourth quarter of 2005 related to the amortization of a bridge
    loan commitment fee that the Company paid related to acquisition
    financing.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
    $590 million compared to $177 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005. The increase in interest expense
    was primarily due to:

•

Financing for the acquisition of Texas Genco
    LLC —

interest on new debt issued to finance
    the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. See Item 15 —
    Note 3,

Discontinued Operations

,

Business
    Acquisitions and Dispositions

, and Note 11,

Debt and
    Capital Leases

, to the consolidated financial statements for
    a further discussion of the acquisition and the related
    financing. As part of the refinancing, NRG replaced its previous
    senior secured term loan with a new $3.575 billion senior
    secured term loan. In addition, NRG retired $1.1 billion of
    its 8% second priority notes and issued $3.6 billion in
    senior unsecured notes with a weighted average interest rate of
    7.33%.

In the first quarter 2006, NRG entered into interest rate swaps
    with the objective of fixing the interest rate on a portion of
    the Company’s new Senior Credit Facility. These swaps were
    designated as cash flow hedges under FAS 133, and any
    impact associated with ineffectiveness was immaterial to
    NRG’s financial results. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, NRG had deferred gains of
    $16 million in other comprehensive income associated with
    these swaps. See also Item 15 — Note 11,

Debt and Capital Leases

, to the consolidated financial
    statements for a further discussion on these interest rate
    swaps. In addition, NRG designated an existing fixed-to-floating
    interest rate swap, previously as a hedge of NRG’s 8%
    second priority notes, into a fair value hedge of the Senior
    Notes, which NRG closed on February 2, 2006.

Income
    Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased by $280 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005. The effective
    tax rate was 37.2% and 38.2% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

%

The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an
    increase in income.

•

Increase in profits

— income before tax
    increased by $755 million, with a corresponding increase of
    approximately $299 million in tax expense.



•

Permanent differences

— the Company’s
    effective tax rate differs from the US statutory rate of 35% due
    to:

•

Change in state effective tax rate

— the state
    effective tax rate was changed which resulted in a net increase
    to income tax expense of approximately $11 million, as
    compared to 2005, inclusive of the movement in valuation
    allowance resulting from the change in state effective tax rate.

•

Disputed claims reserve

— during 2006, the
    Company made distributions from its disputed claims reserve
    decreasing 2006 income tax expense by approximately
    $28 million.

The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period
    depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business
    mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances
    in accordance with SFAS 109. These factors and others,
    including the Company’s history of pre-tax earnings and
    losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to
    realize deferred tax assets.

Income
    from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax
    Expense

NRG classifies as discontinued operations the income from
    operations and gains/losses recognized on the sale of projects
    that were sold or were deemed to have met the required criteria
    for such classification pending final disposition. For the years
    ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, NRG recorded income from
    discontinued operations, net of income tax expense of
    $78 million and $16 million, respectively.
    Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,
    2006 were comprised of the results of ITISA, Flinders, Audrain
    and Resource Recovery. Discontinued operations for 2005
    consisted of the results of ITISA, Flinders, Audrain, Resource
    Recovery, Northbrook New York LLC, Northbrook Energy LLC and NRG
    McClain LLC. NRG closed on the sale of Flinders during the third
    quarter 2006 and recognized an after-tax gain of approximately
    $60 million from the sale. Discontinued operations for the
    full year 2005 included an $11 million gain on the
    disposition of NRG’s Northbrook New York and Northbrook
    Energy operations.

For the period February 2,

Operating
    Income

For the year ended December 31, 2007, operating income
    increased by $88 million compared to 2006, however
    excluding January 2007 results, operating income increased by
    $21 million. The primary drivers were:

•

Energy Revenues

— for eleven months of 2007
    compared to the same period in 2006 were up by
    $755 million, $449 million of which was due to the
    Hedge Reset transaction, as the average price of the underlying
    power contracts increased by $13 per MWh compared to average
    contract prices prior to the hedge reset. The balance of the
    increase in energy revenues was due to the sale of additional
    output as energy rather than under PUCT mandated capacity
    auctions.



This favorable result was offset by:

•

Capacity Revenues

— reduction in capacity
    auction sales reduced capacity revenues by approximately
    $517 million, excluding January 2007.

•

Contract Amortization

— the Hedge Reset
    transaction decreased contract amortization by approximately
    $498 million, excluding January 2007.

•

Gas-fired Generation —

lower natural gas-fired
    generation of approximately 2.7 million MWh, for the
    comparable eleven month period in 2007, was a result of cooler
    summer weather coupled with increased economic purchases of
    energy and ancillary services from ERCOT. Lower sales revenue
    for the eleven months was offset by natural lower natural gas
    fuel costs of $170 million and cash flow economic hedge
    improvements.

•

Development Costs

— increased by
    $44 million in 2007 compared to 2006 largely due to the
    development of STP nuclear units 3 and 4 project, including
    $2 million of expenses in January 2007. The
    $44 million increase also includes $39 million in
    reimbursements from a partnership agreement signed in the fourth
    quarter 2007.

Operating
    Revenues

Total operating revenues from the Texas region increased by
    $199 million during the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006. Excluding January 2007, operating revenues
    decreased by $56 million. This decrease was due to:

•

Energy revenues

— energy revenues increased by
    $972 million of which $217 million was due to the
    inclusion of twelve months activity in 2007 compared to eleven
    months in 2006. Of the remaining $755 million increase,
    $449 million was due to the Hedge Reset transaction which
    resulted in higher 2007 average contracted prices of
    approximately $13 per MWh. In addition, revenues from
    8.8 million MWh of generation moved from capacity revenue
    to energy revenue. Prior to the Acquisition, PUCT regulations
    required that NRG Texas sell 15% of its capacity by auction at
    reduced rates. In March 2006, the PUCT accepted NRG’s
    request to no longer participate in these auctions and that
    capacity is now being sold in the merchant market. These
    favorable results were partially offset by lower sales from
    natural gas-fired units due to a cooler summer which resulted in
    lower natural gas-fired generation of approximately
    2.7 million MWh.

•

Other revenues

— the region’s other
    revenues decreased by $27 million for the eleven months of
    2007 compared to 2006. This was due to a decrease in
    intercompany emission allowance sales of $40 million and a
    $19 million decrease in physical gas sales. This
    $59 million decrease was offset by a $33 million
    increase in ancillary services revenue due to a change in
    strategy to more actively provide ancillary services in the
    Texas region.

•

Capacity revenues

— capacity revenues decreased
    by $517 million, excluding $31 million incurred in
    January 2007. This decrease was due to the reduction of capacity
    auction sales mandated by the PUCT in prior years as described
    above.

•

Contract amortization

— revenues from contract
    amortization excluding January 2007 decreased by
    $405 million primarily due to the write-off of
    out-of-market power contracts during the fourth quarter 2006
    related to the Hedge Reset transaction.

Risk management activities

— The Texas region
    recorded a total of $33 million in derivative losses for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to a
    $30 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    The Texas region’s 2007 derivative loss was comprised of
    $66 million of mark-to-market losses and $33 million
    in settled gains, or financial revenue. Of the $66 million
    of mark-to-market losses, $83 million represents the
    reversal of mark-to-market gains previously recognized on
    economic hedges and $1 million from the reversal of
    mark-to-market gains previously recognized on trading activity.
    Both of these losses ultimately settled as financial revenues
    during 2007. The $19 million gain from economic hedge
    positions was comprised of an $8 million increase in the
    value of forward sales of electricity and fuel due to favorable
    power and natural gas prices and a $11 million gain



from hedge accounting ineffectiveness. This ineffectiveness was
    primarily related to gas swaps and collars due to a change in
    the correlation between natural gas and power prices.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy for the Texas region decreased by
    $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006. This included an additional month’s
    expense for January 2007 of $96 million, without which cost
    of energy would have decreased by $191 million. This was
    due to:

•

Fuel expense

— natural gas expense decreased by
    $170 million, excluding the January 2007 expense of
    $27 million, due to a decrease of 2.7 million MWh in
    natural gas-fired generation as a result of cooler summer
    weather, coupled with greater economic purchases of energy and
    ancillary services from ERCOT and increased baseload generation.
    Coal expenses, excluding January 2007, decreased by
    $13 million due to an 9% reduction in average contracted
    coal prices in 2007, despite a 1.1 million MWh increase in
    coal-fired generation at the region’s W.A. Parish and
    Limestone plants.

•

Purchased ancillary service

— increased by
    approximately $34 million due to the favorable market
    prices in purchasing this service in the market compared to
    providing the service from internal resources causing an
    associated decrease in natural gas expense.

•

Fuel contract Amortization

— decreased by
    approximately $43 million, excluding January 2007, due to
    declining forward fuel price curves below the contracted prices
    used at acquisition in February 2006.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses for the Texas region increased by
    $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    compared to 2006. This included an additional month’s
    expense for January 2007, of $53 million, without which
    other operating expenses would have increased by
    $97 million. This was due to:

•

Development costs

— on September 24, 2007,
    NRG filed a COLA with the NRC. The Company incurred
    $91 million in development costs related to STP nuclear
    unit 3 and 4 project in 2007, including $2 million in
    January 2007, compared to development costs of $14 million
    in 2006. Of the $91 million incurred this year,
    $39 million was reimbursed through a partnership agreement
    in the fourth quarter 2007. Fossil development costs was
    $6 million in 2007.

•

Plant O&M expense

— increased by
    $25 million, excluding January 2007, due to increased
    maintenance associated with planned outages and fuel handling at
    W.A. Parish, increased maintenance related to higher utilization
    in 2006 of the region’s natural gas fleet, and retirement
    of older assets.

•

Corporate allocations

— were higher by
    approximately $16 million.

•

Property tax expense

— increased by
    approximately $10 million related to the Texas acquisition.

Operating
    Income

Operating income decreased by $3 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to:

•

Cost of energy

— increased by approximately
    $26 million due to a 6% increase in generation at the
    region’s coal and natural gas-fired plants.

•

Other operating expenses

— increased by
    $26 million primarily due to increased maintenance and
    staffing costs combined with higher property tax.

•

Depreciation

— increased by $13 million
    reflecting the additional depreciation expense following the
    reduction in estimated useful lives of certain components of the
    region’s power plants as a result of new environmental
    regulation.

•

Offset by higher operating revenues

— of
    approximately $62 million due to increased generation,
    favorable pricing and the favorable impact from new capacity
    markets. This was partially offset by lower gains in the
    region’s risk management activities and lower sales of
    emission allowances due to a 28% reduction in market prices.



Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $62 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to:

•

Energy revenues —

increased by approximately
    $138 million, of which $61 million was due to
    increased generation, and $88 million due to a 9% increase
    in average realized market prices partially offset by an
    $11 million reduction in contracted bilateral energy
    revenues.

•

Generation

— increased by 6%, primarily driven
    by increases at the region’s Arthur Kill, Oswego and Indian
    River plants. The Arthur Kill plant increased generation by 448
    thousand MWh due to transmission constraints around New York
    City, the Oswego plants’ generation increased by 127
    thousand MWh due to a colder winter during 2007 compared to
    2006, and Indian River plants’ generation increased by 418
    thousand MWh due to stronger pricing and fewer outages.

•

Price

— on average, realized prices in the
    Northeast increased by 9% due to a mix of higher priced New York
    City generation coupled with improved economic energy hedge
    trading resulting in a $37 million increase in energy
    revenues.

•

Capacity revenues

— increased by
    $81 million, of which $39 million was from the
    region’s NEPOOL assets, $36 million from the
    region’s PJM assets and $6 million from the
    region’s New York Rest of State assets.

•

NEPOOL

— The region’s NEPOOL assets
    benefited from the new LFRM market and transition capacity
    market, both of which were introduced in the fourth quarter
    2006. Capacity revenues increased by $24 million from the
    LFRM market and $18 million from transition capacity
    payments, which were partially offset by a $3 million
    reduction due to the expiration of an RMR agreement for the
    region’s Devon plant on December 31, 2006 and by RMR
    payments from the region’s Norwalk plant which began in the
    third quarter 2007.

•

PJM

— On June 1, 2007, the new RPM
    capacity market became effective in PJM increasing capacity
    revenues by approximately $36 million.

•

NYISO

— New York Rest of State capacity prices
    increased by 75% as load requirement growth increased demand for
    capacity. This was coupled with the impact from the new capacity
    markets in NEPOOL which reduced exported supply into the New
    York market that further improved the supply/demand dynamics.

These were partially offset by:

•

Risk management activities

— The Northeast
    region recorded $27 million in derivative gain for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared to a $144 million
    gain for the year ended December 31, 2006. The
    region’s 2007 derivative gain was comprised of
    $16 million of mark-to-market losses and $43 million
    in settled gains, or financial revenue. Of the $16 million
    of mark-to-market losses, $45 million represents the
    reversal of mark-to-market gains previously recognized on
    economic hedges and $12 million from the reversal of
    mark-to-market gains previously recognized on trading activity.
    Both of these losses ultimately settled as financial revenues
    during 2007. The region also recognized a $15 million
    unrealized gain from economic hedge positions which was
    comprised primarily of a $13 million increase in the value
    of forward sales of electricity and fuel due to favorable power
    and gas prices. The region also recognized a $26 million
    unrealized gain associated with the Company’s trading
    activity. The $144 million derivative gain for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 was comprised of a
    $154 million unrealized mark-to-market gain and
    $10 million in settled losses. Most of these unrealized
    gains reversed out in 2007.

•

Other revenues

— decreased by $40 million,
    of which approximately $48 million was due to reduced
    activity in the trading of emission allowances following both an
    increase in generation and a 28% decrease in market prices. This
    decrease was partially offset by an $11 million increase in
    physical gas sales to third parties due to favorable trading
    opportunities in the market.



Cost
    of Energy

•

Cost of energy increased by $26 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to
    $30 million in higher natural gas costs related to
    increased generation at the region’s Arthur Kill plant due
    to its locational advantage to New York City following
    transmission constraints during the last three quarters of 2007.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses increased by $26 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to:

•

Plant O&M spending

— of $15 million
    due to increased plant staffing costs of $7 million,
    increased maintenance costs of $6 million and increased
    environmental remediation costs of $2 million.

•

Property tax

— increased by approximately
    $3 million due to a favorable tax decision in 2006 related
    to NYC assets of $10 million partially offset by a tax law
    change the same year that resulted in a reduction of property
    tax receivable of $5 million in 2006 and a $2 million
    reduction in property taxes at the New England plants in 2007.

•

Regional G&A expenditures

— Regional
    staffing and benefits increased by $3 million primarily
    related to the region’s

Repowering

NRG development
    efforts while corporate allocations increased by $5 million.

    compared to 2005

    period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each
    day during the period.

Operating
    Income

For the year ended December 31, 2006, operating income for
    the Northeast region was $461 million, compared to
    $218 million for the same period in 2005, an increase of
    $243 million. This was due to:

•

Risk management activities

— of
    $144 million in mark-to-market gains from risk management
    activities, compared to a $285 million loss for the year
    ended December 31, 2005. The favorable gain from risk
    management activities was largely due to weak forward power
    prices, which resulted in substantial unrealized gains in the
    region’s forward positions for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. In 2005, forward mark-to-market losses
    and settlement of positions at losses was related to the

run-up

in
    natural gas prices which occurred in the wake of hurricanes
    Katrina and Rita.

•

Natural gas costs

— mild weather reduced demand
    for natural gas, with average prices falling as much as 22% year
    over year. Falling natural gas prices reduced annual average
    power prices in the New York, NEPOOL and PJM markets by 23%, 20%
    and 19%, respectively.

This was partially offset by:

•

Generation

— mild weather also led to an 18%
    decline in power generation for the Company’s Northeast
    region to 13.3 million MWh in 2006, compared to
    16.2 million MWh in 2005. Generation from the region’s
    oil-fired assets declined by nearly 2 million MWh,
    representing 66% of the overall Northeast region’s
    generation decrease. Half of this decline was attributable to
    the region’s Western New York plants, which had more run
    time in 2005 due to that year’s cold January winter.

Total
    Operating Revenues

Total operating revenues from NRG’s Northeast region
    totaled $1,543 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006, compared to $1,554 million for the same period in
    2005, a decrease of $11 million.

•

Energy revenues

— decreased by
    $478 million to $966 million due to lower generation
    from the region’s Oswego plant and lower realized price
    from generation from the region’s baseload coal plants
    which reduced energy revenues by $318 million. In addition,
    the region had $23 million of adjustments in 2005 relating
    to prior year NYISO settlements and a $6 million reversal
    of a reserve due to a favorable court decision regarding
    spinning reserve payments.

•

Capacity revenues

— increased to
    $321 million, compared to $291 million for the same
    period in 2005. Of this increase, $28 million was due to
    higher capacity revenues in the New York State market. New York
    capacity revenues outside of New York City drove the increase in
    2006, as increased demand for capacity, coupled with a decline
    in imports of capacity into the market, pushed clearing prices
    higher. Capacity prices were also favorably impacted in the
    region’s New England market by $16 million due to the
    new LFRM market and the new transition capacity market. The
    Northeast region also earned $9 million more in RMR
    payments in 2006 with the approval of new RMR agreements. These
    were partially offset by $23 million of reserve reversals
    in 2005 following the settlement of prior year RMR agreements.

•

Other revenues

— which include emission
    allowance sales, natural gas sales, and expense recovery
    revenues, totaled $112 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to $104 million in the
    same period in 2005, an increase of $8 million. This
    increase was primarily related to $17 million in higher
    emission allowance sales as the Company sold emission allowances
    in lieu of generation during the first quarter 2006. Higher
    emission allowance revenues were partially offset by lower gas
    sales of $2 million, lower ancillary revenues of
    $3 million and lack of cost recovery revenues of
    $5 million related to the 2005 RMR agreements.

•

Risk management activity

— The total derivative
    gain for the year was $144 million, comprised of
    $10 million in financial revenue losses and
    $154 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains. The
    $10 million loss of financial revenues represents the
    settled value for the year of all financial instruments,



including financial swaps and options on power. Of the
    $154 million of mark-to-market gains, $50 million
    represented the fair value of forward sales of electricity and
    fuel transactions to support the region’s physical asset
    position, with $14 million of mark-to-market losses related
    to trading activity. In addition, $90 million represented
    the reversal of mark-to-market losses, which ultimately settled
    as financial revenues. In 2005, the total derivative loss was
    $285 million, comprised of $132 million in financial
    revenue losses and $153 million mark-to-market losses.

Cost
    of Energy

•

Cost of energy

— decreased by $254 million
    to $615 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    due to 18% lower generation from the region’s generation
    assets which resulted in a $143 million decrease in oil
    fuel costs, as lower oil-fired generation accounted for 66% of
    the total decline in generation volume. Gas fuel costs for the
    Northeast region decreased by $101 million. Coal costs
    increased by $11 million, despite slightly lower
    generation, primarily due to higher rail transportation costs.
    Emission allowance amortization costs declined in 2006 by
    $18 million, primarily due to lower generation, which
    resulted in lower consumption of emission allowances.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses for the Northeast region were
    $378 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a
    decrease of $15 million compared to the same period in
    2005. This was due to:

•

Plant utilities

— decreased by
    $20 million.  This was primarily due to a
    favorable court decision in the second quarter 2006 that allowed
    the Northeast region to reverse into earnings $18 million
    of previously accrued station power expense.

•

Insurance costs

— decreased by $8 million
    due to favorable renewals.

•

Corporate allocations

— decreased by
    $14 million due to the inclusion of the Texas region in our
    allocation methodology.

Offsetting these decreases were:

•

Maintenance expense

— increased by
    $15 million in 2006 primarily due to more extensive boiler
    tube work at the region’s Dunkirk and Arthur Kill plants to
    reduce forced outage hours, additional turbine maintenance and
    oil tank repair costs at the region’s Oswego facility.

•

Development costs

— increased by
    $8 million to advance the region’s

Repowering

NRG efforts.

Operating
    Income

Operating income for the region declined by $48 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to
    higher operating expenses, despite a 1% decrease in generation
    at the region’s Big Cajun II plant.

Operating
    Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $88 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to:

•

Energy revenues

— increased by approximately
    $70 million due to a new contract which contributed
    $69 million in contract energy revenues, increasing
    contract sales volume by approximately 1.3 million MWh. A
    contractual change in the fuel adjustment charge for the
    region’s cooperative customers increased energy revenues by
    an additional $11 million. This was offset by a
    $12 million decrease in merchant energy revenue as a result
    of satisfying increasing load requirement from the new contract.



•

Capacity revenues

— increased by approximately
    $22 million, of which $15 million was due to higher
    rates as a result of the region setting new summer peaks in 2006
    and 2007; the new system peak of 2,123 MW set in August
    2007 will continue to impact capacity revenue in the first half
    of 2008. Higher network transmission costs, which are passed
    through to the region’s cooperative customers, also
    increased capacity revenues by $6 million. Improved market
    conditions in PJM resulted in an increase of $3 million in
    merchant capacity revenue from the Rockford plants.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy increased by $104 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to:

•

Purchased energy

— increased by approximately
    $69 million as planned and maintenance outage hours at the
    region’s Big Cajun II facility increased by
    1,209 hours, primarily due to the planned turbine/generator
    outage at the Big Cajun II Unit 3 facility in the fourth
    quarter 2007. These increases were offset by a drop of $2.53/MWh
    in realized purchased power prices.

•

Coal costs

— increased by approximately
    $17 million, of which approximately $11 million was
    due to a 9% increase in coal prices and $7 million due to
    higher coal transportation costs.

•

Transmission costs

— increased by approximately
    $16 million. Network transmission costs, which are
    passed-through to the region’s cooperative customers,
    increased by $6 million due to load growth and increased
    utilization of the Entergy transmission system. Point-to-point
    transmission costs to support off-system sales increased by
    $10 million.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses increased by approximately
    $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006, due to:

•

Maintenance expense

— increased by
    approximately $19 million as the scope of work on planned
    outages were more extensive in 2007. The Big Cajun II Unit
    3 facility incurred a major planned outage in the fourth quarter
    2007, during which the generator was rewound, turbine controls
    were replaced with a modern digital control system, and the
    turbine steam path was replaced with a high-efficiency design.
    Asset disposals in conjunction with the outage added
    $4 million.

•

Franchise tax

— Louisiana state franchise tax
    increased by approximately $6 million due to an increased
    assessment based on the Company’s total debt and equity.
    The Company’s total debt and equity increased significantly
    following the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC.

Operating
    Income

The South Central region realized operating income of
    $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to operating income of $8 million for the same
    period in 2005, an increase of $97 million. This was due to:

•

Better plant availability

— due to lower
    planned and forced outages in 2006, which resulted in 11% higher
    coal generation in 2006 than 2005. The Big Cajun II
    facility achieved an EFOR of 3.13% in 2006 compared to 6.56% in
    2005, resulting in 907 fewer forced outage hours in 2006.

•

Lower outages

— In addition, the Big
    Cajun II coal units experienced 826 less planned outage
    hours in 2006 than in 2005. The forced outages in 2005 occurred
    primarily during the peak summer months when contract load is
    highest, requiring increased energy purchases than in 2006.
    These fewer planned outages in 2006 also resulted in
    $12 million of lower major maintenance expense, which
    benefited operating income.

•

Favorable price spreads

— allowed for resale of
    power received from the region’s tolling agreements,
    providing additional margins.



Total
    Operating Revenues

Operating revenues increased by $10 million in 2006
    compared to 2005. This was due to:

•

Energy revenues

— increased sales to the
    region’s contract customers were offset by lower sales in
    the merchant market.

•

Capacity revenues

— were $9 million higher
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 than in the same
    period for 2005, as the peak of 2011 MW set by the
    region’s cooperative customers in August 2006 impacted
    capacity revenue in the latter half of 2006.

•

Risk management activities

— The region
    recognized $13 million from risk management activities in
    2006.

•

Contract amortization

— increased by
    $10 million due to increased megawatt hour sales to
    contract customers and the expiration of the Rockford contract
    in 2005.

•

Other revenues

— decreased by $19 million
    from 2005 levels, primarily due to $23 million in lower gas
    sales relating to the region’s tolling agreements.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy for the South Central region was
    $308 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to $374 million for the same period in 2005, a
    decrease of $66 million. This was due to:

•

Lower purchased power

— the cost of purchased
    power, including the costs of the region’s tolling
    agreements, was $74 million in 2006, a decrease of
    $71 million from 2005. This decrease was primarily due to
    fewer forced outages at the region’s baseload coal plants
    in 2006 and the impact of netting energy purchases and resale. A
    drop in average purchased power prices by $9/MWh from 2005 to
    2006 also contributed to the reduction in purchased power costs.
    As a result of improved plant availability, energy purchased by
    the South Central region to support load contracts dropped 16%.
    The South Central region increased its use of generation from
    tolled facilities in 2006; tolled combined cycle plants
    contributed 1,451,758 MWh to the region’s energy
    resources in 2006 compared to 474,386 MWh in 2005. The
    tolling agreements further contributed to the region’s
    results as the spread between gas costs and energy costs widened
    in the summer of 2006.

This was partially offset by:

•

Transmission costs

— increased by
    $7 million due to a combination of contractual increases in
    network transmission rates and higher peaks in 2006.

•

Coal costs

— increased by $25 million,
    reflecting contractual increases in coal commodity costs and
    higher plant availability in 2006.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses for the South Central region for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 was $89 million, a
    reduction of $22 million compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2005. The reduction was primarily due to lower
    major maintenance costs, which dropped by $12 million due
    to fewer planned outages at the region’s coal plant in 2006
    and lower insurance costs, which were $3 million less in
    2006 due to lower premiums.

Operating
    Income

Operating income increased by $31 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. Excluding the
    consolidation of WCP’s results following the acquisition of
    Dynegy’s 50% interest on March 31, 2006, operating
    income increased by $24 million, due to:

•

Capacity revenues —

increased by approximately
    $28 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, due to new
    tolling agreements at the region’s Encina and Long Beach
    plants:

•

Encina

— In January 2007, NRG signed a new
    tolling agreement for the region’s Encina plant which
    contributed $15 million in capacity revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

•

Long Beach

— On August 1, 2007, NRG
    successfully completed the repowering of a 260 MW natural
    gas-fueled generating plant at its Long Beach generating
    facility, which contributed approximately $13 million in
    capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007.



•

Cost of energy —

decreased by $76 million,
    excluding the first quarter 2007, due to the new tolling
    agreement entered into at the Encina plant in 2007, which
    required the counterparty to supply their own fuel. Under the
    previous arrangement in 2006, the plant supplied the fuel.

This increase was offset by:

•

Energy revenues

— decreased by approximately
    $72 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, primarily
    due to the tolling agreement at the Encina plant that has
    resulted in the receipt of fixed monthly capacity payment in
    return for the right to schedule and dispatch from the plant.
    The Encina tolling agreement replaced the RMR agreement under
    which the plant was called upon to generate revenues for such
    dispatch.

•

O&M expense

— increased by approximately
    $6 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, primarily due
    to increases in labor costs, major maintenance and auxiliary
    power.

•

Development expenses

— increased by
    $4 million, reflecting

Repowering

NRG initiatives at
    the region’s El Segundo and Encina sites.

•

Other revenues

— decreased ancillary service
    revenue of $3 million at the Encina plant due to the new
    tolling agreement that consigns ancillary service revenue to the
    counterparty in exchange for a fixed monthly capacity payment.

Operating
    Income

For the year ended December 31, 2006, operating income for
    the West region was approximately $8 million, compared to a
    loss of $6 million for the year ended December 31,
    2005. The 2006 gain in operating income was primarily due to
    NRG’s acquisition of Dynegy’s 50% interest of WCP. The
    California high-voltage power grid handled an all time record
    peak demand on July 24, 2006 at 50,270 MW, with the
    previous record peak demand of 45,431 MW set on
    July 20, 2005.

Total
    Operating Revenues

Total operating revenues for the year ended December 31,
    2006 were $146 million, comprised of $75 million in
    energy revenues, of which 39% were contracted, and
    $68 million in capacity revenues. This compares to
    $4 million in operating revenues, comprised of
    $1 million in energy revenues and $3 million in other
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Cost
    of Energy

Cost of energy for the year ended December 31, 2006, was
    approximately $80 million, consisting primarily of gas
    costs. For the year ended December 31, 2005, cost of energy
    for the West region was $1 million.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for the West region for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 were $55 million, or 38% of the
    region’s total operating revenues. These costs included
    $32 million in operating and maintenance costs, of which
    $10 million was related to normal maintenance expenses
    associated with outage work. The region also incurred
    approximately $19 million in G&A expenses, of which
    $4 million was related to development costs associated with
    the Company’s

Repowering

NRG program and
    approximately $3 million in corporate allocations. The
    increase was primarily due to the consolidation of WCP,
    development spending, and NRG cost allocations. This compares to
    $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Liquidity
    Position

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, NRG’s liquidity was

Management believes that these amounts and cash flows from
    operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance
    capital expenditures, to fund dividends to NRG’s preferred
    shareholders and other liquidity commitments. Management
    continues to regularly monitor the company’s ability to
    finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing
    activity in a manner consistent with its intention to maintain a
    steady debt to capital ratio in the range of

45-60%.

Credit
    Ratings

Credit-rating agencies rate a firm’s public debt
    securities. These ratings are utilized by the debt markets in
    evaluating a firm’s credit risk. Ratings influence the
    price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the



market the Company’s ability to pay principal, interest,
    and preferred dividends. Rating agencies evaluate a firm’s
    industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and hedge profile,
    among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firm’s
    credit risk.

SOURCES
    OF FUNDS

The principal sources of liquidity for NRG’s future
    operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived
    from new and existing financing arrangements, asset sales,
    existing cash on hand and cash flows from operations.

Financing
    Arrangements

Senior Credit Facility Amendment

On June 8, 2007, NRG completed a $4.4 billion
    refinancing of the Company’s then existing Senior Credit
    Facility which comprised a senior first priority secured term
    loan, or the Term Loan Facility, a $1.0 billion senior
    first priority secured revolving credit facility, or the
    Revolving Credit Facility, and a senior first priority secured
    synthetic letter of credit facility, or the Letter of Credit
    Facility. The refinancing resulted in a 0.25% reduction on the
    spread that the Company pays on its Term B loan and Synthetic
    Letter of Credit Facility, a $200 million reduction in the
    Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility to $1.3 billion, and
    various amendments to provide improved flexibility, efficiency
    for returning capital to shareholders, asset repowering and
    investment opportunities. The pricing on the Company’s Term
    B loan and Synthetic Letters of Credit Facility was also subject
    to further reductions upon the achievement of certain financial
    ratios. The refinancing resulted in a charge of approximately
    $35 million to the Company’s results of operations for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, which was primarily
    related to the write-off of previously deferred financing costs.

On August 6, 2007, NRG entered into an agreement with BNP
    Paribas, or BNP, whereby BNP has agreed to be an issuing bank
    under the revolver portion of the Company’s Senior Credit
    Facility. BNP has agreed to issue up to $350 million in
    letters of credit under the revolver. In addition, on
    January 30, 2008, NRG entered into an agreement with Bank
    of America, whereby Bank of America has also agreed to be an
    issuing bank under the revolver portion of the Company’s
    Senior Credit Facility. Bank of America has agreed to issue up
    to $250 million of letter of credit under the revolver.
    This increases the amount of unfunded letters of credit the
    Company can issue under its Revolving Credit Facility to
    $900 million. In addition, NRG is permitted to issue
    additional letters of credit of up to $100 million under
    the Senior Credit Facility through other financial institutions.

On December 31, 2007, the Company used cash on hand to
    prepay, without penalty, $300 million of its Term B loan
    under the Senior Credit Facility. With this prepayment, the
    Company has achieved a 3.5:1 threshold for its corporate
    leverage ratio as defined by its credit agreement, which would
    result in a 0.25% reduction in the interest rate on both its
    Term loan B and Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility which is
    expected to result in approximately $8 million in pre-tax
    interest savings during 2008. The prepayment will be credited
    against the Company’s mandatory annual prepayment which is
    required in March 2008 under the Senior Credit Facility.
    Beginning 2008, NRG must offer a portion of its excess cash flow
    (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) to its first lien
    lenders under the Term B loan. The percentage of excess cash
    flow offered to these lenders is dependent upon the
    Company’s consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the
    Senior Credit Facility) at the end of the preceding year. Of the
    amount the Company is required to offer, the first lien lenders
    must accept 50% while the remaining 50% may either be accepted
    or rejected at the lenders’ option.



Based on current credit market conditions the Company expects
    that its lenders will accept in full the mandatory offer
    required in March 2008, and, as such, the Company has
    reclassified approximately $146 million of Term Loan B
    maturity from a non-current to a current liability as of
    December 31, 2007.

Holdco Credit Facility

During 2007, the Company initiated a capital allocation strategy
    that contemplated NRG becoming a wholly owned operating
    subsidiary of a newly created holding company, NRG Holdings,
    Inc. or Holdco, with the stockholders of NRG becoming
    stockholders of Holdco. On June 8, 2007, NRG executed a
    Holdco Credit Facility, a delayed-draw credit facility that
    expired December 28, 2007, that provided for the funding of
    $1 billion in term loan financing to Holdco which was
    intended for Holdco to make a capital contribution to NRG in the
    amount of $1 billion, to be used to prepay a portion of
    NRG’s existing Term B loan. As part of the commitment, NRG
    agreed to pay a fee equal to 0.5% of the facility for the first
    180 days and 0.75% thereafter.

In November 2007, NRG exercised its right to provide its Senior
    Note holders with a conditional change of control notice, and
    related offer to purchase the Company’s Senior Notes at
    101% of par, prior to the actual formation of the Holdco
    structure. Concurrently, NRG also sought consent from its Senior
    Note holders to either waive the change of control or permit
    additional restricted payments under the indentures. In December
    2007, the conditional tender offers and concurrent consent
    solicitations expired with no tendered Senior Notes accepted for
    payment and without receipt of the requisite consents to amend
    the indentures for the Senior Notes. Consequently, the Company
    decided not to move forward and form the Holdco structure.

First and Second Lien Structure

NRG has granted first and second priority liens to certain
    counterparties on substantially all of the Company’s assets
    in the United States in order to secure certain obligations,
    which are primarily long-term in nature under certain power sale
    agreements and related contracts. NRG uses the first or second
    lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and
    letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post
    from time to time to support its obligations under these
    agreements. Within the first and second lien structure, the
    Company can hedge up to 80% of its baseload capacity and 10% of
    its non-baseload assets with these counterparties.

As part of NRG’s amended and restated credit agreement
    signed June 8, 2007, the Company obtained the ability to
    move its current second lien counterparty exposure to the first
    lien, on a pari passu basis with the Company’s existing
    first lien lenders. In exchange for moving some second lien
    holders to a pari passu basis with the Company’s first lien
    lenders, the counterparties agreed to relinquish letters of
    credit issued by NRG which they held as a part of their
    collateral package.

On October 30, 2007, NRG successfully moved certain second
    lien holders to a pari passu basis with the Company’s first
    lien lenders effectively releasing $557 million of letters
    of credit. With the movement to the first lien structure, the
    Company has significantly reduced its outstanding letter of
    credit exposure and thereby increased its liquidity. As of
    December 31, 2007, and February 1, 2008, the net
    discounted exposure on the agreements and hedges that were
    subject to the first and second lien structure were
    approximately $425 million and $340 million,
    respectively.

In addition, on February 7, 2008, the Company moved an
    additional counterparty to the first lien position that resulted
    in an additional return of approximately $65 million in
    letters of credit.

The following table summarizes the amount of MWs hedged against
    the Company’s baseload assets and as a percentage relative
    to the Company’s forecasted baseload capacity under the
    first and second lien structure as of February 1, 2008:

Common Stock Finance I Debt Extension

On February 27, 2008, the Company entered into an
    arrangement with Credit Suisse that allows the Company, at the
    Company’s option and subject to customary closing
    conditions, to extend the $220 million notes and preferred
    interest maturities of CSF I from October 2008 to June 2010. In
    addition, the previous settlement date for any share price
    appreciation beyond a 20% compound annual growth rate since the
    original date of purchase by CSF I, may be extended
    30 days to early December 2008. As part of this extension
    arrangement, the Company intends to contribute to CSF I
    additional collateral in the form of treasury shares to maintain
    a blended interest rate of CSF I facility of approximately 7.5%.
    The Company expects to implement this extension arrangement by
    March 17, 2008.

Asset Sales

ITISA

On December 18, 2007, NRG entered into a sale and purchase
    agreement to sell its 100% interest in Tosli, which holds all
    NRG’s interest in ITISA, to Brookfield Power Inc., a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management Inc., a
    Canadian asset management company, focused on property, power
    and infrastructure assets, for a purchase price of approximately
    $288 million, plus the assumption of approximately
    $60 million in debt, subject to purchase price adjustments,
    the receipt of regulatory approval and other customary closing
    conditions. NRG anticipates completion of the sale transaction
    during first half of 2008. As discussed in Note 3,

Discontinued Operations, Business Acquisitions and
    Dispositions

, the activities of Tosli and ITISA have been
    classified as discontinued operations.

USES
    OF FUNDS

The Company’s requirements for liquidity and capital
    resources, other than for operating its facilities, can
    generally be categorized by the following: (1) commercial
    operations activities; (2) capital expenditures including

Repowering

NRG project deposits; (3) corporate
    financial transactions; and (4) debt service obligations.

Commercial Operations

NRG’s commercial operations activities require a
    significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These
    liquidity requirements are primarily driven by (i) margin
    and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) initial
    collateral required to establish trading relationships;
    (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e., buying
    fuel before receiving energy revenues); and (iv) initial
    collateral for large structured transactions. As of
    December 31, 2007, commercial operations had total cash
    collateral outstanding of $85 million, and
    $556 million outstanding in letters of credit to third
    parties primarily to support its economic hedging activities.

Future liquidity requirements may change based on the
    Company’s hedging activities and structures, fuel
    purchases, and future market conditions, including forward
    prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition,
    liquidity requirements are dependent on NRG’s credit
    ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.

Capital Expenditures

The Company’s capital expenditures for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, increased by approximately
    $260 million, to $481 million, primarily due to
    expenditures on

Repowering

NRG projects. The following
    table

—

Repowering

NRG project capital expenditures consisted of
    approximately $76 million for the repowered Long Beach
    generating station and $67 million in deposits for wind
    turbines related to certain wind farms under development. In
    addition, the Company’s

Repowering

NRG capital
    expenditures included $7 million for the Cos Cob facility
    and $45 million for Cedar Bayou Unit 4.

Major maintenance and environmental capital
    expenditures

— In 2007, the Company initiated a
    baghouse project at the Huntley and Dunkirk plants which
    increased capital expenditures by approximately
    $71 million. Other capital expenditures included
    $60 million for STP fuel and maintenance, rotor work of
    $18 million for the W.A. Parish facility and
    $7 million related to the Limestone unit 2 facility,
    $5 million for Indian River unit 4 reheater, Oswego and
    Arthur Kill spare transformers of $4 million, LaGen Creole
    Station line rebuild of $4 million and Huntley Unit 67
    Boiler replacement of $3 million.

The Company’s estimated repowering capital expenditures for
    2008 primarily consists of approximately $327 million
    related to wind farm projects and approximately
    $172 million related to STP nuclear units 3 and 4. In
    addition, the Company expects to contribute approximately
    $83 million in equity towards its joint partnership with BP
    Alternative Energy North America for the construction of the
    Sherbino Wind Farm project in Texas.

NRG anticipates funding these maintenance capital projects
    primarily with funds generated from operating activities. The
    Company is also pursuing funding for certain environmental
    expenditures in the Northeast through Solid Waste Disposal Bonds
    utilizing tax exempt financing, and expects to draw upon such
    funds during 2008 and 2009.

Environmental Capital Expenditures

Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated
    that environmental capital expenditures to be incurred from 2008
    through 2012 to meet NRG’s environmental commitments will
    be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion. These
    capital expenditures, in general, are related to installation of
    particulate,
    SO


,
    NO

    and mercury controls to comply with Clean Air Interstate Rule,
    or CAIR, the Clean Air Mercury Rule, or CAMR, and related state
    requirements as well as installation of Best Technology
    Available under the Phase II 316(b) rule. NRG continues to
    explore cost effective alternatives that can achieve desired
    results. The range reflects alternative strategies available
    with respect to the Company’s Indian River plant.

NRG plans to reduce the impact of a portion of the above
    environmental capital expenditures. NRG has the ability to
    monetize a portion of the Company’s excess allowances over
    the 2008 through 2012 timeframe and still hold sufficient
    allowances to operate the fleet with proposed controls through
    at least 2020. Second, NRG’s current contracts with the
    Company’s rural electrical customers in the South Central
    region allow for recovery of a significant portion of the
    capital costs, along with a capital return incurred by complying
    with new laws, including interest over the asset life of the
    required expenditures. Actual recoveries will depend, among
    other things, on the duration of the contracts and the treatment
    of these expenditures.

Share Repurchases

For the year ended December 31, 2007, NRG repurchased
    9,044,400 shares of the Company’s common stock for
    approximately $353 million. Of these shares repurchased,
    7,006,700 shares of NRG common stock for approximately
    $268 million were associated with Phase II of the
    Company’s previously announced Capital Allocation Program,
    which was completed during the third quarter 2007.

In December 2007, the Company initiated its 2008 Capital
    Allocation Program with the repurchase of 2,037,700 shares
    of NRG common stock for approximately $85 million. This was
    followed in January 2008 with the repurchase of
    344,000 shares of NRG common stock for approximately
    $15 million. In February 2008, the Company’s Board of
    Directors authorized an additional $200 million in common
    share repurchases that would raise the 2008 Capital Allocation
    Program to approximately $300 million.

RepoweringNRG Project Deposits

NRG has made non-refundable deposits relating to

Repowering

NRG initiatives totaling approximately
    $71 million primarily towards the procurement of wind
    turbines. The Company believes that these deposits are necessary
    for the timely and successful execution of these projects. The
    deposits are in support of expected deliveries of wind turbines
    and other equipment totaling approximately $409 million
    through 2009. Although NRG is committed to their successful
    implementation, the Company may decide not to take delivery of
    the equipment and thus terminate the projects. This would result
    in the Company expensing the deposits it already has made.

On February 4, 2008, NRG through its wholly owned
    subsidiary, Padoma Wind Power LLC, had entered into a

50-50

joint
    venture with BP Alternative Energy North America Inc. to build
    the first phase of the Sherbino Wind Farm. The Sherbino I Wind
    Farm will be a 150-megawatt (MW) wind project, consisting of 50
    Vestas 3 MW wind turbine generators, located approximately
    40 miles east of Fort Stockton in Pecos County, Texas.
    NRG expects to contribute approximately $83 million in
    equity to the joint venture in 2008 and has posted a letter of
    credit in that amount.

Preferred Stock Dividend Payments

For the year ended December 31, 2007, NRG paid
    approximately $28.8 million, $16.8 million and
    $9.0 million in dividend payments to holders of the
    Company’s 5.75%, 4% and 3.625% Preferred Stock.



Debt
    Service Obligations

On December 31, 2007, the Company used cash on hand to
    prepay, without penalty, $300 million of its Term B loan
    under the Senior Credit Facility. With this prepayment, the
    Company has met a financial ratio by the end of 2007 that would
    result in a 0.25% reduction in the interest rate on both its
    Term B loan and Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility which is
    expected to result in approximately $8 million in pre-tax
    interest savings during 2008. This prepayment will be credited
    against the Company’s mandatory annual prepayment which is
    required in March 2008 under the Senior Credit Facility.

As of December 31, 2007, NRG had approximately
    $4.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured
    high yield notes or Senior Notes and approximately
    $2.8 billion in principal amount outstanding under a Term B
    loan and had issued $743 million of letters of credit under
    the Company’s $1.3 billion Letter of Credit Facility,
    leaving $557 million available for future issuances. Under
    the Company’s $1.0 billion Revolving Facility, as of
    December 31, 2007, NRG had issued $3 million in
    letters of credit, leaving $997 million available for
    borrowings, of which approximately $647 million could be
    used to issue additional letters of credit. As of
    February 15, 2008, $518 million of undrawn letters of
    credit remain available under the funded letter of credit
    facility, $897 million of undrawn letters of credit remain
    available under the revolving credit facility, and NRG had no
    borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facility.

In November 2007 NRG made a payment of $11 million on a
    revolving note after Merrill Lynch put the note back to the
    Company.

Principal payments on debt and capital leases as of
    December 31, 2007 are due in the following periods:

Cash Flow Discussion

NRG obtains cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of
    assets as well as proceeds from the issuance of notes and
    preferred stock. NRG uses these funds to finance operations,
    make interest payments, repurchase its common stock, service
    debt obligations, finance capital expenditures, and meet other
    cash and liquidity needs.



2007 compared to 2006

The following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the
    comparative years; all cash flow categories include the cash
    flows from both continuing operations and discontinued
    operations:

Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash provided by
    operating activities increased by $1.1 billion compared to
    the same period in 2006. This was due to:

•

Hedge Reset and derivative activity

— this
    increase was primarily due to the write off of power contracts
    of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006 and a
    corresponding $339 million reduction in contract
    amortization during 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of the
    Hedge Reset transaction. In addition, net income increased
    $226 million as a result of adjustments for derivative
    activity.

•

Collateral deposits

— following an upward shift
    of the forward price curves, NRG’s net collateral deposits
    in support of derivative contracts increased by
    $125 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to a decrease of $454 million during the same
    period in 2006, a difference of $579 million. As of
    December 31, 2007, NRG had net cash collateral deposit of
    $85 million.

Net Cash
    Used in Investing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash used in
    investing activities was approximately $3.9 billion less
    than the same period in 2006. This reduction in investing
    activities was due to:

•

Texas acquisition

— that occurred during the
    first quarter 2006. NRG acquired Texas Genco LLC for
    approximately $6.2 billion that included the issuance of
    common stock at a value of $1.7 billion and a net cash
    payment of approximately $4.3 billion;

•

Capital expenditures

— NRG’s capital
    expenditures increased by $260 million due to expenditures
    of approximately $197 million for

Repowering

NRG
    projects, primarily related to $76 million for the Long
    Beach plant and $67 million in deposits for wind turbines.
    In addition, the Company initiated a baghouse project at the
    Huntley and Dunkirk plants which also increased capital
    expenditures by approximately $71 million.

•

Discontinued Operations and Asset Sales

— In
    2006 NRG received proceeds of $261 million from the sale of
    Flinders, Audrain, and Resource Recovery. The sale of the
    Company’s Red Bluff and Chowchilla plants and equipment
    resulted in increased proceeds from asset sales by approximately
    $57 million for 2007.

Net Cash Provided/(Used) in Financing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash used in
    financing activities decreased by approximately
    $4.9 billion compared to 2006, due to:

•

During the first quarter 2006, NRG acquired Texas Genco LLC. As
    part of the acquisition, NRG refinanced the Company’s
    outstanding debt as well as Texas Genco LLC’s outstanding
    debt, and also issued new debt, preferred stock and common stock
    to fund the acquisition:

•

Total debt repayments were $4.6 billion —
    $1.9 billion of NRG debt and $2.7 billion of Texas
    Genco LLC debt.

•

Total proceeds from debt issued were
    $7.2 billion — $3.6 billion from unsecured
    notes and $3.6 billion from a senior secured facility,
    including a $1.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility, and a
    $1.5 billion Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility.



•

Total proceeds from stock issued of approximately
    $1.5 billion - net proceeds of $986 million from
    issuing approximately 21 million shares of common stock and
    net proceeds of $486 million from issuing 2 million
    shares of the Company’s 5.75% Preferred Stock.

•

For the year ended December 31, 2007, NRG repurchased
    9,049,400 shares of the Company’s common stock for
    approximately $353 million. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, NRG repurchased 29,601,162 shares for
    $732 million. The Company also used cash on hand to repay,
    without penalty, $300 million of its Term B loan under the
    Senior Credit Facility.

NOL’s, Deferred Tax Assets and FIN 48
    Implications

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had generated total
    domestic pretax book income of $860 million which fully
    utilized domestic NOL in the amount of $245 million. In
    addition, NRG has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of
    $288 million, of which $72 million will expire
    starting in 2011 through 2016 and of which $216 million do
    not have an expiration date.

In addition to these amounts, the Company has $683 million
    of tax effected unrecognized tax benefits which relate primarily
    to net operating losses for tax return purposes but have been
    classified as capital loss carryforwards for financial
    statements purposes and for which a full valuation allowance has
    been established. As a result of the Company’s tax
    position, and based on current forecasts, future
    U.S. domestic income tax payments will be minimal through
    mid-year 2009 as these unrecognized tax benefits will be
    utilized for tax return purposes.

However, as the position remains uncertain, of the
    $683 million of tax effected unrecognized tax benefits, the
    Company has recorded a non-current tax liability of
    $7 million and may accrue the remaining balance as an
    increase to non-current liabilities until final resolution with
    the related taxing authority.

On July 6, 2007, the German government passed the Tax
    Reform Act of 2008, which reduces the German statutory and
    resulting effective tax rates on earnings from approximately 36%
    to approximately 27% effective January 1, 2008. Due to this
    reduction in the statutory and resulting effective tax rate in
    2007, NRG recognized a $29 million tax benefit and as of
    December 31, 2007, NRG had a German net deferred tax
    liability of approximately $84 million which includes the
    impact of this tax rate change.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Instruments and Other Contractual Arrangements

Obligations under Certain Guarantee Contracts

NRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee
    arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate
    commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements
    include financial and performance guarantees, stand-by letters
    of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications.

Retained or Contingent Interests

NRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests
    in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.

Derivative Instrument obligations

On August 11, 2005, NRG issued 3.625% Preferred Stock that
    includes a feature which is considered an embedded derivative
    per SFAS 133. Although it is considered an embedded
    derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting as it is
    excluded from the scope pursuant to paragraph 11(a) of
    SFAS 133. As of December 31, 2007, based on the
    Company’s stock price, the redemption value of this
    embedded derivative was approximately $151 million.

On October 13, 2006, NRG through its unrestricted
    wholly-owned subsidiaries NRG Common Stock Fund I and NRG
    Common Stock Fund II, issued notes and preferred interests
    for the repurchase of NRG’s common stock. Included in the
    agreement is a feature which is considered an embedded
    derivative per SFAS 133. Although it is considered a
    derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting as it is
    excluded from the scope pursuant to paragraph 11(a) of
    SFAS 133. As of December 31, 2007, based on the
    Company’s stock price, the redemption value of this
    embedded derivative was approximately $87 million.



Obligations
    Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated
    Entity

Variable interest in Equity investments

— As of
    December 31, 2007, NRG had not entered into any financing
    structure that was designed to be off-balance sheet that would
    create liquidity, financing or incremental market risk or credit
    risk to the Company. However, NRG has several investments with
    an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and
    energy-related entities that are accounted for under the equity
    method of accounting. NRG’s pro-rata share of non-recourse
    debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately
    $122 million as of December 31, 2007. This
    indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to
    issue dividends or distributions to NRG.

Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility and Revolver
    Facility

— Under NRG’s amended Senior Credit
    Facility which the company entered in to on June 8, 2007,
    the Company has a $1.3 billion synthetic Letter of Credit
    Facility which is secured by a $1.3 billion cash deposit at
    Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, the Issuing Bank. This
    deposit was funded using proceeds from the Term B loan investors
    who participated in the facility syndication. Under the
    Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, NRG is allowed to issue
    letters of credit for general corporate purposes including
    posting collateral to support the Company’s commercial
    operations activities. On August 6, 2007, NRG entered into
    an agreement with BNP Paribas, or BNP, whereby BNP has agreed to
    be an issuing bank under the revolver portion of the
    Company’s Senior Credit Facility. BNP has agreed to issue
    up to $350 million of letters of credit. In addition, on
    January 30, 2008, NRG entered into an agreement with Bank
    of America, whereby Bank of America has also agreed to be an
    issuing bank under the revolver portion of the Company’s
    Senior Credit Facility. Bank of America has agreed to issue up
    to $250 million of letters of credit under the revolver.
    This increases the amount of unfunded letters of credit the
    Company can issue under its Revolving Credit Facility to
    $900 million for ongoing working capital requirements and
    for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions that are
    permitted under the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, NRG is
    permitted to issue additional letters of credit of up
    $100 million under the Senior Credit facility through other
    financial institutions.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had issued
    $743 million in letters of credit under the Synthetic
    Letter of Credit Facility. In addition, as of December 31,
    2007, the Company had issued $3 million in letters of
    credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. A portion of these
    letters of credit supports non-commercial letter of credit
    obligations.

Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments

NRG has a variety of contractual obligations and other
    commercial commitments that represent prospective cash
    requirements in addition to the Company’s capital
    expenditure programs. The following tables summarize NRG’s
    contractual obligations and guarantees. For an additional

Commitments and Contingencies

, to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a discussion of commitments and
    contingencies that also include contractual obligations and
    commercial commitments that occurred during 2007.

Derivative Instruments

NRG may enter into long-term power sales contracts, fuel
    purchase contracts and other energy-related financial
    instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to
    fluctuations in spot market prices, to hedge fuel requirements
    at generation facilities and protect fuel inventories. In
    addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated
    with the issuance of the Company’s variable rate and fixed
    rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements.

NRG’s trading activities include contracts entered into to
    profit from market price changes as opposed to hedging an
    exposure, and are subject to limits in accordance with the
    Company’s risk management policy. These contracts are
    recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the
    fair value of these derivative financial instruments are
    recognized in earnings. These trading activities are a
    complement to NRG’s energy marketing portfolio.

The tables below disclose the activities that include
    non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value.
    Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized
    changes in fair value; identify changes in fair value

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

NRG’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition
    and results of operations are based upon the consolidated
    financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. The preparation of these financial statements
    and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, or GAAP, requires the application of
    appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as
    the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
    related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The
    application of these policies necessarily involves judgments
    regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of
    particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges. These
    judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the
    financial statements and disclosures based on varying
    assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the
    financial and operating environment may also have a significant
    effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the
    results reported through the application of accounting measures
    used in preparing the financial statements and related
    disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have
    not changed.

On an ongoing basis, NRG evaluates these estimates, utilizing
    historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods
    the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results
    may differ substantially from the Company’s estimates. Any
    effects on the Company’s business, financial position or
    results of operations resulting from revisions to these
    estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that
    give rise to the revision become known.

NRG’s significant accounting policies are summarized in
    Item 15 — Note 2,

Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

, to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting
    policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to
    the portrayal of the Company’s financial position and
    results of operations, and that require the most difficult,
    subjective

and/or

complex judgments by management regarding estimates about
    matters that are inherently uncertain.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company follows the guidance of SFAS 133, to account
    for derivative financial instruments. SFAS 133 requires the
    Company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the
    balance sheet, and recognize changes in the fair value of
    non-hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. In
    certain cases, NRG may apply hedge accounting to the
    Company’s derivative instruments. The criteria used to
    determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are:
    (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure,
    (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and
    (iii) if there is a correlation between the fair value of
    the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item.
    Changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted
    for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to
    the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or
    deferred and recorded as a component of OCI, and subsequently
    recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.

For purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative
    instruments, NRG uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes.
    When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models
    to determine the fair value. These internal models include
    assumptions of the future prices of energy based on the specific
    market in which the energy is being sold, using externally
    available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible
    under the pricing model. In order to qualify derivatives
    instruments for hedged transactions, NRG estimates the
    forecasted generation occurring within a specified time period.
    Judgments related to the probability of forecasted generation
    occurring are based on available baseload capacity, internal
    forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical
    delivery on similar contracts. The probability that hedged
    forecasted generation will occur by the end of a specified time
    period could change the results of operations by requiring
    amounts currently classified in OCI to be reclassified into
    earnings, creating increased variability in our earnings. These
    estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.

Certain derivative financial instruments that meet the criteria
    for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope
    exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered
    Normal Purchase and Normal Sales, or NPNS. The availability of
    this exception is based upon the assumption that NRG has the
    ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the
    underlying item. These assumptions are based on available
    baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation,
    and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that
    are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting
    treatment, and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it
    is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer
    meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the
    related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
    value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.

Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax
    Assets

As of December 31, 2007, NRG had a valuation allowance of
    approximately $539 million. This amount is comprised of
    U.S. domestic capital loss carryforwards and
    non-depreciable property of approximately $458 million,



foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
    $80 million and foreign capital loss carryforwards of
    approximately $1 million. In assessing the recoverability
    of NRG’s deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether
    it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
    deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization
    of deferred tax assets is dependent upon projected capital gains
    and available tax planning strategies.

As of December 31, 2007, NRG had fully utilized
    $245 million of cumulative U.S. federal and state net
    operating loss for financial reporting purposes. The utilization
    of the Company’s NOLs depends on several factors, such as
    NRG’s ability to utilize tax benefits through carryforwards
    to future periods, the application of tax statutes and
    regulations to transactions.

NRG continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing
    authorities in other jurisdictions. Considerable judgment is
    required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item
    that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. NRG is
    subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax
    returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various
    state and foreign jurisdictions including major operations
    located in Germany, Australia, and Brazil. The Company is no
    longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for
    years prior to 2002. With few exceptions, state and local income
    tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2003. The
    Company’s significant foreign operations are also no longer
    subject to examination by local jurisdictions for years prior to
    2000.

Evaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other Than
    Temporary Decline in Value

In accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, or
    SFAS 144, NRG evaluates property, plant and equipment and
    certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of
    impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are:

•

Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;

•

Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used
    or its physical condition;

•

Adverse business climate;

•

Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
    originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an
    asset,

•

Current-period loss combined with a history of losses or the
    projection of future losses; and

•

Change in the Company’s intent about an asset from an
    intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset
    will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously
    estimated useful life.

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
    comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future
    net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through
    considering project specific assumptions for long-term power
    pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and
    expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be
    impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
    amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
    fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability
    weighting of different courses of action available to the
    Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using
    valuation techniques such as the present value of expected
    future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these
    evaluations and considers various factors, including forward
    price curves for energy, fuel costs, and operating costs.
    However, actual future market prices and project costs could
    vary from the assumptions used in the Company’s estimates,
    and the impact of such variations could be material.

For assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that
    the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the
    carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to
    determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets
    held-for-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount
    or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair
    value under SFAS 144, whether in conjunction with an asset
    to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the
    evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective.
    NRG considers quoted market prices in active markets to the
    extent they are available. In the absence of such information,
    the Company may consider prices of similar assets, consult with
    brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. NRG will also
    discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the
    asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk
    involved with such an investment or employ an expected present
    value method that probability-weights a range of possible
    outcomes. The use of these methods involves the same inherent
    uncertainty of future cash flows as



previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows.
    Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from
    those used in the Company’s estimates, and the impact of
    such variations could be material.

NRG is also required to evaluate its equity-method and
    cost-method investments to determine whether or not they are
    impaired. Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18,

The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common
    Stock

, or APB18, provides the accounting requirements for
    these investments. The standard for determining whether an
    impairment must be recorded under APB 18 is whether the value is
    considered an “other than a temporary” decline in
    value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under APB
    18 involves the same uncertainties as described for long-lived
    assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in
    accordance with SFAS 144. Similarly, the estimates that NRG
    makes with respect to its equity and cost-method investments are
    subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates
    could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the
    Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under
    the provisions of SFAS 144, NRG would record its
    proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate
    its investment for an other than temporary decline in value
    under APB 18.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, there was a reduction
    of $11 million in income from continuing operation due to
    an impairment of an investment in commercial paper which has
    been subsequently reclassified from cash equivalents to
    non-current assets. The Company recorded this impairment as a
    reduction to interest income. For the year ended 2006, there was
    no reduction in income from continuing operation due to any
    impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2005, income
    from continuing operations was reduced by $6 million due to
    an impairment.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

As part of the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, NRG recorded
    intangible assets and goodwill. The Company applied
    SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations,

or
    SFAS 141, and SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

, or SFAS 142, to account for these
    intangibles. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all
    finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated
    weighted-average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite
    life and is not amortized. However, goodwill and all intangible
    assets not subject to amortization will be tested for
    impairments whenever an event occurs that indicates that an
    impairment may have occurred, or at a minimum, on an annual
    basis. Where necessary, the Company’s goodwill

and/or

intangible asset with indefinite lives will be impaired at that
    time.

In connection with the Texas Genco acquisition, the Company
    recognized the estimated fair value of certain power sale
    contracts and fuel contracts acquired. NRG estimated their fair
    value using forward pricing curves as of the closing date of the
    acquisition over the life of each contract. These contracts had
    net negative fair values at the closing date of the acquisition
    and were reflected as assumed contracts in the consolidated
    balance sheets. Assumed contracts are amortized to revenues and
    fuel expense as applicable based on the estimated realization of
    the fair value established on the closing date over the
    contractual lives.

Contingencies

NRG records a loss contingency when management determines it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until management determines it is certain that the
    future event will become or does become a reality. Such
    determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts
    and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of
    the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail
    its contingencies in Item 15 — Note 21,

Commitments and Contingencies,

to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Item 7A —

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

NRG is exposed to several market risks in the Company’s
    normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss
    that may result from market changes associated with the
    Company’s merchant power generation or



with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity
    transaction. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to
    are commodity price risk, interest rate risk and currency
    exchange risk. In order to manage these risks the Company uses
    various fixed-price forward purchase and sales contracts,
    futures and option contracts traded on the New York Mercantile
    Exchange, and swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter
    financial markets to:

•

Manage and hedge fixed-price purchase and sales commitments;

•

Manage and hedge exposure to variable rate debt obligations;

•

Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices; and

•

Hedge fuel requirements for the Company’s generating
    facilities.

Commodity Price Risk

Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot
    prices, forward prices, volatility in commodities, and
    correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas,
    electricity, coal and oil. A number of factors influence the
    level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and
    related derivative products. These factors include:

•

Seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;

•

Extreme peak demands due to weather conditions;

•

Available supply resources;

•

Transportation availability and reliability within and between
    regions; and

•

Changes in the nature and extent of federal and state
    regulations.

As part of NRG’s overall portfolio, NRG manages the
    commodity price risk of the Company’s merchant generation
    operations by entering into various derivative or non-derivative
    instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from
    forecasted sales of electricity and purchases of fuel. These
    instruments include forward purchase and sale contracts, futures
    and option contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
    and swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter financial
    markets. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary
    based upon management’s assessment of market, weather,
    operation and other factors.

While some of the contracts the Company uses to manage risk
    represent commodities or instruments for which prices are
    available from external sources, other commodities and certain
    contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other
    pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected
    future market prices, contract quantities, or both. NRG uses the
    Company’s best estimates to determine the fair value of
    commodity and derivative contracts held and sold. These
    estimates consider various factors, including closing exchange
    and over-the-counter price quotations, time value, volatility
    factors and credit exposure. However, it is likely that future
    market prices could vary from those used in recording
    mark-to-market derivative instrument valuation, and such
    variations could be material.

NRG measures the sensitivity of the Company’s portfolio to
    potential changes in market prices using Value at Risk, or VAR.
    VAR is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss
    based on market price and volatility. Currently, the company
    estimates VAR using a Monte Carlo simulation based methodology.
    NRG’s total portfolio includes mark-to-market and non
    mark-to-market energy assets and liabilities.

NRG uses a diversified VAR model to calculate an estimate of the
    potential loss in the fair value of the Company’s energy
    assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, load
    obligations, and bilateral physical and financial transactions.
    The key assumptions for the Company’s diversified model
    include: (1) a lognormal distribution of prices,

(2) one-day

holding period, (3) a 95% confidence interval, (4) a
    rolling

36-month

forward looking period, and (5) market implied volatilities
    and historical price correlations.

As of December 31, 2007, the VAR for NRG’s commodity
    portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and
    bilateral physical and financial transactions calculated using
    the diversified VAR model was $64 million.



The following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VAR
    for NRG for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:

Prior to December 4, 2007,
    NRG’s VAR measurement was based on a rolling

24-month

forward looking period

Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as
    VAR, the evolving nature of the competitive markets for
    electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of
    changes in market prices, the VAR calculation may not capture
    the full extent of commodity price exposure. As a result, actual
    changes in the fair value of

mark-to-market

energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated
    VAR, and such changes could have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial results.

In order to provide additional information for comparative
    purposes to NRG’s peers, the Company also uses VAR to
    estimate the potential loss of derivative financial instruments
    that are subject to mark-to-market accounting. These derivative
    instruments include transactions that were entered into for both
    asset management and trading purposes. The VAR for the
    derivative financial instruments calculated using the
    diversified VAR model as of December 31, 2007, for the
    entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset
    management and trading was approximately $17 million.

Interest Rate Risk

NRG is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through the
    Company’s issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt.
    Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by
    entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate
    swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts
    reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in
    primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account
    the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate
    derivative instrument. NRG’s risk management policies allow
    the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate
    debt obligations.

In January 2006, the Company entered into a series of new
    interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps became effective
    on February 15, 2006, and are intended to hedge the risk
    associated with floating interest rates. For each of the
    interest rate swaps, NRG pays its counterparty the equivalent of
    a fixed interest payment on a predetermined notional value, and
    NRG receives the equivalent of a floating interest payment based
    on a

3-month

LIBOR rate calculated on the same notional value. All interest
    rate swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made
    quarterly, and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each
    interest period. While the notional value of each of the swaps
    does not vary over time, the swaps are designed to mature
    sequentially. The total notional amount of these swaps as of
    December 31, 2007 was $2.03 billion.

The notional amounts and maturities of each tranche of these
    swaps are as follows:

$

190 million

March 31, 2010

$

March 31, 2011

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had various interest
    rate swap agreements, including those listed above, with
    notional amounts totaling approximately $2.7 billion. If
    the swaps had been discontinued on December 31, 2007, the
    Company would have owed the counter-parties approximately
    $69 million. Based on



the investment grade rating of the counter-parties, NRG believes
    its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by
    counterparties to its hedge contracts to be insignificant.

NRG has both long and short-term debt instruments that subject
    the Company to the risk of loss associated with movements in
    market interest rates. As of December 31, 2007, a
    100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a
    $16 million change in interest expense on a rolling twelve
    month basis.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company’s long-term debt
    fair value was $8.1 billion and the carrying amount was
    $8.4 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market
    interest rates would have increased the fair value of the
    Company’s long-term debt by $471 million.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of
    NRG’s activities and in the management of the
    Company’s assets and liabilities. NRG’s liquidity
    management framework is intended to maximize liquidity access
    and minimize funding costs. Through active liquidity management,
    the Company seeks to preserve stable, reliable and
    cost-effective sources of funding. This enables the Company to
    replace maturing obligations when due and fund assets at
    appropriate maturities and rates. To accomplish this task,
    management uses a variety of liquidity risk measures that take
    into consideration market conditions, prevailing interest rates,
    liquidity needs, and the desired maturity profile of liabilities.

Based on a sensitivity analysis, a $1 per MWh increase or
    decrease in electricity prices across the term of the marginable
    contracts would cause a change in margin collateral outstanding
    of approximately $15 million as of December 31, 2007.
    This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated
    based on portfolio composition and margin-related contract
    provisions as of December 31, 2007.

Credit Risk

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from
    non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the
    terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and
    manages the credit risk of NRG and its subsidiaries through
    credit policies that include (i) an established credit
    approval process, (ii) a daily monitoring of counter-party
    credit limits, (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures
    such as margin, collateral, credit derivatives or prepayment
    arrangements, (iv) the use of payment netting agreements,
    and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for
    the netting of positive and negative exposures of various
    contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks
    surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately
    impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company
    has credit protection within various agreements to call on
    additional collateral support if and when necessary. As of
    December 31, 2007, NRG held net collateral of approximately
    $147 million from counterparties.

A portion of NRG’s credit risk is related to transactions
    that are recorded in the Company’s consolidated Balance
    Sheets. These transactions primarily consist of open positions
    from the Company’s marketing and risk management operation
    that are accounted for using mark-to-market accounting, as well
    as amounts owed by counterparties for transactions that settled
    but have not yet been paid.

The following table highlights the credit quality and the
    balance sheet settlement exposures related to these activities
    as of December 31, 2007:

Additionally, the Company has concentrations of suppliers and
    customers among coal suppliers, electric utilities, energy
    marketing and trading companies, and regional transmission
    operators. These concentrations of counterparties may impact
    NRG’s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or
    negatively, in that counterparties may be similarly affected by
    changes in economic, regulatory and other conditions.

NRG’s exposure to significant counterparties greater than
    10% of the net exposure of approximately $1.2 billion, was
    $923 million as of December 31, 2007. NRG does not
    anticipate any material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial position or results of operations as a result of
    nonperformance by any of NRG’s counterparties.

Currency Exchange Risk

NRG may be subject to foreign currency risk as a result of the
    Company entering into purchase commitments with foreign vendors
    for the purchase of major equipment associated with

Repowering

NRG initiatives. To reduce the risks to such
    foreign currency exposure, the Company may enter into
    transactions to hedge its foreign currency exposure using
    currency options and forward contracts. At December 31,
    2007, no foreign currency options and forward contracts were
    outstanding. As a result of the Company’s limited foreign
    currency exposure to date, the effect of foreign currency
    fluctuations has not been material to the Company’s results
    of operations, financial position and cash flows.

The effects of a hypothetical simultaneous 10% appreciation in
    the U.S. dollar from year-end 2007 levels against all other
    currencies of countries in which the Company has continuing
    operations would result in an immaterial impact to NRG’s
    consolidated statements of operations. However, NRG’s
    consolidated financial position would also have been negatively
    affected by approximately $55 million, due to currency
    translation adjustments recorded in OCI.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
    and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of NRG’s
    management, including its principal executive officer, principal
    financial officer and principal accounting officer, NRG
    conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and
    procedures, as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

or

15d-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s
    principal executive officer, principal financial officer and
    principal accounting officer concluded that the disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
    period covered by this annual report on

Form 10-K.

Management’s report on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting and the report of the Company’s
    independent registered public accounting firm are incorporated
    under the caption “Management’s Report on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting” and under the caption
    “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
    Firm,” of the Company’s 2007 Annual Report to
    Shareholders.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the year ended December 31,
    2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.



Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls

NRG’s internal control over financial reporting is designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that:

1.

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of our assets;

2.

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
    made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
    and directors; and

3.

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our
    assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated
    financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
    absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
    because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility
    of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of
    controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system
    may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely
    basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
    future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

NRG Energy Inc.’s management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company’s management, including its principal executive
    officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting
    officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the
    Company’s evaluation under the framework in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework, the Company’s
    management concluded that its internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been
    audited by KPMG LLP, the Company’s independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is
    included in this

Form 10-K.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

NRG Energy, Inc.:

We have audited NRG Energy Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). NRG Energy
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report
    on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, NRG Energy, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of NRG Energy, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income/(loss), and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three year period ended December 31, 2007, and
    our report dated February 28, 2008, expressed an
    unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

NRG Energy, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2007. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements, we also have audited
    financial statement schedule “Schedule II. Valuation
    and Qualifying Accounts.” These consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
    our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue

No. 04-6,

Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in
    the Mining Industry

, and Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R),

Share Based Payments

,
    and related interpretations on January 1, 2006. As
    discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company also adopted SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of
    SFAS No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

, effective
    December 31, 2006. As discussed in Note 2 to the
    consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Financial
    Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of SFAS No. 109

, on January 1,
    2007.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), NRG
    Energy, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 28, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Note 2 —
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include NRG’s
    accounts and operations and those of its subsidiaries in which
    the Company has a controlling interest. All significant
    intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
    consolidation. The usual condition for a controlling financial
    interest is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of
    an entity. However, a controlling financial interest may also
    exist in entities, such as a variable interest entity, through
    arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests.

As such, NRG applies the guidance of FASB Interpretation
    No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

or FIN 46R, to consolidate variable interest entities,
    or VIE’s, for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
    FIN 46R requires a variable interest holder to consolidate
    a VIE if that party will absorb a majority of the expected
    losses of the VIE, receive the majority of the expected residual
    returns of the VIE, or both. This party is considered the
    primary beneficiary. Conversely, NRG will not consolidate a VIE
    in which it has a majority ownership interest when the Company
    is not considered the primary beneficiary. In determining the
    primary beneficiary, NRG thoroughly evaluates the VIEs design,
    capital structure, and relationships among variable interest
    holders. If a primary beneficiary cannot be determined by a
    qualitative analysis, a quantitative analysis of allocating the
    expected cash flows among the variable interest holders is used
    in the determination.

As discussed in Note 14,

Investments Accounted for by
    the Equity Method

, NRG also has investments in partnerships,
    joint ventures and projects.

Accounting policies for all of NRG’s operations are in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Upon its emergence from bankruptcy on
    December 5, 2003, the Company qualified for and adopted
    fresh start reporting, or Fresh Start, under Statement of
    Position

90-7,

Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the
    Bankruptcy Code

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
    an original maturity of three months or less at the time of
    purchase.

Restricted
    Cash

Restricted cash consists primarily of funds held to satisfy the
    requirements of certain debt agreements and funds held within
    the Company’s projects that are restricted in their use.
    These funds are used to pay for current operating expenses and
    current debt service payments, per the restrictions of the debt
    agreements.

Inventory

Inventory is valued at the lower of weighted average cost or
    market and consists principally of fuel oil, coal and raw
    materials used to generate steam. Spare parts inventory is
    valued at a weighted average cost, since the Company expects to
    recover these costs in the ordinary course of business. Sales of
    inventory are classified as an operating activity in the
    consolidated statements of cash flows.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost however
    impairment adjustments are recorded whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be
    recoverable. NRG also classifies nuclear fuel related to the
    Company’s 44% ownership interest in STP as part of the
    Company’s property, plant, and equipment. Significant
    additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized
    as incurred, while repairs and maintenance that do not improve
    or extend the life of the respective asset are charged to
    expense as incurred. Depreciation other than nuclear fuel is
    computed using the straight-line method, while nuclear fuel is
    amortized based on units of production over the estimated useful
    lives. Certain assets and their related accumulated depreciation
    amounts are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with
    the resulting gain or loss included in other income/(expense) in
    the consolidated statements of operations.

Asset
    Impairments

Long-lived assets that are held and used are reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    carrying values may not be recoverable. Such reviews are
    performed in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets,

or SFAS 144. An impairment loss is recognized
    if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected
    from an asset are less than its carrying value. An impairment
    charge is measured by the difference between an asset’s
    carrying amount and fair value with the difference recorded in
    operating costs and expenses in the statements of operations.
    Fair values are determined by a variety of valuation methods,
    including appraisals, sales prices of similar assets and present
    value techniques.

Investments accounted for by the equity method are reviewed for
    impairment in accordance with APB No. 18,

The Equity
    Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

, or APB
    18, which requires that a loss in value of an investment that is
    other than a temporary decline should be recognized. The Company
    identifies and measures losses in the value of equity method
    investments based upon a comparison of fair value to carrying
    value.

Discontinued
    Operations

Long-lived assets or disposal groups are classified as
    discontinued operations when all of the required criteria
    specified in SFAS 144 are met. These criteria include,
    among others, existence of a qualified plan to dispose of an
    asset or disposal group, an assessment that completion of a sale
    within one year is probable and approval of the appropriate
    level of management. In addition, upon completion of the
    transaction, the operations and cash flows of the disposal group
    must be eliminated from ongoing operations of the Company, and
    the disposal group must not



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

have any significant continuing involvement with the Company.
    Discontinued operations are reported at the lower of the
    asset’s carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Project
    Development Costs and Capitalized Interest

Development costs are expensed in the preliminary stages of a
    project and capitalized when the project is deemed to be
    commercially viable. Commercial viability is determined by one
    or a series of actions including among others, Board of Director
    approval pursuant to a formal project plan that subjects the
    Company to significant future obligations that can only be
    discharged by the use of a Company asset. When a project is
    available for operations, previously capitalized project costs
    are reclassified to property, plant and equipment and amortized
    on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the
    project’s related assets. Capitalized costs are charged to
    expense if a project is abandoned or management otherwise
    determines the costs to be unrecoverable.

Interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance capital projects
    is capitalized if material. Capitalization of interest is
    discontinued when the asset under construction is ready for its
    intended use or when a project is terminated or construction
    ceases.

Debt
    Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest
    expense on a basis which approximates the effective interest
    method over the term of the related debt.

Intangible
    Assets

Intangible assets represent contractual rights held by NRG. The
    Company recognizes specifically identifiable intangible assets
    including emission allowances, power and fuel contracts when
    specific rights and contracts are acquired. In addition, NRG
    also established values for emission allowances and power
    contracts upon adoption of Fresh Start reporting. These
    intangible assets are amortized on either contracted volumes,
    straight line or units of production basis.

Intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not
    amortized, but rather are tested for impairment at least
    annually or more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that such acquired intangible assets have
    been determined to have finite lives and should now be amortized
    over their useful lives. NRG had no intangible assets with
    indefinite lives recorded as of December 31, 2007.

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

, or SFAS 142, the Company recognizes
    goodwill for the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net
    value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

NRG performs goodwill impairment tests annually, typically
    during the fourth quarter and when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step
    process:

Step one

—

Identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a
    reporting unit to the book value, including goodwill. If the
    fair value exceeds book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is
    not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value,
    proceed to step two.

Step two

—

Compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill to the book value of the reporting unit goodwill. If
    the book value of goodwill exceeds fair value, an impairment
    charge is recognized for the sum of such excess.



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Income
    Taxes

NRG accounts for income taxes using the liability method in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes

, or SFAS 109, which requires that the Company use
    the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income
    taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant
    temporary differences.

NRG has two categories of income tax expense or
    benefit — current and deferred, as follows:

•

Current income tax expense or benefit consists solely of regular
    tax less applicable tax credits, and

•

Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the change in the net
    deferred income tax asset or liability, excluding amounts
    charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income.

NRG reports some of the Company’s revenues and expenses
    differently for financial statement purposes than for income tax
    return purposes resulting in temporary and permanent differences
    between the Company’s financial statements and income tax
    returns. The tax effects of such temporary differences are
    recorded as either deferred income tax assets or deferred income
    tax liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets. NRG measures the Company’s deferred income tax
    assets and deferred income tax liabilities using income tax
    rates that are currently in effect. A valuation allowance is
    recorded to reduce the Company’s net deferred tax
    liabilities to an amount that is more likely than not to be
    realized.

In January 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation Number
    48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

, or
    FIN 48, which applies to all tax positions related to
    income taxes subject to SFAS 109. FIN 48 requires a
    new evaluation process for all tax positions taken, recognizing
    tax benefits when it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position
    will be sustained upon examination by the authorities. The
    benefit from a position that has surpassed the
    more-likely-than-not threshold is the largest amount of benefit
    that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. The
    Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Revenue
    Recognition

NRG is primarily a power generation company, operating a
    portfolio of majority-owned electric generating plants and
    certain plants in which the Company’s ownership interest is
    50% or less, which are accounted for under the equity method of
    accounting. NRG also produces thermal energy for sale to
    customers, principally through steam and chilled water
    facilities.

Energy

— Both physical and financial
    transactions are entered into to optimize the financial
    performance of NRG’s generating facilities. Electric energy
    revenue is recognized upon transmission to the customer.
    Physical transactions, or the sale of generated electricity to
    meet supply and demand, are recorded on a gross basis in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Financial
    transactions, or the buying and selling of energy for trading
    purposes, are recorded net within operating revenues in the
    consolidated statements of operations in accordance with EITF
    Issue

No. 02-3,

Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held
    for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading
    and Risk Management Activities, or EITF 02-3.

Capacity —

Capacity revenues are recognized
    when contractually earned, and consist of revenues received from
    a third party at either the market or a negotiated contract
    price for making installed generation capacity available in
    order to satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements.

Sale of Emission Allowances —

NRG records the
    Company’s bank of emission allowances as part of the
    Company’s intangible assets. From time to time, management
    may authorize the transfer from the Company’s emission bank
    to intangible assets held-for-sale as part of the Company’s
    asset optimization strategy. NRG records the sale of emission
    allowances on a net basis within other income in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Contract Amortization —

Liabilities recognized
    from power sales agreements assumed at Fresh Start and through
    acquisitions related to the sale of electric capacity and energy
    in future periods for which the fair value has been determined
    to be significantly less than market is amortized as an increase
    to revenue over the term of each underlying contract based on
    actual generation

and/or

contracted volumes.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

NRG accounts for derivative financial instruments under
    SFAS 133. SFAS 133 requires the Company to record all
    derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value unless they
    qualify for a Normal Purchase or Normal Sale, or NPNS,
    exception. Changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivatives
    are immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair
    value of derivatives accounted for as hedges are either:

•

Recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair
    value of the related hedged assets, liabilities and firm
    commitments; or

•

Deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income, or OCI, until the hedged transactions
    occur and are recognized in earnings for forecasted transactions.

NRG’s primary derivative instruments are power sales
    contracts, fuels purchase contracts, other energy related
    commodities, and interest rate instruments used to mitigate
    variability in earnings due to fluctuations in market prices and
    interest rates. On an ongoing basis, NRG assesses the
    effectiveness of all derivatives that are designated as hedges
    for accounting purposes in order to determine that each
    derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting
    changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Internal
    analyses that measure the statistical correlation between the
    derivative and the associated hedged item determine the
    effectiveness of such an energy contract designated as a hedge.
    If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly
    effective as a hedge, hedge accounting will be discontinued
    prospectively. Hedge accounting will also be discontinued on
    contracts related to commodity price risk previously accounted
    for as cash flow hedges when it is probable that delivery will
    not be made against these contracts. If the derivative
    instrument is terminated, the effective portion of this
    derivative in OCI will be frozen until the underlying hedged
    item is delivered.

Revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify for the NPNS
    exception are recognized when the underlying physical
    transaction is completed. While these contracts are considered
    derivative financial instruments under SFAS 133, they are
    not recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of
    accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as
    NPNS no longer meets the scope exception, the fair value of the
    related contract is recorded on the balance sheet and
    immediately recognized through earnings.

NRG’s trading activities include contracts entered into to
    profit from market price changes as opposed to hedging an
    exposure, and are subject to limits in accordance with the
    Company’s risk management policy. These contracts are
    recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the
    fair value of these derivative financial instruments are
    recognized in earnings. These trading activities are a
    complement to NRG’s energy marketing portfolio.

Effective July, 1, 2007, the Company adopted the Emerging Issues
    Task Force, or EITF, Topic D-109,

Determining the Nature of a
    Host Contract Related to a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in
    the Form of a Share under FASB Statement No. 133.

This
    Topic conveys the SEC staff’s views on determining whether
    the characteristics of a host contract in a hybrid financial
    instruments issued in the form of a share is more like debt or
    equity. The SEC staff believes that in evaluating an embedded
    derivative feature for separation under FASB Statement 133, the
    consideration of the economic characteristics and risks of the
    host contract should not ignore the stated or implied
    substantive terms and features of the hybrid financial
    instrument. The adoption of Topic D-109 did not have an impact
    on the Company’s, results of operations, financial position
    or cash flows.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and
    Losses

The local currencies are generally the functional currency of
    NRG’s foreign operations. Foreign currency denominated
    assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates of
    exchange. Revenues, expenses, and cash flows are translated at
    the weighted-average rates of exchange for the period. The
    resulting currency translation adjustments are accumulated and
    reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity
    and are not included in the determination of the Company’s
    statements of operations. Foreign currency transaction gains or
    losses are reported within other income/(expense) in the
    Company’s statements of operations. For the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, amounts recognized as
    foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were immaterial.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, which potentially subject NRG to
    concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, trust
    funds, accounts receivable, notes receivable, and investments in
    debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents are held at financial
    institutions with high credit ratings. Trust funds are held in
    accounts managed by experienced investment advisors. Accounts
    receivable, notes receivable, and derivative instruments are
    concentrated within entities engaged in the energy industry.
    These industry concentrations may impact the Company’s
    overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or
    negatively, in that the customers may be similarly affected by
    changes in economic, industry or other conditions. Receivables
    are generally not collateralized; however, NRG believes that the
    credit risk posed by industry concentration is offset by the
    diversification and creditworthiness of the Company’s
    customer base.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trust funds,
    receivables, accounts payables, and accrued liabilities
    approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of
    these instruments. The carrying amounts of long-term receivables
    usually approximate fair value, as the effective rates for these
    instruments are comparable to market rates at year-end,
    including current portions. Any differences are disclosed in
    Note 4,

Financial Instruments.

The fair value of
    long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for those
    instruments that are publicly traded, or estimated based on the
    income approach valuation technique for non-publicly traded
    debt. During the fourth quarter 2007, the Company recorded an
    $11 million impairment charge related to an investment in
    commercial paper reducing its carrying value to approximately
    $32 million.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

NRG has adopted SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations

, or SFAS 143, which requires an
    entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset
    retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred.
    Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement
    obligation, an entity shall capitalize an asset retirement cost
    by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived
    asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time, the
    liability is accreted to its present value each period, while
    the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the
    related asset. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived
    assets included within the scope of SFAS 143 are those for
    which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws, statutes,
    written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under
    the doctrine of promissory estoppel. In addition, NRG has also
    identified conditional asset retirement obligations for asbestos
    removal and disposal, which are specific to certain power
    generation operations. Under FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

,
    or FIN 47, a conditional asset retirement obligation is
    reasonably estimable if (a) it is evident that the fair
    value of the obligation is embodied in the acquisition price of
    the asset, (b) an active market exists for the transfer of
    the obligation, or (c) sufficient information exists to
    apply an expected present value technique.

These asset retirement obligations are primarily related to the
    future dismantlement of equipment on leased property and
    environment obligations related to nuclear decommissioning, ash
    disposal site closures, and fuel

Pensions

NRG offers pension benefits through either a defined benefit
    pension plan or a cash balance plan. In addition, the Company
    provides postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain
    groups of employees. Effective December 31, 2006, NRG
    accounts for pension and other postretirement benefits in
    accordance with SFAS No. 158,

Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106 and 132(R)

, or SFAS 158. NRG recognizes the
    funded status of the Company’s defined benefit plans in the
    statement of financial position and records an offset to other
    comprehensive income. In addition, NRG also recognizes on an
    after tax basis, as a component of other comprehensive income,
    gains and losses as well as all prior service costs that have
    not been included as part of the Company’s net periodic
    benefit cost. The determination of NRG’s obligation and
    expenses for pension benefits is dependent on the selection of
    certain assumptions. These assumptions determined by management
    include the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan
    assets and the rate of future compensation increases. NRG’s
    actuarial consultants use assumptions for such items as
    retirement age. The assumptions used may differ materially from
    actual results, which may result in a significant impact to the
    amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by the Company.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

On January 1, 2006, NRG transitioned from
    SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

, or SFAS 123, and adopted
    SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004),

Share-Based
    Payment

, or SFAS 123(R), using the modified prospective
    method. Under the modified prospective method, NRG applied the
    provisions of SFAS 123(R) to new awards of stock-based
    compensation and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled
    after the required effective date. SFAS 123(R) requires
    that NRG apply a forfeiture rate to existing awards and apply
    the standard’s fair value recognition provisions. The fair
    value of the Company’s non-qualified stock options and
    performance units are estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the Monte Carlo valuation
    model, respectively. NRG uses the Company’s common stock
    price on the date of grant as the fair value of the
    Company’s restricted stock units and deferred stock units.
    Forfeiture rates are estimated based on an analysis of
    NRG’s historical forfeitures, employment turnover, and
    expected future behavior. The Company recognizes compensation
    expense for both graded and cliff vesting awards on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the
    entire award.

Investments
    Accounted for by the Equity Method

NRG has investments in various international and domestic energy
    projects. The equity method of accounting is applied to such
    investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and
    partnerships, because the ownership



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

structure prevents NRG from exercising a controlling influence
    over the operating and financial policies of the projects. Under
    this method, equity in pre-tax income or losses of domestic
    partnerships and, generally, in the net income or losses of
    international projects, are reflected as equity in earnings of
    unconsolidated affiliates.

On January 1, 2006, NRG adopted EITF Issue

No. 04-6,

Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in
    the Mining Industry

, or

EITF 04-6.

EITF 04-6

provides that costs incurred to remove overburden and waste
    material to access coal seams, or stripping costs; during the
    production phase of a mine are variable production costs that
    should be included in the costs of the inventory produced during
    the period that the stripping costs are incurred. MIBRA GmbH, or
    MIBRAG, in which NRG holds a 50% equity investment, has mining
    operations which were negatively affected by this pronouncement.
    The adoption of

EITF 04-6

did not have a material impact on NRG’s consolidated
    results of operations, but did have a material impact on
    NRG’s consolidated financial position. Upon adoption of

EITF 04-6

on January 1, 2006, NRG’s investment in MIBRAG was
    reduced by 50% of the above mentioned asset, or approximately
    $93 million after-tax, with an offsetting charge to
    retained earnings.

On January 1, 2006, NRG adopted EITF Issue

No. 05-5,

Accounting for Early Retirement or Post-employment Programs
    with Specific Features (such as terms specified in
    Altersteilzeit Early Retirement Arrangements)

, or

EITF 05-5.

The Altersteilzeit, or ATZ, arrangement is a voluntary early
    retirement program in Germany designed to create an incentive
    for employees, within a certain age group, to transition from
    employment into retirement before their legal retirement age. If
    certain criteria are met by the employer, the German government
    provides to the employer a subsidy for bonuses paid to the
    employee and the additional contributions paid by the employer
    into the German government pension plan under an ATZ arrangement
    for a maximum of six years. Upon adoption of

EITF 05-5

on January 1, 2006, NRG recognized additional equity in
    earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of approximately
    $2 million, after- tax, from the Company’s MIBRAG
    interest. This amount reflects the cumulative effect of the
    adoption of

EITF 05-5,

and did not materially affect NRG’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or statement of cash flows for
    the year ended December 31, 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
    the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
    estimates.

In recording transactions and balances resulting from business
    operations, NRG uses estimates based on the best information
    available. Estimates are used for such items as plant
    depreciable lives, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts,
    actuarially determined benefit costs, and the valuation of
    long-term energy commodity contracts, environmental liabilities,
    and legal costs incurred in connection with recorded loss
    contingencies, among others. In addition, estimates are used to
    test long-lived assets for impairment and to determine the fair
    value of impaired assets. As better information becomes
    available or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded
    estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be
    affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified for
    comparative purposes. These reclassifications had no effect on
    the Company’s net income or total stockholders’
    equity, as previously reported.

Stock
    Split

On April 25, 2007, NRG’s Board of Directors approved a
    two-for-one stock split of the Company’s outstanding shares
    of common stock which was effected through a stock dividend. The
    stock split entitled each

stockholder of record at the close of business on May 22,
    2007 to receive one additional share for every outstanding share
    of common stock held. The additional shares resulting from the
    stock split were distributed by the Company’s transfer
    agent on May 31, 2007. All share and per share amounts
    within this document retroactively reflect the effect of the
    stock split.

Recent
    Accounting Developments

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
    FASB, issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements

, or SFAS 157. This statement defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This
    statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
    periods within those years. In February 2008, the FASB issued
    FASB Staff Position, or FSP,

No. FAS 157-1,

Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement
    No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address
    Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or
    Measurement under Statement 13

, which amends SFAS 157
    to exclude FASB Statement No. 13,

Accounting for
    Leases

, or SFAS 13, and other accounting pronouncements
    that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease
    classification or measurement under SFAS 13. In February
    2008, the FASB also issued FSP

No. FAS 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

, which
    permitted delayed application of this statement for nonfinancial
    assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim
    periods within those fiscal years. NRG partially adopted
    SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008, delaying application for
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as permitted.
    This partial adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    statement of operations, and cash flows. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of the deferred portion of
    SFAS 157 on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position, statement of operations, and cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities-including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115,

or SFAS 159. This statement provides
    entities with an option to measure and report selected financial
    assets and liabilities at fair value. This statement requires a
    business entity to report unrealized gains and losses on items
    for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at
    each subsequent reporting date. An entity may decide whether to
    elect the fair value option for each eligible item on its
    election date, subject to certain requirements described in the
    statement. As of the January 1, 2008 effective date, the
    Company elected not to apply this standard to any of its
    existing eligible assets or liabilities; therefore there was no
    impact on NRG’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

In April 2007, FASB issued its Staff Position

FIN 39-1,

Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39

, or FSP

FIN 39-1,

which amends FIN 39,

Offsetting of Amounts Related to
    Certain Contracts

. FSP

FIN 39-1

impacts entities that enter into master netting arrangements as
    part of their derivative transactions. Under the guidance in
    this new FSP, entities may choose to offset derivative positions
    in the financial statements against the fair value of amounts
    recognized as cash collateral paid or received under those
    arrangements. As of the January 1, 2008 effective date, the
    Company elected not to apply this FSP to any of its existing
    eligible derivative positions; therefore there was no impact on
    NRG’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

, or
    SFAS 141(R). This statement applies prospectively to all
    business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
    after the beginning of an entity’s first annual reporting
    period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The
    statement establishes principles and requires an acquirer to
    recognize and measure in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    minority interest in the acquiree at fair value. It also
    recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired or a gain from a
    bargain purchase in the business combination and determines what
    information to disclose to enable users of an entity’s
    financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination. NRG is currently evaluating
    the impact of this statement upon its adoption on the
    Company’s results of operations, financial position and
    cash flows.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51,
    Consolidated Financial Statements

, or SFAS 160. This
    Statement amends ARB No. 51 to establish accounting and
    reporting standards for the minority interest in a subsidiary
    and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also amends
    certain of ARB No. 51’s consolidation procedures for
    consistency with the requirements of SFAS 141(R). This
    Statement shall be effective and applied prospectively for
    fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
    beginning on or after December 15, 2008, except for the
    presentation and disclosure requirements, which shall be applied
    retrospectively. NRG is currently evaluating the impact of this
    statement upon its adoption on the Company’s results of
    operations, financial position and cash flows.

NRG has non-qualified stock options for which it estimates the
    expected term using the simplified method allowed under Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107,

Share Based
    Payment

, or SAB 107. In December 2007, the SEC issued
    SAB No. 110,

Certain Assumptions Used in Valuation
    Methods

, which eliminates the December 31, 2007
    expiration of SAB 107’s permission to use this
    simplified method. NRG will therefore continue to use this
    simplified method after December 31, 2007, for as long as
    the Company deems it to be the most appropriate method.

Note 3 —
    Discontinued Operations, Business Acquisitions and
    Dispositions

Discontinued
    Operations

NRG has classified material business operations, and
    gains/(losses) recognized on sales, as discontinued operations
    for projects that were sold or have met the required criteria
    for such classification. The financial results for the affected
    businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations.

SFAS 144 requires that discontinued operations be valued on
    an

asset-by-asset

basis at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs
    to sell. In applying the provisions of SFAS 144, the
    Company’s management considers cash flow analyses, bids,
    and offers related to those assets and businesses. In accordance
    with the provisions of SFAS 144, discontinued operations
    are not depreciated commencing with their classification as
    such. The assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations
    are reported in NRG’s balance sheets as discontinued
    operations.

ITISA

— On December 18, 2007, NRG entered
    into a sale and purchase agreement to sell 100% interest in
    Tosli, which holds all NRG’s interest in ITISA, to
    Brookfield Power Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield
    Asset Management Inc., for a purchase price of approximately
    $288 million, plus the assumption of approximately
    $60 million in debt. The transaction, which is subject to
    the receipt of regulatory approval and other customary closing
    conditions, is expected to close during the first half of 2008.

Resource Recovery

— In 2006, NRG completed the
    sale of the Company’s Newport and Elk River Resource
    Recovery facilities, Becker Ash Disposal facility as well as the
    Company’s ownership interest in NRG Processing Solutions
    LLC, to Resource Recovery Technologies, LLC for total proceeds
    of approximately $22 million.

Flinders

— In 2006, NRG completed the sale of
    the Company’s 100% owned Flinders power station and related
    assets, or Flinders, located near Port Augusta, Australia, which
    consisted of two coal-fueled plants — Northern and
    Playford, with a combined generation capacity of approximately
    760 MW, to Babcock & Brown Power Pty, a
    subsidiary of Babcock & Brown. Proceeds from the sale
    were approximately $242 million (AU$317 million). The
    sale resulted in the elimination of approximately
    $370 million (AU$485 million) of consolidated
    liabilities, including approximately $183 million
    (AU$240 million) of non-recourse debt obligations and
    approximately $92 million (AU$121 million) in
    non-current liabilities related to obligations for the purchase
    of electricity and the supply of fuel to the Osborne power
    station that were guaranteed by NRG.

Audrain

— In 2006, NRG completed the sale of
    Audrain generating station, a gas-fired peaking facility in
    Vandalia, Missouri, to AmerenUE, a subsidiary of Ameren
    Corporation. The proceeds from the sale were $115 million,
    plus AmerenUE’s assumption of $240 million of
    non-recourse capital lease obligations and assignment of a
    $240 million note receivable. Of the $115 million in
    cash proceeds, approximately $20 million was paid to NRG
    and the balance was paid to the lenders of NRG Financial I LLC.

Northbrook New York LLC and Northbrook Energy
    LLC

— In 2005, NRG completed the sale of
    Northbrook New York LLC and Northbrook Energy LLC. In exchange
    for the sale, NRG received net cash proceeds of $36 million
    and paid off Northbrook New York LLC’s third party debt of
    $17 million.

Acquisition
    of Texas Genco LLC

On February 2, 2006, NRG acquired Texas Genco LLC, which
    subsequently is being managed and accounted for as a separate
    business segment referred to as NRG’s Texas region. As
    such, the results of Texas Genco LLC have been included in
    NRG’s consolidated financial statements since
    February 2, 2006. The purchase price of approximately
    $6.2 billion consisted of approximately $4.4 billion
    in cash, the issuance of approximately 71 million shares of
    NRG’s common stock valued at approximately
    $1.7 billion, and acquisition costs of approximately



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$0.1 billion. The value of NRG’s common stock issued
    to the sellers was based on NRG’s average stock price
    immediately before and after the closing date of
    February 2, 2006. The acquisition also included the
    assumption of approximately $2.7 billion of Texas Genco LLC
    debt.

The acquisition of Texas Genco LLC was funded at closing with a
    combination of: (i) cash proceeds received upon the
    issuance and sale in a public offering of approximately
    42 million shares of NRG’s common stock at a price of
    $24.38 per share; (ii) cash proceeds received upon the
    issuance and sale of $1.2 billion aggregate principal
    amount of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2014 and $2.4 billion
    aggregate principal amount of 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016;
    (iii) cash proceeds received upon the issuance and sale in
    a public offering of 2,000,000 shares of mandatory
    convertible preferred stock at a price of $250 per share;
    (iv) funds borrowed under a new senior secured credit
    facility consisting of a $3.6 billion term loan facility, a
    $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, and a
    $1.0 billion synthetic letter of credit facility; and
    (v) cash on hand.

The acquisition of Texas Genco LLC was accounted for using the
    purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the purchase
    price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed based on the estimated fair value of such assets and
    liabilities as of February 2, 2006. The excess of the
    purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
    identified intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.
    The allocation of the purchase price may be adjusted if
    additional information for certain income tax items becomes
    available through December 31, 2008 pursuant to
    SFAS 141(R).

Acquisition
    of Remaining 50% interest in WCP

On March 31, 2006, NRG completed a purchase and sale
    agreement for projects co-owned with Dynegy, Inc. Under the
    agreements, NRG acquired Dynegy’s 50% ownership interest in
    WCP (Generation) Holdings, Inc., or WCP, for $205 million
    in cash and the assumption of a $1 million liability, with
    NRG becoming the sole owner of WCP’s 1,825 MW of
    generation capacity in Southern California. In addition, NRG
    sold to Dynegy the Company’s 50% ownership interest in
    Rocky Road Power LLC, or Rocky Road, a 330 MW gas-fueled,
    simple cycle peaking plant located in Dundee, Illinois. NRG sold
    Rocky Road for a fair value sale price of $45 million,
    paying Dynegy a net purchase price of $160 million at
    closing. Prior to the purchase, NRG had an existing investment
    in WCP accounted for as an equity method investment, or Original
    Investment.

The acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in WCP, or New
    Investment, was accounted for as a step acquisition since the
    Original Investment was transacted in a prior period. As a
    result, the value of the Original Investment and the purchase
    price of the New Investment were determined and allocated
    separately. The value of the Original Investment was based on
    the book value of approximately $159 million as of the date
    of the acquisition of the New Investment.

The value of the New Investment was allocated based on the

    as of March 31, 2006. The purchase price allocation
    reflected an excess of fair value of the net assets acquired
    over the purchase price of the New Investment, resulting in
    negative goodwill of approximately $48 million. The
    negative goodwill was subsequently allocated as a reduction to
    the fair value of WCP’s fixed assets. The following table

For cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, the carrying

    securities is based on quoted market prices for those
    instruments. Trust fund investments are comprised of various
    U.S. debt and equity securities carried at fair market
    value.

The fair value of notes receivable, debt securities and certain
    long-term debt are based on expected future cash flows
    discounted at market interest rates. The fair value of
    NRG’s traded long-term debt is estimated based on quoted
    market prices for those instruments that are traded or on a
    present value method using current interest rates for similar
    instruments with equivalent credit quality.

Note 5 —
    Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

SFAS 133, requires NRG to recognize all derivative
    instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities
    and to measure them at fair value each reporting period unless
    they qualify for a NPNS exception. If certain conditions are
    met, NRG may be able to designate certain derivatives as cash
    flow hedges and defer the effective portion of the change in
    fair value of the derivatives to OCI and subsequently recognized
    in earnings when the hedged transaction occurs. The ineffective
    portion of a cash flow hedge is immediately recognized in
    earnings.

For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets
    or liabilities, the changes in fair value of both the derivative
    and the hedged transaction are recorded in current earnings. The
    ineffective portion of a hedging derivative instrument’s
    change in fair value is immediately recognized into earnings.

For derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges or
    do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in
    the fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Under
    the guidelines established per SFAS 133, certain derivative
    instruments may qualify for the NPNS exception and are therefore
    exempt from fair

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

value accounting treatment. SFAS 133 applies to NRG’s
    energy related commodity contracts, interest rate swaps, and
    foreign exchange contracts.

As the Company engages principally in the trading and marketing
    of its generation assets, most of NRG’s commercial
    activities qualify for hedge accounting under the requirements
    of SFAS 133. In order to so qualify, the physical
    generation and sale of electricity should be highly probable at
    inception of the trade and throughout the period it is held, as
    is the case with the Company’s baseload plants. For this
    reason, the majority of trades in support of NRG’s baseload
    units normally qualify for NPNS or cash flow hedge accounting
    treatment, and trades in support of NRG’s peaking units
    will generally not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, with
    any changes in fair value likely to be reflected on a
    mark-to-market basis in the statement of operations. All of
    NRG’s hedging and trading activities are in accordance with
    the Company’s risk management policy.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Energy-Related
    Commodities

To manage the commodity price risk associated with the
    Company’s competitive supply activities and the price risk
    associated with power sales from the Company’s electric
    generation facilities, NRG may enter into a variety of
    derivative and non-derivative hedging instruments, utilizing the
    following:

•

Forward contracts, which commit NRG to sell energy commodities
    or purchase fuels in the future.

•

Futures contracts, which are exchange-traded standardized
    commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial

•

Swap agreements, which require payments to or from
    counter-parties based upon the differential between two prices
    for a predetermined contractual, or notional, quantity.

•

Option contracts, which convey the right or obligation to buy or
    sell a commodity.

The objectives for entering into derivative contracts designated
    as hedges include:

•

Fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity
    sales through the use of various derivative instruments
    including gas collars and swaps at a level that provides an
    acceptable return on the Company’s electric generation
    operations.

•

Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for
    the operation of NRG’s power plants.

•

Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated energy purchases to
    supply NRG’s load-serving customers.

As of December 31, 2007, NRG had hedge and non-hedge
    energy-related derivative financial instruments, and other
    energy-related contracts that did not qualify as derivative
    financial instruments extending through December 2026. As of
    December 31, 2007, NRG’s derivative assets and
    liabilities consisted primarily of the following:

•

Forward and financial contracts for the sale of electricity and
    related products economically hedging NRG’s generation
    assets’ forecasted output through 2014.

•

Forward and financial contracts for the purchase of fuel
    commodities relating to the forecasted usage of NRG’s
    generation assets into 2017.

Also, as of December 31, 2007, NRG had other energy-related
    contracts that qualified for the NPNS exception and were
    therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment under the
    guidelines established by SFAS 133 as follows:

•

Power sales and capacity contracts extending to 2025.

•

Coal purchase contracts extending through 2012 designated as
    normal purchases and disclosed as part of NRG’s contractual
    cash obligations. See Note 21,

Interest
    Rate Swaps

NRG is exposed to changes in interest rates through the
    Company’s issuance of variable and fixed rate debt. In
    order to manage the Company’s interest rate risk, NRG
    enters into interest-rate swap agreements. In January 2006, in
    anticipation of the New Senior Credit Facility, NRG entered into
    a series of forward starting interest rate swaps intended to
    hedge the variability in cash flows associated with the debt
    issuance. These transactions were designated as cash flow hedges
    with any gains/losses deferred on the balance sheet in OCI. In
    February 2006, with the completion of the sale of the Senior
    Notes, the Company designated a fixed-to-floating interest rate
    swap as a hedge of fair value changes in the Senior Notes. This
    interest rate swap was previously designated as a hedge of
    NRG’s 8% Second Priority Notes, which were effectively
    replaced by the Senior Notes.

As of December 31, 2007, all of NRG’s interest rate
    swap arrangements had been designated as either cash flow or
    fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2007, NRG had
    interest rate derivative instruments extending through June 2019.

Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive Income

Gains and losses attributable to hedge derivatives are
    reclassified from OCI to current period earnings due to the
    unwinding of previously deferred amounts. These amounts are
    recorded on the same line in the statement of operations in
    which the hedged transactions are recorded. Changes in the fair
    values of derivatives accounted for as hedges are also recorded
    in OCI.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the unrealized loss
    associated with changes in the fair value of derivative
    instruments not accounted for as hedge derivatives of
    $77 million is comprised of $34 million of fair value
    increases in forward sales of electricity and fuel,
    $160 million loss from the reversal of mark-to-market
    gains,

which ultimately settled as financial revenues, and
    $49 million of gains associated with our trading activity.
    The $34 million of fair value increases in forward sales of
    electricity and fuel includes approximately $14 million due
    to the ineffectiveness associated with financial forward
    contracted electric and gas sales.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, the unrealized gain
    associated with changes in the fair value of derivative
    instruments not accounted for as hedge derivatives of
    $295 million is comprised of $172 million of fair
    value increases in forward sales of electricity and fuel,
    $90 million from the reversal of mark-to-market losses,
    which ultimately settled as financial revenues, and
    $33 million of gains associated with our trading activity.
    The $172 million of fair value increases in forward sales
    of electricity and fuel includes approximately $28 million
    due to the ineffectiveness associated with financial forward
    contracted electric and gas sales. NRG’s pre-tax earnings
    were also affected by a $3 million loss due to
    ineffectiveness associated with our fixed-to-floating interest
    rate swap designated as a hedge of fair value changes in the
    Senior Notes.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, the unrealized loss
    associated with changes in the fair value of derivative
    instruments not accounted for as hedge derivatives of
    $154 million is comprised of $122 million of fair
    value decreases in forward sales of electricity and fuel,
    $59 million from the reversal of mark-to-market gains,
    which ultimately settled as financial revenues, and
    $27 million of gains associated with our trading activity.
    The impact of hedge ineffectiveness associated with financial
    forward contracted electric sales was immaterial.

Discontinued Hedge Accounting

— During 2006,
    due to a relatively mild summer season and expected lower power
    generation for the remainder of 2006, NRG discontinued cash flow
    hedge accounting for certain contracts related to commodity
    prices previously accounted for as a cash flow hedge and
    determined forecasted sales were no longer probable. These
    contracts were originally entered into as hedges of forecasted
    sales by baseload plants. The decision not to deliver against
    these contracts was driven by the decline in natural gas and
    associated power prices, making it uneconomical to dispatch the
    units into the marketplace. As a result, approximately
    $5 million of previously deferred revenue in OCI was
    recognized in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Impact of Hedge Reset

— NRG accounted for the
    Company’s Hedge Reset transaction as a net settlement of
    its current hedge positions and a subsequent reestablishment of
    new hedge positions. The impact of the net settlement reduced
    revenues by approximately $129 million.

As of December 31, 2006, the impact to NRG’s
    consolidated financial position and statement of operations from
    the Hedge Reset transaction was as follows:

    Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund

NRG’s nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets which are
    for the decommissioning of South Texas Project, or STP, are
    primarily comprised of securities recorded at fair value based
    on actively quoted market prices. NRG accounts for these trust
    fund assets per SFAS 71,

Accounting for the Effects of
    Certain Types of Regulation

, because the Company’s
    nuclear decommissioning activities are regulated by the Public
    Utility Commission of Texas, or PUCT. Although the owners of STP
    are responsible for the management of decommissioning STP, the
    cost of decommissioning is the responsibility of the Texas
    ratepayers. As such, NRG does not bear the cost for these
    decommissioning responsibilities, except to the extent that NRG
    has a prudence obligation with respect to the management of the
    trust funds or the future decommissioning of STP. Third party
    appraisals are periodically conducted to estimate the future
    decommissioning liability related to STP. These appraisals are
    then used to determine the adequacy of the existing
    decommissioning trust investments to cover that estimated future
    liability.

Should there be a shortfall in the value of the assets in the

Goodwill

—

In connection with the

    has recorded goodwill in the amount of approximately
    $1.8 billion. Goodwill is not amortized but instead tested
    for impairment in accordance with SFAS 142 at the

reporting-unit

level. Goodwill is tested annually, typically during

the fourth quarter, or more often if events or circumstances,
    such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate there
    may be an impairment. As of December 31, 2007, there was no
    impairment to goodwill. As of December 31, 2007, NRG had
    approximately $851 million of goodwill that is deductible
    for U.S. income tax purposes in future periods.

Intangible Assets

—

NRG acquired
    intangible assets as part of the Company’s acquisition of
    Texas Genco LLC and established intangible assets upon adoption
    of Fresh Start reporting. These intangible assets include
    SO


and
    NO

x

emission allowances and certain in-market power, fuel (coal,
    gas, and nuclear) and water contracts. The emission allowances
    are amortized and recorded as part of the cost of operations,
    with
    NO

x

emission allowances amortized on a straight line basis and
    SO


emission allowances amortized based on units of production. The
    power contracts are amortized based on contracted volumes over
    the life of each contract and the fuel contracts are amortized
    over expected volumes over the life of each contract. The power
    contracts are amortized and recorded as part of revenues, while
    fuel and water contracts are amortized and recorded as part of
    the cost of operations.

NRG actively trades portions of the Company’s emission
    allowances as part of the Company’s asset optimization
    strategy, with their respective costs expensed when sold.
    Emission allowances that the Company designates for such trading
    are reclassified to intangible assets held-for-sale on the
    balance sheet and are not amortized.

The weighted average remaining amortization period is

    emitted from the respective plants.

Intangible assets held for sale

— NRG records
    the Company’s bank of emission allowances as part of the
    Company’s intangible assets. From time to time, management
    may authorize the transfer from the Company’s emission bank
    to intangible assets held-for-sale as part of the Company’s
    asset optimization strategy. As of December 31, 2007, the
    value of emission allowances held-for-sale is $14 million
    and is managed within the Corporate segment. Once transferred to
    held-for-sale, these emission allowances transferred are
    prohibited from moving back to held-for-use.

Out-of-market contracts —

Due to Fresh Start
    accounting, as well as the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, NRG
    acquired certain out-of-market contracts. These are primarily
    power, gas swaps, and certain coal contracts and are classified
    as non-current liabilities on NRG’s consolidated balance
    sheet. Both the gas swap and power contracts are amortized to
    revenues, while the coal contracts are amortized to cost of
    operations.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Supplemental indentures to the series of notes have been issued
    to add newly formed or acquired subsidiaries as guarantors.

The Indentures and the form of notes provide, among other
    things, that the Senior Notes will be senior unsecured
    obligations of NRG. The Indentures also provide for customary
    events of default, which include, among others: nonpayment of
    principal or interest; breach of other agreements in the
    Indentures; defaults in failure to pay certain other
    indebtedness; the rendering of judgments to pay certain amounts
    of money against NRG and its subsidiaries; the failure of
    certain guarantees to be enforceable; and certain events of
    bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default
    occurs, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal
    amount of the then outstanding series of Senior Notes may
    declare all of the Senior Notes of such series to be due and
    payable immediately.

The terms of the Indentures, among other things, limit
    NRG’s ability and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability
    to:

•

return capital to shareholders;

•

grant liens on assets to lenders; and

•

incur additional debt.

Interest is payable semi-annually on the Senior Notes until

Senior
    Credit Facility

2007 Activity

— On June 8, 2007, NRG
    completed a $4.4 billion refinancing of the Company’s
    then existing senior credit facility which was comprised of a
    senior first priority secured term loan, or the Term Loan
    Facility, a $1.0 billion senior first priority secured
    revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, and
    a senior first priority secured synthetic letter of credit
    facility, or the Letter of Credit Facility. The refinancing
    resulted in a 0.25% reduction on the spread that the Company
    pays on its Term B loan and Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility,
    a $200 million reduction in the Synthetic Letter of Credit
    Facility from $1.5 billion to $1.3 billion, and
    various amendments to provide improved flexibility, efficiency
    for returning capital to shareholders, asset repowering and
    investment opportunities. The pricing on the Company’s Term
    B loan and Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility is also subject
    to further reductions upon the achievement of certain financial
    ratios. The refinancing resulted in a charge of approximately
    $35 million to the Company’s results of operations for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, which was primarily
    related to the write-off of previously deferred financing costs.

On August 6, 2007, NRG entered into an agreement with BNP
    Paribas, or BNP, whereby BNP has agreed to be an issuing bank
    under the revolver portion of the Company’s Senior Credit
    Facility. BNP has agreed to issue up to $350 million of
    letters of credit under the revolver. This increased the amount
    of unfunded letters of credit the Company can issue under its
    Revolving Credit Facility to $650 million. As of
    December 31, 2007, NRG was permitted to issue additional
    letters of credit of up to $350 million under the Senior
    Credit Facility through other financial institutions.



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On December 31, 2007, the Company used cash on hand to
    prepay, without penalty, $300 million of its Term B loan
    under the Senior Credit Facility. With this prepayment, the
    Company has met a financial ratio by the end of 2007 that would
    result in a 0.25% reduction in the interest rate on both its
    Term B loan and Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility. The
    prepayment will be credited against the Company’s mandatory
    annual prepayment which is required in March 2008 under the
    Senior Credit Facility.

Significant terms

— The Term Loan Facility
    matures on February 1, 2013, and amortizes in 27
    consecutive equal quarterly installments of 0.25% term loan
    commitments, beginning June 30, 2006, with the balance
    payable on the seventh anniversary thereof. The full amount of
    the Revolving Credit Facility will mature on February 2,
    2011. The Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility will mature on
    February 1, 2013, and no amortization will be required in
    respect thereof. As of December 31, 2007, NRG had issued
    $743 million under the Company’s Synthetic Letter of
    Credit Facility and $3 million in letters of credit under
    the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility. NRG has the option
    to prepay the Senior Credit Facility in whole or in part at any
    time.

Beginning 2008, NRG must offer a portion of its excess cash
    flow, an amount which approximates the Company’s free cash
    flow for the prior year, to its first lien lenders. The
    percentage of the excess cash flow offered to these lenders is
    dependent upon the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio at
    the end of the preceding year. Of the amount offered, the first
    lien lenders must accept 50%, while the remaining 50% may either
    be accepted or rejected at the lenders’ option. Based on
    current credit market conditions the Company expects that its
    lenders will accept in full the mandatory offer required in
    March 2008, and, as such, the Company has reclassified
    approximately $146 million of Term Loan B maturity
    from a non-current to a current liability as of
    December 31, 2007.

The Senior Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of
    NRG’s existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries,
    with certain customary or

agreed-upon

exceptions for unrestricted foreign subsidiaries, project
    subsidiaries, and certain other subsidiaries. The capital stock
    of substantially all of NRG’s subsidiaries, with certain
    exceptions for unrestricted subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries,
    and project subsidiaries, has been pledged for the benefit of
    the Senior Credit Facility’s lenders.

The Senior Credit Facility is also secured by first-priority
    perfected security interests in substantially all of the
    property and assets owned or acquired by NRG and its
    subsidiaries, other than certain limited exceptions. These
    exceptions include assets of certain unrestricted subsidiaries,
    equity interests in certain of NRG’s project affiliates
    that have non-recourse debt financing, and voting equity
    interests in excess of 66% of the total outstanding voting
    equity interest of certain of NRG’s foreign subsidiaries.

The Senior Credit Facility contains customary covenants, which,
    among other things, require NRG to meet certain financial tests,
    including minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage
    ratio on a consolidated basis, and limit NRG’s ability to:

•

incur indebtedness and liens and enter into sale and lease-back
    transactions;

•

make investments, loans and advances; and

•

return capital to shareholders.

Interest Rate Swaps

— In connection with the
    Senior Credit Facility, NRG entered into a series of
    forward-setting interest rate swaps in 2006 which are intended
    to hedge the risks associated with floating interest rates. For
    each of the interest rate swaps, the Company pays its
    counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a
    predetermined notional value, and NRG receives quarterly the
    equivalent of a floating interest payment based on a

3-month

LIBOR calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate
    swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made quarterly,
    and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period.
    While the notional value of each of the swaps does not vary over
    time, the swaps are designed to mature sequentially.

Holdco
    Credit Facility

During 2007, the Company initiated a capital allocation strategy
    that contemplated NRG becoming a wholly-owned operating
    subsidiary of a newly created holding company, NRG Holdings,
    Inc. or Holdco, with the stockholders of NRG becoming
    stockholders of Holdco. On June 8, 2007, NRG executed a
    Holdco Credit Facility, a delayed-draw credit facility that
    expired December 28, 2007 that provided for the funding of
    $1 billion in term loan financing to Holdco which was
    intended for Holdco to make a capital contribution to NRG in the
    amount of $1 billion, to be used to prepay a portion of
    NRG’s existing Term B loan. As part of the commitment NRG
    agreed to pay a fee equal to 0.5% of the facility for the first
    180 days and 0.75% thereafter.

In November 2007, NRG exercised its right to provide its Senior
    Note holders with a conditional change of control notice, and
    related offer to purchase the Company’s Senior Notes at
    101% of par, prior to the actual formation of the Holdco
    structure. Concurrently, NRG also sought consent from its Senior
    Note holders to either waive the change of control or permit
    additional restricted payments under the indentures. In December
    2007, the conditional tender offers and concurrent consent
    solicitations expired with no tendered Senior Notes accepted for
    payment and without receipt of the requisite consents to amend
    the indentures for the Senior Notes. Consequently, the Company
    decided not to move forward and form the Holdco structure.

NRG
    Non-Recourse Debt

Debt
    Related to Capital Allocation Program

During the third quarter 2006, the Company formed two
    wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiaries, NRG Common Stock
    Finance I, LLC, or CSF I, and NRG Common Stock Finance
    II, LLC, or CSF II, that are both consolidated by NRG. Their
    purpose was to repurchase $500 million shares of NRG’s
    common stock in the public markets or in privately negotiated
    transactions in connection with the Company’s Capital
    Allocation Program. These subsidiaries were funded with a
    combination of cash from NRG and a mix of notes and preferred
    interests issued to Credit Suisse. Both the notes and the
    preferred interests are non-recourse debt to NRG or any of its
    restricted subsidiaries, with the notes collateralized by the
    NRG common stock repurchased by these two wholly-owned
    unrestricted subsidiaries that are consolidated in the
    Company’s statement of financial position. In addition, the
    assets of these two subsidiaries are not available to the
    creditors of NRG or the Company’s other subsidiaries.

These notes and preferred interests contain a feature considered
    an embedded derivative, which requires NRG to pay to Credit
    Suisse at maturity, either in cash or stock, the excess of
    NRG’s then current stock price over a Reference Price. This
    Reference Price is the price of NRG’s stock in excess of a
    compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 20% beyond the
    volume-weighted average share price of the stock at the time of
    repurchase. Although this feature is considered a derivative, it
    is exempt from derivative accounting under the guidance in
    paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133, and will only be
    recognized upon settlement with a corresponding impact to
    Additional Paid-In Capital if settled in stock.

Notes

— As of December 31, 2007, CSF I and
    CSF II issued a total of $249 million in notes in
    connection with Phase I of the Capital Allocation Program that
    mature in two tranches: $137 million in October 2008, plus
    accrued interest at an annual rate of 5.45%, and the balance of
    $112 million in October 2009, plus accrued interest at an
    annual rate of 6.11%.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Preferred Interests

— As of December 31,
    2007, total preferred interests issued and outstanding by CSF I
    and CSF II were approximately $84 million to Credit Suisse.
    These preferred interests are classified as a liability per
    SFAS 150, because they embody a fixed unconditional
    obligation that these two unrestricted subsidiaries must settle.
    The preferred interests also mature in two tranches:
    $53 million in October 2008, plus accrued interest at an
    annual rate of 12.65%, and $31 million in October 2009,
    plus accrued interest at an annual rate of 13.23%.

CSF I Extension

— On February 27, 2008,
    the Company entered into an arrangement with Credit Suisse that
    allows the Company, at the Company’s option and subject to
    customary closing conditions, to extend the $220 million
    notes and preferred interest maturities of CSF I from October
    2008 to June 2010. In addition, the previous settlement date for
    any share price appreciation beyond a 20% compound annual growth
    rate since the original date of purchase by CSF I, may be
    extended 30 days to early December 2008. As part of this
    extension arrangement, the Company intends to contribute to CSF
    I additional collateral in the form of treasury shares to
    maintain a blended interest rate of CSF I facility of
    approximately 7.5%. The Company expects to implement this
    extension arrangement by March 17, 2008.

Project
    Financings

The following are descriptions of certain indebtedness of
    NRG’s project subsidiaries that remain outstanding as of
    December 31, 2007. The indebtedness described below is
    non-recourse to NRG, unless otherwise noted.

Peakers

In June 2002, NRG Peaker Financing LLC, or Peakers, an indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $325 million in floating
    rate bonds due June 2019. Peakers subsequently swapped such
    floating rate debt for fixed rate debt at an all-in cost of
    6.67% per annum. Principal, interest, and swap payments are
    guaranteed by XL Capital Assurance, through a financial guaranty
    insurance policy. These notes are also secured by, among other
    things, substantially all of the assets of and membership
    interests in Bayou Cove Peaking Power LLC, Big Cajun I Peaking
    Power LLC, NRG Sterlington Power LLC, NRG Rockford LLC, NRG
    Rockford II LLC, and NRG Rockford Equipment LLC. As of
    December 31, 2007, approximately $279 million in
    principal remained outstanding on these bonds. Upon emergence
    from bankruptcy, NRG issued a $36 million letter of credit
    to the Peakers’ Collateral Agent. The letter of credit may
    be drawn if the project is unable to meet principal or interest
    payments. There are no provisions requiring NRG to replenish the
    letter of credit if it is drawn.

NRG
    Thermal

NRG owns and operates its thermal business through a
    wholly-owned subsidiary holding company, NRG Thermal LLC, or NRG
    Thermal. In August 1993, the predecessor entity to NRG
    Thermal’s largest subsidiary, NRG Energy Center Minneapolis
    LLC, or NRG Thermal Minneapolis, issued $84 million of
    7.31% senior secured notes due June 2013, of which
    approximately $36 million remained outstanding as of
    December 31, 2007. In July 2002, NRG Thermal Minneapolis
    issued an additional $55 million of 7.25% Series A
    notes due August 2017, of which approximately $42 million
    remained outstanding as of December 31, 2007, and
    $20 million of 7.12% Series B notes due August 2017,
    of which approximately $15 million remained outstanding as
    of December 31, 2007. This indebtedness is secured by
    substantially all of the assets of NRG Thermal Minneapolis. NRG
    Thermal has guaranteed the indebtedness, and its guarantee is
    secured by a pledge of the equity interests in all of NRG
    Thermal’s subsidiaries.

Capital
    Leases

Saale
    Energie GmbH

Saale Energie GmbH, or SEG, an NRG wholly-owned subsidiary, has
    a 41.9% participation in the Schkopau Power Plant, or Schkopau,
    through NRG’s interest in the Kraftwerke Schkopau GbR, or
    KSGbR, partnership. Under the terms of a Use and Benefit Fee
    Agreement, SEG and the other partner to the project, E.ON
    Kraftwerke GmbH, are required to fund debt service and certain
    other costs resulting from the construction and financing of
    Schkopau. The Use and Benefit Fee Agreement is treated as a
    capital lease under U.S. GAAP. Calls for funds are made to
    the partners based on their participation interest as cash is
    needed. The KSGbR issued debt to fund Schkopau pursuant to
    multiple facilities totaling approximately
    €785 million (approximately $1.1 billion). As of
    December 31, 2007, approximately €239 million
    (approximately $349 million) remained outstanding at
    Schkopau. Interests on the individual loans accrue at fixed
    rates averaging 5.47% per annum, with maturities occurring
    between 2008 and 2015. The lenders to the project rely almost
    exclusively on the creditworthiness of E.ON Kraftwerke GmbH. SEG
    remains liable to the lenders as a partner in KSGbR, but there
    is no recourse to NRG. As of December 31, 2007, the capital

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Note 12 — Benefit
    Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158. This statement
    requires an employer that sponsors one or more single-employer
    defined benefit plans to recognize the funded status of a
    benefit plan in its statement of financial position with an
    offset to other comprehensive income, and recognize as a
    component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains
    or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during
    the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic
    benefit cost. NRG adopted this statement as of the
    Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2006.

NRG sponsors and operates three defined benefit pension and
    other postretirement plans. The NRG Plan for Bargained Employees
    and the NRG Plan for Non-bargained Employees are maintained
    solely for eligible legacy NRG participants. A third plan, the
    Texas Genco Retirement Plan, is maintained for participation
    solely by eligible Texas based employees. NRG expects to
    contribute approximately $87 million to the Company’s
    three pension plans in 2008.

NRG Plans for Bargained and Non-bargained Employees

—  Substantially all employees hired prior to
    December 5, 2003 were eligible to participate in NRG’s
    legacy defined benefit pension plans. The Company initiated a
    noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan effective
    January 1, 2004, with credit for service from
    December 5, 2003. In addition, the Company provides
    postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain groups of
    employees. Generally, these are groups that were acquired prior
    to 2004 and for whom prior benefits are being continued (at
    least for a certain period of time or as required by union
    contracts). Cost sharing provisions vary by acquisition group
    and terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements.

Texas Genco Retirement Plan

— The Texas
    region’s pension plan is a noncontributory defined benefit
    pension plan that provides a final average pay benefit or cash
    balance benefit, where the participant receives the more
    favorable of the two formulas, based on all years of service. In
    addition, employees who were hired prior to 1999 are also
    eligible for grandfathered benefits under a final average pay
    formula. In most cases, the benefits under the grandfathered
    formula will be frozen on December 31, 2008. NRG’s
    Texas region employees are also covered under an unfunded
    postretirement health and welfare plan. Each year, employees
    receive a fixed credit of $750 to their account plus interest.
    Certain grandfathered employees will receive additional credits
    through 2008. At retirement, the employees may use their
    accounts to purchase retiree medical and dental benefits from
    NRG. NRG’s costs are limited to the amounts earned in the
    employee’s account; all other costs are paid by the
    participant.

NRG uses December 31 of each respective year as the measurement
    date for the Company’s pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans. The Company sets the discount rate assumptions on
    an annual basis for each of NRG’s retirement related
    benefit plans at their respective measurement date. This rate is
    determined by NRG’s Investment Committee based on
    information provided by the Company’s actuary. The discount
    rate assumptions reflect the current rate at which the
    associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end
    of the year. The discount rate assumptions used to determine
    future pension obligations as of December 31, 2007 and 2006
    were based on the Hewitt Yield Curve, or HYC, which was designed
    by Hewitt Associates to provide a means for plan sponsors to
    value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans. The
    HYC is a hypothetical yield curve represented by a series of
    annualized individual discount rates. Each bond issue underlying
    the HYC is required to have a rating of Aa or better by
    Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. or a rating of AA or better
    by Standard & Poor’s. Prior to using the HYC
    rates, the discount rate assumptions for pension expense in 2006
    and 2005 were based on investment yields available on AA rated
    long-term corporate bonds.

NRG employs a total return investment approach, whereby a mix of
    equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the
    long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
    Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of
    plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial
    condition. The target allocation of plan assets is 60% to 80%
    invested in equity securities, with the remainder invested in
    fixed income securities. The Investment Committee reviews the
    asset mix periodically and as the plan assets increase in future
    years, the Investment Committee may examine other asset classes
    such as real estate or private equity. NRG employs a building
    block approach to determining the long-term rate of return for
    plan assets, with proper consideration given to diversification
    and rebalancing. Historical markets are studied and long-term
    historical relationships between equities and fixed income are
    preserved, consistent with the widely accepted capital market
    principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater
    return over the long run. Current factors such as inflation and
    interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market
    assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are
    reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

Plan assets are currently invested in a diversified blend of
    equity and fixed-income investments. Furthermore, equity
    investments are diversified across U.S. and

non-U.S. equities,

as well as among growth, value, small and large capitalization
    stocks.

    Split

On April 25, 2007, NRG’s Board of Directors approved a
    two-for-one stock split of the Company’s outstanding shares
    of common stock which was effected through a stock dividend. The
    stock split entitled each stockholder of record at the close of
    business on May 22, 2007 to receive one additional share
    for every outstanding share of common stock held. The additional
    shares resulting from the stock split were distributed by the
    Company’s transfer agent on May 31, 2007. In
    connection with the stock split, the Company transferred
    approximately $1.3 million from Additional Paid-in Capital
    to Common Stock, representing the par value of additional shares
    issued. All share amounts for all periods presented have been
    adjusted to reflect the stock split.

    at a cost of approximately $638 million and
    $732 million, respectively, of the Company’s common
    stock.

In 2006, NRG initiated a Capital Allocation Program to be
    executed in two phases. Phase I, completed in the fourth
    quarter 2006, resulted in the repurchase of
    21,175,400 shares of the Company’s common stock for
    approximately $500 million. Phase II, also a
    $500 million share buyback program, began in the fourth
    quarter 2006 with the repurchase of 8,425,762 shares of NRG
    common stock for approximately $232 million. NRG completed
    Phase II in the third quarter 2007. The Company has thus
    repurchased 7,006,700 shares of NRG common stock for
    approximately $268 million relating to Phase II of the
    Capital Allocation Program for the year ended December 31,
    2007.

On May 22, 2007, NRG retired 14,094,962 shares of
    treasury stock. These retired shares are now included in the
    Company’s pool of authorized but unissued shares. The
    retired stock had a carrying value of approximately
    $447 million. The Company’s accounting policy upon the
    formal retirement of treasury stock is to deduct its par value
    from Common Stock and to reflect any excess of cost over par
    value as a deduction from Additional Paid-in Capital.

Preferred
    Stock

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company’s preferred stock
    consisted of three series, the 5.75% Mandatory Convertible
    Preferred Stock, or 5.75% Preferred Stock, the
    4% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, or 4% Preferred
    Stock, and the 3.625% Convertible Perpetual Preferred
    Stock, which is treated as Redeemable Preferred Stock, or 3.625%
    Preferred Stock.

5.75%
    Preferred Stock

On February 2, 2006, NRG completed the issuance of
    2,000,000 shares of 5.75% Preferred Stock, for net proceeds
    of $486 million, reflecting an offering price of $250 per
    share and the deduction of offering expenses and discounts of
    approximately $14 million. Dividends on the 5.75% Preferred
    Stock are $14.375 per share per year, and are due and payable on
    a quarterly basis beginning on March 15, 2006. The 5.75%
    Preferred Stock will

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

automatically convert into common stock on March 16, 2009,
    or the Conversion Date, at a rate that is dependent upon the
    applicable market value of NRG’s common stock.

Included in the agreement is a call option which allows that at
    any time prior to March 16, 2009, should the price of
    NRG’s common stock exceed $45.375, for at least 20 trading
    days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days, NRG may
    elect to cause the conversion of all, but not less than all, of
    its 5.75% Preferred Stock outstanding at the minimum conversion
    rate of 8.2712 shares of the Company’s common stock
    for each share of the 5.75% Preferred Stock. However, NRG can
    cause conversion only if it pays the holders in cash an amount
    equal to any accrued, accumulated and unpaid dividends on the
    outstanding 5.75% Preferred Stock declared and not declared plus
    the present value of all remaining future dividends through
    March 16, 2009.

Also included is an early conversion feature by the holders
    which is contingent upon a cash acquisition of NRG on or prior
    to March 16, 2009. This feature requires paying converting
    holders an amount equal to the sum of any accumulated and unpaid
    dividends, the present value of all remaining dividend payments
    through and including March 16, 2009, and a specified
    conversion rate determined by reference to the price per share
    of the Company’s common stock paid in such acquisition for
    each share of the outstanding 5.75% Preferred Stock. However,
    should such a transaction be consummated by a public acquirer,
    in lieu of providing for conversion and paying the dividend
    amount, the Company may adjust its conversion obligation such
    that upon conversion of the outstanding 5.75% Preferred Stock,
    NRG will deliver the acquirer’s common stock.

The following table illustrates the conversion rate per share of
    the 5.75% Preferred Stock:

    Preferred Stock

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, 420,000 shares of
    the Company’s 4% Preferred Stock were issued and
    outstanding at a liquidation value, net of issuance costs, of
    $406 million. Holders of the 4% Preferred Stock are
    entitled to receive, when declared by NRG’s Board of
    Directors, cash dividends at the rate of 4% per annum, or $40.00
    per share per year, payable quarterly in arrears commencing on
    March 15, 2005. The 4% Preferred Stock is convertible, at
    the option of the holder, at any time into shares of NRG’s
    common stock at an initial conversion price of $20.00 per share.
    On or after December 20, 2009, NRG may redeem, subject to
    certain limitations, some or all of the 4% Preferred Stock with
    cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation
    preference, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends, including
    liquidated damages, if any, to the redemption date.

Should NRG be subject to a fundamental change, as defined in the
    Certificate of Designation of the 4% Preferred Stock, each
    holder of shares of the 4% Preferred Stock has the right,
    subject to certain limitations, to require NRG to purchase any
    or all of the Company’s shares of Preferred Stock at a
    purchase price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, plus
    accumulated and unpaid dividends, including liquidated damages,
    if any, to the date of purchase. Final determination of a
    fundamental change must be approved by the Board of Directors.
    Each holder of the 4% Preferred Stock has one vote for each
    share of the 4% Preferred Stock held by the holder on all
    matters voted upon by the holders of NRG common stock, as well
    as voting rights specifically provided for in NRG’s amended
    and restated certificate of incorporation or as otherwise, from
    time to time, required by law.

The 4% Preferred Stock is, with respect to dividend rights and
    rights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution: junior to
    all of NRG’s existing and future debt obligations; junior
    to each other class or series of NRG’s capital stock other
    than (1) NRG’s common stock and any other class or
    series of the Company’s capital stock that provides that
    such class or series will rank junior to the 4% Preferred Stock,

3.625%
    Preferred Stock

On August 11, 2005, NRG issued 250,000 shares of
    3.625% Preferred Stock, which is treated as Redeemable Preferred
    Stock, to Credit Suisse in a private placement. As of
    December 31, 2007, 250,000 shares of the 3.625%
    Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding at a liquidation
    value, net of issuance costs, of $247 million. The 3.625%
    Preferred Stock amount is located after the Liabilities but
    before the Stockholders’ Equity section on the Balance
    Sheet, due to the fact that the preferred shares can be redeemed
    in cash by the shareholder.

The 3.625% Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of
    $1,000 per share. Holders of the 3.625% Preferred Stock are
    entitled to receive, out of legally available funds, cash
    dividends at the rate of 3.625% per annum, or $36.25 per share
    per year, payable in cash quarterly in arrears commencing on
    December 15, 2005. Each share of the 3.625% Preferred Stock
    is convertible during the

90-day

period beginning August 11, 2015 at the option of NRG or
    the holder. Holders tendering the 3.625% Preferred Stock for
    conversion shall be entitled to receive, for each share of
    3.625% Preferred Stock converted, $1,000 in cash and a number of
    shares of NRG common stock equal to the product of (a) the
    greater of (i) the difference between the average closing
    share price of NRG common stock on each of the 20 consecutive
    scheduled trading days starting on the date 30 exchange business
    days immediately prior to the conversion date, or the Market
    Price, and $29.54 and (ii) zero, times (b) 50.77. The
    number of NRG common stock to be delivered under the conversion
    feature is limited to 16,000,000 shares. If upon
    conversion, the Market Price is less than $19.69, then the
    Holder will deliver to NRG cash or a number of shares of NRG
    common stock equal in value to the product of (i) $19.69
    minus the Market Price, times (ii) 50.77. NRG may elect to
    make a cash payment in lieu of delivering shares of NRG common
    stock in connection with such conversion, and NRG may elect to
    receive cash in lieu of shares of common stock, if any, from the
    Holder in connection with such conversion. If a fundamental
    change occurs, the holders will have the right to require NRG to
    repurchase all or a portion of the 3.625% Preferred Stock for a
    period of time after the fundamental change at a purchase price
    equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, plus accumulated
    and unpaid dividends. The 3.625% Preferred Stock is senior to
    all classes of common stock, on a parity with the Company’s
    4% Preferred Stock, and junior to all of the Company’s
    existing and future debt obligations and all of NRG
    subsidiaries’ existing and future liabilities and capital
    stock held by persons other than NRG or its subsidiaries.

MIBRAG

— NRG owns a 50% interest in
    MIBRAG.  Located near Leipzig, Germany, MIBRAG owns
    and manages a coal mining operation, three lignite fueled power
    generation facilities and other related businesses.
    Approximately 40% of the power generated by MIBRAG is used to
    support its mining operations, with the remainder sold to a
    German utility company. A portion of the coal from MIBRAG’s
    mining operation is used to fuel the power generation
    facilities, but a majority of the mined coal is sold primarily
    to two major customers, including Schkopau, an affiliate of NRG.
    A significant portion of MIBRAG’s sales are made pursuant
    to long-term coal and energy supply contracts. For the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, NRG’s equity
    earnings from MIBRAG were approximately $36 million,
    $30 million and $26 million, respectively.

As discussed in Note 2,

Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

, the Company’s MIBRAG equity
    investment was negatively affected by the adoption of

EITF 04-6.

Upon adoption of

EITF 04-6

on January 1, 2006, NRG’s investment in MIBRAG was
    reduced by approximately $93 million, with an offsetting
    charge to retained earnings.

Saguaro Power Company

— NRG owns a 50%
    interest in the Saguaro plant, a cogeneration plant with
    dual-fuel capability, natural gas and oil. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, NRG’s equity loss from Saguaro was
    $3 million and a loss of approximately $1 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. NRG had no equity
    earnings in 2005 from Saguaro. However, at the end of 2005, NRG
    determined that it had a permanent decline in value of its 50%
    interest and recorded a write down of the Company’s equity
    investment in Saguaro by approximately $27 million.

Gladstone

— NRG owns a 37.5% interest in
    Gladstone, an unincorporated joint venture, or UJV, which
    operates a 1,613 megawatt coal-fueled power generation facility
    in Queensland, Australia. The power generation facility is
    managed by the joint venture participants and the facility is
    operated by NRG. Operating expenses incurred in connection with
    the operation of the facility are funded by each of the
    participants in proportion to their ownership interests. Coal is
    sourced from a mining operation owned and operated by certain
    joint venture partners



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and other investors under a long-term supply agreement. NRG and
    the joint venture participants receive a majority of their
    respective share of revenues directly from customers and are
    directly responsible and liable for project-related debt, all in
    proportion to the ownership interests in the UJV. Power
    generated by the facility is primarily sold to an adjacent
    aluminum smelter, with excess power sold on the national market.
    For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    NRG’s equity earnings from Gladstone were approximately
    $21 million, $25 million and $24 million,
    respectively.

On June 8, 2006, NRG announced the sale of the
    Company’s 37.5% equity interest in the Gladstone power
    station, or Gladstone, and its associated 100% owned NRG
    Gladstone Operating Services to Transfield Services of
    Australia. The sale is pending until NRG satisfies certain
    conditions, particularly the securing of certain consents and
    waivers from the other owners of the project, or agrees to
    complete the sale on alternative terms.

Note 15 — Write
    Downs and Gains/(Losses) on Sales of Equity Method
    Investments

Investments accounted for by the equity method are reviewed for
    impairment in accordance with APB 18, which requires that a loss
    in value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline
    should be recognized. Gains or losses are recognized on
    completion of the sale. Write downs and gains/(losses) on sales
    of equity method investments recorded in other income/expense in
    the Company’s consolidated statements of operations include

Latin American Funds

— On June 30, 2006,
    NRG, through its wholly-owned entities NRG Caymans-C and NRG
    Caymans-P, completed the sale of the entities remaining
    interests in various Latin American power funds to a subsidiary
    of Australia Post. Total proceeds received were approximately
    $23 million and a pre-tax gain of approximately
    $3 million was recognized in the second quarter 2006.

James River —

On May 15, 2006, NRG
    completed the sale of Capistrano Cogeneration Company, a
    subsidiary of NRG which owned a 50% interest in James River, to
    Cogentrix. The proceeds from the sale were approximately
    $8 million. As a result of the sale, NRG recorded a pre-tax
    loss of approximately $6 million.

Cadillac —

On January 1, 2006, NRG sold
    49.5% of the Company’s 50% interest in a 38MW biomass fuel
    generation facility located in Cadillac, Michigan, along with
    its right to receive Production Tax Credits, or PTCs, through
    2009 to Lakes Renewable LLC. In consideration, NRG received
    approximately $4 million in a note receivable and a
    promissory note equal to the value of the Company’s share
    in future PTCs earned through 2009. The sale was contingent upon
    the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the
    Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and accordingly, all
    consideration was held in escrow. On April 13, 2006, NRG
    sold its remaining 0.5% share



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in Cadillac along with the Company’s interest in the note
    receivable and promissory note to Delta Power for approximately
    $11 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately
    $11 million.

Saguaro

— During the fourth quarter of 2005,
    due to the expiration of the partnership’s long-term gas
    supply contract and higher market prices paid for natural gas,
    NRG determined that a decline in the value of the Company’s
    50% investment in Saguaro was considered to be permanent and
    recorded a write down of the Company’s investment of
    approximately $27 million.

Rocky Road

— In December 2005, NRG entered into
    a purchase and sale agreement with Dynegy, Inc., whereby NRG
    agreed to sell to Dynegy the Company’s 50% ownership
    interest in Rocky Road Power LLC for $45 million in cash.
    As a result of the purchase and sale agreement with Dynegy, NRG
    recorded an impairment charge of approximately $20 million
    to write down the value of the Company’s 50% interest in
    Rocky Road to the investment’s fair value of
    $45 million.

Kendall

— In December 2004, NRG sold its
    interest in Kendall to LS Power Associates, L.P., or LS Power.
    Under the terms of the December 2004 agreement, NRG retained the
    right to acquire a 40% interest in the plant within a

10-year

period for a nominal amount, or the Call Option. Therefore, the
    transaction was treated as a partial sale for accounting
    purposes. On August 8, 2005, NRG executed an agreement with
    LS Power to sell the Call Option for $5 million. A pre-tax
    gain of $4 million was recognized in the third quarter of
    2005.

Enfield

— On April 1, 2005, NRG completed
    the sale of the Company’s 25% interest in Enfield to
    Infrastructure Alliance Limited. Net cash proceeds received from
    the sale were approximately $65 million and a pre-tax gain
    of approximately $12 million was recorded in 2005.

Note 16 — Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net
    income less accumulated preferred stock dividends by the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Shares
    issued and treasury shares repurchased during the year are
    weighted for the portion of the year that they were outstanding.
    Diluted earnings per share is computed in a manner consistent
    with that of basic earnings per share while giving effect to all
    potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during
    the period.

Dilutive effect for equity compensation

— The
    outstanding non-qualified stock options, non-vested restricted
    stock units, deferred stock units and performance units are not
    considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings
    per share. However, these instruments are included in the
    denominator for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share
    under the treasury stock method.

Dilutive effect for other equity instruments

—
    NRG’s outstanding 4% Preferred Stock and 5.75% Preferred
    Stock are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing
    basic earnings per share. However, these instruments are
    considered for inclusion in the denominator for purposes of
    computing diluted earnings per share under the if-converted
    method. The Company’s 3.625% Preferred Stock and preferred
    interests and notes issued by CSF I and CSF II include
    conversion features that, if dilutive, are calculated using the
    if-converted method as well.

Effective income tax rate

%

%

38.2

%

The effective income tax rate for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 differs from the U.S. statutory rate
    of 35% primarily due to a taxable dividend from foreign
    operations and non-deductible interest, offset by earnings in
    foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates lower than the
    U.S. statutory rate including the impact of a law change
    that reduced the German tax rate.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, NRG’s state
    effective income tax rate has remained at 7%, which is
    consistent with its 2006 rate. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the Company decreased the estimated
    state effective income tax rate to 7% from the prior year state
    income tax rate of 9%. This decrease was due to the acquisition
    of Texas Genco LLC, which operates in the state of Texas where
    there was no state income tax as of December 31, 2006. A
    decrease to the net deferred tax asset balance of approximately
    $24 million, of which $21 million is derived from
    continuing operations and $3 million is from discontinued
    operations, has been recorded for this change during 2006. In
    addition, a reduction of $22 million, of which
    $19 million is generated from continuing operations and
    $3 million is from discontinued operations, reflected in
    our domestic valuation allowance, was recorded due to a change
    in our estimated state effective income tax rate during 2006.

The effective income tax rate for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 differs from the U.S. statutory rate
    of 35% due to a taxable dividend from foreign operations and
    non-deductible interest, offset by earnings in foreign
    jurisdictions that are taxed at rates lower than the
    U.S. statutory rate including the impact of a law change
    that reduced the German tax rate. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the effective tax rate differs from the
    U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to settlements paid from a
    claimant reserve established at bankruptcy as well as earnings
    in foreign jurisdictions that are taxed at rates lower than the
    U.S. statutory rate.

Deferred
    tax assets and valuation allowance

Net deferred tax balance

— As of
    December 31, 2007, NRG recorded a net deferred tax
    liability of $180 million. Due to an assessment of positive
    and negative evidence, related to projected capital gains and
    available tax planning strategies, NRG believes that it is more
    likely than not that a benefit will not be realized on
    $539 million of tax assets, thus a valuation allowance has
    remained, resulting in a net deferred tax liability of
    $719 million. NRG believes it is more likely than not that
    future earnings will be sufficient to utilize the Company’s
    deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowances at
    December 31, 2007.

NOL carryforwards

— As of December 31,
    2007, the Company had generated total domestic pretax book
    income of $860 million which fully utilized cumulative
    domestic net operating loss, or NOL, in the amount of
    $245 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2007,
    NRG has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of
    $288 million of which $72 million will expire starting
    2011 through 2016 and of which $216 million do not have an
    expiration date.

Valuation allowance

— As of December 31,
    2007, the Company’s valuation allowance and other deferred
    tax items were reduced as a result of the reduction in
    NRG’s net deferred tax assets. In accordance with

SOP 90-7,

these movements resulted in an increase in Additional Paid in
    Capital of approximately $56 million.

As of December 31, 2006, these movements resulted in the
    reduction of intangibles by $241 million, an increase in
    Additional Paid in Capital of $17 million and reduced tax
    expense by approximately $22 million (of which
    $3 million was reflected in discontinued operations).

Any future reductions to valuation allowance will be recorded to
    Additional

Paid-in-Capital

with the exception of $14 million which will be recorded to
    income tax expense.

APB
    Opinion 23

To the extent that NRG does not provide deferred income taxes
    for unremitted earnings, it is management’s intent to
    permanently reinvest those earnings overseas in accordance with
    APB Opinion No. 23 Accounting for Income Taxes-Special
    Areas, or APB 23. If NRG does not permanently reinvest earnings
    then deferred taxes of approximately $39 million would be
    recognized for the cumulative translation adjustment as of
    December 31, 2007.

Repatriation
    of foreign funds pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of

Pursuant to the Jobs Act, during 2005, NRG elected to deduct 85%
    of certain eligible dividends received from

non-U.S. subsidiaries

from its taxable income before the end of 2005 as those
    dividends were reinvested in the U.S. for eligible
    purposes. NRG repatriated approximately $298 million of
    accumulated foreign earnings. Only a portion of this amount
    represents the cumulative earnings and profits which resulted in
    approximately $5 million of tax expense. The remaining
    amounts transferred are considered a return of capital.

Tax
    Holidays

During 2005, the “Amazon Development Agency” granted
    an income tax holiday to our subsidiary ITISA pertaining to the
    local tax liability resulting from ITISA’s operating income
    for Brazilian tax purposes, applicable retroactively to
    January 1, 2005. The tax holiday program reduced the
    effective income tax rate to 15.25% from a statutory income tax
    rate of 34% resulting in a decrease in tax expense, recognized
    within discontinued operations, of approximately $5 and
    $3 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively. This tax holiday
    will expire in December 31, 2013.

Uncertain
    tax benefits

NRG has identified certain unrecognized tax benefits whose
    after-tax value was $683 million, of which $19 million
    would impact the Company’s effective tax rate if
    recognized. Of the $683 million in unrecognized tax
    benefits, $664 million relates to periods prior to the
    Company’s emergence from bankruptcy. In accordance with
    Statement of Position

90-7,

Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the
    Bankruptcy Code

, and the application of fresh start
    accounting, recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits
    existing pre-emergence would not impact the Company’s
    effective tax rate but would increase Additional Paid in
    Capital. As of December 31, 2007, NRG has recorded a
    $7 million non-current tax liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits. This amount was recorded after utilization in 2007 of
    the cumulative domestic NOL. In accordance with
    SFAS 141(R), any changes to our uncertain tax benefits
    occurring after

1/1/2009,

will be credited to income tax expense rather than APIC.

NRG has accrued interest and penalties related to these
    unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $4 million as of
    the adoption of FIN 48 by the Company on January 1,
    2007. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. For the year
    ended December 31, 2007, the Company incurred an immaterial
    amount of interest and penalties related to its unrecognized tax
    benefits.

Tax jurisdictions

— NRG is subject to
    examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed
    in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and
    foreign jurisdictions including major operations located in
    Germany, Australia, and Brazil. The Company is no longer subject
    to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to
    2002. With few exceptions, state and local income tax
    examinations are no longer open for years before 2003. The
    Company’s significant foreign operations are also no longer
    subject to examination by local jurisdictions for years prior to
    2000.

Sale of ITISA

— On December 18, 2007, NRG
    entered into a sale and purchase agreement to sell 100% interest
    in Tosli, which holds all NRG’s interest in ITISA, to
    Brookfield Power Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield
    Asset Management Inc., for a purchase price of approximately
    $288 million, plus the assumption of approximately
    $60 million in debt. The transaction, which is subject to
    the receipt of regulatory approval and other customary closing
    conditions, is expected to close during the first half of 2008.
    We expect a portion of this sale to result in capital gain,
    which will further reduce our uncertain tax benefits.

German
    Tax Reform Act 2008

On July 6, 2007, the German government passed the Tax
    Reform Act of 2008, which reduces the German statutory and
    resulting effective tax rates on earnings from approximately 36%
    to approximately 27% effective January 1, 2008. Due to this
    reduction in the statutory and resulting effective tax rate in
    2007, NRG recognized a $29 million tax benefit and as of
    December 31, 2007, NRG had a German net deferred tax
    liability of approximately $84 million which includes the
    impact of this tax rate change.

Note 19 — Stock-Based
    Compensation

In 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), a revision
    to SFAS 123, which required NRG to modify the recognition
    of expense for stock-based compensation in the statements of
    operations. NRG adopted the requirements of SFAS 123(R)
    effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective
    method. The provisions of SFAS 123(R) did not result in a
    significant change in NRG’s compensation expense because
    the Company previously recognized compensation expense in the
    statements of operations under SFAS 123. In accordance with
    SFAS 123(R), NRG estimated a forfeiture rate for each of
    the Company’s awards based on the number of instruments
    expected to vest rather than recording the actual forfeitures as
    they occur. The elimination of unearned compensation and amounts
    previously recognized in income related to the application of
    the new forfeiture rate to outstanding instruments as of
    January 1, 2006 were immaterial to NRG’s consolidated
    statements of operations.

Long-Term
    Incentive Plan, or LTIP

As of December 31, 2007, a total of 16,000,000 shares
    of NRG common stock were authorized for issuance under the LTIP,
    subject to adjustments in the event of a reorganization,
    recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock
    dividend, and a combination of shares, merger or similar change
    in NRG’s structure or outstanding shares of common stock.
    It is NRG’s policy to issue treasury shares upon exercise
    of a LTIP award. If there are no treasury shares available, new
    shares of common stock will be issued. There were
    7,941,758 shares of common stock remaining available for
    grants under NRG’s LTIP as of December 31, 2007.

Non-Qualified
    Stock Options, or NQSO’s

NQSO’s granted under the LTIP typically have a three-year
    graded vesting schedule beginning on the grant date and become
    exercisable at the end of the requisite service period. As
    provided for by SFAS 123(R), for share options with graded
    vesting issued after January 1, 2006, NRG recognizes
    compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period for the entire award. The maximum contractual
    term is ten years for approximately 1.3 million of
    NRG’s outstanding NQSO’s, and six years for the
    remaining 2.3 million NQSO’s.

    options was $7 million and $1 million, respectively.
    There were no NQSO’s exercised during 2005.

The fair value of the Company’s NQSO’s is estimated on
    the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

    historical two-year stock price volatility data. For 2007, as
    more historical NRG data has become available, expected
    volatility is calculated based on NRG’s historical stock
    price volatility data over the period commensurate with the
    expected term of the stock option. Typically, the expected term
    for the Company’s NQSO’s is based on the simple
    average of the contractual term and vesting term.

Restricted
    Stock Units, or RSU’s

Typically, RSU’s granted under the Company’s LTIP
    fully vest three years from the date of issuance. Fair value of
    the RSU’s is based on the closing price of NRG common stock
    on the date of grant. The following table

DSU’s represent the right of a participant to be paid one
    share of NRG common stock at the end of a deferral period
    established under the terms of the award. DSU’s granted
    under the Company’s LTIP are fully vested at the date of

Performance
    Units, or PU’s

PU’s granted under the Company’s LTIP fully vest three

    stock for the ten trading days prior to the vesting date, or the
    Measurement Price, is equal to or greater than the Target Price.
    A Target Price and Maximum Price are determined on the date of
    issuance. The payout for each PU will be equal to: (i) one
    share of common stock, if the Measurement Price equals the
    Target Price; (ii) a pro-rata amount between one and two
    shares of common stock, if the Measurement Price is greater than

Lignite
    Contract with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co.

The lignite used to fuel the Texas region’s Limestone
    facility is obtained from a surface mine, or the Jewett mine,
    adjacent to the facility under an amended long-term contract
    with TWCC, originally entered into in 1979. In June 2007, TWCC
    notified NRG of their election to deliver zero tons of lignite
    from the Jewett Mine for 2008,



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

effectively ending TWCC’s rights to deliver lignite from
    the Jewett Mine per the long-term contract after
    December 31, 2007. During the third quarter of 2007, NRG
    and TWCC renegotiated a long-term contract that has
    significantly changed the contractual structure as well as
    extended the mining period. The new contract is based on a
    cost-plus arrangement with incentives and penalties to ensure
    proper management of the mine. NRG has flexibility to increase
    or decrease lignite purchases from the mine within certain
    ranges, including the ability to suspend or terminate lignite
    purchases with adequate notice. The mining period has been
    extended through 2018 with an option to extend the mining period
    by two five-year intervals.

TWCC is responsible for performing ongoing reclamation
    activities at the mine until all lignite reserves have been
    produced. When production is completed at the mine, NRG will be
    responsible for final mine reclamation obligations. Due to an
    increase in reclamation estimates offset by the negotiated
    three-year extension of the mining contract, the Company’s
    asset retirement obligation for mine reclamation costs increased
    by $5 million.

The Railroad Commission of Texas has imposed a bond obligation
    of approximately $83 million on TWCC for the reclamation of
    this lignite mine. Pursuant to the contract with TWCC, an
    affiliate of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. has guaranteed
    $50 million of this obligation. The remaining sum of
    approximately $33 million has been bonded by the mine
    operator, TWCC. Approximately $7 million of such amount is
    supported by a letter of credit posted by NRG. Under the terms
    of the new cost plus agreement with TWCC, NRG is required to
    maintain a corporate guarantee of TWCC’s bond obligation in
    the amount of $50 million if CenterPoint Energy,
    Inc.’s obligation lapses, or pay the costs of obtaining
    replacement performance assurance. Additionally, NRG is required
    to provide additional performance assurance over TWCC’s
    current bond obligations if required by the Commission.

International
    Commitments

Two of the Company’s wholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries
    are severally responsible for the pro rata payments of
    principal, interest and related costs incurred in connection
    with the financing of NRG’s equity investment in the
    unincorporated joint venture Gladstone Power Station. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company was obligated for the loan
    of AUD 42 million (approximately US $37 million) in
    principal. This loan is scheduled to be fully repaid on
    March 31, 2009.

First
    and Second Lien Structure

NRG has granted first and second priority liens to certain
    counterparties on substantially all of the Company’s assets
    in the United States in order to secure certain obligations,
    which are primarily long-term in nature under certain power sale
    agreements and related contracts. NRG uses the first or second
    lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and
    letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post
    from time to time to support its obligations under these
    agreements. Within the first and second lien structure, the
    Company can hedge up to 80% of its baseload capacity and 10% of
    its non-baseload assets with these counterparties.

As part of NRG’s amended and restated credit agreement
    signed June 8, 2007, the Company obtained the ability to
    move its current second lien counterparty exposure to the first
    lien, on a pari passu basis with the Company’s existing
    first lien lenders. In exchange for moving some second lien
    holders to a pari passu basis with the Company’s first lien
    lenders, the counterparties relinquished letters of credit
    issued by NRG which they held as a part of their collateral
    package.

On October 30, 2007, NRG successfully moved certain second
    lien holders to a pari passu basis with the Company’s first
    lien lenders effectively releasing $557 million of letters
    of credit. With the movement to the first lien structure, the
    Company has significantly reduced its outstanding letter of
    credit exposure and thereby increased its liquidity. As of
    December 31, 2007, the net discounted exposure on the
    agreements and hedges that were subject to the first and second
    lien structure was approximately $425 million.

RepoweringNRG
    Project Deposit

NRG has made non-refundable deposits relating to

Repowering

NRG initiatives totaling approximately
    $71 million primarily towards the procurement of wind
    turbines. The Company believes that these deposits are necessary
    for the timely and successful execution of these projects. The
    deposits are in support of expected deliveries of wind turbines
    and other equipment totaling approximately $409 million
    through 2009. Although NRG is committed to their successful
    implementation, the Company may decide not to take delivery of
    the equipment and thus terminate the projects. This would result
    in the Company expensing the deposits it already has made.

On February 4, 2008, NRG through its wholly owned
    subsidiary, Padoma Wind Power LLC, had entered into a

50-50

joint
    venture with BP Alternative Energy North America Inc. to build
    the first phase of the Sherbino Wind Farm. The Sherbino I Wind
    Farm will be a 150-megawatt (MW) wind project, consisting of 50
    Vestas 3 MW wind turbine generators, located approximately
    40 miles east of Fort Stockton in Pecos County, Texas.
    NRG expects to contribute approximately $83 million in
    equity to the joint venture in 2008 and has posted a letter of
    credit in that amount.

Contingencies

Set forth below is a description of the Company’s material
    legal proceedings. Pursuant to the requirements of
    SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

or
    SFAS 5, and related guidance, NRG records reserves for
    estimated losses from contingencies when information available
    indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can
    be reasonably estimated. Because litigation is subject to
    inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or developments
    could occur, there can be no certainty that NRG may not
    ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded
    reserves. A future adverse ruling or unfavorable development
    could result in future charges, which could have a materially
    adverse effect on NRG’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows.

With respect to a number of the items listed below, management
    has determined that a loss is not probable or the amount of the
    loss is not reasonably estimable, or both. In some cases,
    management is not able to predict with any degree of substantial
    certainty the range of possible loss that could be incurred.
    Notwithstanding these facts, management has assessed each of
    these matters based on current information and made a judgment
    concerning its potential outcome, considering the nature of the
    claim, the amount and nature of damages sought, and the
    probability of success. Management’s judgment may, as a
    result of facts arising prior to resolution of these matters, or
    other factors, prove inaccurate and investors should be aware
    that such judgment is made subject to the uncertainty of
    litigation.

In addition to the legal proceedings noted below, NRG and its
    subsidiaries are party to other litigation or legal proceedings
    arising in the ordinary course of business. In management’s
    opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will
    not materially adversely effect NRG’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

NRG believes that it has valid defenses to the legal proceedings
    and investigations described below and intends to defend them
    vigorously. However, litigation is inherently subject to many
    uncertainties. There can be no assurance that additional
    litigation will not be filed against the Company or its
    subsidiaries in the future, asserting similar or different legal
    theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and
    relief. Unless specified below, the Company is unable to predict
    the outcome that these legal proceedings and investigations or
    reasonably estimate the scope or amount of any associated costs
    and potential liabilities. An unfavorable outcome in one or more
    of these proceedings could have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows. NRG also has indemnity rights for
    some of these proceedings to reimburse NRG for certain legal
    expenses and to offset certain amounts deemed to be owed in the
    event of an unfavorable litigation outcome.

California
    Electricity and Related Litigation

NRG, WCP, WCP’s four operating subsidiaries, Dynegy, Inc.,
    and numerous other unrelated parties are the subject of lawsuits
    that arose based on events that occurred in the California power
    market in 2000 and 2001. The

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

complaints primarily allege that the defendants engaged in
    unfair business practices, price fixing, antitrust violations,
    and other market gaming activities. Other cases, including
    putative class actions, have been filed in state and federal
    court on behalf of business and residential consumers that name
    WCP

and/or

subsidiaries of WCP, in addition to numerous other defendants.
    These complaints allege the defendants attempted to manipulate
    gas indexes by reporting false and fraudulent trades, and
    violated California’s antitrust law and unfair business
    practices law. The complaints seek restitution and disgorgement,
    civil fines, compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys’
    fees, and declaratory and injunctive relief. Discovery is
    proceeding in these cases. In October 2007, Dynegy reached a
    tentative settlement of all remaining coordinated natural gas
    index cases pending in state court in San Diego. The
    settlement has yet to be funded by Dynegy and requires court
    approval which is underway. If approved, neither WCP and its
    subsidiaries nor NRG would pay any settlement costs as Dynegy
    owed and continues to provide a complete defense and
    indemnification.

In cases relating to natural gas, Dynegy is defending WCP

and/or

its
    subsidiaries pursuant to an indemnification agreement and will
    be the responsible party for any loss. There are no further
    cases related to electricity, but should any new cases arise,
    Dynegy’s counsel would represent it and WCP

and/or

its
    subsidiaries, with each party responsible for half of the costs
    and each party responsible for half of any loss.

California
    Department of Water Resources

On December 19, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
    the Ninth Circuit reversed the Federal Energy Regulatory
    Commission’s, or FERC’s, prior determinations
    regarding the enforceability of certain wholesale power
    contracts and remanded the case to FERC for further proceedings
    consistent with the decision. One of these contracts was the
    wholesale power contract between the California Department of
    Water Resources, or CDWR, and subsidiaries of WCP. This case
    originated with a February 2002 complaint filed at FERC by the
    State of California alleging that many parties, including WCP
    subsidiaries, overcharged the State. For WCP, the alleged
    overcharges totaled approximately $940 million for 2001 and
    2002. The complaint demanded that FERC abrogate the CDWR
    contract and sought refunds associated with revenues collected
    under the contract. In 2003, FERC rejected this complaint,
    denied rehearing, and the case was appealed to the Ninth Circuit
    where oral argument was held on December 8, 2004. On
    December 19, 2006, the Court decided that in FERC’s
    review of the contracts at issue, FERC could not rely on the
    Mobile-Sierra standard presumption of just and reasonable rates,
    where such contracts were not reviewed by FERC with full
    knowledge of the then existing market conditions. On May 3,
    2007, WCP and the other defendants filed separate petitions for
    certiorari seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court and on
    September 25, 2007, the Court agreed to hear two of the
    filed petitions. Although WCP’s petition was not selected
    for review, the Court’s ultimate decision with respect to
    the other defendants’ petitions will apply equally to WCP.
    Oral argument occurred on February 19, 2008, and a decision
    is expected from the Court by the end of 2008. At this time,
    while NRG cannot predict with certainty whether WCP will be
    required to make refunds for rates collected under the CDWR
    contract or estimate the range of any such possible refunds, a
    reconsideration of the CDWR contract by FERC with a resulting
    order mandating significant refunds could have a material
    adverse impact on NRG’s financial position, statement of
    operations, and statement of cash flows. As part of the 2006
    acquisition of Dynegy’s 50% ownership interest in WCP, WCP
    and NRG assumed responsibility for any risk of loss arising from
    this case, unless any such loss was deemed to have resulted from
    certain acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
    part of Dynegy, in which case any such loss would be shared
    equally between WCP and Dynegy.

Station
    Service Disputes

On October 2, 2000, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, or
    NiMo, commenced an action against NRG in New York state court
    seeking damages related to NRG’s alleged failure to pay
    retail tariff amounts for utility services at the Dunkirk plant
    between June 1999 and September 2000. The parties agreed to
    consolidate this action with two other actions against the
    Huntley and Oswego plants. On October 8, 2002, by
    stipulation and order, this action was stayed pending submission
    to FERC of the disputes in the action. At FERC, NiMo asserted
    the same claims and legal theories, and on November 19,
    2004, FERC denied NiMo’s petition and ruled that the NRG
    facilities could net their service obligations over each 30
    calendar day period from the day NRG acquired the



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

facilities. In addition, FERC ruled that neither NiMo nor the
    New York Public Service Commission could impose a retail
    delivery charge on the NRG facilities because they are
    interconnected to transmission and not to distribution. NiMo
    appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit
    which, on June 23, 2006, denied the appeal finding that New
    York Independent System Operator’s, or NYISO’s,
    station service program that permits generators to self supply
    their station power needs by netting consumption against
    production in a month is lawful. On April 30, 2007, the
    U.S. Supreme Court denied NiMo’s request for review of
    the D.C. Circuit decision thus ending further avenues to appeal
    FERC’s ruling in this matter. NRG believes it is adequately
    reserved.

On December 14, 1999, NRG acquired certain generating
    facilities from CL&P. A dispute arose over station service
    power and delivery services provided to the facilities. On
    December 20, 2002, as a result of a petition filed at FERC
    by Northeast Utilities Services Company on behalf of itself and
    CL&P, FERC issued an order finding that, at times when NRG
    is not able to self-supply its station power needs, there is a
    sale of station power from a third-party and retail charges
    apply. In August 2003, the parties agreed to submit the dispute
    to binding arbitration. On September 11, 2007, the parties
    argued the dispute before a three judge arbitration panel. On
    February 19, 2008, the parties executed a settlement
    agreement ending the arbitration. A component of the settlement
    requires approval from ISO-NE. Our accrual was reversed into
    income consistent with the settlement.

Spring
    Creek Coal Company

In August 2007, Spring Creek Coal Company filed a complaint
    against NRG Texas LP, NRG South Texas LP, NRG Texas Power LLC,
    NRG Texas LLC, and NRG Energy, Inc. in the U.S. District
    Court for the federal district of Wyoming. The complaint alleges
    multiple breaches in 2007 of a 1978 coal supply agreement as
    amended by a later 1987 agreement, which plaintiff alleges is a
    “take or pay” contract. Damages of approximately
    $18 million are being sought. Certain of the defendants
    have filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction
    and certain other defendants have filed a motion to dismiss for
    lack of a case in controversy. The court will hear these and
    other motions on July 11, 2008. The trial is scheduled to
    begin on September 8, 2008.

Native
    Village of Kivalina and City of Kivalina

Numerous electric generating companies and oil and gas companies
    have been named as defendants in this complaint, which has been
    filed but not yet served on NRG. Damages of up to
    $400 million have been asserted. The complaint alleges that
    the carbon dioxide emissions of defendants contribute to global
    climate change which has harmed the plaintiffs. The complaint is
    filed on behalf of an Alaskan town made up of native tribes and
    seeks damages associated with those tribes having to relocate
    from the northern coast of Alaska, purportedly because of the
    effects of global warming.

Disputed
    Claims Reserve

As part of NRG’s plan of reorganization, NRG funded a
    disputed claims reserve for the satisfaction of certain general
    unsecured claims that were disputed claims as of the effective
    date of the plan. Under the terms of the plan, as such claims
    are resolved, the claimants are paid from the reserve on the
    same basis as if they had been paid out in the bankruptcy. To
    the extent the aggregate amount required to be paid on the
    disputed claims exceeds the amount remaining in the funded
    claims reserve, NRG will be obligated to provide additional cash
    and common stock to satisfy the claims. Any excess funds in the
    disputed claims reserve will be reallocated to the creditor pool
    for the pro rata benefit of all allowed claims. The contributed
    common stock and cash in the reserves is held by an escrow agent
    to complete the distribution and settlement process. Since NRG
    has surrendered control over the common stock and cash provided
    to the disputed claims reserve, NRG recognized the issuance of
    the common stock as of December 6, 2003 and removed the
    cash amounts from the balance sheet. Similarly, NRG removed the
    obligations relevant to the claims from the balance sheet when
    the common stock was issued and cash contributed.

On April 3, 2006, the Company made a supplemental
    distribution to creditors under the Company’s
    Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan, totaling $25 million in
    cash and 5,082,000 shares of common stock. As of
    February 7, 2008, the



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reserve held approximately $10 million in cash and
    approximately 1,317,138 shares of common stock on a
    post-stock split basis. NRG believes the cash and stock together
    represent sufficient funds to satisfy all remaining disputed
    claims.

Note 22 — Regulatory
    Matters

NRG operates in a highly regulated industry and the Company is
    subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. As
    such, NRG is affected by regulatory developments at both the
    federal and state levels and in the regions in which NRG
    operates. In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules,
    procedures, and protocols of the various ISO markets in which
    NRG participates. These wholesale power markets are subject to
    ongoing legislative and regulatory changes.

Northeast
    Region

New England —

On July 16, 2007, FERC
    conditionally accepted, subject to refund, the
    Reliability-Must-Run, or RMR, agreement filed on April 26,
    2007 by Norwalk Power for its units 1 and 2, specifying a
    June 19, 2007 effective date. Norwalk’s RMR rate and
    its eligibility for the RMR agreement, which is based upon the
    facility’s projected market revenues and costs, are subject
    to further proceedings. Norwalk filed for the RMR agreement in
    response to FERC’s order eliminating the Peaking Unit Safe
    Harbor bidding mechanism which took effect on June 19,
    2007. Settlement proceedings are still ongoing.

On December 28, 2006, the Attorney General of the State of
    Connecticut and Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed an appeal of
    the FERC orders accepting the settlement of the New England
    capacity market design with the U.S. Court of Appeals for
    the D.C. Circuit. The settlement, filed with FERC on
    March 7, 2006, by a broad group of New England market
    participants, provides for interim capacity transition payments
    for all generators in New England for the period starting
    December 1, 2006 through May 31, 2010, and the
    establishment of a FCM commencing May 31, 2010. On
    June 16, 2006, FERC issued an order accepting the
    settlement, which was reaffirmed on rehearing by order dated
    October 31, 2006. Interim capacity transition payments
    provided for under the FCM settlement commenced December 1,
    2006, as scheduled. A successful appeal by the Attorneys General
    could disturb the settlement and create a refund obligation of
    interim capacity transition payments. Oral argument was held on
    February 14, 2008.

New York —

On July 6, 2007, FERC issued an
    order establishing an approximately six-month paper hearing
    process to address reforms to the in-city Installed Capacity, or
    ICAP, market and to formulate comprehensive solutions. On
    October 4, 2007, the NYISO filed its proposal for revisions
    to the ICAP market for the New York City zone. While the
    NYISO’s proposal will retain the existing ICAP market
    structure, it will impose additional market power mitigation on
    the current owners of Consolidated Edison’s divested
    generation units in New York City (which include NRG’s
    Arthur Kill and Astoria facilities) who are deemed to be pivotal
    suppliers. Specifically, the NYISO proposal will impose a
    reference price on pivotal suppliers and require bids to be
    submitted at or below the reference price. The reference price
    will be the expected clearing price based upon the intersection
    of the supply curve and the ICAP Demand Curve if all suppliers
    bid as price-takers. The NYISO proposal, if accepted by FERC,
    would result in a significant decrease in the clearing price for
    New York City capacity. Earlier this year, FERC had rejected
    proposed mitigation that would have effectively lowered the
    capacity offer cap for those units from $105/kW-year to
    $82/kW-year. Although that proposal was rejected on
    March 6, 2007, FERC initiated an investigation to determine
    the justness and reasonableness of the NYISO’s in-city
    installed capacity market, setting a refund effective date of
    May 12, 2007. The NYISO’s October 4, 2007 filing
    proposes that any market reforms should be implemented only
    prospectively and that no refunds should be required.

On December 18, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
    the D.C. Circuit denied the appeals relating to the high prices
    for spinning reserves, or SR, and non-spinning reserves, or NSR,
    in the NYISO-administered markets during the period from
    January 29, 2000 to March 27, 2000. Certain entities
    had argued that the NYISO acted unreasonably in declining to
    invoke Temporary Extraordinary Operating Procedures, or TEP, to
    recalculate prices



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

and that the markets should be resettled for various reasons. In
    a series of orders, FERC had declined to grant the requested
    relief, explaining that (i) the NYISO acted reasonably in
    not invoking TEP, (ii) NYISO did not violate its tariff,
    and (iii) refunds should not be granted as they would be
    disruptive to settled market expectations. The Court’s
    December 18, 2007 order is expected to conclude this matter.

On March 15, 2006, NRG received the results from NYISO
    Market Monitoring Unit’s review of NRG’S Astoria
    plant’s 2004 Generating Availability Data System reporting.
    This audit may result in the resettlement of NRG’s capacity
    revenues from the Astoria facility due to a redetermination of
    the amount of available capacity. NRG is currently in settlement
    discussions with the NYISO, and the Company believes that it is
    adequately reserved.

PJM

— On August 23, 2007, several
    entities, including the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities,
    the District of Columbia Office of the People’s Counsel,
    and the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, filed appeals
    of the FERC orders accepting the settlement of the locational
    capacity market for PJM Interconnection, LLC. The settlement,
    filed at FERC on September 29, 2006, provides for a
    capacity market mechanism known as the Reliability Pricing
    Model, or RPM, which is designed to provide a long-term price
    signal through competitive forward auctions. On
    December 22, 2006, FERC issued an order accepting the
    settlement, which was reaffirmed on rehearing by order dated
    June 25, 2007. The RPM auction period for delivery year
    June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2008 was conducted
    earlier this year, and capacity payments pursuant to the RPM
    mechanism have commenced. A successful appeal by the appellants
    could disturb the settlement and create a refund obligation of
    capacity payments.

On January 15, 2008, the Maryland Public Service
    Commission, or MDPSC, filed at FERC a complaint against PJM
    claiming that PJM had failed to adequately mitigate certain
    generation resources, due to exemptions for resources used to
    relieve reactive limits on interfaces or that were constructed
    during certain periods after 1999. In addition to seeking an
    order eliminating the exemptions and a refund effective date as
    of the date of the complaint, the MDPSC is also seeking an
    investigation of periods prior to the complaint that could lead
    to disgorgement by certain entities, and possibly a resettlement
    of the market back to September 8, 2006. The principal
    impacts on NRG would occur as a resettlement of the LMPs, which
    is not viewed as likely at this time, and going-forward in the
    form of lower LMPs. In addition, NRG’s peaking units at its
    energy center in Dover, Delaware were built in 2001 and utilize
    the post-1999 bidding exemption.

Note 23 — Environmental
    Matters

The construction and operation of power projects are subject to
    stringent environmental and safety protection and land use laws
    and regulation in the U.S. If such laws and regulations
    become more stringent, or new laws, interpretations or
    compliance policies apply and NRG’s facilities are not
    exempt from coverage, the Company could be required to make
    modifications to further reduce potential environmental impacts.
    New greenhouse gas legislation and regulations to mitigate the
    effects of gases, including
    CO


from power plants, are under consideration at the federal and
    state levels. In general, the effect of such future laws or
    regulations is expected to require the addition of pollution
    control equipment or the imposition of restrictions or
    additional costs on the Company’s operations.

Environmental
    Capital Expenditures

Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated
    that environmental capital expenditures to be incurred from 2008
    through 2012 to meet NRG’s environmental commitments will
    be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion. These
    capital expenditures, in general, are related to installation of
    particulate,

    and mercury controls to comply with Clean Air Interstate Rule,
    or CAIR, the Clean Air Mercury Rule, or CAMR, and related state
    requirements as well as installation of Best Technology
    Available under the Phase II 316(b) rule. NRG continues to
    explore cost effective alternatives that can achieve desired
    results. The range reflects alternative strategies available
    with respect to the Company’s Indian River plant.

    shore line erosion. The landfill itself will require a further
    Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study to determine the
    type and scope of any additional work required. Until the
    Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study is completed, the
    Company is unable to predict the impact of any required
    remediation.

In November 2006, DNREC, promulgated
    Regulation No. 1146, or Reg 1146, Electric Generating
    Unit Multi-Pollutant Regulation and Section 111(d) of the
    State Plan for the Control of Mercury Emissions from Coal-Fired
    Electric Steam Generating Units. These regulations govern the
    control of
    SO


,
    NO

x

,
    and mercury emissions from electric generating units. NRG’s
    plan to install controls at the Company’s Indian River
    facility, while on an accelerated basis, was unable to meet
    certain deadlines, taking into account the time required, as a
    practical matter, to design, install and commission the
    necessary equipment. NRG filed a challenge to Reg 1146 with the
    Environmental Appeals Board, or EAB, on December 6, 2006.
    In addition, NRG also filed a protective appeal with the
    Delaware Superior Court on December 29, 2006. This
    challenge was settled when DNREC and NRG signed a Consent Order
    on September 25, 2007, and filed that document with the
    Delaware Superior Court thereby ending the case. Under this
    agreement, continued operations at the Company’s Indian
    River Generating Station are conditioned upon installation of
    controls on Units 1 and 2 by May 1, 2008, to reduce
    NO

x

;
    installation of controls on Units 1-4 by January 1, 2009 to
    meet mercury requirements; mothball of Units 1 and 2 by
    May 1, 2011, and May 1, 2010, respectively; and
    installation of advanced controls on Units 3 and 4 in 2011 to
    further reduce
    NO

x

and
    SO


.
    If the plant emits
    NO

x

in excess of 1,700 tons in any given ozone season, it will be
    subject to a graduated scale of stipulated penalties, up to a
    maximum $2,500/ton. The capital costs associated with this
    settlement are included in the Company’s estimated
    environmental capital expenditures. In the absence of the
    appropriate control technology installed at this facility, Units
    3 and 4 totaling approximately 565 MW, could not operate
    beyond December 31, 2011, per terms of the Consent Order.

South
    Central Region

On January 27, 2004, NRG’s Louisiana Generating, LLC
    and the Company’s Big Cajun II plant received a
    request under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act from the
    United States Environmental Protection Agency, or USEPA, seeking
    information primarily related to physical changes made at the
    Big Cajun II plant, and subsequently received a notice of
    violation, or NOV, on February 15, 2005, alleging that
    NRG’s predecessors had undertaken projects that triggered
    requirements under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration
    program, including the installation of emission controls. NRG
    submitted multiple responses commencing February 27, 2004
    and ending on October 20, 2004. On May 9, 2006, these
    entities received from the Department of Justice, or DOJ, a
    Notice of Deficiency related to their responses, to which NRG
    responded on May 22, 2006. A document review was conducted
    at NRG’s Louisiana Generating, LLC offices by the DOJ
    during the week of August 14, 2006. On December 8,
    2006, the USEPA issued a supplemental NOV updating the original
    February 15, 2005 NOV. Discussions with the USEPA are
    ongoing and the Company cannot predict with certainty the
    outcome of this matter.

Note 25 — Guarantees

NRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that
    include indemnification and guarantee provisions as a routine
    part of the Company’s business activities. Examples of
    these contracts include asset purchase and sale agreements,
    commodity sale and purchase agreements, joint venture
    agreements, operations and maintenance agreements, service
    agreements, settlement agreements, and other types of
    contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties.
    These contracts generally indemnify the counter-party for tax,
    environmental liability, litigation, and other matters, as well
    as breaches of representations, warranties, and covenants set
    forth in the agreements. In many cases, the Company’s
    maximum potential liability cannot be estimated, since some of
    the underlying agreements contain no limits on potential
    liability. In accordance with FIN 45, NRG has estimated
    that the current fair value for issuing these guarantees was
    approximately $9 million as of December 31, 2007, and
    the liability in this amount is included in the Company’s
    non-current liabilities.

The following table summarizes NRG’s estimated guarantees,
    indemnity, and other contingent liability obligations by

Letters of credit and surety bonds

— As of
    December 31, 2007, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries
    were contingently obligated for a total of approximately
    $751 million under letters of credit and surety bonds. Most
    of these letters of credit and surety bonds are issued in
    support of the Company’s obligations to perform under
    commodity agreements, financing or other arrangements. A
    majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds expire
    within one year of issuance, and it is typical for the Company
    to renew them on similar terms.



NRG
    ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Asset sale guarantees —

NRG is typically
    requested to provide certain assurances to the counter-parties
    of the Company’s asset sale agreements. Such assurances may
    take the form of a guarantee issued by the Company on behalf of
    a directly or indirectly held majority-owned subsidiary which
    include certain indemnifications to a third party, usually the
    buyer, as described below. Due to the inter-company nature of
    such arrangements, NRG is essentially guaranteeing its own
    performance, and the nature of the guarantee being provided. It
    is not the Company’s policy to recognize the value of such
    an obligation in its consolidated financial statements. Most of
    these guarantees provide an explicit cap on the Company’s
    maximum liability, as well as an expiration period, exclusive of
    breach of representations and warranties.

On December 18, 2007, NRG entered into a share and purchase
    agreement to sell its 100% interest in Tosli to Brookfield Power
    Inc. NRG has guaranteed the payment and performance of its
    wholly owned subsidiary’s Sterling Luxemburg (No. 4)
    obligations under the share and purchase agreement. The maximum
    liability of NRG is limited to the sale price of
    $288 million.

Commercial sales arrangements —

In connection
    with the purchase and sale of fuel, emission allowances and
    power generation products to and from third parties with respect
    to the operation of some of NRG’s generation facilities in
    the U.S., the Company may be required to guarantee a portion of
    the obligations of certain of its subsidiaries. These
    obligations may include liquidated damages payments or other
    unscheduled payments.

Other guarantees —

NRG has issued guarantees of
    obligations that its subsidiaries may incur as a provision for
    environmental site remediation, payment of debt obligations,
    rail car leases, performance under purchase, EPC and operating
    and maintenance agreements. In 2007, NRG executed a guarantee
    related to its obligations as construction manager under its
    agreements related to a wind farm project. In addition, NRG
    entered into a guarantee under an EPC contract related to a
    repowering project. The Company does not believe that it will be
    required to perform under this guarantee.

The material indemnities, within the scope of FIN 45, are
    as follows:

Asset purchases and divestitures —

The purchase
    and sale agreements, which govern NRG’s asset or share
    investments and divestitures, customarily contain
    indemnifications of the transaction to third parties. The
    contracts indemnify the parties for liabilities incurred as a
    result of a breach of a representation or warranty by the
    indemnifying party, or as a result of a change in tax laws.
    These obligations generally have a discrete term and are
    intended to protect the parties against risks that are difficult
    to predict or estimate at the time of the transaction. In
    several cases, the contract limits the liability of the
    indemnifier. For those indemnities in which liability is capped,
    the minimum exposures range from $1 million to
    $288 million. NRG has no reason to believe that the Company
    currently has any material liability relating to such routine
    indemnification obligations.

Other indemnities —

Other indemnifications NRG
    has provided cover operational, tax, litigation and breaches of
    representations, warranties and covenants. NRG has also
    indemnified, on a routine basis in the ordinary course of
    business, consultants or other vendors who have provided
    services to the Company. NRG’s maximum potential exposure
    under these indemnifications can range from a specified dollar
    amount to an indeterminate amount, depending on the nature of
    the transaction. Total maximum potential exposure under these
    indemnifications is not estimable due to uncertainty as to
    whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved. NRG
    does not have any reason to believe that the Company will be
    required to make any material payments under these indemnity
    provisions.

Because many of the guarantees and indemnities NRG issues to
    third parties do not limit the amount or duration of its
    obligations to perform under them, there exists a risk that the
    Company may have obligations in excess of the amounts described
    above. For those guarantees and indemnities that do not limit
    the Company’s liability exposure, it may not be able to
    estimate what the Company’s liability would be, until a
    claim is made for payment or performance, due to the contingent
    nature of these contracts.
