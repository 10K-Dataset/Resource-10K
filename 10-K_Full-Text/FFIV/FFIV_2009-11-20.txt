Item 1.

Business

General

F5 Networks is a leading provider of technology that optimizes
    the delivery of network-based applications and the security,
    performance and availability of servers, data storage devices
    and other network resources.

Founded in 1996, F5 pioneered load-balancing technology that
    distributes internet traffic evenly across multiple web servers,
    making them look like a single server. Today, our BIG-IP
    application delivery controllers sit in front of web and
    application servers, balancing traffic and performing
    compute-intensive functions such as encrypting and unencrypting
    transmissions, screening traffic for security threats,
    maintaining open connections with servers, speeding the flow of
    traffic and a variety of other functions that improve the
    performance, availability and security of applications and would
    otherwise be performed by the servers themselves. By offloading
    functions from servers, BIG-IP makes servers more efficient and
    reduces the number of servers needed to run specific
    applications. BIG-IP also supports software modules that manage
    the flow of traffic between multiple data centers and across
    multiple service provider connections, ensuring that this
    traffic is always routed to the most available resource. In
    addition, we offer complementary products that provide secure
    remote access to corporate networks and optimize the delivery of
    applications over wide-area networks.

The core of our application delivery controllers and related
    products is our full-proxy Traffic Management Operating System
    (TMOS) that enables these products to inspect and modify traffic
    flows to and from servers at network speed and supports a broad
    array of functions that enhance the speed, performance and
    availability



of applications. iRules, a scripting language based on TCL (Tool
    Command Language), is a unique feature of TMOS that enables
    customers and third parties to write customized rules to inspect
    and modify traffic. TMOS also supports a common software
    interface called iControl, which enables our products to
    communicate with one another and with third-party products,
    including custom and commercial enterprise applications. TMOS is
    designed to support the addition of new functionality as
    software modules and to exploit the performance-enhancing
    features of our purpose-built hardware platforms.
    Correspondingly, our hardware architecture integrates industry
    standard components with the unique features and characteristics
    of TMOS to deliver performance that is, we believe, demonstrably
    superior to competing products.

Just as our application delivery controllers make many servers
    look like one, ARX storage virtualization products sit in front
    of network attached storage (NAS), making multiple storage
    devices from different vendors look like a single device to the
    individual clients, servers and applications that use them. This
    frees users and storage administrators from the time-consuming
    task of mapping individual drives to specific clients and
    applications. In addition, ARX products simplify the migration
    of data between storage devices, the addition of new storage
    devices, and the distribution of data across tiers of storage
    that reflect the relative importance or immediacy of the data.

In connection with our products, we offer a broad range of
    services including consulting, training, installation,
    maintenance and other technical support services.

F5 Networks was incorporated on February 26, 1996 in the
    State of Washington. Our headquarters is in Seattle, Washington
    and our mailing address is 401 Elliott Avenue West, Seattle,
    Washington 98119. The telephone number at our executive offices

Industry
    Background

Growth of
    IP Networks

Internet Protocol (IP) is a communications language used to
    transmit data over the Internet. Since the late 1990s,
    businesses have responded to the power, flexibility and
    efficiency of the Internet by deploying new

IP-based

applications, upgrading their client-server applications to new

IP-enabled

versions, and enabling existing or legacy applications for use
    over the Internet. At the same time, organizations have become
    more geographically dispersed, and increasingly mobile
    workforces depend on access to corporate applications and data
    from remote locations and a variety of client devices such as
    cellular telephones, personal digital assistants and notebook
    computers.

Over the next several years, we believe these trends will
    accelerate as more organizations discover the benefits of

IP-enabled

applications. In addition, we believe the growth of Internet
    usage will continue to be driven by new applications, such as
    Web Services and Voice over IP, the growth of mobile and
    broadband Internet access and new usage and infrastructure
    models such as “cloud computing.”

In conjunction with the growth of Internet traffic, the
    proliferation of data and, in particular, unstructured data such
    as voice, video, images, email, spreadsheets and formatted text
    files, presents an enormous and increasing challenge to IT
    organizations. Along with the growing volume of unstructured
    data that is business-critical and must be retained and readily
    accessible to individuals and applications, new regulations
    mandate that company email, web pages and other files must be
    retained indefinitely. In response to this challenge,
    IT organizations spend an increasing amount of their budget
    on NAS and other types of storage systems.

Trend
    Toward Virtualization

From a broad perspective, the goal of IT organizations is to
    optimize the secure delivery of applications and data to users
    wherever they are and whenever they need them. To achieve this
    goal, organizations are



embracing virtualization technologies that enable them to group
    or partition data center resources to meet user demand and
    reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand
    changes. Server virtualization, which allows organizations to
    improve utilization of physical servers by partitioning them
    into multiple virtual servers, is well known and widely
    deployed. Application delivery controllers free up both physical
    and virtual server processing power by offloading common
    functions, such as encryption and compression from multiple
    physical or virtual servers, and dynamically manage the flow of
    traffic between users and both virtual and physical servers,
    making them look like a single resource to the user. Server
    virtualization puts additional pressure on storage resources by
    increasing the demand for storage capacity and the complexity of
    storing and retrieving files. Sitting in front of storage
    systems, file virtualization devices perform functions similar
    to application delivery controllers, presenting the appearance
    of a single resource to users and applications and dynamically
    managing the transfer of files between users, applications and
    multiple storage devices.

Application
    Delivery Networking

Internet traffic passing between client devices and servers is
    divided into discrete packets which travel by multiple routes to
    their destination where they are reassembled. The disassembly,
    routing, and reassembly of transmissions are relatively
    straightforward and require little intelligence. By contrast,
    application delivery networking — managing,
    inspecting, modifying, redirecting and securing application
    traffic going to and from servers — requires
    intelligent systems capable of performing a broad array of
    functions.

Basic application delivery networking (ADN) functions include
    load-balancing (distributing traffic across multiple servers
    while making them appear to be a single server) and
    health-checking (monitoring the performance of servers and
    applications to ensure that they are working properly before
    routing traffic to them). In addition, ADN encompasses a growing
    number of functions that have typically been performed by the
    server or the application itself, or by point solutions running
    on separate devices. These include:

•

SSL Acceleration — using Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
    encryption to secure traffic between the server and the browser
    on an end user’s client device;

•

Rate Shaping — prioritizing transmissions according to
    preset rules that give precedence to different types of traffic;

•

Compression — reducing the volume of data transmitted
    to take maximum advantage of available bandwidth;

•

TCP Optimization — improving server efficiency by
    maintaining an open connection with a server during interactive
    sessions;

•

IPv6 Translation — enabling communication and
    interoperability between networked devices using IPv6, the
    newest version of the Internet Protocol, and those using the
    older version IPv4;

•

Application Security — protecting critical web
    applications from attacks such as Google hacking, cross-site
    scripting, and parameter tampering;

•

Web Acceleration — enhancing the performance of web
    applications over wide area networks by reducing latency,
    eliminating errors, and resolving other issues that slow
    delivery;

•

WAN Optimization — improving the performance of
    applications accessed over wide area network links by reducing
    the number of round trips required and ensuring maximum use of
    available bandwidth;

•

Global Traffic Management — ensuring high
    availability, maximum performance and global management for
    applications running across multiple, globally-dispersed data
    centers; and

•

Link Load Balancing — monitoring availability and
    performance of multiple WAN connections and intelligently
    managing bi-directional traffic flows to ensure uninterrupted,
    optimized Internet access.

Since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not
    thousands — of servers and applications, it is not
    practical to replicate these functions on each server or build
    them into the applications themselves. Even if it



were, maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the net result
    would be a negative impact on the overall performance of servers
    and applications. Deploying point solutions in the network
    eliminates those problems but creates a new set of challenges.
    Using point solutions from multiple vendors can create
    interoperability issues, and problems that do occur can be
    difficult to troubleshoot. From a security standpoint, it is
    also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through
    multiple devices. As a result, enterprise customers are
    increasingly demanding products that integrate ADN functions on
    a single platform.

File
    Virtualization

Along with other types of IP traffic, the volume of file-based
    information created and accessed by Internet users and network
    applications is growing rapidly. According to some estimates,
    the volume of unstructured files is expected to triple annually
    over the next several years. The challenge of storing and
    managing unstructured files is becoming increasingly costly and
    complex, and reducing the cost and complexity is quickly moving
    up the list of data center priorities.

In many large organizations whose employees are geographically
    dispersed, unstructured data is stored on local file servers,
    which are difficult to manage, costly to maintain and generally
    underutilized. Information on these devices is easy for local
    users to access but often inaccessible to others in the
    organization. To reduce the cost, complexity, and redundancy of
    dispersed file systems, many IT organizations are consolidating
    file storage on centralized NAS devices and other types of
    storage systems. Migrating and consolidating files is difficult
    and time-consuming, however, and centralized storage systems
    pose a different set of problems.

Centralized storage of files can slow access for remote users
    and applications, spurring interest in technology that can speed
    the transfer of files across wide area networks (WANs). In
    addition, only users and applications that are physically mapped
    to a specific drive can store and access data on that drive. As
    the drive fills up, files must be moved manually to a new drive
    and affected users and applications must be remapped to that
    drive. In large organizations, this often constitutes a

round-the-clock

chore for many highly-skilled employees.

Another major storage problem stems from the fact that all files
    are not created equal. Many businesses and other organizations
    have policies or other obligations to retain email and other
    files, increasing the volume of data to archive and, in some
    cases, to keep indefinitely. Since it is unlikely that these
    files will be accessed frequently, if at all, in the course of
    normal business, it makes little sense to store them on
    expensive, high-performance systems designed to provide
    immediate access to business-critical information. As a result,
    IT organizations are beginning to deploy tiers of storage
    systems that match cost, capacity, and performance to the type
    of information being stored, how frequently it is accessed, and
    its relative importance to the business. Often, the most
    cost-effective solution is a combination of storage systems from
    different vendors, an approach that typically entails migrating
    huge amounts of data between incompatible devices. Once that is
    completed, organizations face the challenge of automating the
    tiering process and the management of aging files.

Whether or not they deploy tiered file systems, many
    organizations are beginning to address the mounting cost in time
    and resources of backing up data stored on employee desktops,
    local file servers, and other devices. According to some
    estimates, approximately 80% of the files organizations back up
    have not changed since the previous

back-up.

Worse yet, a large and growing percentage are music and video
    files, family photographs, and other personal files.

Responding to increasing demand from IT organizations, a number
    of storage vendors and a handful of other companies offer
    solutions that address some or all of these issues and can be
    loosely grouped under the heading of file virtualization.
    Collectively, these solutions encompass a variety of
    technological approaches designed to optimize and simplify the
    storage of unstructured data.

F5
    Solutions

Application
    Delivery Networking

F5 is a leading provider of application delivery networking
    products that ensure the security, optimization and availability
    of applications for any user, anywhere. We believe our products
    offer the most intelligent



architecture and advanced functionality in the marketplace along
    with performance, flexibility and usability features that help
    organizations improve the way they serve their employees,
    customers, and partners while lowering operational costs.

Software Based Products.

From inception, we
    have been committed to the belief that the complexity of
    application-level processing requires the flexibility of a
    software-based solution. We believe our modular software
    architecture enables us to deliver the broadest range of
    integrated functionality in the market and facilitates the
    addition and integration of new functionality. We also believe
    that integrating our software with commodity hardware components
    enables us to build products that deliver superior performance,
    functionality and flexibility at competitive prices.

Full Proxy Architecture.

The core of our
    software technology is the Traffic Management Operating System
    (TMOS) introduced in September 2004. We believe TMOS is a major
    enhancement of our previous technology that enables our products
    to deliver functionality that is superior on many levels to any
    other application delivery networking product in the market.
    With TMOS, our products can inspect, modify and direct both
    inbound and outbound traffic flows across multiple packets. This
    ability to manage application traffic to and from servers adds
    value to applications that pass through our devices in ways that
    are not possible with other application delivery networking
    solutions. In April 2009, we introduced a major upgrade (Version
    10.0) of TMOS that includes more than 130 new features, more
    than 90 application-ready solution templates, and a number of
    performance enhancements, all designed to leverage the advanced
    features and performance of our recently upgraded family of
    BIG-IP hardware platforms.

Modular Functionality.

In addition to its full
    proxy architecture, TMOS is specifically designed to facilitate
    the development and integration of application delivery
    networking functions as modules that can be added to
    BIG-IP’s core functionality to keep pace with rapidly
    evolving customer needs. Feature modules that are available as
    add ons to TMOS Version 10.0 include: Advanced Client
    Authentication, Advanced Routing, Fast Cache, Intelligent
    Compression, IPv6 Gateway, L7 Rate Shaping, Message Security
    Module, Protocol Security Module and SSL Acceleration. Product
    modules that are available as add ons include: Application
    Security Manager (ASM), Global Traffic Manager (GTM), Link
    Controller, and WebAccelerator.

Application Awareness.

The open architecture
    of TMOS includes an application programming interface (API)
    called iControl that allows our products to communicate with one
    another and with third-party software and devices. Through this
    unique feature, third- party applications and network devices
    can take an active role in shaping IP network traffic, directing
    traffic based on exact business requirements defined by our
    customers and solutions partners and tailored to specific
    applications. This “application awareness” capability
    is a key feature of our software-based products and further
    differentiates our solutions from those of our competitors.

Application-Specific Configurations.

Developed
    and tested in collaboration with our solutions partners,
    Application Ready Solutions are configurations designed to
    optimize BIG-IP deployments for specific applications such as
    those provided by Oracle, Microsoft, Siebel, and SAP, as well as
    generic applications delivered via HTTP. With TMOS Version 10.0,
    we introduced templates that reduce the time and effort
    necessary to configure BIG-IP for a specific application. The
    configuration created is optimal for BIG-IP devices and the
    specific application for which the template was created and can
    be further customized for the specific conditions of an
    organization’s unique infrastructure and environment. Like
    other configuration details of BIG-IP devices, these templates
    can easily be shared across multiple BIG-IP deployments.

Adaptive Intelligence.

The full-proxy
    capabilities of TMOS enable it to inspect or “read”
    the entire contents of a transmission across multiple packets
    and identify specific elements of that transmission, including
    items such as names, dates, and any type of number or label. By
    taking advantage of our unique scripting capability, based on
    Tool Command Language (TCL), customers can use those elements as
    variables to create iRules that modify the content and direct
    the flow of traffic in ways tailored to the dynamic needs of
    their applications. iRules is a unique feature of TMOS that
    gives our products flexibility we believe to be unmatched by
    competing products.

Integrated Application Layer Solutions.

The
    combination of our full proxy architecture and enhanced iRules
    enables BIG-IP to intercept, inspect and act on the contents of
    traffic from virtually every type of



IP-enabled

application. In addition, the modularity of the TMOS
    architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions
    that secure, optimize and ensure the availability of
    applications and the networks they run on.

Data
    Solutions

F5’s data solutions products address many of the problems
    associated with managing today’s rapidly expanding file
    storage infrastructure. Our ARX product family of intelligent
    file virtualization devices represents a unique set of
    capabilities that optimize the performance and utilization of
    NAS systems.

Non-disruptive Data Migration.

ARX automates
    the movement of files between heterogeneous storage devices
    without affecting access and without requiring client
    reconfiguration. Enterprises can perform seamless
    hardware & software upgrades on file storage
    platforms, server consolidation, even vendor switches, all
    during business hours.

Automated Storage Tiering.

ARX automates the
    movement of data between tiers of storage, and the placement of
    data on appropriate tiers of storage, irrespective of platform
    or vendor. Organizations can lower the cost of storage and
    shrink backup and recovery windows by automatically placing data
    on appropriate storage devices without affecting access to the
    data.

Dynamic Load Balancing.

ARX dynamically
    distributes files across multiple file storage devices,
    eliminating “hotspots” or bottlenecks. Companies can
    improve application performance and increase productivity using
    the storage infrastructure that is already in place.

Efficient Data Replication.

ARX provides the
    ability to replicate files between heterogeneous storage
    platforms for efficient and cost effective disaster recovery and
    centralized backup applications.

Centralized Data Management.

Introduced in
    October 2008, Data Manager simplifies file virtualization
    deployments and helps organizations monitor multiple file
    storage resources through a centralized and extensible storage
    management platform. Data Manager can quickly identify areas
    within an organization’s file storage resources that could
    be improved by file virtualization and gives customers the tools
    to create a more efficient and cost-effective storage
    infrastructure.

Strategy

Our objective is to lead the industry in delivering the enabling
    architectures that integrate IP networks with applications and
    data. Our products provide strategic points of control in the IT
    infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented
    where information is exchanged, enabling organizations to
    respond quickly to changing business needs, improve costly and
    time consuming business processes and develop new sources of
    revenue through highly differentiated offerings. Key components
    of our strategy include:

Offering
    a complete, integrated application delivery product
    suite.

Since the introduction of our TMOS architecture for application
    delivery networking, we have developed TMOS-based versions of
    our own legacy products, such as Global Traffic Manager (GTM)
    and Link Controller, and acquired technology, including
    Application Security Manager (ASM), WebAccelerator, and WANJet.
    ASM and WebAccelerator are currently available as software
    modules on our BIG-IP family of application delivery
    controllers, and features of WANJet have been integrated into
    TMOS Version 10.0. We believe this approach sharply
    differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings
    and provides customers with an expanding array of integrated
    application delivery networking solutions that can be customized
    to meet their specific needs.

Investing
    in technology to meet evolving customer needs.

We continue to invest in research and development to provide our
    customers with comprehensive, integrated solutions. In
    application delivery networking, our product development efforts
    leverage the unique attributes of our software-based platforms
    to deliver new features and functions that address the complex,



changing needs of our customers. Our ongoing investments in ARX
    are aimed at providing data solutions for the complex challenge
    of efficiently storing and managing the huge and growing volume
    of unstructured files created by network users and applications.
    Although the bulk of our investment in application delivery and
    file virtualization technologies is software development,
    concurrent development of tightly integrated, high-performance
    hardware is a key part of our investment strategy. To ensure
    performance and cost competitiveness, we incorporate commodity
    components in all of our hardware products.

Enhancing
    channel sales and distribution model.

We continue to invest significant resources in developing and
    expanding our indirect sales and distribution channels by
    cultivating our relationships with our existing partners and
    actively developing new relationships. Our efforts to recruit
    new partners are aimed primarily at large value-added resellers,
    systems integrators, and industry-leading systems manufacturers.

Continuing
    to build and expand relationships with strategic technology
    partners.

To compete successfully against Cisco Systems, Inc. and other
    large competitors who have an established presence in our target
    accounts, we have developed strategic technology partnerships
    with enterprise software vendors, such as Microsoft, Oracle and
    SAP, who often have an established presence in those accounts.
    By taking advantage of our open application programming
    interface, called iControl, these vendors can equip their
    applications to control our products in the network, enhancing
    overall application performance. In return, they provide us
    significant leverage in the selling process by recommending our
    products to their customers. We have also worked closely with
    several of these vendors to develop configurations of our
    products, called application ready solutions, that are
    specifically tuned to simplify deployment and optimize the
    performance of their applications. With the release of TMOS
    Version 10.0 we made these solutions available as templates
    which allow quick and easy configuration of our products for
    specific applications. We plan to continue building on our
    existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge by
    developing new relationships with other strategic partners.

Leveraging
    DevCentral, our online community of network architects and
    developers.

Customization of our products using iRules enhances their
    “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems
    in both their applications and their networks that would be
    difficult if not impossible to solve by other means. To promote
    the use of iRules, we host an online community where network
    architects and developers can discuss and share the ways in
    which they use iRules to solve problems and enhance the
    security, performance and availability of applications. A
    corollary benefit is that many of the iRules solutions posted by
    DevCentral participants have become standard features in new
    releases of TMOS.

Enhancing
    our brand.

We believe F5 has achieved industry-wide recognition as the
    leading provider of application delivery networking products
    that optimize the security, performance and availability of
    network applications, servers and storage systems. We plan to
    continue investing in programs to promote the F5 brand and make
    it synonymous with superior technology, high quality customer
    service, trusted advice and definitive business value.

Products

Our core technology is hardware and software for application
    delivery networking, including application security, secure
    remote access, WAN optimization and file virtualization.

All of our products are systems that integrate our software with
    purpose-built hardware that incorporates commodity components.
    Our BIG-IP product family, which represents the bulk of our
    sales, supports a growing number of features and functions as
    software modules — including GTM (Global Traffic
    Manager), Link Controller, ASM (Application Security Manager)
    and WebAccelerator. We also sell ASM, FirePass, WANJet and
    WebAccelerator as separate, stand-alone appliances.



BIG-IP

Products in our family of BIG-IP application delivery
    controllers all run TMOS and differ primarily in the hardware
    configurations that make up each system. During the past
    18 months, we replaced our entire BIG-IP family of hardware
    platforms with new platforms designed to exploit the advanced
    features, functionality and performance of TMOS Version 10.0.
    Current platforms include BIG-IP 1600, BIG-IP 3600, BIG-IP 3900,
    BIG-IP 6900, BIG-IP 8900, and VIPRION, our chassis-based
    application delivery controller. In addition to local area
    traffic management, which is standard on every system, BIG-IP
    supports a growing number of add-on software products and
    features. Software products currently available for BIG-IP
    platforms include GTM, Link Controller, ASM, and WebAccelerator.
    Software add ons for TMOS include: Advanced Client
    Authentication, Advanced Routing, Fast Cache, Intelligent
    Compression, IPv6 Gateway, L7 Rate Shaping, Message Security
    Module, Protocol Security Module and SSL Acceleration.

VIPRION

Introduced in January 2008, VIPRION is our chassis-based
    application delivery controller that scales from one to four
    blades, each equipped with two dual-core processors and
    equivalent in performance to a BIG-IP 8900. Using clustered
    multiprocessing, custom disaggregation ASICs and advanced
    software, VIPRION allows customers to add or remove blades
    without disrupting traffic and distributes traffic across all
    available processors, effectively creating a single virtual
    processor. VIPRION helps customers simplify their networks by
    offloading servers and consolidating devices, saving management
    costs as well as power, space, and cooling in the datacenter and
    by reducing the number of application delivery controllers they
    need to deliver even the most demanding applications. By
    offloading computationally intense processes, VIPRION can also
    significantly reduce the number of application servers needed.

FirePass

FirePass appliances provide SSL VPN access for remote users of
    IP networks and any applications connected to those networks
    from any standard Web browser on any device. The components of
    FirePass include a dynamic policy engine, which manages user
    authentication and authorization privileges, and special
    components that enable corporations to give remote users
    controlled access to the full array of applications and
    resources within the network. FirePass also supports Application
    Ready Access, providing full reverse-proxy services for
    market-leading application portals including those of SAP,
    Oracle, Microsoft, and others.

Currently, we sell three FirePass products: The FirePass 1200
    appliance is designed for small to medium enterprises and branch
    offices and supports from 10 to 100 concurrent users. The
    FirePass 4100 controller is designed for medium size enterprises
    and, from a price/performance standpoint, is recommended for up
    to 500 concurrent users. The FirePass 4300 appliance is designed
    for medium to large enterprises and service providers and
    supports up to 2,000 concurrent users.

Application
    Security Manager (ASM)

Application Security Manager is a Web application firewall that
    provides comprehensive, proactive, application-layer protection
    against both generalized and targeted attacks. Available as a
    software module on BIG-IP LTM, ASM employs a positive security
    model (‘deny all unless allowed’) combined with
    signature-based detection. As a result, ASM can prevent
    “day-zero” attacks in addition to known security
    threats. ASM is also available as a module or a stand-alone
    hardware platform.

WebAccelerator

WebAccelerator speeds web transactions by optimizing individual
    network object requests, connections, and

end-to-end

transactions from the browser through to databases.
    WebAccelerator enhances web application performance from any
    location, speeding up interactive performance, improving
    download times, utilizing bandwidth more efficiently, and
    dramatically reducing the cost and response time of delivering
    Web-enabled applications to distributed users where it is not
    possible to deploy an end point device. WebAccelerator devices



can also be placed at key remote locations to provide
    acceleration to end-users above and beyond TCP optimizations and
    HTTP compression.

WebAccelerator is available as a software module on BIG-IP LTM
    or as a stand-alone appliance.

WANJet

WANJet combines WAN optimization and traffic-shaping in a single
    device to accelerate file transfers, email, data replication,
    and other applications over IP networks. It provides LAN-like
    performance on any WAN, ensuring predictable application
    performance for all users, and encrypts and secures all
    transfers without performance penalties. WANJet is deployed as a
    dual-sided (symmetric) solution that optimizes application
    traffic to and from data centers and branch offices.

For data centers, the WANJet 500 features pass-through fault
    tolerance and scalability for up to 20,000 optimized
    connections. For branch offices, the WANJet 300 combines
    pass-through fault tolerant features, silent operation, and
    performance for up to 1,000 optimized connections. WANJet
    solutions work seamlessly across all wide-area networks
    including dedicated links, IP VPNs, frame relay, and even
    satellite connections.

TMOS Version 10.0 incorporates features of WANJet called
    iSessions that enable the rapid transfer of large amounts of
    data between data centers, dramatically reducing the time needed
    for remote backup, site replication and data recovery.

Enterprise
    Manager

Enterprise Manager takes advantage of our iControl interface to
    provide a single, centralized management console for our ADN
    products. Enterprise Manager allows customers with dozens or
    hundreds of our products to discover and view those products in
    a single window, and to upgrade or modify the software on those
    products simultaneously. This lowers the cost and simplifies the
    task of deploying, managing and maintaining our products and
    reduces the likelihood of error when blanket changes are
    implemented.

Enterprise Manager 500 and Enterprise Manager 3000 are
    appliance-based devices on dedicated, enterprise-grade
    platforms. Enterprise Manager 500 provides control for up to 50
    F5 devices, and Enterprise Manager 3000 provides control for up
    to 300 F5 devices.

ARX

The ARX product family is a series of high performance,
    enterprise-class intelligent file virtualization devices that
    dramatically simplify the management of file storage
    environments and lower total storage costs by automating data
    management tasks and eliminating the disruption associated with
    storage management operations. The ARX series is powered by the
    FreedomFabric network operating system, which automates many
    storage management tasks that are performed manually today, and
    eliminates the disruption associated with those tasks.
    FreedomFabric’s unique suite of storage management policies
    includes data migration, automated storage tiering, data
    replication, and dynamic load balancing.

Currently, the ARX series includes four products. ARX 500 and
    ARX 1000 are stand-alone devices that can manage more than
    120 million and 380 million files, respectively. In
    October 2008, we introduced ARX 4000, a fixed form-factor device
    supporting 10 gigabit Ethernet and capable of managing more than
    2 billion files. Our high-end ARX 6000 is a chassis-based
    device with multiple blades that can manage more than
    2 billion files.

Data
    Manager

Also introduced in October 2008, Data Manager is a software
    product that interfaces directly with most file storage devices,
    including ARX file virtualization platforms. Data Manager
    gathers valuable file storage statistics and provides graphical
    reporting and trending functions to give users visibility into
    their constantly changing data storage environments, helping
    them respond to business needs and better plan for future growth.



Enabling
    Technologies

iControl is an application programming interface that allows
    customers and independent software vendors to modify their
    programs to communicate with our products, eliminating the need
    for human involvement, lowering the cost of performing basic
    network functions and reducing the likelihood of error. Although
    we do not derive revenue from iControl itself, the sale of
    iControl-enabled applications by independent software vendors
    such as Microsoft and Oracle helps promote and often leads
    directly to the sale of our other products.

iRules is a built-in feature of our TMOS architecture that
    allows customers to manipulate and manage any IP application
    traffic that passes through our TMOS-based products. iRules has
    an

easy-to-learn

scripting syntax and enables users to customize how they
    intercept, inspect, transform, and direct inbound or outbound
    application traffic.

Product
    Development

We believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain
    technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and
    by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our
    customers. Our product development group employs a standard
    process for the development, documentation and quality control
    of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals.
    This process includes working with our business development and
    marketing teams, product managers, customers and partners to
    identify new or improved solutions that meet the evolving needs
    of our addressable markets.

Our principal software engineering group is located in our
    headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Our core product
    development teams for FirePass, WANJet and WebAccelerator are
    located in San Jose, California. Our core Application
    Security Manager (ASM) product development team is located in
    Tel Aviv, Israel. Our ARX product development team is located in
    Lowell, Massachusetts. Our hardware engineering group is located
    in Spokane, Washington. In addition, we maintain a dedicated
    facility for product testing and quality control in Tomsk,
    Russia. Members of all these teams collaborate closely with one
    another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our
    hardware and software systems.

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, we had research and product development expenses of
    $103.7 million, $103.4 million, and
    $69.0 million, respectively.

Customers

Our customers include a wide variety of enterprise customers and
    service providers among Fortune 1000 and Business Week Global
    1000 companies, including those in technology,
    telecommunications, financial services, transportation,
    education, manufacturing and healthcare, along with government
    customers. In fiscal year 2009, international sales represented
    44.7% of our net revenues. Refer to Note 12 of our
    consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic
    area.

Sales and
    Marketing

Sales

We sell our products and services to large enterprise customers
    and service providers through a variety of channels, including
    distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”) and
    systems integrators. A substantial amount of our revenue for
    fiscal year 2009 was derived from these channel sales. Our sales
    teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our
    products and services directly to a limited number of major
    accounts.

F5 sales teams.

Our inside sales team
    generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and
    helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field
    and internal corporate resources. Our field sales personnel are
    located in major cities in four sales regions: the Americas
    (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and
    Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia Pacific region (APAC). Field
    sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist
    them, as necessary, in the sale of our products and services to
    their customers. We also sell our products and services directly
    to a limited group of customers,



primarily large enterprises, whose accounts are managed by our
    major account services team. Field systems engineers support our
    regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in
    joint sales calls and providing pre-sale technical resources as
    needed.

Distributors and VARs.

Consistent with our
    goal of building a strong channel sales model, we have
    established relationships with a number of large national and
    international distributors, local and specialized distributors
    and VARs. We derive a majority of our product sales from these
    distributors and VARs.

Our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and
    do not prevent them from selling competitive products. These
    agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation
    to renew, and typically do not provide for exclusive sales
    territories or minimum purchase requirements.

For fiscal year 2009, sales to one of our distributors, Avnet
    Technologies, represented 15.4% of our total revenues. Our
    agreement with this distributor is a standard, non-exclusive
    distribution agreement that renews automatically on an annual
    basis and can be terminated by either party with 30 days
    prior written notice. The agreement grants Avnet Technologies
    the right to distribute our products to resellers in North
    America and certain other territories internationally, with no
    minimum purchase requirements.

Systems integrators.

We also market our
    products through strategic relationships with systems
    integrators, who include our products as core components of
    application or network-based solutions they deploy for their
    customers. In most cases, systems integrators do not directly
    purchase our products for resale to their customers. Instead
    they typically recommend our products as part of broader
    solutions, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or
    customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, that
    incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced
    performance.

Marketing

Our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our
    continued success depends on our ability to understand and
    anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to
    develop valuable solutions that meet those needs. In line with
    this belief, our marketing organization works directly with
    customers, partners and our product development teams to
    identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our
    leadership position. In addition, our business development team,
    which is a component of our marketing organization, closely
    monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary
    markets for opportunities to acquire or partner with those whose
    solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to
    expand our addressable market.

Another key component of our marketing strategy is to develop
    and expand our iControl partnerships. Working closely with our
    partners, we have developed solution sets called Application
    Ready Solutions that help ensure the successful deployment and
    delivery of their applications over the network. The result of
    methodical testing and research, these solutions have been
    integrated into TMOS Version 10.0 as templates that allow
    customers to configure our products quickly and easily to
    optimize the performance of specific applications from major
    software vendors such as Microsoft, Oracle and SAP.

To support the growing number of developers using our products,
    including network and application architects, we continue to
    promote and expand DevCentral, our on-line community website
    that provides technical resources to customers, prospects and
    partners wanting to extend and optimize F5 solutions using
    iRules. A key aspect of DevCentral is an on-line forum where
    developers as well as application and network architects discuss
    and share solutions they have written with iRules. At the end of
    fiscal 2009, DevCentral had more than 50,000 registered members.

We also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives
    aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of
    our technology and products. These include actively
    participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events
    with channel and technology partners, and briefing industry
    analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products,
    business relationships and technology partnerships. In addition,
    we market our products to chief information officers and other
    information technology professionals through targeted
    advertising, direct mail and high-profile Web events.



Backlog

At the end of fiscal years 2009 and 2008, we had product backlog
    of approximately $35.5 million and $10.9 million,
    respectively. Backlog represents orders confirmed with a
    purchase order for products to be shipped generally within
    90 days to customers with approved credit status. Orders
    are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers or
    product specification changes by customers. Although we believe
    that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be
    cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant
    penalty. For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at
    any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues.

Customer
    Service and Technical Support

We believe that our ability to provide consistent, high-quality
    customer service and technical support is a key factor in
    attracting and retaining large enterprise customers.
    Accordingly, we offer a broad range of support services that
    include installation, phone support, hardware repair and
    replacement, software updates, consulting and training services.
    We deliver these services directly to end users and also utilize
    a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our
    channel partners when applicable. Our technical support staff is
    strategically located in regional service centers to support our
    global customer base.

Prior to the installation of our products, our services
    personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and
    determine the best way to deploy our products and configure
    product features and functions to meet those needs. Our services
    personnel also provide

on-site

installation and training services to help customers make
    optimal use of product features and functions.

Our customers typically purchase a one-year maintenance contract
    which entitles them to an array of services provided by our
    technical support team. Maintenance services provided under the
    contract include online updates, software error correction
    releases, hardware repair and replacement, and, in the majority
    of cases,

round-the-clock

call center support. Updates to our software are only available
    to customers with a current maintenance contract. Our technical
    support team also offers seminars and training classes for
    customers on the configuration and use of products, including
    local and wide area network system administration and
    management. In addition, we have a professional services team
    able to provide a full range of fee-based consulting services,
    including comprehensive network management, documentation and
    performance analysis, and capacity planning to assist in
    predicting future network requirements.

We also offer, as part of our maintenance service, an online,
    automated, self-help customer support function called “Ask
    F5” that allows customers to answer many commonly asked
    questions without having to call our support desk. This allows
    the customer to rapidly address issues and questions, while
    significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk.
    This enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while
    keeping our support-related expenses at a manageable, consistent
    level.

Manufacturing

We outsource the manufacturing of our pre-configured hardware
    platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly
    according to our specifications.

We outsource the majority of our manufacturing to Tier 1
    Electronic Manufacturing Services providers. Flextronics
    manufactures our ADC product line and Sanmina-SCI manufacturers
    our ARX product line. The subcontracting activity at Flextronics
    and Sanmina-SCI encompasses prototype builds, full production
    and direct fulfillment. Our contract manufacturers perform the
    following activities on our behalf: material procurement, PCB
    assembly and test, final assembly, system test, quality control,
    direct shipment and warranty repairs. We provide a rolling
    forecast that allows our contract manufacturers to stock
    component parts and other materials, plan capacity and build
    finished goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand.
    Each of the contract manufacturers procures components necessary
    to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products
    according to our specifications. Products are then shipped to
    our distributors, value-added resellers, or end users.
    Generally, we do not own the components. Title to the products
    transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and then to our
    customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If
    the components are unused or the products are not sold within
    specified periods of time, we may incur carrying



charges or obsolete material charges for components that our
    contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our
    forecast or customer orders.

Hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of
    commodity parts and certain custom components designed and
    approved by our hardware engineering group. Most of our
    components are purchased from sources which we believe are
    readily available from other suppliers. However, several
    components used in the assembly of our products are purchased
    from a single or limited source.

Competition

The expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled
    us to address a growing array of opportunities, many of which
    are outside the bounds of the traditional Layer 4-7 market.
    Within what Gartner Group has defined as the Application
    Acceleration market, we compete in the Application Delivery
    Controller (ADC) market, which encompasses the traditional Layer
    4-7 market, and, to a lesser extent, the WAN Optimization
    Controller (WOC) market. Over the next several years, we believe
    these two markets will merge as WAN optimization effectively
    becomes a feature of Application Delivery. Today, we offer
    WebAccelerator as a software module on BIG-IP, and features of
    WANJet, our WAN optimization and traffic-shaping device, have
    been integrated into Version 10.0 of TMOS.

In 2009, approximately 90% of our products and services were
    sold into the ADC market where our primary competitor is Cisco
    Systems, Inc. Other competitors in this market include Citrix
    Systems, Inc., Brocade, Radware Ltd, and a number of smaller
    competitors including A10 Networks, Array Networks, Barracuda
    Networks, Crescendo Networks, and Zeus Technology Ltd. In the
    adjacent WAN Optimization Controller market, we compete with
    Riverbed, Juniper, Blue Coat Systems, Cisco and Citrix.
    Currently, we do not compete in the branch office segment of the
    WOC market, which features products offered by Riverbed
    Technology, Inc., BlueCoat Systems Inc., Cisco and others.

File virtualization remains an early-stage market, the growth of
    which has been slowed by the recent global economic downturn. We
    believe our ARX file virtualization products are unique in terms
    of technology and functionality and are well positioned within
    this emerging market. However, large storage vendors such as EMC
    Corporation offer competing products with overlapping
    functionality.

The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we
    compete include: product performance and features; customer
    support; brand recognition; the scope of distribution and sales
    channels; and pricing. Many of our competitors have a longer
    operating history and greater financial, technical, marketing
    and other resources than we do. These larger competitors also
    have a more extensive customer base and broader customer
    relationships, including relationships with many of our current
    and potential customers. In addition, many have large,
    well-established, worldwide customer support and professional
    services organizations and more extensive direct sales force and
    sales channels. Because of our relatively smaller size, market
    presence and resources, our larger competitors may be able to
    respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies
    and changes in customer requirements. These companies may also
    adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share. As a
    result, our competitors could undermine our ability to win new
    customers and maintain our existing customer base.

Intellectual
    Property

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
    trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our
    intellectual property rights. We have obtained 47 patents in the
    United States and have applications pending for various aspects
    of our technology. Our future success depends in part on our
    ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies
    used in our principal products. Despite our efforts to protect
    our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy
    aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or
    other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition,
    the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our
    proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States.
    Any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position, and
    competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or
    superior to our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect
    our intellectual property rights could harm our business,
    operating results and financial condition.



In addition to our own proprietary software, we incorporate
    software licensed from several third-party sources into our
    products. These licenses generally renew automatically on an
    annual basis. We believe that alternative technologies for these
    licenses are available both domestically and internationally.

Employees

As of September 30, 2009, we had 1,646 full-time
    employees, including 430 in product development, 696 in sales
    and marketing, 330 in professional services and technical
    support and 190 in finance, administration and operations. None
    of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have
    experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee
    relations are good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

In addition to the other information in this report, the
    following risk factors should be carefully considered in
    evaluating our company and its business.

Our
    success depends on our timely development of new products and
    features, market acceptance of new product offerings and proper
    management of the timing of the life cycle of our
    products

The application delivery networking and file virtualization
    markets are characterized by rapid technological change,
    frequent new product introductions, changes in customer
    requirements and evolving industry standards. Our continued
    success depends on our ability to identify and develop new
    products and new features for our existing products to meet the
    demands of these changes, and the acceptance of those products
    and features by our existing and target customers. If we are
    unable to identify, develop and deploy new products and new
    product features on a timely basis, our business and results of
    operations may be harmed.

The current life cycle of our products is typically 12 to
    24 months. The introduction of new products or product
    enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing
    products, or replace sales of some of our current products,
    thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product
    introduction, and may cause customers to defer purchasing our
    existing products in anticipation of the new products. This
    could harm our operating results by decreasing sales, increasing
    our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to
    greater risk of product obsolescence. We have also experienced,
    and may in the future experience, delays in developing and
    releasing new products and product enhancements. This has led
    to, and may in the future lead to, delayed sales, increased
    expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated. Also, in
    the development of our products, we have experienced delays in
    the prototyping of our products, which in turn has led to delays
    in product introductions. In addition, complexity and
    difficulties in managing product transitions at the

end-of-life

stage of a product can create excess inventory of components
    associated with the outgoing product



that can lead to increased expenses. Any or all of the above
    problems could materially harm our business and results of
    operations.

Our
    success depends on sales and continued innovation of our
    Application Delivery Networking product lines

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, we derived
    approximately 93.7% of our net product revenues, or
    approximately 58.3% of our total net revenues, from sales of our
    Application Delivery Networking (“ADN”) product lines.
    We expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net
    revenues from sales of our ADN products in the future.
    Implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being
    able to solve critical network availability and performance
    problems of our customers. If our ADN products are unable to
    solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to
    sustain the high levels of innovation in our ADN product feature
    set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a
    competitive market environment, our business and results of
    operations will be harmed.

We may
    not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application
    delivery networking and file virtualization
    markets

The markets we serve are new, rapidly evolving and highly
    competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify
    in the future. Our principal competitors in the application
    delivery networking market include Cisco, Citrix, Brocade and
    Radware. In the adjacent WAN Optimization Controller market, we
    compete with Riverbed, Juniper, Blue Coat Systems, Cisco and
    Citrix. In the file virtualization market, we compete with EMC.
    We expect to continue to face additional competition as new
    participants enter our markets. As we continue to expand
    globally, we may see new competitors in different geographic
    regions. In addition, larger companies with significant
    resources, brand recognition, and sales channels may form
    alliances with or acquire competing application delivery
    networking solutions from other companies and emerge as
    significant competitors. Potential competitors may bundle their
    products or incorporate an Internet traffic management or
    security component into existing products in a manner that
    discourages users from purchasing our products. Any of these
    circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and
    negatively impact our financial performance.

Our
    quarterly and annual operating results are inherently
    unpredictable and may cause our stock price to
    fluctuate

Our quarterly and annual operating results have varied
    significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the
    future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future
    operating results. In particular, we anticipate that the size of
    customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger
    business accounts. A delay in the recognition of revenue, even
    from just one account, may have a significant negative impact on
    our results of operations for a given period. In the past, a
    majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a
    quarter. Accordingly, a delay in an anticipated sale past the
    end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of
    operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that fiscal year.
    Additionally, we have exposure to the credit risks of some of
    our customers and

sub-tenants.

Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor
    and mitigate the associated risk, there can be no assurance that
    such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks
    adequately. We monitor individual payment capability in granting
    credit arrangements, seek to limit the total credit to amounts
    we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we
    believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses. If
    there is a deterioration of a

sub-tenant’s

or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults
    are higher than expected, future losses, if incurred, could harm
    our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating
    results.

Further, our operating results may be below the expectations of
    securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years.
    Our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the
    market price of our common stock. Such a decline could occur,
    and has occurred in the past, even when we have met our publicly
    stated revenue

and/or

earnings guidance.



The
    average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs
    may increase, which may negatively impact gross
    profits

It is possible that the average selling prices of our products
    will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing
    pressures, increased sales discounts, new product introductions
    by us or our competitors or other factors. Therefore, in order
    to maintain our gross profits, we must develop and introduce new
    products and product enhancements on a timely basis and
    continually reduce our product costs. Our failure to do so will
    cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline, which will
    harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we may
    experience substantial

period-to-period

fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of
    our average selling prices.

It is
    difficult to predict our future operating results because we
    have an unpredictable sales cycle

Our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our
    revenue is difficult to predict. Historically, our sales cycle
    has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended
    to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on
    the enterprise market. Also, as our distribution strategy has
    evolved into more of a channel model, utilizing value-added
    resellers, distributors and systems integrators, the level of
    variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has
    increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of
    many of our sales transactions. Sales of our products require us
    to educate potential customers in their use and benefits. Sales
    of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal
    budgeting, approval and competitive evaluation processes that
    large corporations and governmental entities may require. For
    example, customers frequently begin by evaluating our products
    on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our
    products before they decide whether or not to purchase.
    Customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated
    releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or
    us. As a result, our products have an unpredictable sales cycle
    that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating
    results.

Our
    business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not
    able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if
    a single source of hardware assembly is lost or
    impaired

We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to
    third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware
    platforms to our specifications. We have experienced minor
    delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past.
    However, if we experience major delays in the future or other
    problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of
    product, any one or a combination of these factors may harm our
    business and results of operations. The inability of our
    contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of
    our products or the loss of one or more of our contract
    manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders
    while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our
    business and results of operations. In particular, we currently
    subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking
    products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not
    have a long-term contract. If our arrangement with this single
    source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise
    impaired, and we were not able to engage another contract
    manufacturer in a timely manner, our business, financial
    condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.

If the demand for our products grows, we will need to increase
    our raw material and component purchases, contract manufacturing
    capacity and internal test and quality control functions. Any
    disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue, may harm our
    competitive position and may result in additional costs or
    cancellation of orders by our customers.

Our
    business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays
    in the supply of hardware components from our third-party
    sources

We currently purchase several hardware components used in the
    assembly of our products from a number of single or limited
    sources. Lead times for these components vary significantly. The
    unavailability of suitable components, any interruption or delay
    in the supply of any of these hardware components or the
    inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources
    at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, may delay



assembly and sales of our products and, hence, our revenues, and
    may harm our business and results of operations.

We are
    subject to governmental export and import controls that could
    subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in
    international markets

Our products are subject to U.S. export controls and may be
    exported outside the U.S. only with the required level of
    export license or through an export license exception because we
    incorporate encryption technology into our products. In
    addition, various countries regulate the import of certain
    encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our
    ability to distribute our products or our customers’
    ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in
    our products or changes in export and import regulations may
    create delays in the introduction of our products in
    international markets, prevent our customers with international
    operations from deploying our products throughout their global
    systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our
    products to certain countries altogether. Any change in export
    or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach
    to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in
    the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such
    regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by,
    or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to,
    existing or potential customers with international operations.
    For example, we will need to comply with Waste Electrical and
    Electronic Equipment Directive laws, which are being adopted by
    certain European Economic Area countries on a

country-by-country

basis. Failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely
    basis, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, operating results and financial condition. Any
    decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to
    export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our
    business, operating results and financial condition.

We may
    not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and
    our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of
    third parties

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
    trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure of
    confidential and proprietary information to protect our
    intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our
    proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or
    otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring
    unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be
    certain that the steps we have taken will prevent
    misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign
    countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights
    as fully as in the United States.

Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number
    of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding
    patent and other intellectual property rights. In the ordinary
    course of our business, we are involved in disputes and
    licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed
    proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always
    successfully defend ourselves against such claims. If we are
    found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, or if we
    otherwise settle such claims, we could be compelled to pay
    damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those
    intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they
    no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights. Any license
    could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at
    all. Similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid
    infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or
    impractical. In addition, we have initiated, and may in the
    future initiate, claims or litigation against third parties for
    infringement of our proprietary rights, or to determine the
    scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our
    competitors. Any of these claims, whether claims that we are
    infringing the proprietary rights of others, or vice versa, with
    or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly
    litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel
    or require us to cease using infringing technology, develop
    non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing
    agreements. Further, our license agreements typically require us
    to indemnify our customers, distributors and resellers for
    infringement actions related to our technology, which could
    cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against
    our customers, distributors or resellers. Any of the
    above-described circumstances relating to intellectual property
    rights disputes could result in our business and results of
    operations being harmed.

Many of our products include intellectual property licensed from
    third parties. In the future, it may be necessary to renew
    licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new
    licenses for other technology.



These third party licenses may not be available to us on
    acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain
    licenses, or litigation regarding the interpretation or
    enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property
    issues, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, we
    license some third party intellectual property on a
    non-exclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect
    our intellectual property rights in our products.

We may
    not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships
    and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution
    partners could hurt our business

We sell our products and services through multiple distribution
    channels in the United States and internationally, including
    leading industry distributors, value-added resellers, systems
    integrators, and other indirect channel partners. We have a
    limited number of agreements with companies in these channels,
    and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution
    relationships or maintain our existing relationships. Recruiting
    and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in
    our technologies requires significant time and resources. If we
    are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels,
    our business and results of operations will be harmed. In
    addition, one worldwide distributor of our products accounted
    for 15.4% of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2009. Two
    worldwide distributors of our products together accounted for
    24.5% of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2008. A
    substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these
    distribution partners, if not replaced by sales to other
    indirect channel partners and distributors, could harm our
    business, operating results and financial condition.

Undetected
    software or hardware errors may harm our business and results of
    operations

Our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first
    introduced or as new versions are released. We have experienced
    these errors or defects in the past in connection with new
    products and product upgrades. We expect that these errors or
    defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced
    products after commencement of commercial shipments. These
    problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair
    costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from
    our product development efforts and cause significant customer
    relations problems. We may also be subject to liability claims
    for damages related to product errors or defects. While we carry
    insurance policies covering this type of liability, these
    policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be
    asserted. A material product liability claim may harm our
    business and results of operations.

Our products must successfully operate with products from other
    vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may
    be difficult to identify the source of the problem. The
    occurrence of software or hardware problems, whether caused by
    our products or another vendor’s products, may result in
    the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products. The
    occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and
    results of operations.

Adverse
    general economic conditions or reduced information technology
    spending may adversely impact our business

A substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for
    information technology by large enterprise customers and service
    providers, the overall economic health of our current and
    prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of
    the Internet. National, regional and local economic conditions,
    such as recessionary economic cycles, protracted economic
    slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely
    impact demand for our products. The purchase of our products is
    often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of
    capital and other resources. Continued weak economic conditions
    or a reduction in information technology spending even if
    economic conditions improve would likely result in longer sales
    cycles and reduced product sales, each of which would adversely
    impact our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.



Our
    investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that
    may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these
    investments

At September 30, 2009, the fair value of our AAA/A- (or
    equivalent) rated municipal auction rate securities
    (“ARS”) was approximately $40.1 million.
    Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately
    $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS we held because
    sell orders exceeded buy orders. We may not be able to liquidate
    these investments and realize their full carrying value unless
    the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a
    buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security
    matures. While we do not believe the decline in the carrying
    values of these municipal ARS is permanent, if the issuers of
    these securities are unable to successfully close future
    auctions and their credit ratings are lowered, we may be
    required to record future impairment charges related to these
    investments, which would harm our results of operations. We
    believe certain of these

available-for-sale

investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months
    and as a result, we have classified these investments as
    long-term as of September 30, 2009.

Our
    operating results are exposed to risks associated with
    international commerce

As our international sales increase, our operating results
    become more exposed to international operating risks. These
    risks include risks related to recessionary economic cycles or
    protracted slowdowns in economies outside the United States,
    foreign currency exchange rates, managing foreign sales offices,
    regulatory, political or economic conditions in specific
    countries, military conflict or terrorist activities, changes in
    laws and tariffs, inadequate protection of intellectual property
    rights in foreign countries, foreign regulatory requirements and
    natural disasters. All of these factors could have a material
    adverse effect on our business. We intend to continue expanding
    into international markets. International sales represented
    44.7% and 42.5% of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended
    September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In particular,
    in fiscal year 2009, we derived 8.7% of our total revenue from
    the Japanese market. This revenue is dependent on a number of
    factors outside our control, including the viability and success
    of our resellers and the strength of the Japanese economy.

Changes
    in governmental regulations could negatively affect our
    revenues

Our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by
    the United States and various foreign governments including, but
    not limited to, environmental regulations and regulations
    implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the
    import or export of some technologies, especially encryption
    technology. Changes in governmental regulation and our inability
    or failure to obtain required approvals, permits or
    registrations could harm our international and domestic sales
    and adversely affect our revenues, business and operations.

Acquisitions
    present many risks and we may not realize the financial and
    strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the
    transaction

With respect to our past acquisitions, as well as any other
    future acquisitions we may undertake, we may find that the
    acquired businesses, products or technologies do not further our
    business strategy as expected, that we paid more than what the
    assets are later worth or that economic conditions change, all
    of which may generate future impairment charges. Our
    acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers, financial
    markets or investors. There may be difficulty integrating the
    operations and personnel of the acquired business, and we may
    have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired
    business. We may have difficulty in integrating the acquired
    technologies or products with our existing product lines. Our
    ongoing business and management’s attention may be
    disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and
    the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse
    locations. We may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards,
    controls, procedures and policies across locations. We may
    experience significant problems or liabilities associated with
    product quality, technology and other matters.

Our inability to successfully operate and integrate
    newly-acquired businesses appropriately, effectively and in a
    timely manner, or to retain key personnel of any acquired
    business, could have a material adverse



effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in
    demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions
    and other advances in technology, as well as on our revenues,
    gross margins and expenses.

Our
    success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract
    and retain qualified sales and marketing, operations, product
    development and professional services personnel

Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued
    contributions of our key management, product development, sales,
    marketing and finance personnel, many of whom may be difficult
    to replace. The complexity of our application delivery
    networking products and their integration into existing networks
    and ongoing support, as well as the sophistication of our sales
    and marketing effort, requires us to retain highly trained
    professional services, customer support and sales personnel.
    Competition for qualified professional services, customer
    support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because
    of the limited number of people available with the necessary
    technical skills and understanding of our products. Our ability
    to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by
    volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock, since
    these employees are generally granted restricted stock units or
    stock options. The loss of services of any of our key personnel,
    the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the
    future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our
    business and results of operations.

We
    face litigation risks

We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business.
    Litigation in general, and intellectual property and securities
    litigation in particular, can be expensive, lengthy and
    disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results
    of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
    Responding to lawsuits has been, and will likely continue to be,
    expensive and time-consuming for us. An unfavorable resolution
    of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business, results
    of operations or financial condition.

Our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our
    prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks
    associated with litigation. Beginning in May 2006 several
    derivative actions were filed against certain current and former
    directors and officers (as discussed further in Part II,
    Item 8, Note 8, “Commitments and
    Contingencies — Litigation”) based on allegations
    relating to our historical stock option practices. We cannot
    assure you that this current litigation will result in the same
    conclusions reached by the special committee of outside
    directors formed by our Board of Directors to conduct a review
    of our stock option practices (the “Special
    Committee”).

We may in the future be subject to additional litigation arising
    in relation to our historical stock option practices and the
    restatement of our prior financial statements. Litigation may be
    time consuming, expensive and distracting for management from
    the conduct of our business. The adverse resolution of any
    lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure
    you that any future litigation relating to our historical stock
    option practices will result in the same conclusions reached by
    the Special Committee. Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse
    findings in any of these matters, we could be required to pay
    damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us
    which could adversely affect our business, results of operations
    or financial condition.

The
    matters relating to our historical stock option practices and
    the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have
    resulted in regulatory proceedings against us and may result in
    future regulatory proceedings, which could have a material
    adverse impact on our financial condition

On November 8, 2006, we announced that the Special
    Committee had completed its review of our historical stock
    option practices. Upon completion of its review, the Special
    Committee found that the recorded grant dates for certain stock
    options granted during fiscal years 1999 to 2004 should be
    adjusted as the measurement date for accounting purposes and the
    accounting treatment used for the vesting of certain stock
    options was incorrect. Based on the Special Committee’s
    review, to correct the accounting treatment, we amended our
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K/A

(as amended) for the year ended September 30, 2005 and our
    Quarterly Reports on

Form 10-Q

for the three months ended December 31, 2005 and
    March 31, 2006 to restate the consolidated financial
    statements contained in those reports.



In May 2006, we received notice from both the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the United States
    Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York (the
    “Department of Justice”) that they were conducting
    informal inquiries into our historical stock option practices.
    We have fully cooperated with both agencies. Considerable legal
    and accounting expenses related to our historical stock option
    practices have been incurred and we may in the future be subject
    to additional regulatory proceedings or actions arising in
    relation to our historical stock option practices and the
    restatement of our prior period financial statements. Any
    potential regulatory proceeding or action may be time consuming,
    expensive and distracting for management from the conduct of our
    business. The adverse resolution of any potential regulatory
    proceeding or action could adversely affect our business,
    results of operations or financial condition. We cannot assure
    you that the SEC and Department of Justice inquiries, or any
    future regulatory action relating to our historical stock option
    practices, will result in the same conclusions reached by the
    Special Committee. Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse
    findings in any of these matters, we could be required to pay
    damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us,
    including criminal penalties, which could adversely affect our
    business, results of operations or financial condition.

Anti-takeover
    provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to
    acquire us

Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the
    price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions,
    including voting rights, of those shares without any further
    vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of
    common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected
    by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be
    issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have
    the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of
    control of our company without further action by our
    shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other
    rights of the holders of common stock. Further, certain
    provisions of our bylaws, including a provision limiting the
    ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of
    shareholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect
    of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of
    our company, which could have an adverse effect on the market
    price of our common stock. In addition, our articles of
    incorporation provide for a staggered board, which may make it
    more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of
    Directors. Similarly, state anti-takeover laws in the State of
    Washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a
    change of control of our company.

Properties

We lease our principal administrative, sales, marketing,
    research and development facilities, which are located in
    Seattle, Washington and consist of approximately
    190,000 square feet. In April 2000, we amended and restated
    the lease agreement on two of the three buildings for our
    corporate headquarters. The lease commenced in July 2000 on the
    first building; and the lease on the second building commenced
    in October 2000. The lease for both buildings expires in 2012
    with an option for renewal. The lease for the second building
    has been partially subleased through 2012. The lease on the
    third building commenced in June 2008 and will expire in 2018.
    In October 2006, we entered into an office lease agreement to
    lease a building adjacent to the three buildings that serve as
    our corporate headquarters. This lease expires in 2018. During
    2008, we entered into two separate sublease agreements to
    sublease approximately 112,500 square feet of this
    building. These subleases expire in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

We believe that our existing properties are in good condition
    and suitable for the conduct of our business. We also lease
    office space for our product development personnel in Spokane,
    Washington, San Jose, California, Lowell, Massachusetts,
    Israel, Northern Ireland, and Russia and for our sales and
    support personnel in Illinois, Washington D.C., New York, New
    Jersey, Mexico, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, Taiwan, Thailand,
    India, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, Australia, New
    Zealand, Germany, France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Netherlands and
    the United Kingdom. We believe that our future growth can be
    accommodated by our current facilities or by leasing additional
    space if necessary.



Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

Derivative Suits.

Beginning on or about
    May 24, 2006, several derivative actions were filed against
    certain of our current and former directors and officers. These
    derivative lawsuits were filed in: (1) the Superior Court
    of King County, Washington, as In re F5 Networks, Inc. State
    Court Derivative Litigation (Case

No. 06-2-17195-1

SEA), which consolidates Adams v. Amdahl, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-17195-1

SEA), Wright v. Amdahl, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-19159-5

SEA), and Sommer v. McAdam, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-26248-4

SEA) (the “State Court Derivative Litigation”); and
    (2) the U.S. District Court for the Western District
    of Washington, as In re F5 Networks, Inc. Derivative Litigation,
    Master File

No. C06-0794RSL,

which consolidates Hutton v. McAdam, et al. (Case

No. 06-794RSL),

Locals 302 and 612 of the International Union of Operating
    Engineers-Employers Construction Industry Retirement
    Trust v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1057RSL),

and Easton v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1145RSL)

(the “Federal Court Derivative Litigation”). On
    August 2, 2007, another derivative lawsuit, Barone v.
    McAdam et al. (Case

No. C07-1200P)

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
    District of Washington. The Barone lawsuit was designated a
    related case to the Federal Court Derivative Litigation on
    September 4, 2007. The complaints generally allege that
    certain of our current and former directors and officers,
    including, in general, each of our current outside directors
    (other than Deborah L. Bevier and Scott Thompson who joined our
    Board of Directors in July 2006 and January 2008, respectively)
    breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by engaging in
    alleged wrongful conduct concerning the manipulation of certain
    stock option grant dates. We are named solely as a nominal
    defendant against whom the plaintiffs seek no recovery. Our
    combined motion to consolidate and stay the State Court
    Derivative Litigation was granted in a court order dated
    April 3, 2007. Our motion to dismiss the consolidated
    federal derivative actions based on plaintiffs’ failure to
    make demand on our Board of Directors prior to filing suit was
    granted in a court order dated August 6, 2007 with leave to
    amend the allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint. Plaintiffs
    filed an amended consolidated federal derivative action
    complaint on September 14, 2007. We filed a motion to
    dismiss the amended complaint based on plaintiff’s failure
    to make demand on our Board of Directors prior to filing suit.
    On July 3, 2008, before ruling on our pending dismissal
    motion, the federal court entered an order certifying certain
    issues of Washington state law to the Washington Supreme Court
    for resolution. On May 21, 2009, the Washington Supreme
    Court issued its opinion on the certified issues. Our dismissal
    motion remains pending before the federal court as we intend to
    continue to vigorously pursue dismissal of the derivative
    actions.

SEC and Department of Justice Inquiries.

In
    May 2006, we received notice from both the SEC and the
    Department of Justice that they were conducting informal
    inquiries into our historical stock option practices, and have
    fully cooperated with both agencies. Considerable legal and
    accounting expenses related to our historical stock option
    practices have been incurred to date. We may in the future be
    subject to additional regulatory proceedings or actions arising
    in relation to our historical stock option practices and the
    restatement of our prior period financial statements. Although
    regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, we
    do not believe the results of any pending actions will,
    individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact
    on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

We are not aware of any pending legal proceedings other than
    those mentioned above that, individually or in the aggregate,
    would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
    results, or financial condition. We may in the future be party
    to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business,
    including claims that we allegedly infringe upon third-party
    trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Such claims,
    even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of
    significant financial and managerial resources.

As of November 18, 2009, there were approximately 77
    holders of record of our common stock. As many of our shares of
    common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on
    behalf of shareholders, we are unable to estimate the total
    number of beneficial holders of our common stock represented by
    these record holders.

Dividend

Our policy has been to retain cash to fund future growth.
    Accordingly, we have not paid dividends and do not anticipate
    declaring dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable
    future.

Unregistered
    Securities Sold in 2009

We did not sell any unregistered shares of our common stock
    during the fiscal year 2009.

Issuer
    Purchases of Equity Securities

On October 22, 2008, we announced that our Board of
    Directors approved a new program to repurchase up to an
    additional $200 million of our outstanding common stock.
    Acquisitions for the share repurchase program will be made from
    time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as
    permitted by securities laws and other requirements. The program
    can be terminated at any time. As of November 18, 2009 we
    had repurchased and retired 3,482,597 shares at an average price
    of $26.94 per share under the new program.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results
    of operations contains forward-looking statements within the
    meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. These
    statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our
    plans, objectives, expectations, strategies, intentions or other
    characterizations of future events or circumstances and are
    generally identified by the words “expects,”
    “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,”
    “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,”
    and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are
    based on current information and expectations and are subject to
    a number of risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could
    differ materially from those expressed or implied by these
    forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or
    contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to,
    those discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”
    herein and in other documents we file from time to time with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission. We assume no obligation to
    revise or update any such forward-looking statements.

Overview

We are a global provider of appliances consisting of software
    and hardware and services that help companies efficiently and
    securely manage the delivery, optimization and security of
    application and data traffic on Internet-based networks, and to
    optimize the performance and utilization of data storage
    infrastructure and other network resources. We market and sell
    our products primarily through multiple indirect sales channels
    in the Americas (primarily the United States); Europe, the
    Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia Pacific
    region (APAC). Enterprise customers (Fortune 1000 or Business
    Week Global 1000 companies) in the technology,
    telecommunications, financial services, transportation,
    education, manufacturing and health care industries, along with
    government customers, continue to make up the largest percentage
    of our customer base.

Our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key
    performance indicators in order to manage our business and
    evaluate our financial and operating performance. Those
    indicators include:

•

Revenues.

The majority of our revenues are
    derived from sales of our Application Delivery Networking
    (“ADN”) products; BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager, BIG-IP
    Global Traffic Manager, BIG-IP ISP Traffic Manager,
    TrafficShield Application Firewall, WANJet, and WebAccelerator;
    FirePass SSL VPN servers; and our ARX file virtualization
    products. We also derive revenues from the sales of services
    including annual maintenance contracts, training and consulting
    services. We carefully monitor the sales



mix of our revenues within each reporting period. We believe
    customer acceptance rates of our new products and feature
    enhancements are key indicators of future trends. We also
    consider overall revenue concentration by customer and by
    geographic region as additional indicators of current and future
    trends.

•

Cost of revenues and gross margins.

We strive
    to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross
    margins. Significant items impacting cost of revenues are
    hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third-party
    software license fees, amortization of developed technology and
    personnel and overhead expenses. Our margins have remained
    relatively stable, however, factors such as sales price, product
    mix, inventory obsolescence, returns, component price increases
    and warranty costs could significantly impact our gross margins
    from quarter to quarter and represent significant indicators we
    monitor on a regular basis.

•

Operating expenses.

Operating expenses are
    substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses.
    Existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant
    factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense
    trends. Other significant operating expenses that we monitor
    include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees,
    computer costs related to the development of new products,
    facilities and depreciation expenses.

•

Liquidity and cash flows.

Our financial
    condition remains strong with significant cash and investments
    and no long term debt. The increase in cash and investments for
    fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to cash provided by operating
    activities of $202.0 million. This increase was partially
    offset by $87.4 million of cash used to repurchase
    outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program in
    fiscal 2009. Going forward, we believe the primary driver of
    cash flows will be net income from operations. Capital
    expenditures for fiscal year 2009 were comprised primarily of
    tenant improvements and information technology infrastructure
    and equipment to support the growth of our core business
    activities. We will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions
    of, or investments in businesses, products, or technologies that
    we believe are strategic, which may require the use of cash.

•

Balance sheet.

We view cash, short-term and
    long-term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable
    balances and days sales outstanding as important indicators of
    our financial health. Deferred revenues continued to increase in
    fiscal 2009 due to the growth in the amount of annual
    maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance
    renewal contracts related to our existing product installation
    base. Our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of
    fiscal year 2009 was 55 days. We expect to maintain this
    metric in the mid

50-day

range
    going forward.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. The preparation of these financial
    statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and
    on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
    estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the
    more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation
    of our financial statements.

Revenue Recognition.

We sell products through
    distributors, resellers, and directly to end users. We recognize
    product revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns,
    provided that collection is determined to be reasonably assured
    and no significant obligations remain. In certain regions where
    we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns, we
    defer revenue on sales to our distributors until we receive
    information from the channel partner indicating that the
    distributor has sold the product to its customer. Payment terms
    to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net
    45 days. Payment terms to international customers range
    from net 30 days to net 90 days based on normal and
    customary trade practices in the



individual markets. We have offered extended payment terms
    ranging from three to six months to certain customers, in which
    case revenue is recognized when payments are made.

Whenever product, training and post-contract customer support
    (“PCS”) elements are combined into a package with a
    single “bundled” price, a portion of the sales price
    is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on
    their respective fair values as determined when the individual
    elements are sold separately. We determine fair value based on
    the type of customer and region in which the package is sold.
    Where fair value of certain elements are not available, we
    recognize revenue on the “residual method” based on
    the fair value of undelivered elements. Revenues from the sale
    of product are recognized when the product has been shipped and
    the customer is obligated to pay for the product. When rights of
    return are present and we cannot estimate returns, we recognize
    revenue when such rights of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the service contract
    term. PCS includes a limited period of telephone support
    updates, repair or replacement of any failed product or
    component that fails during the term of the agreement, bug fixes
    and rights to upgrades, when and if available. Consulting
    services are customarily billed at fixed rates, plus

out-of-pocket

expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has
    been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training
    has been completed.

Reserve for Doubtful Accounts.

Estimates are
    used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are
    based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a
    percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging
    category. In determining these percentages, we evaluate
    historical write-offs, current trends in the credit quality of
    our customer base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We
    perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’
    financial condition and do not require any collateral. If there
    is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or
    actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our
    allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient.

Reserve for Product Returns.

In some
    instances, product revenue from distributors is subject to
    agreements allowing rights of return. Product returns are
    estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the
    time revenues are recognized. Accordingly, we reduce recognized
    revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is
    recorded. When rights of return are present and we cannot
    estimate returns, revenue is recognized when such rights lapse.
    The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon
    changes in historical rates of returns and other related
    factors. It is possible that these estimates will change in the
    future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates.

Accounting for Income Taxes.

We utilize the
    liability method of accounting for income taxes. Accordingly, we
    are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the
    jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of
    preparing our consolidated financial statements. This process
    involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including
    assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with
    assessing temporary differences resulting from the different
    treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These
    differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due
    to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with
    the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is
    possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in
    the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and
    adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition
    and cash flows.

Stock-Based Compensation.

We account for
    stock-based compensation using the straight-line attribution
    method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite
    service period of the related award. We recognized
    $56.1 million and $60.6 million of stock-based
    compensation expense for the years ended September 30, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. As of September 30, 2009, there was
    $82.5 million of total unrecognized stock-based
    compensation cost, the majority of which will be recognized over
    the next two years. Going forward, stock-based compensation
    expenses may increase as we issue additional equity-based awards
    to continue to attract and retain key employees.

We issue incentive awards to our employees through stock-based
    compensation consisting of stock options and restricted stock
    units (“RSUs”). The value of RSUs is determined using
    the fair value method, which in this case, is based on the
    number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common
    stock on the date of grant. Alternatively, in determining the
    fair value of stock options, we use the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model that employs the following key assumptions.
    Expected volatility is based on the annualized



daily historical volatility of our stock price over the expected
    life of the option. Expected term of the option is based on
    historical employee stock option exercise behavior, the vesting
    terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten
    years. Our stock price volatility and option lives involve
    management’s best estimates at that time, both of which
    impact the fair value of the option calculated under the
    Black-Scholes methodology and, ultimately, the expense that will
    be recognized over the life of the option.

We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of stock
    options or RSUs that are expected to vest. Therefore, we apply
    estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical
    employee termination behavior. Based on historical differences
    with forfeitures of stock-based awards granted to our executive
    officers and Board of Directors versus grants awarded to all
    other employees, we developed separate forfeiture expectations
    for these two groups. In fiscal 2009, the average estimated
    forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and
    Board of Directors was approximately 4% and the average
    estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other
    employees was approximately 11%. If the actual number of
    forfeitures differs from those estimated by management,
    additional adjustments to stock-based compensation expense may
    be required in future periods.

In August 2009, we granted 420,000 RSUs to certain current
    executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of
    RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments
    over two years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested
    on August 1, 2011. Twenty-five percent of the RSU grant, or
    a portion thereof, is subject to our achievement of specified
    quarterly revenue and EBITDA goals during the period beginning
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 through the third
    quarter of fiscal year 2010. Fifty percent of the quarterly
    performance stock grant is based on achieving at least 80% of
    the quarterly revenue goal and the other 50% is based on
    achieving at least 80% of the quarterly EBITDA goal (the
    “2009 Performance Award”). The quarterly performance
    stock grant is paid linearly above 80% of the targeted goals. At
    least 100% of both goals must be attained in order for the
    quarterly performance stock grant to be awarded over 100%. Each
    goal is evaluated individually and subject to the 80%
    achievement threshold and 100% over-achievement threshold. The
    remaining twenty-five percent is subject to our achievement of
    specified quarterly goals during the period beginning in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 through the third quarter of
    fiscal year 2011, as will be set by the Compensation Committee
    of our Board of Directors.

In August 2008, we granted 383,400 RSUs to certain current
    executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of
    RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments
    over two years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested
    on August 1, 2010. Twenty-five percent of the RSU grant, or
    a portion thereof, was subject to our achievement of specified
    percentage increases in total revenue during the period
    beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 through the
    third quarter of fiscal year 2009, relative to the same periods
    in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 (the “2008 Performance
    Award”). Approximately half of this twenty-five percent was
    earned in fiscal 2009. The remaining twenty-five percent or a
    portion thereof, is subject to our achievement of specified
    quarterly revenue and EBITDA goals during the period beginning
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 through the third
    quarter of fiscal year 2010. Fifty percent of the quarterly
    performance stock grant is based on achieving at least 80% of
    the quarterly revenue goal and the other 50% is based on
    achieving at least 80% of the quarterly EBITDA goal. The
    quarterly performance stock grant is paid linearly above 80% of
    the targeted goals. At least 100% of both goals must be attained
    in order for the quarterly performance stock grant to be awarded
    over 100%. Each goal is evaluated individually and subject to
    the 80% achievement threshold and 100% over-achievement
    threshold.

In August 2007, we granted 276,400 RSUs to certain current
    executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of
    RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments
    over two years, and was fully vested on August 1, 2009.
    Twenty-five percent of the RSU grant was subject to our
    achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue
    during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year
    2007 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, relative to
    the same periods in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 (the “2007
    Performance Award”). This twenty-five percent was fully
    earned in fiscal 2008. The remaining twenty-five percent was
    subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in
    total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal year 2008 through the third quarter of fiscal year
    2009, relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2007 and
    2008. Approximately half of this twenty-five percent was earned
    in fiscal 2009.



We recognize compensation costs for awards with performance
    conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance
    condition will be achieved. We reassess the probability of
    vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs
    based on our probability assessment. Performance conditions for
    these awards were not met in the second and third fiscal
    quarters of 2009 and as such, no compensation cost was incurred.

Common stock repurchase.

On October 22,
    2008, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new
    program to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of
    our outstanding common stock. As of November 18, 2009, we
    had repurchased and retired 3,482,597 shares at an average
    price of $26.94 per share.

Goodwill and intangible assets.

We have a
    significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our
    balance sheet related to acquisitions. Intangible assets are
    carried and reported at acquisition cost, net of accumulated
    amortization subsequent to acquisition. Intangible assets are
    amortized over the estimated useful lives, which generally range
    from three to five years. Intangible assets are reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment
    might exist. Projected undiscounted net cash flows expected to
    be derived from the use of those assets are compared to the
    respective net carrying amounts to determine whether any
    impairment exists. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of
    the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets.

The determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and
    intangible assets and the extent to which, if any, there is
    impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on
    our part, including the useful life over which the intangible
    assets are to be amortized, and the estimates of the value of
    future net cash flows, which are based upon further estimates of
    future revenues, expenses and operating margins. We review our
    goodwill annually for impairment in the second fiscal quarter,
    or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The first
    step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may
    have occurred, while the second step of the test measures the
    amount of the impairment, if any. Impairment is recognized when
    the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. In March
    2009, we completed our annual impairment test and concluded that
    there was no impairment of goodwill. The Company has considered
    the assumptions used in the test and notes that no reasonably
    possible changes would reduce the fair value of the reporting
    unit to such a level that would cause an impairment charge.
    Additionally, as a result of the current economic environment,
    we considered potential impairment indicators at
    September 30, 2009 and noted no indicators of impairment.

Investments.

Our investments are diversified
    among high-credit quality debt securities in accordance with our
    investment policy. The majority of our investments are
    classified as

available-for-sale,

and are reported at fair market value with the related
    unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity.
    Realized gains and losses and declines in value of these
    investments judged to be other than temporary are included in
    other income (expense). To date, we have not deemed it necessary
    to record any charges related to

other-than-temporary

declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt
    securities. However, the fair value of our investments is
    subject to volatility. Declines in the fair value of our
    investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely
    affect our future operating results.

Our investments also include auction rate securities
    (“ARS”) that are classified as

available-for-sale

and as trading investment securities. ARS that are classified as

available-for-sale

are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized
    gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive
    income or loss in stockholders’ equity. We believe these
    investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months
    and as a result, we have classified these investments as
    long-term as of September 30, 2009. ARS securities
    classified as trading investment securities are reported at fair
    value with the related changes in fair value recorded to other
    income (expense). These ARS have been classified as short term,
    as we have the opportunity to liquidate these securities within
    the next twelve months through a guaranteed program with our
    investment manager. We used the income approach to determine the
    fair value of our ARS using a discounted cash flow analysis. The
    assumptions we used in preparing the discounted cash flow model
    include estimates for interest rates; estimates for discount
    rates using yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for
    illiquidity and other risk factors, amount of cash flows and
    expected holding periods for the ARS.

Net Revenues.

Total net revenues increased
    slightly in fiscal year 2009 from the prior year, compared to an
    increase of 23.7% in fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007.
    Given the current economic environment, we did not experience
    the same level of net revenue growth that we have had in prior
    periods and as a result net revenue for fiscal year 2009
    remained relatively flat with fiscal 2008. The change in net
    revenue was primarily due to a reduction in the volume of
    product sales, offset by an increase in service revenue as a
    result of our increased installed base of products.
    International revenues represented 44.7%, 42.5% and 41.6% of net
    revenues in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We
    expect international sales will continue to represent a
    significant portion of net revenues, although we cannot provide
    assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net
    revenues will remain at current levels.

Net product revenues decreased 10.2% in fiscal year 2009 from
    fiscal year 2008 and increased 15.3% in fiscal year 2008 as
    compared to fiscal year 2007. The decrease of $46.4 million
    in net product sales for fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to a
    $36.1 million reduction in the volume of sales of our ADN
    products, a $5.4 million reduction in the sales of our ARX
    file virtualization products, and a $4.9 million reduction
    in the volume of sales of our FirePass products, as compared to
    the same period in the prior year. Sales of our ADN products
    represented 93.7%, 92.0% and 94.5% of total product revenues in
    fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Net service revenues increased 25.0% in fiscal year 2009 from
    fiscal year 2008 and increased 48.6% in fiscal year 2008 as
    compared to fiscal year 2007. The increases in service revenue
    were the result of increased purchases or renewals of
    maintenance contracts driven by additions to our installed base
    of products.

Avnet Technology Solutions, one of our worldwide distributors,
    accounted for 15.4%, 14.0% and 13.2% of our total net revenue in
    fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Ingram Micro,
    Inc., another worldwide distributor, accounted for 10.5% and
    11.6% of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. No other distributors accounted for more than 10%
    of total net revenue.

Cost of Net Product Revenues.

Cost of net
    product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our
    contract manufacturers, manufacturing overhead, freight,
    warranty, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and
    amortization expenses in connection with developed technology
    from acquisitions. Product cost decreased to $95.2 million
    in fiscal year 2009 as compared to $102.4 million in fiscal
    year 2008. The year over year decrease was primarily due to a
    reduction in the volume of units shipped. In fiscal year 2008,
    the year over year increase from $84.1 million in fiscal
    year 2007 was primarily due to a higher volume of units shipped.
    The fiscal year 2008 increase also included shipments of our ARX
    file virtualization products and increased indirect
    manufacturing costs over prior periods.

Cost of Net Service Revenues.

Cost of net
    service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of
    our professional services staff, travel, facilities and
    depreciation expenses. Cost of net service revenues as a
    percentage of net service revenues decreased to 19.3% in fiscal
    year 2009 from 23.6% in fiscal year 2008 and 25.8% in fiscal
    year 2007 primarily due to the scalability of our existing
    customer support infrastructure and increased revenue from
    maintenance contracts. Professional services headcount at the
    end of fiscal year 2009 increased to 330 from 323 at the end of
    fiscal year 2008 and 279 at the end of fiscal year 2007. In
    addition, cost of net service revenues included stock-based
    compensation expense of $4.8 million, $4.0 million and
    $2.4 million for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing
    expenses consist of salaries, commissions and related benefits
    of our sales and marketing staff, the costs of our marketing
    programs, including public relations, advertising and trade
    shows, travel, facilities and depreciation expenses. Sales and
    marketing expense decreased 5.1% in fiscal year 2009 as compared
    to year over year increases of 35.1% and 37.7% in fiscal years
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in sales and marketing
    expense was primarily due to cost reduction initiatives we
    implemented in response to the slowing economic environment and
    a $6.9 million decrease in commissions expense
    corresponding to the decrease in product revenue for fiscal year
    2009, compared to the prior year. The fiscal year 2008 increase
    over the prior year was primarily due to a full year of expenses
    related to our ARX file virtualization personnel as compared to
    the 17 days of comparable expenses in fiscal year 2007.
    Sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2009
    decreased to 696 from 716 at the end of fiscal 2008 and 669 at
    the end of fiscal 2007. The decrease in headcount was primarily
    related to a reduction in workforce that took place in the
    second fiscal quarter of 2009 as part of our restructuring
    program. Sales and marketing expense included stock-based
    compensation charges of $22.6 million, $24.1 million
    and $15.8 million for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Research and Development.

Research and
    development expenses consist of the salaries and related
    benefits for our product development personnel, prototype
    materials and other expenses related to the development of new
    and improved products, facilities and depreciation expenses. In
    fiscal year 2009, research and development expenses remained
    relatively consistent with the prior year as compared to year
    over year increases of 49.8% and 40.4% in fiscal years 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The increase in research and development
    expense in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to
    increased personnel costs which totaled $19.7 million and
    $12.2 million, respectively, which is consistent with the
    increased revenue for the corresponding periods. The fiscal year
    2008 increase over the prior year was also attributed to a full
    year of expenses related to our ARX file virtualization
    personnel as compared to the 17 days of comparable expenses
    in fiscal year 2007. Research and development headcount at the
    end of fiscal 2009 decreased to 430 from 460 at the end of
    fiscal 2008 and 450 at the end of fiscal 2007. The decrease in
    headcount was primarily related to a reduction in workforce that
    took place in the second fiscal quarter of 2009 as part of our
    restructuring program. Research and development expense included
    stock-based compensation charges of $16.7 million,
    $16.3 million and $10.2 million for fiscal years 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. We expect research and development
    expenses to remain consistent as a percentage of net revenue in
    the foreseeable future.



General and Administrative.

General and
    administrative expenses consist of the salaries, benefits and
    related costs of our executive, finance, information technology,
    human resource and legal personnel, third-party professional
    service fees, bad debt charges, facilities and depreciation
    expenses. General and administrative expenses remained
    relatively consistent in fiscal year 2009 as compared with year
    over year increases of 13.7% in fiscal year 2008 and 25.9% in
    fiscal year 2007. The increase in fiscal year 2008 of
    $6.7 million was due primarily to an increase of
    $3.2 million in stock-based compensation charges and an
    increase of $3.5 million in salary and benefit expenses.
    General and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2009
    decreased to 190 from 195 at the end of fiscal 2008 and
    increased from 184 at the end of fiscal 2007. The decrease in
    headcount was primarily related to a reduction in workforce that
    took place in the second fiscal quarter of 2009 as part of our
    restructuring program. General and administrative expense
    included stock-based compensation charges of $11.6 million,
    $15.9 million and $12.6 million for fiscal years 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

In-process Research and Development.

Acquired
    in-process research and development (“IPR&D”)
    expense was $14.0 million in 2007 and reflects the amount
    allocated to IPR&D that we acquired in the Acopia Networks,
    Inc. (“Acopia”) acquisition. IPR&D represents the
    present value of estimated after-tax cash flows expected to be
    generated by purchased technology, which, at the acquisition
    date, had not yet reached technological feasibility. We based
    our estimates and projections related to IPR&D on
    assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time of the
    acquisition but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
    If we do not successfully develop this product, our business,
    operating results and financial condition may be adversely
    affected.

Loss on Facility Exit and Sublease.

During
    2008, we exited a research and development facility in Bellevue,
    Washington for which there was remaining operating lease
    obligations through 2014. In addition, during this period we
    consolidated our corporate headquarters, partially subleasing
    the building located at 333 Elliott Avenue West in Seattle,
    Washington for which there were remaining operating lease
    obligations through 2018. As a result of the expected loss on
    the facility exit and sublease agreements, we recorded a charge
    of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.

Restructuring.

Beginning in the second quarter
    of fiscal 2009 we implemented a comprehensive restructuring
    program as part of an overall initiative to reduce certain
    operating expenses. Restructuring actions included the
    consolidation of facilities, accelerated depreciation on tenant
    improvements and a reduction in workforce. In the second quarter
    of fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring expenses of
    $4.3 million, which included a $2.1 million charge for
    severance and related costs and a $2.2 million charge for
    the exit of certain offices worldwide. We had $0.6 million
    of accrued restructuring cost at September 30, 2009, which
    we expect to offset future rent expenses through September 2012.

Other Income, Net.

Other income, net, consists
    of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and
    losses. Other income, net decreased 48.7% in fiscal year 2009,
    as compared to fiscal year 2008 and decreased 32.8% in fiscal
    year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007. Interest income was
    $9.9 million, $17.5 million and $27.3 million for
    fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in
    other income, net for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal
    year 2008 was primarily due to decreased interest income of
    $7.6 million and decreased foreign currency transaction
    gains of $1.5 million. The decrease in interest income for
    fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to a decline in interest
    rates for the year. The decrease in other income, net for fiscal
    year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to
    decreased interest income as a result of reduced investment
    balances. Investment balances decreased in fiscal year 2008 as a
    result of the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our
    stock repurchase program and additional cash required for the
    acquisition of Acopia in September 2007.

Provision for Income Taxes.

We recorded a
    30.5% provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2009 compared
    to 37.1% in fiscal year 2008 and 39.7% in fiscal year 2007. The
    reduction in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2008 to
    fiscal year 2009 is largely attributable to the deduction for
    tax purposes of compensation related to equity awards in a major
    foreign tax jurisdiction, the reinstatement of the federal
    research and development credit in fiscal year 2009 and
    deductions obtained for U.S. tax purposes relative to the
    cessation of operations of a foreign subsidiary in the quarter
    ending September 30, 2009.

At September 30, 2009, we did not have a valuation
    allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the
    jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the
    assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making this
    determination we have considered projected future taxable income
    and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in
    assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance. Our net
    deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2009, 2008 and 2007
    were $57.0 million, $52.8 million and
    $43.3 million, respectively. Our worldwide effective tax
    rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including
    variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic
    locations in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our
    net deferred tax assets, resolution of potential exposures, tax
    positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic
    locations in which we operate, and the introduction of new
    accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations
    thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate.
    We have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures
    related to business and income tax positions we have taken that
    could be challenged by taxing authorities. The ultimate
    resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less
    than the liabilities recorded which could result in an
    adjustment to our future tax expense. In addition, on
    May 4, 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama proposed
    significant changes to the U.S. international tax laws that
    would limit U.S. deductions for expenses related to
    un-repatriated foreign-source income and modify the



U.S. foreign tax credit and

“check-the-box”

rules. We cannot determine whether these proposals will be
    enacted into law or what, if any, changes may be made to such
    proposals prior to their being enacted into law. If the
    U.S. tax laws change in a manner that increases our tax
    obligation, our operating results could suffer.

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term
    investments totaled $574.4 million as of September 30,
    2009 compared to $451.3 million as of September 30,
    2008, representing an increase of $123.2 million. The
    increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating
    activities of $202.0 million for fiscal year 2009, compared
    to $193.7 million for fiscal year 2008, which was partially
    offset by $87.4 million of additional cash required for the
    repurchase of outstanding common stock under our stock
    repurchase program in fiscal 2009. In fiscal year 2008, the
    decrease was primarily due to approximately $200 million of
    cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock under our stock
    repurchase program in fiscal 2008, partially offset by cash
    provided by operating activities of $193.7 million for the
    year ended September 30, 2008.

At September 30, 2009, we held $40.1 million of
    tax-exempt ARS, which are variable-rate debt securities and have
    a long-term maturity with the interest rates being reset through
    Dutch auctions that are typically held every 7, 28 or
    35 days. The securities have historically traded at par and
    are callable at par at the option of the issuer. Interest is
    typically paid at the end of each auction period or
    semi-annually. We limit our investments in ARS to securities
    that carry a AAA/A- (or equivalent) rating from recognized
    rating agencies and limit the amount of credit exposure to any
    one issuer. At the time of initial investment and at the date of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

all of our ARS were in compliance with our investment policy.

Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately
    $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS we held because
    sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these auctions failed to
    clear, higher interest rates for those securities went into
    effect. However, the funds associated with these failed auctions
    will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a
    successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the
    auction process or the security matures. The underlying assets
    of the municipal ARS we hold, including the securities for which
    auctions have failed, are generally student loans which are
    guaranteed by the U.S. government.

We have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers
    of our ARS are presently at risk of default. Through
    September 30, 2009, we have continued to receive interest
    payments on the ARS in accordance with their terms. We believe
    we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant
    loss primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying
    securities. However, due to recent changes and uncertainty in
    the ARS market, we believe certain of these

available-for-sale

investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months
    and as a result, we have classified $19.0 million (par
    value) of securities as long-term as of September 30, 2009.

In October 2008, we entered into an agreement (“the
    Agreement”) with UBS whereby UBS would purchase eligible
    ARS it sold to us prior to February 13, 2008. Under the
    terms of the Agreement, and at our discretion, UBS will purchase
    eligible ARS from us at par value (“Put Option”)
    during the period of June 30, 2010 through July 2,
    2012. Amounts eligible total $26.1 million (par value) at
    September 30, 2009. We expect to sell our eligible ARS
    under the Agreement. However, if we do not exercise our rights
    to sell our eligible



ARS under the Agreement before July 2, 2012 the Put Option
    will expire and UBS will have no further rights or obligations
    to buy our ARS. So long as we hold our ARS, they will continue
    to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the
    terms of the ARS if the auction process fails. In the first
    quarter of fiscal year 2009, we transferred these ARS from

available-for-sale

to trading investment securities. We elected to measure the Put
    Option under the fair value option, and recorded a benefit in
    other income of approximately $1.5 million pre-tax for the
    year ended September 30, 2009, and recorded a corresponding
    long term investment. As a result of accepting the Put Option
    and reclassifying the ARS from

available-for-sale

to trading investment securities, we recognized an

other-than-temporary

impairment loss of approximately $1.5 million pre-tax as of
    September 30, 2009, reflecting a reversal of the related
    unrealized loss that was previously recorded in other
    comprehensive loss. The recording of the fair value of the Put
    Option and the recognition of the

other-than-temporary

impairment loss resulted in no impact to the consolidated income
    statement for the year ended September 30, 2009.

Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2009
    was $202.0 million compared to $193.7 million in
    fiscal year 2008 and $169.7 million in fiscal year 2007.
    Cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from
    cash generated from net income, after adjusting for non-cash
    charges such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and
    amortization charges and changes in operating assets and
    liabilities.

Cash used in investing activities was $99.1 million for
    fiscal year 2009, compared to cash provided by investing
    activities of $13.7 million for fiscal year 2008 and cash
    used in investing activities of $188.1 million for fiscal
    year 2007. The cash used in investing activities in fiscal year
    2009 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and
    capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations
    worldwide partially offset by the maturity of investments. The
    cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2008 was
    primarily the result of the maturity of investments partially
    offset by the purchase of investments. The cash used in fiscal
    year 2007 was primarily the result of the purchase of
    investments partially offset by the sale of investments and
    $207.1 million of cash payments, net of cash acquired, to
    shareholders of Acopia, which was acquired in September 2007.

Cash used in financing activities was $70.7 million for
    fiscal year 2009, compared to cash used in financing activities
    of $181.7 million for fiscal year 2008 and cash provided by
    financing activities of $35.5 million in fiscal years 2007.
    In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, our Board of Directors
    approved a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to an
    additional $200 million of our outstanding common stock.
    Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2009 included
    $87.4 million to repurchase common stock under this plan,
    which was partially offset by the exercise of employee stock
    options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.
    Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2008 included
    $200 million to repurchase common stock under a previous
    stock repurchase program, which was partially offset by the
    exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our
    employee stock purchase plan. During fiscal year 2007 our
    financing activities consisted entirely of cash proceeds and tax
    benefits received from the exercise of stock options and stock
    purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.

Based on our current operating and capital expenditure
    forecasts, we believe that our existing cash and investment
    balances, excluding ARS, together with cash generated from
    operations should be sufficient to meet our operating
    requirements for the foreseeable future.

which establishes
    principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring
    identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed,
    and any noncontrolling interest in an acquisition, at their fair
    value as of the acquisition date. ASC 805 is effective for
    business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
    after October 1, 2009. This standard will change the
    Company’s accounting treatment for business combinations on
    a prospective basis.

In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC

820-10-65,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures —
    Overall — Transition and Open Effective Date
    Information

(“ASC

820-10-65”).

ASC

820-10-65

provides guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets
    and liabilities when the volume and level of activity for the
    asset/liability has significantly decreased. This statement also
    provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a
    transaction is not orderly. In addition, ASC

820-10-65

requires disclosure in interim and annual periods of the inputs
    and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and a
    discussion of changes in valuation techniques. The Company
    adopted the statement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.
    The adoption of ASC

820-10-65

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC

320-10,

Investments — Debt and Equity
    Securities — Overall

(“ASC

320-10”).

This guidance amends the requirements for the recognition and
    measurement of

other-than-temporary

impairments for debt securities by modifying the pre-existing
    “intent and ability” indicator. Under ASC

320-10,

an

other-than-temporary

impairment is triggered when there is an intent to sell the
    security, it is more likely than not that the security will be
    required to be sold before recovery, or the security is not
    expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the
    security. Additionally, this guidance changes the presentation
    of an

other-than-temporary

impairment in the income statement for those impairments
    involving credit losses. The credit loss component will be
    recognized in earnings and the remainder of the impairment will
    be recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company adopted
    ASC

320-10

in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. The adoption of this
    statement did not impact the Company as there have been no
    credit losses or

other-than-temporary

impairment losses on the Company’s

available-for-sale

securities in prior periods.

In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC

825-10-65,

Financial Instruments — Overall —
    Transition and Open Effective Date Information

(“ASC

825-10-65”).

This guidance requires interim disclosures regarding the fair
    values of financial instruments that are within the scope of ASC

825-10.

Additionally, this guidance requires disclosure of the methods
    and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
    financial instruments on an interim basis as well as changes of
    the methods and significant assumptions from prior periods. The
    Company adopted ASC

820-10-65

in
    the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. The adoption of this
    statement does not change the accounting treatment for these
    financial instruments.

In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC

855-10,

Subsequent Events — Overall

(“ASC

855-10”)

,

which establishes general standards of accounting for and
    disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but
    before financial statements are issued or are available to be
    issued. It requires the disclosure of the date



through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the
    basis for selecting that date, that is, whether that date
    represents the date the financial statements were issued or were
    available to be issued. The Company adopted ASC

855-10

in
    the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. The adoption of this
    statement did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

2009-13,

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements,

(amendments to
    FASB ASC Topic 605,

Revenue Recognition

) (“ASU

2009-13”)

and ASU

2009-14,

Certain Arrangements That Include Software Elements

,
    (amendments to FASB ASC Topic 985,

Software

) (“ASU

2009-14”).

ASU

2009-13

requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using
    estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services
    based on a selling price hierarchy. The amendments eliminate the
    residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be
    allocated using the relative selling price method. ASU

2009-14

removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue
    guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software
    deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product
    are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance. ASU

2009-13

and
    ASU

2009-14

should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue
    arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years
    beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption
    permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of ASU

2009-13

or
    ASU

2009-14

to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations or financial condition.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk.

Our cash equivalents
    consist of high-quality securities, as specified in our
    investment policy guidelines. The policy limits the amount of
    credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5% of
    the total portfolio with the exception of U.S. treasury
    securities, commercial paper and money market funds, which are
    exempt from size limitation. The policy requires investments in
    securities that mature in three years or less, with the average
    maturity being no greater than one and a half years. These
    securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease
    in value if interest rates increase. A decrease of one percent
    in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease
    of approximately $1.3 million in our interest income for
    the fiscal year 2009.

At September 30, 2009, the fair value of our AAA/A- (or
    equivalent) rated municipal ARS was approximately
    $40.1 million. ARS are collateralized long-term debt
    instruments that provide liquidity through a Dutch auction
    process that resets the applicable interest rate at
    pre-determined intervals, typically every 7, 28 or 35 days.
    Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately
    $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS we held because
    sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these auctions failed to
    clear, higher interest rates for those securities went into
    effect. However, the funds associated with these failed auctions
    will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a
    successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the
    auction process, we exercise the Put Option with UBS, or the
    security matures. The underlying assets of the municipal ARS we
    hold, including the securities for which auctions have failed,
    are generally student loans which are guaranteed by the
    U.S. government. Based on our expected operating cash flows
    and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that any
    reduction in liquidity of our municipal ARS will have a material
    impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. We
    have no intent to sell, won’t be required to sell, and
    believe we will hold these securities until recovery. The
    trading investment securities of $24.6 million (par value)
    have been classified as short-term and the

available-for-sale

securities of $15.5 million (par value) have been
    classified as long-term at September 30, 2009.

Foreign Currency Risk.

The majority of our
    sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a
    result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency
    transaction gains and losses to date. While we have conducted
    some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2009 and expect to continue to do so,
    we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or
    losses will be significant at our current level of operations.
    However, as we continue to expand our operations
    internationally, transaction gains or losses may become
    significant in the future. We have not engaged in foreign
    currency hedging to date. However, we may do so in the future.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of F5 Networks, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of F5 Networks, Inc. and its subsidiaries
    at September 30, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended September 30, 2009 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
    all material respects, the information set forth therein when
    read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of September 30, 2009, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain tax positions in fiscal year 2008.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

The
    Company

F5 Networks, Inc. (the “Company”) provides products
    and services to help companies manage their Internet Protocol
    (IP) traffic and file storage infrastructure efficiently and
    securely. The Company’s application delivery networking
    products improve the performance, availability and security of
    applications on Internet-based networks. Internet traffic
    between network-based applications and clients passes through
    these devices where the content is inspected to ensure that it
    is safe and modified as necessary to ensure that it is delivered
    securely and in a way that optimizes the performance of both the
    network and the applications. The Company’s storage
    virtualization products simplify and reduce the cost of managing
    files and file storage devices, and ensure fast, secure, easy
    access to files for users and applications. The Company also
    offers a broad range of services that include consulting,
    training, maintenance and other technical support services.

Accounting
    Principles

The Company’s consolidated financial statements and
    accompanying notes are prepared on the accrual basis of
    accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date
    of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are
    used in accounting for revenue recognition, reserves for
    doubtful accounts, product returns, obsolete and excess
    inventory, warranties, valuation allowances on deferred tax
    assets and purchase price allocations. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
    original maturities of three months or less to be cash
    equivalents. The Company invests its cash and cash equivalents
    in deposits with three major financial institutions, which, at
    times, exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not
    experienced any losses on its cash and cash equivalents.

Investments

The Company classifies the majority of its investment securities
    as

available-for-sale.

Investment securities, consisting of corporate and municipal
    bonds and notes and United States government securities, are
    reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and
    losses included as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.
    Realized gains and losses and declines in value of securities
    judged to be other than temporary are included in other income
    (expense). The cost of investments for purposes of computing
    realized and unrealized gains and losses is based on the
    specific identification method. Investments in securities with
    maturities of less than one year or where management’s
    intent is to use the investments to fund current operations are
    classified as short-term investments. Investments, other than
    certain auction rate securities (“ARS”) with
    maturities of greater than one year are classified as long-term
    investments.



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company has ARS that are classified as

available-for-sale

securities and are reported as long term, as the Company does
    not believe that they will be able to liquidate these securities
    in the next twelve months. The Company has no intent to sell,
    won’t be required to sell, and believes it will hold these
    securities until recovery. The Company also has ARS that are
    classified as trading investment securities and are reported as
    short term, as the Company has the option to liquidate these
    securities within the next twelve months through a guaranteed
    program with the Company’s investment manager. The Company
    used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value
    of ARS. The assumptions the Company used in preparing the
    discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates;
    estimates for discount rates using yields of comparable traded
    instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors,
    amount of cash flows and expected holding periods for the ARS.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company extends credit to customers and is therefore subject
    to credit risk. The Company performs initial and ongoing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and does
    not require collateral. An allowance for doubtful accounts is
    recorded to account for potential bad debts. Estimates are used
    in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based
    upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of
    remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In determining
    these percentages, the Company evaluates historical write-offs,
    and current trends in customer credit quality, as well as
    changes in credit policies. At September 30, 2009, Avnet
    Technology Solutions and Ingram Micro, Inc. accounted for 11.6%
    and 10.7% of our accounts receivable, respectively.

The Company maintains its cash and investment balances with high
    credit quality financial institutions. Included within the
    Company’s investment portfolio are investments in ARS. The
    Company’s ARS investments are currently not liquid as a
    result of continued auction failures. If the issuers are not
    able to meet their payment obligations or if the Company sells
    its ARS investments before they recover, the Company may lose
    some or all of its principal invested or may be required to
    further reduce the carrying value.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

Short-term and long-term investments are recorded at fair value
    as the underlying securities are classified as

available-for-sale

with any unrealized gain or loss being recorded to other
    comprehensive income and trading investment securities are

marked-to-market

through other income at each reporting period. The fair value is
    determined using quoted market prices for the securities held
    with the exception of ARS, which are valued based on a
    discounted cash flow model.

Inventories

The Company outsources the manufacturing of its pre-configured
    hardware platforms to contract manufacturers, who assemble each
    product to the Company’s specifications. As protection
    against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for
    its service teams, the Company also stocks limited supplies of
    certain key product components. The Company reduces inventory to
    net realizable value based on excess and obsolete inventories
    determined primarily by historical usage and forecasted demand.
    Inventories consist of hardware and related component parts and
    are recorded at the lower of cost or market (as determined by
    the

first-in,

first-out method).

Restricted
    Cash

Restricted cash primarily represents escrow accounts established
    in connection with lease agreements for the Company’s
    corporate headquarters and, to a lesser extent, the
    Company’s international facilities. Under the terms of the
    lease for the Company’s corporate headquarters, the amount
    required to be held in escrow reduces and eventually eliminates
    at various dates throughout the duration of the lease term.
    During fiscal year 2009, the amount required to be held in
    escrow was $2.4 million as set forth in the lease agreement
    for the Company’s corporate headquarters.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation of
    property and equipment are provided using the straight-line
    method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging
    from two to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized
    over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life
    of the improvements. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs
    is charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for major
    improvements are capitalized at cost. Gains or losses on the
    disposition of assets are reflected in the income statements at
    the time of disposal.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated
    fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date.
    The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and
    between annual tests in certain circumstances, and goodwill is
    written down when impaired. Goodwill of $150.2 million was
    recorded in connection with the acquisition of Acopia Networks,
    Inc. (“Acopia”) in the fourth quarter of 2007,
    goodwill of $32.0 million was recorded in connection with
    the acquisition of Swan Labs, Inc. (“Swan Labs”) in
    fiscal year 2006, goodwill of $25.5 million was recorded in
    connection with the acquisition of MagniFire

    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Websystems, Inc. in fiscal year 2004 and goodwill of
    $24.2 million was recorded in connection with the
    acquisition of uRoam, Inc. in fiscal year 2003.

The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test during
    the second fiscal quarter, or whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may
    not be recoverable. The first step of the test identifies
    whether potential impairment may have occurred, while the second
    step of the test measures the amount of the impairment, if any.
    Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill
    exceeds its fair value. In March 2009, the Company completed its
    annual impairment test and concluded that there was no
    impairment of goodwill. The Company has considered the
    assumptions used in the test and notes that no reasonably
    possible changes would reduce the fair value of the reporting
    unit to such a level that would cause an impairment charge.
    Additionally, as a result of the current economic environment,
    the Company considered potential impairment indicators
    throughout the year and at September 30, 2009 and noted no
    indicators of impairment.

Other
    Assets

Other assets primarily consist of software development costs,
    acquired and developed technology and customer relationships.

Software development costs are charged to research and
    development expense in the period incurred until technological
    feasibility is established. Thereafter, until the product is
    released for sale, software development costs are capitalized
    and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable
    value of each product. Capitalized software development cost are
    amortized over the remaining estimated economic life of the
    product. The establishment of technological feasibility and the
    ongoing assessment of recoverability of costs require
    considerable judgment by the Company with respect to certain
    internal and external factors, including, but not limited to,
    anticipated future gross product revenues, estimated economic
    life and changes in hardware and software technology. The
    Company did not capitalize any software development costs in
    fiscal year 2009. During fiscal year 2008, the Company
    capitalized $1.7 million of software development costs. The
    Company did not capitalize any software development costs in
    fiscal year 2007. Amortization costs related to capitalized
    software development were $421,000, $202,000, and $249,000 for
    fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively and have been
    recorded as additional cost of product revenues.

Acquired and developed technology and customer relationship
    assets are recorded at cost and amortized over their estimated
    useful lives of five years. The estimated useful life of these
    assets is assessed and evaluated for reasonableness
    periodically. Acquired technology of $15.0 million in
    fiscal 2007 and $8.0 million in fiscal 2006 was recorded in
    connection with the acquisitions of Acopia and Swan Labs,
    respectively. Amortization expense related to acquired
    technology, which is charged to cost of product revenues,
    totaled $5.3 million, $6.1 million and
    $3.4 million during the fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Amortization of all other intangible assets, including customer
    relationships, patents and trademarks was $1,003,000, $969,000
    and $486,000 during the fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets
    whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
    When such events occur, management determines whether there has
    been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted net
    future cash flows to the related asset’s carrying value. If
    impairment exists, the asset is written down to its estimated
    fair value. No impairment of long-lived assets was noted as of
    and for the year ended September 30, 2009.

    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s products are integrated with software that is
    essential to the functionality of the equipment. Accordingly,
    the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the accounting
    guidance for software products and disclosure under GAAP.

The Company sells products through distributors, resellers, and
    directly to end users. The Company recognizes product revenue
    upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that
    collection is determined to be reasonably assured and no
    significant performance obligations remain. In certain regions
    where the Company does not have the ability to reasonably
    estimate returns, the Company defers revenue on sales to its
    distributors until they have received information from the
    channel partner indicating that the distributor has sold the
    product to its customer. Payment terms to domestic customers are
    generally net 30 days to net 45 days. Payment terms to
    international customers range from net 30 days to net
    90 days based on normal and customary trade practices in
    the individual markets. The Company offers extended payment
    terms to certain customers, in which case, revenue is recognized
    when payments are due.

Whenever product, training and post-contract customer support
    (“PCS”) elements are sold together, a portion of the
    sales price is allocated to each element based on their
    respective fair values as determined when the individual
    elements are sold separately. The Company determines fair value
    based on the type of customer and region in which the package is
    sold. Where fair value of certain elements are not available,
    the Company recognizes revenue on the “residual
    method” based on the fair value of undelivered elements.
    Revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the
    product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay
    for the product. When rights of return are present and the
    Company cannot estimate returns, it recognizes revenue when such
    rights of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the service contract term. PCS includes
    a limited period of telephone support updates, repair or
    replacement of any failed product or component that fails during
    the term of the agreement, bug fixes and rights to upgrades,
    when and if available. Consulting services are customarily
    billed at fixed rates, plus

out-of-pocket

expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has
    been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training
    has been completed.

The Company accounts for taxes collected from customers and
    remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded
    from revenues.

Shipping
    and Handling

Shipping and handling fees charged to the Company’s
    customers are recognized as product revenue in the period
    shipped and the related costs for providing these services are
    recorded as a cost of sale.

Guarantees
    and Product Warranties

In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its
    products, the Company indemnifies other parties, including
    customers, resellers, lessors, and parties to other transactions
    with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company
    has agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses
    arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of
    intellectual property infringement or other claims made against
    certain parties. These agreements may limit the time within
    which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the
    claim. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements
    with its officers and directors, and the Company’s bylaws
    contain similar indemnification obligations to the
    Company’s agents. It is not possible to determine the
    maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements
    due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and
    the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
    agreement.

The Company offers warranties of one year for hardware for those
    customers without service contracts, with the option of
    purchasing additional warranty coverage in yearly increments.
    The Company accrues for



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

warranty costs as part of its cost of sales based on associated
    material product costs and technical support labor costs.
    Accrued warranty costs as of September 30, 2009, 2008 and
    2007 were not considered material.

Research
    and Development

Research and development expenses consist of salaries and
    related benefits of product development personnel, prototype
    materials and expenses related to the development of new and
    improved products, and an allocation of facilities and
    depreciation expense. Research and development expenses are
    reflected in the statements of income as incurred.

In-Process
    Research and Development

Acquired in-process research and development
    (“IPR&D”) reflects the amount allocated to
    IPR&D that the Company acquired in acquisitions. IPR&D
    represents the present value of estimated after-tax cash flows
    expected to be generated by purchased technology, which, at the
    acquisition date, had not yet reached technological feasibility
    and had no alternative future use. The Company recorded
    $14.0 million of IPR&D in fiscal 2007 related to its
    acquisition of Acopia.

Advertising

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred
    $1.3 million, $1.5 million and $2.2 million in
    advertising costs during the fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for
    income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
    determined based upon differences between the financial
    statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using
    enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
    differences are expected to reverse. The realization of deferred
    tax assets is based on historical tax positions and estimates of
    future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded when it
    is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets
    will not be realized.

In fiscal year 2008, the Company began assessing whether tax
    benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return
    should be recorded in the financial statements. The Company may
    recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if
    it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, including
    resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based
    on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits to be
    recognized in the financial statements from such a position is
    measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater
    than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement. The new guidance also provides guidance on
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income
    taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased
    disclosures.

Foreign
    Currency

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign
    subsidiaries is the local currency in which the respective
    entity is located, with the exception of F5 Networks, Ltd., in
    the United Kingdom that uses the U.S. dollar as its
    functional currency. An entity’s functional currency is
    determined by the currency of the economic environment in which
    the majority of cash is generated and expended by the entity.
    The financial statements of all majority-owned subsidiaries and
    related entities, with a functional currency other than the
    U.S. dollar, have been translated into U.S. dollars.
    All assets and liabilities of the respective entities are
    translated at year-end exchange rates and all revenues and
    expenses are translated at average rates during the respective
    period. Translation adjustments are reported as a separate
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
    shareholder’s equity.



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of
    the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated
    in currencies other than the functional currency, including
    U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on those foreign currency
    transactions are included in determining net income or loss for
    the period of exchange. The net effect of foreign currency gains
    and losses was not significant during the fiscal years ended
    September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Segments

The Company discloses certain information about its operating
    segments, which are determined consistent with the way
    management organizes and evaluates financial information
    internally for making operating decisions and assessing
    performance. Management has determined that the Company operated
    in one segment for fiscal 2009 and prior years and will continue
    to evaluate its reporting structure prospectively.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the
    straight-line attribution method for recognizing compensation
    expense. The Company recognized $56.1 million,
    $60.6 million and $41.2 million of stock-based
    compensation expense for the fiscal years ended
    September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of
    September 30, 2009, there was $82.5 million of total
    unrecognized stock-based compensation cost, the majority of
    which will be recognized over the next two years. Going forward,
    stock-based compensation expenses may increase as the Company
    issues additional equity-based awards to continue to attract and
    retain key employees.

The Company issues incentive awards to its employees through
    stock-based compensation consisting of stock options and
    restricted stock units (“RSUs”). On August 3,
    2009, the Company awarded approximately 1.7 million RSUs to
    employees and executive officers pursuant to the Company’s
    annual equity awards program. The value of RSUs is determined
    using the fair value method, which in this case, is based on the
    number of shares granted and the quoted price of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Alternatively,
    in determining the fair value of stock options, the Company uses
    the Black-Scholes option pricing model that employs the
    following key assumptions.

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
    curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company does not
    anticipate declaring dividends in the foreseeable future.
    Expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical
    volatility of the Company’s stock price commensurate with
    the expected life of the option. Expected term of the option is
    based on an evaluation of the historical employee stock option
    exercise behavior, the vesting terms of the respective option
    and a contractual life of ten years. The Company’s stock
    price volatility and option lives involve management’s best
    estimates at that time, both of which impact the fair value of
    the option calculated under the Black-Scholes methodology and,
    ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the life of
    the option. The Company recognizes compensation expense for only
    the portion of options or stock units that are expected to vest.
    Therefore, the Company applies estimated forfeiture rates that
    are derived from historical employee termination behavior. Based
    on historical differences with forfeitures of stock-based awards
    granted to the Company’s executive officers and Board of
    Directors versus grants awarded to all other employees, the
    Company has developed separate forfeiture expectations for these
    two groups. The average estimated forfeiture rate for grants
    awarded to the Company’s executive officers and

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Board of Directors was approximately 4% and the average
    estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other
    employees was approximately 11% in fiscal 2009. If the actual
    number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by
    management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may
    be required in future periods.

In August 2009, the Company granted 420,000 RSUs to certain
    current executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate
    number of RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly
    increments over two years, until such portion of the grant is
    fully vested on August 1, 2011. Twenty-five percent of the
    RSU grant, or a portion thereof, is subject to the Company
    achieving specified quarterly revenue and EBITDA goals during
    the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009
    through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. Fifty percent of
    the quarterly performance stock grant is based on achieving at
    least 80% of the quarterly revenue goal and the other 50% is
    based on achieving at least 80% of the quarterly EBITDA goal.
    The quarterly performance stock grant is paid linearly above 80%
    of the targeted goals. At least 100% of both goals must be
    attained in order for the quarterly performance stock grant to
    be awarded over 100%. Each goal is evaluated individually and
    subject to the 80% achievement threshold and 100%
    over-achievement threshold. The remaining twenty-five percent is
    subject to the Company achieving specified quarterly goals
    during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year
    2010 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, as will be
    set by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of
    Directors.

In August 2008, the Company granted 383,400 RSUs to certain
    current executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate
    number of RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly
    increments over two years, until such portion of the grant is
    fully vested on August 1, 2010. Twenty-five percent of the
    RSU grant, or a portion thereof, was subject to the Company
    achieving specified percentage increases in total revenue during
    the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008
    through the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, relative to the
    same periods in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 (the “2008
    Performance Award”). Approximately half of this twenty-five
    percent was earned in fiscal year 2009. The remaining
    twenty-five percent is subject to the Company achieving
    specified quarterly revenue and EBITDA goals during the period
    beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 through the
    third quarter of fiscal year 2010, as set by the Compensation
    Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.

In August 2007, the Company granted 276,400 RSUs to certain
    current executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate
    number of RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly
    increments over two years, and was fully vested on
    August 1, 2009. Twenty-five percent of the RSU grant was
    subject to the Company achieving specified percentage increases
    in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal year 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal
    year 2008, relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2006 and
    2007 (the “2007 Performance Award”). This twenty-five
    percent was fully earned in fiscal 2008. The remaining
    twenty-five percent was subject to the Company achieving
    specified percentage increases in total revenue during the
    period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008
    through the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, relative to the
    same periods in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Approximately half
    of this twenty-five percent was earned in fiscal 2009.

The Company recognizes compensation costs for awards with
    performance conditions when it concludes it is probable that the
    performance condition will be achieved. The Company reassesses
    the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and
    adjusts compensation costs based on the probability assessment.
    Performance conditions for these awards were not met in the
    second and third fiscal quarters of 2009 and as such, no
    compensation cost was incurred.

Earnings

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
    the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing
    net income by the weighted average number of common and dilutive
    common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC

810-10,

Consolidation — Overall

(“ASC

810-10”),

which amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 to
    establish accounting and reporting standards for the
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. ASC

810-10

is
    effective for the Company’s fiscal years beginning
    October 1, 2009 and the Company does not expect its
    adoption to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC Topic 805,

Business
    Combinations

(“ASC 805”)

,

which establishes
    principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring
    identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed,
    and any noncontrolling interest in an acquisition, at their fair
    value as of the acquisition date. ASC 805 is effective for
    business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
    after October 1, 2009. This standard will change the
    Company’s accounting treatment for business combinations on
    a prospective basis.

In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC

820-10-65,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures —
    Overall — Transition and Open Effective Date
    Information

(“ASC

820-10-65”).

ASC

820-10-65

provides guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets
    and liabilities when the volume and level of activity for the
    asset/liability has significantly decreased. This statement also
    provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a
    transaction is not orderly. In addition, ASC

820-10-65

requires disclosure in interim and annual periods of the inputs
    and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and a
    discussion of changes in valuation techniques. The Company
    adopted the statement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.
    The adoption of ASC

820-10-65

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC

320-10,

Investments — Debt and Equity
    Securities — Overall

(“ASC

320-10”).

This guidance amends the requirements for the recognition and
    measurement of

other-than-temporary

impairments for debt securities by modifying the pre-existing
    “intent and ability” indicator. Under ASC

320-10,

an

other-than-temporary

impairment is triggered when there is an intent to sell the
    security, it is more likely than not that the security will be
    required to be sold before recovery, or the security is not
    expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the
    security. Additionally, this guidance changes the presentation
    of

an

other-than-temporary

impairment in the income statement for those impairments
    involving credit losses. The credit loss component will be
    recognized in earnings and the remainder of the impairment will
    be recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company adopted
    ASC

320-10

in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. The adoption of this
    statement did not impact the Company as there have been no
    credit losses or

other-than-temporary

In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC

825-10-65,

Financial Instruments — Overall —
    Transition and Open Effective Date Information

(“ASC

This guidance requires interim disclosures regarding the fair
    values of financial instruments that are within the scope of ASC

825-10.

Additionally, this guidance requires disclosure of the methods
    and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
    financial instruments on an interim basis as well as changes of
    the methods and significant assumptions from prior periods. The
    Company adopted ASC

820-10-65

in
    the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. The adoption of this
    statement does not change the accounting treatment for these
    financial instruments.

In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC

855-10,

Subsequent Events — Overall

(“ASC

,

which establishes general standards of accounting for and
    disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but
    before financial statements are issued or are available to be
    issued. It requires the disclosure of the date through which an
    entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for
    selecting that date, that is, whether that date represents the
    date the financial statements were issued or were available to
    be issued. The Company adopted ASC

855-10

in
    the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. The adoption of this
    statement did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

ASU

2009-13

requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using
    estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services
    based on a selling price hierarchy. The amendments eliminate the
    residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be
    allocated using the relative selling price method. ASU

2009-14

removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue
    guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software
    deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product
    are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance. ASU

Fair
    Value Measurements

In accordance with the authoritative guidance on fair value
    measurements and disclosure under GAAP, the Company determines
    fair value using a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes
    between market participant assumptions developed based on market
    data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity,
    and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market
    participant assumptions developed based on the best information
    available in the circumstances and expands disclosure about fair
    value measurements.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in our principal or most
    advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date,
    essentially the exit price.

The levels of fair value hierarchy are:

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets and liabilities at the measurement date.



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Level 2:

Observable inputs other than
    quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices
    for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted
    prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in
    markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable
    or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs for which
    there is little or no market data available. These inputs
    reflect management’s assumptions of what market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Level 1 investments are valued based on quoted market
    prices in active markets and include the Company’s cash
    equivalent investments. Level 2 investments, which include
    investments that are valued based on quoted prices in markets
    that are not active, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative
    pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency,
    include the Company’s certificates of deposit, corporate
    bonds and notes, municipal bonds and notes and
    U.S. government securities.

A financial instrument’s level within the fair value
    hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of any input that is
    significant to the fair value measurement. However, the
    determination of what constitutes “observable”
    requires significant judgment by the Company. The Company
    considers observable data to be market data which is readily
    available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and
    verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources
    that are actively involved in the relevant market.

The Company adopted the fair value hierarchy for financial
    assets and liabilities on October 1, 2008, the first day of
    fiscal 2009. The adoption did not have a material effect on the
    consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact on its non-financial assets and
    liabilities, which will be effective at the beginning of fiscal
    year 2010.

Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair

    methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant
    model assumption or input is unobservable. Level 3
    financial assets also include certain investment securities for
    which there is limited market activity such that the
    determination of fair value requires significant judgment or
    estimation. Level 3 investment securities primarily include
    certain ARS for which there was a decrease in the observation of
    market pricing. At September 30, 2009, these securities
    were valued primarily using internal cash flow valuation that
    incorporates transaction details such as contractual terms,
    maturity, timing and amount of future cash flows, as well as
    assumptions about liquidity and credit valuation adjustments of
    marketplace participants at September 30, 2009.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company invests in securities that are rated investment
    grade or better. The unrealized losses on investments for fiscal
    2009 were primarily caused by reductions in the values of the
    ARS due to the illiquid markets and were partially offset by
    unrealized gains related to interest rate decreases.

ARS are variable-rate debt securities. The Company limits its
    investments in ARS to securities that carry an AAA/A- (or
    equivalent) rating from recognized rating agencies and limits
    the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. At the time of
    the Company’s initial investment and at the date of this
    report, all ARS were in compliance with the Company’s
    investment policy. In the past, the auction process allowed
    investors to obtain immediate liquidity if so desired by selling
    the securities at their face amounts. Liquidity for these
    securities has historically been provided by an auction process
    that resets interest rates on these investments on average every
    7-35 days. However, as has been reported in the financial
    press, the disruptions in the credit markets adversely affected
    the auction market for these types of securities.

Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately
    $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS the Company
    held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. The funds
    associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a
    successful auction occurs or a buyer is found outside the
    auction process.

In October 2008, the Company entered into an agreement
    (“the Agreement”) with UBS whereby UBS would purchase
    eligible ARS it sold to the Company prior to February 13,
    2008. Under the terms of the Agreement, and at the
    Company’s discretion, UBS will purchase eligible ARS from
    the Company at par value (“Put Option”) during the
    period of June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. The
    Company expects to sell its eligible ARS under the Agreement.
    However, if the Company does not exercise its rights to sell its
    eligible ARS under the Agreement before July 2, 2012 this
    Put Option will expire and UBS will have no further rights or
    obligations to buy the Company’s ARS. So long as the
    Company holds its ARS, they will continue to accrue interest as
    determined by the auction process or the terms of the ARS if the
    auction process fails. The Company elected to measure the Put
    Option under the fair value option, and recorded a benefit of
    approximately $1.5 million pre-tax for the year ended
    September 30, 2009. These securities were recorded as short
    term at September 30, 2009, as the Company has the option
    to liquidate these securities within the next twelve months. The
    Company transferred these ARS from

available-for-sale

to trading investment securities in the first quarter of fiscal
    2009. As a result of accepting the Put Option and reclassifying
    the ARS from

available-for-sale

to trading investment securities, the Company recognized an

other-than-temporary

impairment loss of approximately $1.5 million pre-tax as of
    September 30, 2009, reflecting a reversal of the related
    unrealized loss that was previously recorded in other
    comprehensive loss. The recording of the fair value of the Put
    Option and the recognition of the

other-than-temporary

impairment loss resulted in no impact to the consolidated income
    statement for year ended September 30, 2009. The Company
    believes that the appropriate presentation of these

available-for-sale

securities of $15.5 million is long-term investments as
    reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
    September 30, 2009, as the Company does not believe it will
    be able to liquidate these securities in the next twelve months.

Business
    Combinations

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for under the
    purchase method of accounting. The total purchase price is
    allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the
    liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The
    excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded
    as goodwill. The fair value assigned to the tangible and
    intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on
    estimates and assumptions provided by management, and other
    information compiled by management, including independent
    valuations, prepared by valuation specialists that utilize
    established valuation techniques appropriate for the technology
    industry. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for
    impairment at least annually.

Fiscal
    Year 2007 Acquisition of Acopia

On September 12, 2007, the Company acquired all of the
    capital stock of Acopia, a privately held Delaware corporation
    headquartered in Lowell, Massachusetts for $207.8 million
    in cash. The Company also incurred $2.2 million of direct
    transaction costs for a total purchase price of approximately
    $210.0 million. Acopia provides high-performance,
    intelligent file virtualization solutions. These solutions are
    complementary to Company’s strategy of optimizing the
    application infrastructure from the core of the datacenter to
    the edge of the network. As a result of the merger, the Company
    acquired all the assets of Acopia, all property, equipment and
    other assets that Acopia used in its business and assumed all
    the liabilities of Acopia. The results of operations of Acopia
    have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements from the date of acquisition.

Of the total estimated purchase price, $15.0 million was
    allocated to developed technology, $14.0 million to
    in-process research and development, $2.1 million to
    customer relationships and $0.4 million to trade name and a
    specific non-compete agreement. To determine the value of the
    developed technology, a combination of cost and market
    approaches were used. The cost approach required an estimation
    of the costs required to reproduce the developed technology. The
    market approach measures the fair value of the technology
    through an analysis of recent comparable transactions. To
    determine the value of customer relationships, the income
    approach was used. The income approach estimates the fair value
    based on the earnings and cash flow capacity of an asset.

Developed technology, customer relationships and trade name will
    be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
    useful life of five years. The non-compete agreement will be
    amortized on a straight-line basis over the thirty-six month
    term of the agreement.

At September 30, 2009, the Company had U.S. net
    operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
    $69.7 million, a portion of which begins to expire in
    fiscal 2022 if not utilized. All U.S. net operating loss
    carry-forwards relate to entities acquired by the Company and
    are limited in use by I.R.C. Sec. 382. At September 30,
    2009, the Company also had net operating loss carry-forwards of
    approximately $15.6 million related to operations in the
    United Kingdom that carry forward indefinitely. At
    September 30, 2009 the Company also had federal research
    and development credit carry-forwards of approximately
    $2.4 million which, if not utilized, will begin to expire
    in 2022 and state research and development and investment credit
    carry-forwards of approximately $1.9 million, which if not
    utilized, may begin to expire in fiscal year 2017. The
    aforementioned credit carry-forwards are limited in use under
    I.R.C. Sec. 383. At September 30, 2008 the Company had
    approximately $80.6 million of net operating loss
    carry-forwards of which approximately $413,000 were related to
    operations in the United Kingdom which carry-forward
    indefinitely. At September 30, 2008, the Company had
    federal research credit and other credit carry-forwards of
    approximately $2.4 million and state research and
    investment credit carry-forwards of approximately
    $1.2 million.

United States income and foreign withholding taxes have not been
    provided on approximately $5.2 million of undistributed
    earnings from the Company’s international subsidiaries. The
    Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability for the
    undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because the
    Company currently does not expect to remit those earnings in the
    foreseeable future. Determination of the amount of unrecognized
    deferred tax liability related to undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries is not practicable because such liability,
    if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when
    remittance occurs.

Several occurrences in fiscal year 2009 are responsible for the
    significant change in the effective tax rate between fiscal year
    2009 and fiscal year 2008. The significant change in the
    effective tax rate between fiscal year 2009 and 2008 was the
    result of the Company deducting for tax purposes compensation
    related to equity awards in a major foreign tax jurisdiction
    effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2009, the
    reinstatement into law on October 3, 2008 retroactive to
    January 1, 2008 of the federal tax credit for increasing
    research activities for qualifying expenditures through
    December 31, 2009 and deductions obtained for U.S. tax
    purposes relative to the cessation of operations of a foreign
    subsidiary in the quarter ending September 30, 2009.

The Company recognizes the financial statement impact of a tax
    position only after determining that the relevant tax authority
    would more likely than not sustain the position following an
    audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not
    threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is
    the largest impact that has a greater than fifty percent
    likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the
    relevant tax authority.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning
    and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal years
    2009 and 2008:

The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties
    (not included in the “unrecognized tax benefits” table
    above) for any uncertain tax positions. This interest and
    penalty expense will be a component of income tax expense. In
    the years ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, the Company
    accrued approximately $193,000 and $146,000, respectively, of
    interest expense related to its liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits. No penalties were recognized in fiscal 2009 or 2008 or
    accrued for at September 30, 2009 and 2008.

All unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the
    effective tax rate. Due to an ongoing audit by the Internal
    Revenue Service it is reasonably possible that the reserves may
    change within the next 12 months.

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to
    U.S. federal income tax as well as the income tax of
    multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has
    concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters for fiscal
    years through September 30, 2005 and is currently under
    examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the fiscal years
    ended September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2008. Major
    jurisdictions where there are wholly owned subsidiaries of F5
    Networks, Inc. which require income tax filings include the
    United Kingdom, Japan, Australia and Germany. Periods open for
    review by local taxing authorities are fiscal years 2006, 2003,
    2004 and 2003 for the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia and
    Germany, respectively. Within the next four fiscal quarters, the
    statute of limitations will begin to close on the fiscal years
    ended 2005 and 2006 tax returns filed in various states and the
    fiscal year ended 2006 federal income tax return.

    Incentive Plans

In fiscal 2005, the Company modified the method in which it
    issues incentive awards to its employees through stock-based
    compensation. In prior years, stock-based compensation consisted
    only of stock options. Beginning in 2005, the majority of awards
    consisted of restricted stock unit awards and to a lesser degree
    stock options. Employees vest in restricted stock units and
    stock options ratably over the corresponding service term,
    generally one to four years. The Company’s stock options
    expire 10 years from the date of grant. Restricted stock
    units are payable in shares of the Company’s common stock
    as the periodic vesting requirements are satisfied. The value of
    a restricted stock unit is based upon the fair market value of
    the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The value
    of restricted stock units is determined using the intrinsic
    value method and is based on the number of shares granted and
    the quoted price of the Company’s common stock on the date
    of grant. Alternatively, the Company uses the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock
    options. Compensation expense related to restricted stock units
    and

stock options is recognized over the vesting period. The Company
    has adopted a number of stock-based compensation plans as
    discussed below.

1998 Equity Incentive Plan.

In November 1998,
    the Company adopted the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 1998
    Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of non-qualified
    and incentive stock options, stock purchase awards and stock
    bonuses for employees and other service providers. The 1998 Plan
    expired on November 11, 2008. Upon certain changes in
    control of the Company, all outstanding and unvested options or
    stock awards under the 1998 Plan will vest at the rate of 50%,
    unless assumed or substituted by the acquiring entity. During
    the fiscal years 2009 and 2008, the Company issued no stock
    options, stock purchase awards or stock bonuses under this plan.
    As of September 30, 2009, there were options to purchase
    562,261 shares outstanding, no unvested stock bonuses, and
    no shares available for awards under the 1998 Plan.

1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

In May
    1999, the board of directors approved the adoption of the 1999
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan. A total of 6,000,000 shares of common stock have been
    reserved for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
    The Employee Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to
    acquire shares of the Company’s common stock through
    periodic payroll deductions of up to 15% of base compensation.
    No employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock,
    determined at the fair market value of the shares at the time
    such option is granted, in one calendar year. The Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan has been implemented in a series of offering
    periods, each 6 months in duration. The price at which the
    common stock may be purchased is 85% of the lesser of the fair
    market value of the Company’s common stock on the first day
    of the applicable offering period or on the last day of the
    respective purchase period. As of September 30, 2009 there
    were 2,432,528 shares available for awards under the
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

2000 Equity Incentive Plan.

In July 2000, the
    Company adopted the 2000 Employee Equity Incentive Plan, or the
    2000 Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of
    non-qualified stock options, stock purchase awards and stock
    bonuses for non-executive employees and other service providers.
    A total of 7,000,000 shares of common stock have been
    reserved for issuance under the 2000 Plan. Upon certain changes
    in control of the Company, all outstanding and unvested options
    or stock awards under the 2000 Plan will vest at the rate of
    50%, unless assumed or substituted by the acquiring entity. As
    of September 30, 2009, there were options to purchase
    490,455 shares outstanding and no shares available for
    awards under the 2000 Plan. The Company terminated the 2000 Plan
    effective November 1, 2008 and no additional shares may be
    issued from the 2000 Plan.

New Hire Incentive Plans.

In August 2004, the
    Company adopted a non-qualified stock option plan, or the
    Triebes Plan, in connection with the hiring of Karl Triebes, the
    Company’s Senior Vice President of Product Development and
    Chief Technical Officer. The Triebes Plan provided for a grant
    of 600,000 non-qualified stock options for Mr. Triebes. As
    of September 30, 2009, there were options to purchase
    113,000 shares outstanding and no shares available for
    awards under the Triebes Plan. Upon certain changes in control
    of the Company, 100% of all outstanding and unvested options
    remaining under the Triebes Plan will vest and become
    immediately exercisable.

Acquisition Incentive Plans.

In July 2003, the
    Company adopted the uRoam Acquisition Equity Incentive Plan, or
    the uRoam Plan, in connection with the hiring of the former
    employees of uRoam, Inc. A total of 500,000 shares of
    common stock were reserved for issuance under the uRoam Plan.
    The plan provided for discretionary grants of non-qualified and
    incentive stock options, stock purchase awards and stock
    bonuses. The Company has not granted any stock purchase awards
    or stock bonuses under this plan. As of September 30, 2009
    there were options to purchase 21,330 shares outstanding
    and no shares available for awards under the uRoam Plan.

In July 2004, the Company adopted the MagniFire Acquisition
    Equity Incentive Plan, or the MagniFire Plan, in connection with
    the hiring of the former employees of MagniFire Websystems, Inc.
    A total of

    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

830,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance
    under the MagniFire Plan. The plan provides for discretionary
    grants of non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock
    purchase awards and stock bonuses. The Company has not granted
    any stock purchase awards or stock bonuses under this plan. As
    of September 30, 2009 there were options to purchase
    32,798 shares outstanding and no shares available for
    awards under the MagniFire Plan.

Options that expire under the uRoam Plan or the MagniFire Plan,
    whether due to termination of employment or otherwise, are not
    available for future grant.

In August 2007, the Company adopted the 2007 Acopia Acquisition
    Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2007 Acopia Plan. The 2007 Acopia
    Plan provides for discretionary grants of non-statutory stock
    options and stock units for employees, directors and consultant
    of Acopia to whom the Company offers employment in connection
    with the Company’s acquisition of Acopia. A total of
    600,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for
    issuance under the 2007 Acopia Plan. Upon certain changes in
    control of the Company, the surviving entity will either assume
    or substitute all outstanding Stock Awards under the 2007 Acopia
    Plan. During the fiscal year 2009, the Company issued no stock
    options or stock units under the 2007 Acopia Plan. As of
    September 30, 2009, there were no stock options outstanding
    and no shares available for awards under the 2007 Acopia Plan.
    The Company terminated the 2007 Acopia Plan effective
    November 1, 2008 and no additional shares may be issued
    from the 2007 Acopia Plan.

In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Acopia, the
    Company assumed the Acopia 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, or the
    Acopia Plan. Unvested options to acquire Acopia’s common
    stock were converted into options to acquire the Company’s
    common stock in connection with the acquisition. A total of
    2,230,703 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance
    under the Acopia Plan. The plan provides for discretionary
    grants of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted
    stock awards and other stock-based awards to persons who were
    employees, officers, directors, consultants or advisors to
    Acopia on or prior to September 12, 2007. During the fiscal
    year 2009, the Company issued no stock options or stock units
    under the Acopia Plan. As of September 30, 2009, there were
    options to purchase 139,147 shares outstanding and no
    shares available for awards under the Acopia Plan. The Company
    terminated the Acopia Plan effective November 1, 2008 and
    no additional shares may be issued from the Acopia Plan.

2005 Equity Incentive Plan.

In December 2004,
    the Company adopted the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2005
    Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of non-statutory
    stock options and stock units for employees, including officers,
    and other service providers. A total of 12,400,000 shares
    of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2005
    Plan. Upon certain changes in control of the Company, the
    surviving entity will either assume or substitute all
    outstanding Stock Awards under the 2005 Plan. During the fiscal
    year 2009, the Company issued no stock options and 1,892,582
    stock units under the 2005 Plan. As of September 30, 2009,
    there were options to purchase 60,000 shares outstanding
    and 5,193,620 shares available for awards under the 2005
    Plan.

A majority of the restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2009,
    2008 and 2007 vest quarterly over a two-year period. The
    restricted stock units were granted during fiscal 2009, 2008 and
    2007 with a per-share weighted average fair value of $36.31,
    $30.47 and $40.98, respectively. Restricted stock units were
    granted during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 with a per
    share weighted average fair value of $22.30. The fair value of
    restricted stock vested during fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007
    was $41.0 million, $36.5 million and
    $45.3 million, respectively.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Operating
    Leases

The majority of the Company’s operating lease payments
    relate to the Company’s three building corporate
    headquarters in Seattle, Washington. The lease on the first and
    second buildings commenced in July and October of 2000. The
    lease for both buildings expires in 2012 with an option for
    renewal. The second building has been partially subleased
    through 2012. The lease on the third building commenced in June
    2008 and will expire in 2018. The Company also leases additional
    office space for product development and sales and support
    personnel in the United States and internationally.

In October 2006, the Company entered into an office lease
    agreement to lease a total of approximately 137,000 square
    feet of office space in a building known as 333 Elliott West,
    which is adjacent to the three buildings that serve as the
    Company’s corporate headquarters. The lease expires in
    2018. During 2008, the Company entered into two separate
    sublease agreements to sublease approximately
    112,500 square feet of building 333 Elliott West. These
    sublease terms expire in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

Purchase
    Obligations

Purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with
    our contract manufacturers. The agreement with our primary
    contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory
    on our behalf based on our production forecast. We are obligated
    to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer
    procures in accordance with the forecast, unless cancellation is
    given within applicable lead times. As of September 30,
    2009, our purchase obligations were $15.5 million.

Litigation

Derivative Suits.

Beginning on or about
    May 24, 2006, several derivative actions were filed against
    certain current and former directors and officers of the
    Company. These derivative lawsuits were filed in: (1) the
    Superior Court of King County, Washington, as In re F5 Networks,
    Inc. State Court Derivative Litigation (Case

No. 06-2-17195-1

SEA), which consolidates Adams v. Amdahl, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-17195-1

No. 06-2-19159-5

SEA), and Sommer v. McAdam, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-26248-4

SEA) (the “State Court Derivative Litigation”); and
    (2) the U.S. District Court for the Western District
    of Washington, as In re F5 Networks, Inc. Derivative Litigation,
    Master File

No. C06-0794RSL,

which consolidates Hutton v. McAdam, et al. (Case

No. 06-794RSL),

Locals 302 and 612 of the International Union of Operating
    Engineers-Employers Construction Industry Retirement
    Trust v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1057RSL),

and Easton v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1145RSL)(the

“Federal Court Derivative Litigation”). On
    August 2, 2007, another derivative lawsuit, Barone v.
    McAdam et al. (Case

No. C07-1200P),

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
    District of Washington. It is expected that this lawsuit will be
    consolidated with the other lawsuits pending in the
    U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.
    The complaints generally allege that certain of the
    Company’s current and former directors and officers,
    including, in general, each of the Company’s current
    outside directors (other than Deborah L. Bevier and Scott
    Thompson who joined the Company’s Board of Directors in
    July 2006 and January 2008, respectively) breached their
    fiduciary duties to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful
    conduct concerning the manipulation of certain stock option
    grant dates. The Company is named solely as a nominal defendant
    against whom the plaintiffs seek no recovery. The Company’s
    combined motion to consolidate and stay the State Court
    Derivative Litigation was granted in a court order dated
    April 3, 2007. The Company’s motion to dismiss the
    consolidated federal derivative actions based on
    plaintiffs’ failure to make demand on the Company’s
    Board of Directors prior to filing suit was granted in a court
    order dated August 6, 2007 with leave to amend the
    allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint. Plaintiffs filed an
    amended consolidated federal derivative action complaint on
    September 14, 2007. The Company filed a motion to dismiss
    the amended complaint based on plaintiff’s failure to make
    demand on the Company’s Board of

Directors prior to filing suit. On July 3, 2008, before
    ruling on the Company’s pending dismissal motion, the
    federal court entered an order certifying certain issues of
    Washington state law to the Washington Supreme Court for
    resolution. On May 21, 2009, the Washington Supreme Court
    issued its opinion on the certified issues. The Company’s
    dismissal motion remains pending before the federal court as the
    Company intends to continue to vigorously pursue dismissal of
    the derivative actions.

SEC and Department of Justice Inquiries.

In
    May 2006, the Company received notice from both the SEC and the
    Department of Justice that they were conducting informal
    inquiries into the Company’s historical stock option
    practices. The Company has fully cooperated with both agencies.
    Considerable legal and accounting expenses related to the
    Company’s historical stock option practices have been
    incurred to date. The Company may in the future be subject to
    additional regulatory proceedings or actions arising in relation
    to its historical stock option practices and the restatement of
    its prior period financial statements. Although regulatory
    proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, the Company
    does not believe the results of any pending actions will,
    individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact
    its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

The Company is not aware of any pending legal proceedings other
    than those mentioned above that, individually or in the
    aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business, operating results, or financial
    condition. The Company may in the future be party to litigation
    arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims
    that we allegedly infringe upon third-party trademarks or other
    intellectual property rights. Such claims, even if not
    meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant
    financial and managerial resources.

Restructuring
    Charges

In January 2009, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to
    reduce its operating expenses which included the consolidation
    of facilities, accelerated depreciation on tenant improvements
    and a reduction in workforce. These initiatives are intended to
    conserve or generate cash in response to the uncertainties
    associated with the recent deterioration in the global economy.
    As a result of these initiatives, the Company recorded a
    restructuring charge of $4.3 million in the second quarter
    of fiscal 2009. As of September 30, 2009, there was
    $0.6 million in accrued expenses that will offset futures
    lease payments through September 2012.

Facility
    Exit and Sublease Agreements

During fiscal year 2008, the Company exited a research and
    development facility in Bellevue, Washington for which it has
    remaining operating lease obligations through 2014. In addition,
    the Company consolidated its corporate headquarters, partially
    subleasing the building located at 333 Elliott Avenue West in
    Seattle, Washington for which it has remaining operating lease
    obligations through 2018. As a result of the expected loss on
    the facility exit and sublease agreements, the Company recorded
    a charge of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2008.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company has a 401(k) savings plan whereby eligible employees
    may voluntarily contribute a percentage of their compensation.
    The Company may, at its discretion, match a portion of the
    employees’ eligible contributions. Contributions by the
    Company to the plan during the years ended September 30,
    2009, 2008, and 2007 were approximately $3.3 million,
    $3.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively.

Geographic
    Sales and Significant Customers

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
    for which separate financial information is available and
    evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or
    decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and
    in assessing performance. For fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    the Company was organized as, and operated in, one reportable
    segment: the development, marketing and sale of application
    delivery networking products that optimize the security,
    performance and availability of network applications, servers
    and storage systems. The Company manages its business based on
    four geographic regions: the Americas (primarily the United
    States); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and
    the Asia Pacific region (APAC). The Company’s chief
    operating decision-making group reviews financial information
    presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by information
    about revenues by geographic region. The Company’s foreign
    offices conduct sales, marketing and support activities.
    Management evaluates performance based primarily on revenues in
    the geographic locations in which the Company operates. Revenues
    are attributed by geographic location based on the location of
    the customer. The Company’s assets are primarily located in
    the United States and not allocated to any specific region.
    Therefore, geographic information is presented only for net
    product revenue.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that
    required information is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the required timeframe, as specified in the
    rules set forth by the Securities Exchange Commission. Our
    disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
    that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and
    communicated to management, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosures.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, evaluated the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
    September 30, 2009 and, based on this evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer have concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
    September 30, 2009.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
    absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
    because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over
    financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence
    and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and
    breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over
    financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or
    improper management override. Because of such limitations, there
    is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or
    detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
    reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known
    features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is
    possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
    not eliminate, this risk.

Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    September 30, 2009. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control
    — Integrated Framework

. Based on the results of
    this assessment and on those criteria, management concluded that
    our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
    of September 30, 2009.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of September 30, 2009 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
    herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During the fourth fiscal quarter, there were no changes to our
    internal control over financial reporting that materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal controls over financial reporting.

Item 9B.

    Information
