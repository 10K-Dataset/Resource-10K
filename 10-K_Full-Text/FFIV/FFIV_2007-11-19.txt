Item 1.

Business

General

F5 Networks is a leading provider of technology that optimizes
    the delivery of network-based applications and the performance
    and availability of servers, data storage devices and other
    network resources.

Founded in 1996, F5 pioneered load-balancing technology that
    distributes internet traffic evenly across multiple web servers,
    making them look like a single server. Today, our BIG-IP
    application delivery controllers sit in front of web and
    application servers, balancing traffic and performing
    compute-intensive functions such as encrypting and unencrypting
    transmissions, screening traffic for security threats,
    maintaining open connections with servers, speeding the flow of
    traffic and a variety of other functions that improve the
    performance, availability and security of applications and would
    otherwise be performed by the servers themselves. By offloading
    functions from servers, BIG-IP makes servers more efficient and
    reduces the number of servers needed to run specific
    applications. BIG-IP also supports software modules that manage
    the flow of traffic between multiple data centers and across
    multiple service provider connections, ensuring that it is
    always routed to the most available resource. In addition, we
    offer complementary products that provide secure remote access
    to corporate networks and optimize the delivery of applications
    over wide-area networks.

We believe our application delivery controllers and related
    products are superior to competing technology in both
    functionality and performance. The core of these products is our
    full-proxy Traffic Management



Operating System (TMOS) that enables them to inspect and modify
    traffic flows to and from servers at network speed and supports
    a broad array of functions that enhance the speed, performance
    and availability of applications. iRules, a scripting language
    based on TCL (Tools Command Language), is a unique feature of
    TMOS that enables customers and third parties to write
    customized rules to inspect and modify traffic. TMOS also
    supports a common software interface called iControl, which
    enables our products to communicate with one another and with
    third-party products, including custom and commercial enterprise
    applications. TMOS is designed to support the addition of new
    functionality as software modules and to exploit the
    performance-enhancing features of our purpose-built hardware
    platforms. Correspondingly, our hardware architecture integrates
    industry standard components with our own custom Packet Velocity
    ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) in ways that
    exploit the unique features and characteristics of TMOS to
    deliver performance that is demonstrably superior to competing
    products.

In September 2007, we acquired Acopia Networks, Inc.,
    (“Acopia”) a leading provider of storage
    virtualization technology. Just as our application delivery
    controllers make many servers look like one, Acopia’s ARX
    products sit in front of networked attached storage (NAS),
    making multiple storage devices from different vendors look like
    a single device to the individual clients, servers and
    applications that use them. This frees users and storage
    administrators from the time-consuming task of mapping
    individual drives to specific clients and applications. In
    addition, Acopia products simplify the migration of data between
    storage devices, the addition of new storage devices, and the
    distribution of data across tiers of storage that reflect the
    relative importance or immediacy of the data.

In connection with our products, we offer a broad range of
    services including consulting, training, installation,
    maintenance and other technical support services.

F5 Networks was incorporated on February 26, 1996 in the
    State of Washington. Our headquarters is in Seattle, Washington
    and our mailing address is 401 Elliott Avenue West, Seattle,
    Washington 98119. The telephone number at our executive offices
    is

(206) 272-5555.

We have subsidiaries or branch offices in Australia, Canada,
    China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Malaysia,
    Northern Ireland, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,
    Thailand and the United Kingdom. Our annual reports on

Industry
    Background

Growth of
    IP Networks

Internet Protocol (IP) is a communications language used to
    transmit data over the Internet. Since the late 1990s,
    businesses have responded to the power, flexibility and
    efficiency of the Internet by deploying new

IP-based

applications, upgrading their client-server applications to new

IP-enabled

versions, and enabling existing or legacy applications for use
    over the Internet. At the same time, organizations have become
    more geographically dispersed, and increasingly mobile
    workforces depend on access to corporate applications and data
    from remote locations and a variety of client devices such as
    cellular telephones, personal digital assistants and notebook
    computers.

Over the next several years, we believe these trends will
    accelerate as more organizations discover the benefits of

IP-enabled

applications. In addition, we believe the growth of Internet
    usage will continue to be driven by new applications, such as
    Web Services and Voice over IP, and the growth of broadband
    Internet access.

In conjunction with the growth of Internet traffic, the
    proliferation of data and, in particular, unstructured data such
    as voice, video, images, email, spreadsheets and formatted text
    files, presents an enormous and increasing challenge to IT
    organizations. In addition to unstructured data that is
    business-critical and must be retained and readily accessible to
    individuals and applications, new regulations mandate that
    company email, web pages and other files must be retained
    indefinitely. In response to this challenge, IT organizations
    spend an increasing amount of their budget on NAS and other
    types of storage systems.



Trend
    Toward Virtualization

From a broad perspective, the goal of IT organizations is to
    optimize the secure delivery of applications and data to users
    wherever they are and whenever they need them. To achieve this
    goal, organizations are embracing virtualization technologies
    that enable them to group or partition data center resources to
    meet user demand and reconfigure these virtual resources easily
    and quickly as demand changes. Server virtualization, which
    allows organizations to improve utilization of physical servers
    by partitioning them into multiple virtual servers, is well
    known and widely deployed. Application delivery controllers free
    up server space by offloading common functions, such as
    encryption and compression from multiple physical or virtual
    servers, and dynamically manage the flow of traffic between
    users and servers, making them look like a single resource to
    the user. Sitting in front of storage systems, file
    virtualization devices perform functions similar to application
    delivery controllers, presenting the appearance of a single
    resource to users and applications and dynamically managing the
    transfer of files between users and applications and multiple
    storage devices.

Application
    Delivery Networking

Internet traffic passing between client devices and servers is
    divided into discrete packets which travel by multiple routes to
    their destination where they are reassembled. The disassembly,
    routing, and reassembly of transmissions are relatively
    straightforward and require little intelligence. By contrast,
    application delivery networking — managing,
    inspecting, modifying and redirecting application traffic going
    to and from servers — requires intelligent systems
    capable of performing a broad array of functions.

Basic application delivery networking (ADN) functions include
    load-balancing (distributing traffic across multiple servers
    while making them appear to be a single server), and
    health-checking (monitoring the performance of servers and
    applications to ensure that they are working properly before
    routing traffic to them). In addition, ADN encompasses a growing
    number of functions that have typically been performed by the
    server or the application itself, or by point solutions running
    on separate devices. This category includes a growing number of
    functions, such as the following:

•

SSL Acceleration — using Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
    encryption to secure traffic between the server and the browser
    on an end user’s client device;

•

Rate Shaping — prioritizing transmissions according to
    preset rules that give precedence to different types of traffic;

•

Compression — reducing the volume of data transmitted
    to take maximum advantage of available bandwidth;

•

TCP Optimization — improving server efficiency by
    maintaining an open connection with a server during interactive
    sessions;

•

IPv6 Translation — enabling communication and
    interoperability between networked devices using IPv6, the
    newest version of the Internet Protocol, and those using the
    older version IPv4;

•

Application Security — protecting critical web
    applications from attacks such as Google hacking, cross-site
    scripting, and parameter tampering;

•

Web Acceleration — enhancing the performance of web
    applications over wide area networks by reducing latency,
    eliminating errors, and resolving other issues that slow
    delivery;

•

WAN Optimization — improving the performance of
    applications accessed over wide area network links by reducing
    the number of round trips required and ensuring maximum use of
    available bandwidth.

•

Global Traffic Management — ensuring high
    availability, maximum performance and global management for
    applications running across multiple, globally-dispersed data
    centers;

•

Link Load Balancing — monitoring availability and
    performance of multiple WAN connections and intelligently
    managing bi-directional traffic flows to ensure uninterrupted,
    optimized Internet access.



Since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not
    thousands — of servers and applications, it isn’t
    practical to replicate these functions on each server or build
    them into the applications themselves. Even if it were,
    maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the net result would
    be a negative impact on the overall performance of servers and
    applications. Deploying point solutions in the network
    eliminates those problems but creates a new set of challenges.
    Using point solutions from multiple vendors can create
    interoperability issues, and problems that do occur can be
    difficult to troubleshoot. From a security standpoint, it is
    also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through
    multiple devices. As a result, enterprise customers are
    increasingly demanding products that integrate ADN functions on
    a single platform.

File
    Virtualization

Along with other types of IP traffic, file-based information
    created and accessed by Internet users and network applications
    is growing significantly. According to some estimates, the
    volume of unstructured files is expected to triple annually over
    the next several years. The challenge of storing and managing
    unstructured files is becoming increasingly costly and complex,
    and reducing the cost and complexity is rapidly moving up the
    list of data center priorities.

In many large organizations whose employees are geographically
    dispersed, unstructured data is stored on local file servers,
    which are difficult to manage, costly to maintain and generally
    underutilized. Information on these devices is easy for local
    users to access but often inaccessible to others in the
    organization. To reduce the cost, complexity, and redundancy of
    dispersed file systems, many IT organizations are consolidating
    file storage on centralized NAS devices and other types of
    storage systems. Migrating and consolidating files is difficult
    and time-consuming, however, and centralized storage systems
    pose a different set of problems.

Centralized storage of files can slow access for remote users
    and applications, spurring interest in technology that can speed
    the transfer of files across wide area networks (WANs). In
    addition, only users and applications that are physically mapped
    to a specific drive can store and access data on that drive. As
    the drive fills up, files must be moved manually to a new drive
    and affected users and applications must be remapped to that
    drive. In large organizations, this often constitutes a
    round-the-clock chore for many highly-skilled employees.

Another major storage problem stems from the fact that all files
    are not created equal. Many businesses and other organizations
    have policies or other obligations to retain email and other
    files, increasing the volume of data to archive and, in some
    cases, to keep indefinitely. Since it is unlikely that these
    files will be accessed frequently, if at all, in the course of
    normal business, it makes little sense to store them on
    expensive, high-performance systems designed to provide
    immediate access to business-critical information. As a result,
    IT organizations are beginning to deploy tiers of storage
    systems that match cost, capacity, and performance to the type
    of information being stored, how frequently it is accessed, and
    its relative importance to the business. Often, the most
    cost-effective solution is a combination of storage systems from
    different vendors, an approach that typically entails migrating
    huge amounts of data between incompatible devices. Once that is
    completed, organizations face the challenge of automating the
    tiering process and the management of aging files.

Whether or not they deploy tiered file systems, many
    organizations are beginning to address the mounting cost in time
    and resources of backing up data stored on employee desktops,
    local file servers, and other devices. According to some
    estimates, approximately 80% of the files organizations back up
    have not changed since the previous

back-up.

Worse yet, a large and growing percentage are music and video
    files, family photographs, and other personal files.

Responding to increasing demand from IT organizations, a number
    of storage vendors and a handful of other companies offer
    solutions that address some or all of these issues and can be
    loosely grouped under the heading of file virtualization.
    Collectively, these solutions encompass a variety of
    technological approaches designed to optimize and simplify the
    storage of unstructured data.



F5
    Solutions

Application
    Delivery Networking

F5 is a leading provider of application delivery networking
    products that ensure the security, optimization and availability
    of applications for any user, anywhere. We believe our products
    offer the most intelligent architecture and advanced
    functionality in the marketplace along with performance,
    flexibility and usability features that help organizations
    improve the way they serve their employees, customers, and
    partners while lowering operational costs.

Software Based Products.

From inception, we
    have been committed to the belief that the complexity of
    application-level processing requires the flexibility of a
    software-based solution. We believe our modular software
    architecture enables us to deliver the broadest range of
    integrated functionality in the market and facilitates the
    addition and integration of new functionality. We also believe
    that integrating our software with commodity hardware components
    enables us to build products that deliver superior performance,
    functionality and flexibility at competitive prices.

Full Proxy Architecture.

The core of our
    software technology is the Traffic Management Operating System
    (TMOS) introduced in September 2004 as part of BIG-IP version 9.
    We believe this is a major enhancement of our previous
    technology that enables our products to deliver functionality
    that is superior on many levels to any other application
    delivery networking product in the market. With TMOS, our
    products can inspect, modify and direct both inbound and
    outbound traffic flows across multiple packets. This ability to
    manage application traffic to and from servers adds value to
    applications that pass through our devices in ways that are not
    possible with other application delivery networking solutions.

Modular Functionality.

In addition to its full
    proxy architecture, TMOS is specifically designed to facilitate
    the development and integration of application delivery
    networking functions as modules that can be added to
    BIG-IP’s core functionality to keep pace with rapidly
    evolving customer needs. Add-on modules currently available with
    BIG-IP include: Intelligent Compression; SSL Acceleration; Rate
    Shaping; Advanced Client Authentication; IPv6 Gateway; Caching;
    and others. We also offer Application Security Manager (ASM),
    Global Traffic Manager (GTM), Link Controller, and
    WebAccelerator as software modules on BIG-IP.

Application Awareness.

The open architecture
    of TMOS includes an application programming interface (API)
    called iControl that allows our products to communicate with one
    another and with third-party software and devices. Through this
    unique feature, third-party applications and network devices can
    take an active role in shaping IP network traffic, directing
    traffic based on exact business requirements defined by our
    customers and solutions partners and tailored to specific
    applications. This “application awareness” capability
    is one of the most important features of our software-based
    products and further differentiates our solutions from those of
    our competitors.

Adaptive Intelligence.

The full-proxy
    capabilities of TMOS enable it to inspect or “read”
    the entire contents of a transmission across multiple packets
    and identify specific elements of that transmission, including
    items such as names, dates, and any type of number or label. By
    taking advantage of our unique scripting capability, based on
    Tool Command Language (TCL), customers can use those elements as
    variables to create iRules that modify the content and direct
    the flow of traffic in ways tailored to the dynamic needs of
    their applications. iRules is a unique feature of TMOS that
    gives our products flexibility unmatched by competing products.

Integrated Application Layer Solutions.

The
    combination of our full proxy architecture and enhanced iRules
    enables BIG-IP to intercept, inspect and act on the contents of
    traffic from virtually every type of

IP-enabled

application. In addition, the modularity of the TMOS
    architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions
    that secure, optimize and ensure the availability of
    applications and the networks they run on.

Data
    Solutions

With the acquisition of Acopia Networks in September 2007, we
    expanded our offerings to include intelligent file
    virtualization solutions which address many of the problems
    associated with managing today’s



rapidly expanding file storage infrastructure. Acopia’s ARX
    product family represents a unique set of capabilities that
    optimize the performance and utilization of NAS storage systems.

Non-disruptive Data Migration.

ARX automates
    the movement of files between heterogeneous storage devices
    without affecting access and without requiring client
    reconfiguration. Enterprises can perform seamless
    hardware & software upgrades on file storage
    platforms, server consolidation, even vendor switches, all
    during business hours.

Automated Storage Tiering.

ARX automates the
    movement of data between tiers of storage, and the placement of
    data on appropriate tiers of storage, irrespective of platform
    or vendor. Organizations can lower the cost of storage and
    shrink backup and recovery windows by automatically placing data
    on appropriate storage devices without affecting access to the
    data.

Dynamic Load Balancing.

ARX dynamically
    distributes application workload across multiple file storage
    devices, eliminating “hotspots” or bottlenecks.
    Companies can improve application performance and increase
    productivity using the infrastructure that is already in place.

Efficient Data Replication.

ARX provides the
    ability to replicate files between heterogeneous storage
    platforms for efficient and cost effective disaster recovery and
    centralized backup applications.

Strategy

Our objective is to lead the industry in delivering the enabling
    architectures that integrate IP networks with applications and
    data. Integration allows organizations to improve costly and
    time consuming business processes and develop new sources of
    revenue through highly differentiated offerings. Key components
    of our strategy include:

Offering
    a complete, integrated application delivery product
    suite.

Since the introduction of our TMOS architecture for application
    delivery networking, we have developed TMOS-based versions of
    our own legacy products, such as GTM and Link Controller, and
    acquired technology, including Application Security Manager,
    WebAccelerator, and WANJet. We are currently developing a
    TMOS-based version of FirePass, which we plan to release in
    early calendar year 2008. In fiscal 2007, we also introduced
    Message Security Module, a third-party reputation-based,
    anti-spam solution that runs on TMOS and is available as an
    add-on module to BIG-IP LTM. We believe this approach sharply
    differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings
    and provide customers with an expanding array of integrated
    application delivery networking solutions that can be customized
    to meet their specific needs.

Investing
    in technology to continue to meet customer needs.

We continue to invest in research and development to provide our
    customers with comprehensive, integrated solutions. In
    application delivery networking, our product development efforts
    leverage the unique attributes of our software-based platforms
    to deliver new features and functions that address the complex
    and changing needs of our customers. Our acquisition of Acopia
    and our planned investments in ARX devices are aimed at
    providing data solutions to the complex challenge of efficiently
    storing and managing the huge and growing volume of unstructured
    files created by network users and applications. For both our
    application delivery networking and file virtualization
    products, development of high-performance, proprietary hardware
    is a key component of our investment strategy. In developing
    these products, we will continue to use commodity hardware in
    order to ensure performance and cost competitiveness.

Enhancing
    channel sales and distribution model.

We continue to invest significant resources in developing and
    expanding our indirect sales and distribution channels by
    cultivating our relationships with our existing partners and
    actively developing new relationships. Our efforts to recruit
    new partners are aimed primarily at large value-added resellers,
    systems integrators, and industry-leading systems manufacturers.
    We are also recruiting new channel partners and leveraging our
    existing channels to sell our WAN optimization and file
    virtualization products.



Continuing
    to build and expand relationships with strategic technology
    partners.

To compete successfully against Cisco and other large
    competitors who have an established presence in our target
    accounts, we have developed strategic technology partnerships
    with enterprise software vendors, such as Microsoft, Oracle and
    SAP, who also have an established presence in those accounts. By
    taking advantage of our open application programming interface,
    called iControl, these vendors can enable their applications to
    control our products in the network, enhancing overall
    application performance. In addition, we have worked closely
    with several of these vendors to develop configurations of our
    products, called application ready networks, that are
    specifically tuned to simplify deployment and optimize the
    performance of their applications. In return, these vendors
    provide us significant leverage in the selling process by
    recommending our products to their customers. We plan to
    continue building on our existing relationships and to extend
    our competitive edge by developing new relationships with other
    strategic partners.

Leveraging
    DevCentral, our online community of network architects and
    developers.

Customization of our products using iRules enhances their
    “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems
    in both their applications and their networks that would be
    difficult if not impossible to solve by other means. To promote
    the use of iRules, we host an online community where network
    architects and developers can discuss and share the ways in
    which they use iRules to solve problems and enhance the
    security, performance and availability of applications. A
    corollary benefit is that many of the iRules solutions posted by
    DevCentral participants have become standard features in new
    releases of TMOS.

Enhancing
    our brand.

We plan to continue building awareness of F5 as a leading
    provider of application delivery networking products that
    optimize the security, performance and availability of network
    applications, servers and storage systems. Our goal is to make
    the F5 brand synonymous with superior technology, high-quality
    customer service and ease of use.

Products

Our core technology is software for application delivery
    networking, including application security, secure remote
    access, and WAN optimization. With the acquisition of Acopia, we
    have added complementary file virtualization technology.

All of our products, including the ARX family, are systems that
    integrate our software with purpose-built hardware that combines
    commodity components with our custom ASICs. Our BIG-IP product
    family, which represents the bulk of our sales, supports a
    growing number of features and functions as software
    modules — including GTM (Global Traffic Manager, Link
    Controller, ASM (Application Security Manager) and
    WebAccelerator. We also sell FirePass, WANJet and WebAccelerator
    as separate, stand-alone appliances.

BIG-IP

Products in our family of BIG-IP application delivery
    controllers differ primarily in the hardware configurations that
    make up each system. Our current BIG-IP systems include five
    hardware platforms: high-end (BIG-IP 8800 and 8400), mid-range
    (BIG-IP 6800, 6400 and 3400), and an entry-level (BIG-IP 1500).
    Each system uses one or more CPUs for application-level
    processing, and all but the entry-level systems come equipped
    with our own proprietary Packet Velocity ASIC for
    high-performance packet assembly and disassembly; commodity
    switch fabric for connectivity; and commodity ASICs for SSL
    encryption and decryption and for compression. In addition to
    local area traffic management, which is standard on every
    system, BIG-IP supports a growing number of add-on software
    products and features. Software products currently available on
    BIG-IP include GTM, Link Controller, ASM, and WebAccelerator.
    Available features include intelligent compression, L7 rate
    shaping, iPv6 gateway, advanced client authentication, SSL
    acceleration, advanced routing and fast caching.



FirePass

FirePass appliances provide SSL VPN access for remote users of
    IP networks and any applications connected to those networks
    from any standard Web browser on any device. The components of
    FirePass include a dynamic policy engine, which manages user
    authentication and authorization privileges, and special
    components that enable corporations to give remote users
    controlled access to the full array of applications and
    resources within the network. FirePass also supports Application
    Ready Access, providing full reverse-proxy services for
    market-leading application portals including those of SAP,
    Oracle, Microsoft, and others.

Currently, we sell three FirePass products: The FirePass
    1200 appliance is designed for small to medium enterprises and
    Branch Offices and supports from 10 to 100 concurrent users. The
    FirePass 4100 controller is designed for medium size enterprises
    and, from a price/performance standpoint, is recommended for up
    to 500 concurrent users. The FirePass 4300 appliance is designed
    for medium to large enterprises and service providers and
    supports up to 2000 concurrent users.

Application
    Security Manager (ASM)

Application Security Manager is a Web application firewall that
    provides comprehensive, proactive, application-layer protection
    against both generalized and targeted attacks. Available as a
    software module, ASM employs a positive security model
    (’deny all unless allowed’) combined with
    signature-based detection. As a result, ASM can prevent
    “day-zero” attacks in addition to known security
    threats. ASM is available as an add-on software module for our
    BIG-IP product family.

WebAccelerator

WebAccelerator speeds web transactions by optimizing individual
    network object requests, connections, and end-to-end
    transactions from the browser through to databases.
    WebAccelerator enhances web application performance from any
    location, speeding up interactive performance, improving
    download times, utilizing bandwidth more efficiently, and
    dramatically reducing the cost and response time of delivering
    Web-enabled applications to distributed users where it is not
    possible to deploy an end point device. WebAccelerator devices
    can also be placed at key remote locations to provide
    acceleration to end-users above and beyond TCP optimizations and
    HTTP compression.

WebAccelerator is available as a software module on BIG-IP LTM
    or as a stand-alone appliance (BIG-IP WebAccelerator 4500).

WANJet

WANJet combines WAN optimization and traffic-shaping in a single
    device to accelerate file transfers, email, data replication,
    and other applications over IP networks. It provides LAN-like
    performance on any WAN, ensuring predictable application
    performance for all users, and encrypts and secures all
    transfers without performance penalties. WANJet is deployed as a
    dual-sided (symmetric) solution that optimizes application
    traffic to and from data centers and branch offices.

For data centers, the WANJet 500 features pass-through fault
    tolerance and scalability for up to 20,000 optimized
    connections. For branch offices, the WANJet 300 combines
    pass-through fault tolerant features, silent operation, and
    performance for up to 1,000 optimized connections. WANJet
    solutions work seamlessly across all wide-area networks
    including dedicated links, IP VPNs, frame relay, and even
    satellite connections.

Enterprise
    Manager

Enterprise Manager takes advantage of our iControl interface to
    provide a single, centralized management console for our ADN
    products. Enterprise Manager allows customers with dozens or
    hundreds of our products to discover and view those products in
    a single window, and to upgrade or modify the software on those
    products simultaneously. This lowers the cost and simplifies the
    task of deploying, managing and maintaining our products and
    reduces the likelihood of error when blanket changes are
    implemented.



Enterprise Manager 500 and Enterprise Manager 3000 are
    appliance-based devices on dedicated, enterprise-grade
    platforms. Enterprise Manager 500 provides control for up to 50
    F5 devices, and Enterprise Manager 3000 provides control for up
    to 300 F5 devices.

ARX

The ARX product family is a series of high performance,
    enterprise-class intelligent file virtualization devices that
    dramatically simplify the management of file storage
    environments and lower total storage costs by automating data
    management tasks and eliminating the disruption associated with
    storage management operations. The ARX series is powered by the
    FreedomFabric network operating system, which automates many
    storage management tasks that are performed manually today, and
    eliminates the disruption associated with those tasks.
    FreedomFabric’s unique suite of storage management policies
    includes data migration, automated storage tiering, data
    replication, and dynamic load balancing.

Currently, the ARX series includes three products. The ARX
    500, the low end of the series, is a stand-alone device that can
    manage more than 120 million files. The ARX 1000 is also a
    stand-alone device and can manage more than 380 million
    files. The high-end ARX 6000 is a chassis-based device with
    multiple blades that can manage more than 2 billion files.

Enabling
    Technologies

iControl is an application programming interface that allows
    customers and independent software vendors to modify their
    programs to communicate with our products, eliminating the need
    for human involvement, lowering the cost of performing basic
    network functions and reducing the likelihood of error. Although
    we do not derive revenue from iControl itself, the sale of
    iControl-enabled applications by independent software vendors
    such as Microsoft and Oracle helps promote and often leads
    directly to the sale of our other products.

iRules is a built-in feature of our TMOS architecture that
    allows users customers to manipulate and manage any IP
    application traffic that passes through out TMOS-based products.
    iRules utilizes an easy-to-learn scripting syntax and enables
    users to customize how they intercept, inspect, transform, and
    direct inbound or outbound application traffic.

Product
    Development

We believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain
    technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and
    by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our
    customers. Our product development group employs a standard
    process for the development, documentation and quality control
    of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals.
    This process includes working with management, product
    management, customers and partners to identify new or improved
    solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable
    markets.

Our principal software engineering group is located in our
    headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Our core product
    development teams for FirePass, WANJet and WebAccelerator are
    located in San Jose, California. We also have a smaller
    development facility for WANJet and WebAccelerator in Belfast,
    Northern Ireland. Our core Application Security Manager (ASM)
    product development team is located in Tel Aviv, Israel. Our ARX
    product development team is located in Lowell, Massachusetts.
    Our hardware engineering group is located in Spokane,
    Washington. In addition, we maintain a dedicated facility for
    product testing and quality control in Tomsk, Russia. Members of
    all these teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure
    the interoperability and performance of our hardware and
    software systems.

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and
    2005, we had research and product development expenses of
    $69.0 million, $49.2 million, and $31.5 million,
    respectively.

Customers

Our customers include a wide variety of enterprise customers and
    service providers who are Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global
    1000 companies) including those in telecommunications,
    financial services,



technology, manufacturing, transportation and government. In
    fiscal year 2007, international sales represented 41.6% of our
    net revenues. Refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic
    area.

Sales and
    Marketing

Sales

We sell our products and services to large enterprise customers
    and service providers through a variety of channels, including
    distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”) and
    systems integrators. A substantial amount of our revenue for
    fiscal year 2007 was derived from these channel sales. Our sales
    teams work closely with our channel partners and sell our
    products and services directly to a limited number of major
    accounts.

F5 sales teams.

Our inside sales team
    generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and
    helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field
    and internal corporate resources. Our field sales personnel are
    located in major cities in four sales regions: the Americas;
    Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia
    Pacific region (APAC). Field sales personnel work closely with
    our channel partners to assist them, as necessary, in the sale
    of our products and services to their customers. We also sell
    our products and services directly to a limited group of
    customers, primarily large enterprises, whose accounts are
    managed by our major account services team. Field systems
    engineers support our regional sales managers and channel
    partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing
    pre-sale technical resources as needed.

With the purchase of Acopia, we acquired an existing sales team
    with specialized knowledge of the storage market, data solutions
    and the ARX product line. During fiscal year 2008 we plan to
    expand the ARX sales team as we integrate sales and marketing of
    ARX with our ADN products.

Distributors and VARs.

Consistent with our
    goal of building a strong channel sales model, we have
    established relationships with large national and international
    distributors, local and specialized distributors and VARs from
    which we derive the majority of our sales.

Both distributors and VARs sell our products. In addition,
    VARs assist their customers in network design, installation and
    testing. Since the acquisition of Acopia, we have identified a
    number of existing partners who are potential channels for ARX.

Our agreements with our channel partners are not exclusive and
    do not prevent them from selling competitive products. These
    agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation
    to renew, and typically do not provide for exclusive sales
    territories or minimum purchase requirements.

For fiscal year 2007, sales to two of our distributors, Ingram
    Micro, Inc., and Avnet Technologies, represented 11.6% and 13.2%
    of our total revenues respectively. Our agreements with these
    distributors are standard, non-exclusive distribution agreements
    that renew automatically on an annual basis and can be
    terminated by either party with 30 days’ prior written
    notice. The agreements grant Ingram Micro and Avnet Technologies
    the right to distribute our products to resellers in North
    America and certain other territories internationally, with no
    minimum purchase requirements.

Systems integrators.

We also market our
    products through strategic relationships with systems
    integrators, who include our products as core components of
    application or network-based solutions they deploy for their
    customers. In most cases, systems integrators do not directly
    purchase our products for resale to their customers. Instead
    they typically recommend our products as part of broader
    solutions, such as enterprise resource platform (ERP) or
    customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, that
    incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced
    performance.

Marketing

Our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our
    continued success depends on our ability to understand and
    anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to
    develop valuable solutions that meet those needs. In line with
    this belief, our marketing organization works directly with
    customers, partners



and our product development teams to identify and create
    innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position.
    In addition, our business development team, which is a component
    of our marketing organization, closely monitors technology
    companies in adjacent and complementary markets for
    opportunities to acquire or partner with those whose solutions
    are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our
    addressable market.

Another key component of our marketing strategy is to develop
    and expand our iControl partnerships. Working closely with our
    partners, we have developed solution sets called Application
    Ready Networks (ARNs) that help ensure the successful deployment
    and delivery of their applications over the network. The result
    of methodical testing and research, ARNs provide
    architecture-based, best-practice documentation on how to deploy
    F5 products with applications from major software vendors such
    as Microsoft, Oracle and SAP, helping joint customers unlock the
    full potential of those applications.

To support the growing number of developers using our products,
    including network and application architects, we continue to
    promote and expand DevCentral, our on-line community website
    that provides technical resources to customers, prospects and
    partners wanting to extend and optimize F5 solutions using
    iRules. A key aspect of DevCentral is an on-line forum where
    developers as well as application and network architects discuss
    and share solutions they have written with iRules. At the end of
    fiscal 2007, DevCentral had more than 19,500 registered members.

We also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives
    aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of
    our technology and products. These include actively
    participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events
    with channel and technology partners, and briefing industry
    analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products,
    business relationships and technology partnerships. In addition,
    we market our products to chief information officers and other
    information technology professionals through targeted
    advertising, direct mail and high-profile Web events.

Backlog

At the end of fiscal years 2007 and 2006, we had product backlog
    of approximately $9.9 million and $12.3 million,
    respectively. Backlog represents orders confirmed with a
    purchase order for products to be shipped generally within
    90 days to customers with approved credit status. Orders
    are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers or
    product specification changes by customers. Although we believe
    that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be
    cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant
    penalty. For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at
    any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues.

Customer
    Service and Technical Support

We believe that our ability to provide consistent, high-quality
    customer service and technical support is a key factor in
    attracting and retaining large enterprise customers. Accordingly
    we offer a broad range of support services that include
    installation, phone support, hardware repair and replacement,
    software updates, consulting and training services. We deliver
    these services directly to end users and also utilize a
    multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our
    channel partners when applicable. Our technical support staff is
    strategically located in regional service centers to support our
    global customer base.

Prior to the installation of our products, our services
    personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and
    determine the best way to deploy our products and configure
    product features and functions to meet those needs. Our services
    personnel also provide

on-site

installation and training services to help customers make
    optimal use of product features and functions.

Our customers typically purchase a one-year maintenance contract
    which entitles them to an array of services provided by our
    technical support team. Maintenance services provided under the
    contract include online updates, software error correction
    releases, hardware repair and replacement, and remote support
    through a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week help desk,
    although not all service contracts entitle a customer to
    round-the-clock call center support. Updates to our software are
    only available to customers with a current



maintenance contract. Our technical support team also offers
    seminars and training classes for customers on the configuration
    and use of products, including local and wide area network
    system administration and management. In addition, we have a
    professional services team able to provide a full range of
    fee-based consulting services, including comprehensive network
    management, documentation and performance analysis, and capacity
    planning to assist in predicting future network requirements.

During fiscal year 2007 we achieved ISO 2001 certification for
    our Professional Services Organization.

We also offer, as part of our maintenance service, an online,
    automated, self-help customer support function called “Ask
    F5” that allows customers to answer many commonly asked
    questions without having to call our support desk. This allows
    the customer to rapidly address issues and questions, while
    significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk.
    This enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while
    keeping our support-related expenses at a manageable, consistent
    level.

Manufacturing

We outsource the manufacturing of our pre-configured hardware
    platforms to contract manufacturer Solectron Corporation for
    assembly according to our specifications. Our outsourcing
    relationship will continue following the acquisition of
    Solectron by Flextronics in October 2007.

Flextronics installs our software onto the hardware platforms
    and conducts functionality testing, quality assurance and
    documentation control prior to shipping our products. Our
    agreement with Flextronics allows it to procure component
    inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production
    forecast. Subcontractors supply Flextronics with standard parts
    and components for our products based on our production
    forecast. We are contractually obligated to purchase component
    inventory that our contract manufacturer procures in accordance
    with the forecast, unless we give notice of order cancellation
    in advance of applicable lead times. As protection against
    component shortages and to provide replacement parts for our
    service teams, we also stock limited supplies of certain key
    components for our products.

Hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of
    commodity parts and certain custom components designed and
    approved by our hardware engineering group. Most of our
    components are purchased from sources which we believe are
    readily available from other suppliers. However, several
    components used in the assembly of our products are purchased
    from single or limited sources such as our proprietary Packet
    Velocity ASIC for Layer 4 processing that is manufactured for us
    by a third-party contract semiconductor foundry.

Competition

The increasing breadth of our product offerings has enabled us
    to address a growing array of opportunities, many of which are
    outside the bounds of the traditional Layer 4-7 market. Within
    what Gartner Group calls the Application Acceleration market, we
    compete in the Application Delivery Controller (ADC) market,
    which encompasses the traditional Layer 4-7 market, and the WAN
    Optimization Controller market. Over the next year or two, we
    believe these two market segments will merge as WAN optimization
    effectively becomes a feature of Application Delivery. With the
    availability of ASM and WebAccelerator as software modules on
    BIG-IP, these products have already become features of our
    overall ADN solution, and our strategic roadmap includes plans
    to integrate FirePass with BIG-IP over the next 12 to
    18 months. For the immediate future, however, the WAN
    optimization and secure remote access application security
    market segments will continue to be viewed as discrete markets.

In 2007, approximately 90 percent of our products and
    services were sold into the ADC market where our primary
    competitor is Cisco Systems, Inc. Other competitors in this
    market include Citrix Systems, Inc., and to a lesser degree
    Nortel Networks Corporation, Juniper Networks, Inc., Foundry
    Networks, Inc. and Radware Ltd.

In the adjacent WAN Optimization market, WANJet competes mainly
    with Riverbed Technology, Inc., Juniper, Packeteer, Inc., and to
    a lesser extent Cisco and Citrix. None of our competitors offer
    an integrated product with advanced features comparable to
    WebAccelerator.



In the SSL VPN remote access market, we compete with Juniper,
    Citrix, Aventail Corporation (acquired by SonicWall), Nokia,
    Nortel, and Symantec and a number of smaller players. Because
    SSL VPNs are a potential replacement for IPSec VPNs, the most
    widely deployed solution for secure remote access today, we also
    compete with Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. which,
    along with Juniper, is a market leader in IPSec VPNs. Citrix
    introduced V8 of their Netscaler code which does offer the Teros
    web firewall as a module.

Application firewalls represent an emerging market that is
    populated mainly by private, early-development-stage companies.
    Other companies that have acquired products similar to ASM
    include Citrix Systems. None of our competitors offers a
    high-performance product similar to our Application Security
    Module, which is tightly integrated with our application
    delivery products.

With the acquisition of Acopia, we have entered the nascent file
    virtualization market. Although ARX is unique in terms of its
    technology and the functionality it supports, large storage
    vendors such as EMC, Network Appliance, Brocade, and Cisco offer
    products with overlapping functionality.

Many of our competitors have a longer operating history and
    greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than
    we do. These larger competitors also have a more extensive
    customer base and broader customer relationships, including
    relationships with many of our current and potential customers.
    In addition, many have large, well-established, worldwide
    customer support and professional services organizations and a
    more extensive direct sales force and sales channels. Because of
    our relatively smaller size, market presence and resources, our
    larger competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we
    can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
    requirements. These companies may also adopt aggressive pricing
    policies to gain market share. As a result, our competitors
    could undermine our ability to win new customers and maintain
    our existing customer base.

Intellectual
    Property

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
    trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our
    intellectual property rights. We have obtained 23 patents in the
    United States and have applications pending for various aspects
    of our technology. Our future success depends in part on our
    ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies
    used in our principal products. Despite our efforts to protect
    our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy
    aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or
    other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition,
    the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our
    proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States.
    Any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position, and
    competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or
    superior to our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect
    our intellectual property rights could harm our business,
    operating results and financial condition.

In addition to our own proprietary software, we incorporate
    software licensed from several third-party sources into our
    products. These licenses generally renew automatically on an
    annual basis. We believe that alternative technologies for these
    licenses are available both domestically and internationally.

Employees

As of September 30, 2007, we employed 1,582 full-time
    persons, including 450 in product development, 669 in sales and
    marketing, 279 in professional services and technical support
    and 184 in finance, administration and operations. None of our
    employees are represented by a labor union. We have experienced
    no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are
    good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

In addition to the other information in this report, the
    following risk factors should be carefully considered in
    evaluating our company and its business.

Our
    success depends on our timely development of new products and
    features, market acceptance of new product offerings and proper
    management of the timing of the life cycle of our
    products

We expect the application delivery networking and file
    virtualization markets to be characterized by rapid
    technological change, frequent new product introductions,
    changes in customer requirements and evolving industry
    standards. Our continued success depends on our ability to
    identify and develop new products and new features for our
    existing products to meet the demands of these changes, and for
    those products and features to be accepted by our existing and
    target customers. If we are unable to identify, develop, and
    deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis,
    our business and results of operations may be harmed.

The current life cycle of our products is typically 12 to
    24 months. The introduction of new products or product
    enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing
    products, or replace sales of some of our current products,
    thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product
    introduction, and may cause customers to defer purchasing our
    existing products in anticipation of the new products. This
    could harm our operating results by decreasing sales, increasing
    our inventory levels of older products, and exposing us to



greater risk of product obsolescence. We have also experienced,
    and may in the future experience, delays in developing and
    releasing new products and product enhancements. This has led
    to, and may in the future lead to, delayed sales, increased
    expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated. Also, in
    the development of our products, we have experienced delays in
    the prototyping of our products, which in turn has led to delays
    in product introductions. In addition, complexity and
    difficulties in managing product transitions at the end-of-life
    stage of a product can create excess inventory of components
    associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased
    expenses. Any or all of the above problems could materially harm
    our business and operating results.

Our
    success depends on sales and continued innovation of our BIG-IP
    product lines

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, we derived
    approximately 91% of our product revenues, or approximately 68%
    of our total revenues, from sales of our BIG-IP family of
    application delivery networking product lines. We continue to
    expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from
    sales of our BIG-IP products in the future. Implementation of
    our strategy depends upon BIG-IP products being able to solve
    critical network availability and performance problems of our
    customers. If BIG-IP products are unable to solve these problems
    for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels
    of innovation in BIG-IP’s product feature set needed to
    maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive
    market environment, our business and results of operations will
    be harmed.

We may
    not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application
    delivery networking and file virtualization
    markets

The markets we serve are new, rapidly evolving and highly
    competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify
    in the future. Our principal competitors in the application
    delivery networking market include Cisco Systems, Inc., Nortel
    Networks Corporation, Foundry Networks, Inc., Citrix Systems,
    Inc., Radware Ltd. and Juniper Networks, Inc. In the adjacent
    WAN Optimization market, we compete with Riverbed Technology,
    Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., Packeteer, Inc., Cisco Systems,
    Inc. and Citrix systems, Inc. In the file virtualization market,
    we compete with EMC, Network Appliance, Brocade and Cisco. We
    expect to continue to face additional competition as new
    participants enter our markets. As we continue to expand
    globally, we may see new competitors in different geographic
    regions. In addition, larger companies with significant
    resources, brand recognition, and sales channels may form
    alliances with or acquire competing application delivery
    networking solutions and emerge as significant competitors.
    Potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate
    an Internet traffic management or security component into
    existing products in a manner that discourages users from
    purchasing our products.

Our
    quarterly and annual operating results are inherently
    unpredictable and may cause our stock price to
    fluctuate

Our quarterly and annual operating results have varied
    significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the
    future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future
    operating results. In particular, we anticipate that the size of
    customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger
    business accounts. A delay in the recognition of revenue, even
    from just one account, may have a significant negative impact on
    our results of operations for a given period. In the past, a
    majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a
    quarter. Accordingly, a delay in an anticipated sale past the
    end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of
    operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that year.
    Additionally, we have exposure to the credit risks of some of
    our customers and sub-tenants. Although we have programs in
    place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated
    risk, there can be no assurance that such programs will be
    effective in reducing our credit risks adequately. We monitor
    individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements,
    seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our
    customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate
    to cover exposure for potential losses. If there is a
    deterioration of a sub-tenant’s or major customer’s
    creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected
    future resulting losses, if incurred, could harm our business
    and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.



Further, our operating results may be below the expectations of
    securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years.
    Our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the
    market price of our common stock. Such a decline could occur,
    and has occurred in the past, even when we have met our publicly
    stated revenue

and/or

earnings guidance.

The
    average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs
    may increase, which may negatively impact gross
    profits

It is possible that the average selling prices of our products
    will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing
    pressures, increased sales discounts, new product introductions
    by us or our competitors or other factors. Therefore, in order
    to maintain our gross profits, we must develop and introduce new
    products and product enhancements on a timely basis and
    continually reduce our product costs. Our failure to do so will
    cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline, which will
    harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we may
    experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future
    operating results due to the erosion of our average selling
    prices.

It is
    difficult to predict our future operating results because we
    have an unpredictable sales cycle

Our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our
    revenue is difficult to predict. Historically, our sales cycle
    has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended
    to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on
    the enterprise market. Also, as our distribution strategy has
    evolved into more of a channel model, utilizing value-added
    resellers, distributors and systems integrators, the level of
    variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has
    increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of
    many of our sales transactions. Sales of our products require us
    to educate potential customers in their use and benefits. Sales
    of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal
    budgeting, approval and competitive evaluation processes that
    large corporations and governmental entities may require. For
    example, customers frequently begin by evaluating our products
    on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our
    products before they decide whether or not to purchase.
    Customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated
    releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or
    us. As a result, our products have an unpredictable sales cycle
    that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating
    results.

Our
    business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not
    able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if
    a single source of hardware assembly is lost or
    impaired

We rely on third party contract manufacturers to assemble our
    products. We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware
    platforms to contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware
    platforms to our specifications. We have experienced minor
    delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past.
    However, if we experience major delays in the future or other
    problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of
    product, any one or a combination of these factors may harm our
    business and results of operations. The inability of our
    contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of
    our products or the loss of our contract manufacturer may cause
    a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a
    replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results
    of operations. In particular, because we subcontract
    substantially all of our manufacturing to a single contract
    manufacturer, with whom we do not have a long-term contract, any
    termination, loss or impairment in our arrangement with this
    single source of hardware assembly, or any impairment of their
    facilities or operations, would harm our business, financial
    condition and results of operation.

If the demand for our products grows, we will need to increase
    our raw material and component purchases, contract manufacturing
    capacity and internal test and quality control functions. Any
    disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue, may harm our
    competitive position and may result in additional costs or
    cancellation of orders by our customers.



Our
    business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays
    in the supply of hardware components from our third-party
    sources

We currently purchase several hardware components used in the
    assembly of our products from a number of single or limited
    sources. Lead times for these components vary significantly. The
    unavailability of suitable components, any interruption or delay
    in the supply of any of these hardware components, or the
    inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources
    at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, may delay
    assembly and sales of our products and, hence, our revenues, and
    may harm our business and results of operations.

We are subject to governmental export and import controls that
    could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete
    in international markets.

Our products are subject to U.S. export controls and may be
    exported outside the U.S. only with the required level of
    export license or through an export license exception, because
    we incorporate encryption technology into our products. In
    addition, various countries regulate the import of certain
    encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our
    ability to distribute our products or could limit our
    customers’ ability to implement our products in those
    countries. Changes in our products or changes in export and
    import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our
    products in international markets, prevent our customers with
    international operations from deploying our products throughout
    their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or
    import of our products to certain countries altogether. Any
    change in export or import regulations or related legislation,
    shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing
    regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies
    targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of
    our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell
    our products to, existing or potential customers with
    international operations. For example, we will need to comply
    with Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive laws,
    which are being adopted by certain European Economic Area
    countries on a

country-by-country

basis. Failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely
    basis, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, operating results and financial condition. Any
    decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to
    export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our
    business, operating results and financial condition.

We may
    not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and
    our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of
    third parties

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
    trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure of
    confidential and proprietary information to protect our
    intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our
    proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or
    otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring
    unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be
    certain that the steps we have taken will prevent
    misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign
    countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights
    as fully as in the United States.

Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number
    of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding
    patent and other intellectual property rights. In the ordinary
    course of our business, we are involved in disputes and
    licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed
    proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always
    successfully defend ourselves against such claims. If we are
    found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, or if we
    otherwise settle such claims, we could be compelled to pay
    damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those
    intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they
    no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights. Any license
    could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at
    all. Similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid
    infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or
    impractical. In addition, we have initiated, and may in the
    future initiate, claims or litigation against third parties for
    infringement of our proprietary rights, to determine the scope
    and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our
    competitors. Any of these claims, whether claims that we are
    infringing the proprietary rights of others, or vice versa, with
    or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly
    litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel
    or require us to cease using infringing technology, develop
    non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing
    agreements. Further, our



license agreements typically require us to indemnify our
    customers, distributors and resellers for infringement actions
    related to our technology, which could cause us to become
    involved in infringement claims made against our customers,
    distributors, or resellers. Any of the above-described
    circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes
    could result in our business and results of operations being
    harmed.

Many of our products include intellectual property licensed from
    third parties. In the future, it may be necessary to renew
    licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new
    licenses for other technology. These third party licenses may
    not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. The
    inability to obtain certain licenses, or litigation regarding
    the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related
    intellectual property issues, could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, operating results and financial
    condition. Furthermore, we license some third party intellectual
    property on a non-exclusive basis and this may limit our ability
    to protect our intellectual property rights in our products.

We may
    not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships
    and a reduction or delay in sales to a significant distribution
    partner could hurt our business

Our sales strategy requires that we establish and maintain
    multiple distribution channels in the United States and
    internationally through leading industry resellers, systems
    integrators, Internet service providers and other indirect
    channel partners. We have a limited number of agreements with
    companies in these channels, and we may not be able to increase
    our number of distribution relationships or maintain our
    existing relationships. Recruiting and retaining qualified
    channel partners and training them in our technologies requires
    significant time and resources. If we are unable to establish or
    maintain our indirect sales channels, our business and results
    of operations will be harmed. In addition, two domestic
    distributors of our products together accounted for 24.8% and
    25.2% of our total net revenue for the fiscal years 2007 and
    2006, respectively. A substantial reduction or delay in sales of
    our products to this or any other key distribution partner could
    harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

Undetected
    software or hardware errors may harm our business and results of
    operations

Our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first
    introduced or as new versions are released. We have experienced
    these errors or defects in the past in connection with new
    products and product upgrades. We expect that these errors or
    defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced
    products after commencement of commercial shipments. These
    problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair
    costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from
    our product development efforts and cause significant customer
    relations problems. We may also be subject to liability claims
    for damages related to product errors or defects. While we carry
    insurance policies covering this type of liability, these
    policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be
    asserted. A material product liability claim may harm our
    business and results of operations.

Our products must successfully operate with products from other
    vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may
    be difficult to identify the source of the problem. The
    occurrence of software or hardware problems, whether caused by
    our products or another vendor’s products, may result in
    the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products. The
    occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and
    results of operations.

Adverse
    economic conditions or reduced information technology spending
    may adversely impact our business.

A substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for
    information technology by large enterprise customers and service
    providers, the overall economic health of our current and
    prospective customers, and the continued growth and evolution of
    the Internet. The purchase of our products is often
    discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of
    capital and other resources. Weak economic conditions, or a
    reduction in information technology spending even if economic
    conditions improve, would likely adversely impact our business,
    operating results and financial condition in a number of ways,
    including longer sales cycles, lower prices for our products and
    services and reduced unit sales.



Our
    operating results are exposed to risks associated with
    international commerce

As our international sales increase, our operating results
    become more exposed to international operating risks. These
    risks include risks related to potential recessions in economies
    outside the United States, foreign currency exchange rates,
    managing foreign sales offices, regulatory, political, or
    economic conditions in specific countries, military conflict or
    terrorist activities, changes in laws and tariffs, inadequate
    protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries,
    foreign regulatory requirements, and natural disasters. All of
    these factors could have a material adverse effect on our
    business. We intend to continue expanding into international
    markets. International sales represented 41.6% and 42.6% of our
    net revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. In particular, in fiscal year 2007, we
    derived 12.2% of our total revenue from the Japanese market.
    This revenue is dependent on a number of factors outside our
    control, including the viability and success of our resellers
    and the strength of the Japanese economy.

Changes
    in governmental regulations could negatively affect our
    revenues

Our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by
    the United States and various foreign governments including, but
    not limited to, environmental regulations and regulations
    implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the
    import or export of some technologies, especially encryption
    technology. Changes in governmental regulation and our inability
    or failure to obtain required approvals, permits, or
    registrations could harm our international and domestic sales
    and adversely affect our revenues, business and operations.

Acquisitions,
    including our recent acquisition of Acopia Networks, Inc.,
    present many risks and we may not realize the financial and
    strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the
    transaction

With respect to our past any any future acquisitions, we may
    find that the acquired businesses, products or technologies do
    not further our business strategy as expected, that we paid more
    than what the assets are later worth, or that economic
    conditions change, all of which may generate future impairment
    charges. Our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers,
    financial markets or investors. There may be difficulty
    integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired
    business, and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel
    of the acquired business. We may have difficulty in
    incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our
    existing product lines. Our ongoing business and
    management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by
    transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing
    geographically and culturally diverse locations. We may have
    difficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures
    and policies across locations. We may experience significant
    problems or liabilities associated with the product quality,
    technology and other matters.

Our inability to successfully operate and integrate
    newly-acquired businesses appropriately, effectively and in a
    timely manner, or to retain key personnel of any acquired
    business, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
    take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated
    traffic management and security solutions and other advances in
    technology, as well as on our revenues, gross margins and
    expenses.

Our
    success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract
    and retain qualified sales and marketing, operations, product
    development and professional services personnel

Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued
    contributions of our key management, product development, sales,
    marketing and finance personnel, many of whom may be difficult
    to replace. The complexity of our application delivery
    networking products and their integration into existing networks
    and ongoing support, as well as the sophistication of our sales
    and marketing effort, requires us to retain highly trained
    professional services, customer support and sales personnel.
    Competition for qualified professional services, customer
    support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because
    of the limited number of people available with the necessary
    technical skills and understanding of our products. Our ability
    to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by
    volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock, since
    these employees are generally granted restricted stock units or
    stock options. The loss of services



of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract
    qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified
    personnel, may harm our business and results of operations.

We
    face litigation risks

We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business.
    Litigation in general, and intellectual property and securities
    litigation in particular, can be expensive, lengthy and
    disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results
    of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
    Responding to lawsuits has been, and will likely continue to be,
    expensive and time-consuming for us. An unfavorable resolution
    of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business, results of
    operations, or financial condition.

Our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our
    prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks
    associated with litigation. Beginning in May 2006 several
    derivative actions were filed against certain current and former
    directors and officers (as discussed further in Item 3
    “Legal Proceedings”) based on allegations relating to
    our historical stock option practices. We cannot assure you that
    this current litigation will result in the same conclusions
    reached by the special committee of outside directors formed by
    our Board of Directors to conduct a review of our stock option
    practices (the “Special Committee”).

We may in the future be subject to additional litigation arising
    in relation to our historical stock option practices and the
    restatement of our prior financial statements. Litigation may be
    time consuming, expensive and distracting for management from
    the conduct of our business. The adverse resolution of any
    lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure
    you that any future litigation relating to our historical stock
    option practices will result in the same conclusions reached by
    the Special Committee. Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse
    findings in any of these matters, we could be required to pay
    damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us
    which could adversely affect our business, results of
    operations, or financial condition.

The
    matters relating to the Special Committee’s review of our
    historical stock option practices and the restatement of our
    consolidated financial statements has resulted in regulatory
    proceedings against us and may result in future regulatory
    proceedings, which could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition

On November 8, 2006, we announced that the Special
    Committee had completed its review of our historical stock
    option practices. Upon completion of its review, the Special
    Committee found that the recorded grant dates for certain stock
    options granted during fiscal years 1999 to 2004 should be
    adjusted as the measurement date for accounting purposes and the
    accounting treatment used for the vesting of certain stock
    options was incorrect. Based on the Special Committee’s
    review, to correct the accounting treatment, we amended our
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K/A

(as amended) for the year ended September 30, 2005 and our
    Quarterly Reports on

Form 10-Q

for the three months ended December 31, 2005 and
    March 31, 2006 to restate the consolidated financial
    statements contained in those reports.

We have received notice from both the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”) and the United States
    Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York (the
    “Department of Justice”) that they are conducting
    informal inquiries into our historical stock option practices,
    and we have fully cooperated with both agencies. Considerable
    legal and accounting expenses related to our historical stock
    option practices have already been incurred to date and
    significant expenditures may continue to be incurred in the
    future. We may in the future be subject to additional regulatory
    proceedings or actions arising in relation to our historical
    stock option practices and the restatement of our prior period
    financial statements. Any potential regulatory proceeding or
    action may be time consuming, expensive and distracting for
    management from the conduct of our business. The adverse
    resolution of any potential regulatory proceeding or action
    could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or
    financial condition. We cannot assure you that the SEC and
    Department of Justice inquiries, or any future regulatory action
    relating to our historical stock option practices, will result
    in the same conclusions reached by the Special Committee.
    Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse findings in any of
    these matters, we could be required to pay damages or penalties
    or have other remedies imposed



upon us, including criminal penalties, which could adversely
    affect our business, results of operations, or financial
    condition.

Anti-takeover
    provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to
    acquire us

Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the
    price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions,
    including voting rights, of those shares without any further
    vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of
    common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected
    by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be
    issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have
    the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of
    control of our company without further action by our shareholder
    and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the
    holders of common stock. Further, certain provisions of our
    bylaws, including a provision limiting the ability of
    stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders
    without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying
    or preventing changes in control or management of our company,
    which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our
    common stock. In addition, our articles of incorporation provide
    for a staggered board, which may make it more difficult for a
    third party to gain control of our board of directors.
    Similarly, state anti-takeover laws in the State of Washington
    related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of
    control of our company.

Properties

Our principal administrative, sales, marketing, research and
    development facilities are located in Seattle, Washington and
    consist of approximately 165,000 square feet. In April
    2000, we amended and restated the lease agreement on two of the
    three buildings for our corporate headquarters. The lease
    commenced in July 2000 on the first building; and the lease on
    the second building commenced in September 2000. The lease for
    both buildings expires in 2012 with an option for renewal. The
    lease for the second building has been partially subleased
    through 2012. We believe that our existing properties are in
    good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business. We
    also lease office space for our product development personnel in
    Bellevue, Washington, Spokane, Washington, San Jose,
    California, Lowell, Massachusetts, Israel, Northern Ireland, and
    Russia and for our sales and support personnel in Illinois,
    Washington D.C., New York, New Jersey, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    China, Taiwan, Thailand, India, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan,
    Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, Belgium, Spain, Italy,
    Netherlands and the United Kingdom. We believe that our future
    growth can be accommodated by current facilities or by leasing
    additional space if necessary.

On October 31, 2006 we entered into an office lease
    agreement to lease a total of approximately 137,000 square
    feet of office space in the building known as 333 Elliott West,
    which is next to the three buildings that currently serve as our
    corporate headquarters. The lease term is 10 years with an
    option for renewal. We plan to occupy this new building during
    the third quarter of fiscal 2008 after construction is completed
    and currently expect to sublease a portion of this office space.

Legal
    Proceedings

    proceedings

Derivative Suits.

Beginning on or about
    May 24, 2006, several derivative actions were filed against
    certain of our current and former directors and officers. These
    derivative lawsuits were filed in: (1) the Superior Court
    of King County, Washington, as In re F5 Networks, Inc. State
    Court Derivative Litigation

(Case No. 06-2-17195-1

SEA), which consolidates Adams v. Amdahl, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-17195-1

SEA), Wright v. Amdahl, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-19159-5

SEA), and Sommer v. McAdam, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-26248-4

SEA) (the “State Court Derivative Litigation”); and
    (2) in the U.S. District Court for the Western
    District of Washington, as In re F5 Networks, Inc. Derivative
    Litigation, Master File

No. C06-0794RSL,

which consolidates Hutton v. McAdam, et al. (Case

No. 06-794RSL),

Locals 302 and 612 of the International Union of Operating
    Engineers-Employers



Construction Industry Retirement Trust v. McAdam et al.
    (Case

No. C06-1057RSL),

and Easton v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1145RSL).

On August 2, 2007, another derivative lawsuit,
    Barone v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C07-1200P),

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
    District of Washington. It is expected that this lawsuit will be
    consolidated with the other lawsuits pending in the
    U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.
    The complaints generally allege that certain of our current and
    former directors and officers, including, in general, each of
    our current outside directors (other than Deborah L. Bevier who
    joined our Board of Directors in July 2006) breached their
    fiduciary duties to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful
    conduct concerning the manipulation of certain stock option
    grant dates. We are named solely as a nominal defendant against
    whom the plaintiffs seek no recovery. Our combined motion to
    consolidate and stay the State Court Derivative Litigation was
    granted in a court order dated April 3, 2007. Our motion to
    dismiss the consolidated federal derivative actions based on
    plaintiffs’ failure to make demand on our Board of
    Directors prior to filing suit was granted in a court order
    dated August 6, 2007 with leave to amend the allegations in
    plaintiffs’ complaint. Plaintiffs filed an amended
    consolidated federal derivative action complaint on
    September 14, 2007. We intend to vigorously pursue
    dismissal of the amended complaint and has filed a motion to
    dismiss based on plaintiffs’ failure to make demand on the
    Company’s Board of Directors prior to filing suit.

Although litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, we do
    not believe the results of these pending actions will,
    individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact
    on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

SEC and Department of Justice Inquiries.

We
    have received notice from both the SEC and the Department of
    Justice that they are conducting informal inquiries into our
    historical stock option practices, and have fully cooperated
    with both agencies. Considerable legal and accounting expenses
    related to our historical stock option practices have already
    been incurred to date and significant expenditures may continue
    to be incurred in the future. We may in the future be subject to
    additional regulatory proceedings or actions arising in relation
    to our historical stock option practices and the restatement of
    our prior period financial statements. Although regulatory
    proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, we do not
    believe the results of any pending actions will, individually or
    in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

We are not aware of any other pending legal proceedings than
    those mentioned above that, individually or in the aggregate,
    would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
    results, or financial condition. We may in the future be party
    to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business,
    including claims that allegedly infringe upon third-party
    trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Such claims,
    even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of
    significant financial and managerial resources.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The statements contained below that are not purely historical
    are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. These statements
    include, but are not limited to, statements about our plans,
    objectives, expectations, strategies, intentions or other
    characterizations of future events or circumstances and are
    generally identified by the words “expects,”
    “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,”
    “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,”
    and similar expressions. Because these forward-looking
    statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,
    our actual results could differ materially from those expressed
    or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that
    could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are
    not limited to, those discussed under the heading “Risk
    Factors” herein and in other documents we file from time to
    time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All
    forward-looking statements set forth below are based on
    information available to us on the date hereof. Our business and
    the associated risks may have changed since the date this report
    was originally filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to
    update any such forward-looking statements.

Restatement
    of Consolidated Financial Statements

In our Annual Report on

Form 10-K/A

No. 2 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005

    (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and
    Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia Pacific region. Enterprise
    customers (Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global
    1000 companies) in



financial services, transportation, government and
    telecommunications industries continue to make up the largest
    percentage of our customer base.

Our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance
    indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our
    financial and operating performance. Those indicators include:

•

Revenues.

The majority of our revenues are
    derived from sales of our core products; BIG-IP Local Traffic
    Manager; BIG-IP Global Traffic Manager; BIG-IP ISP Traffic
    Manager; TrafficShield Application Firewall, WANJet,
    WebAccelerator; FirePass SSL VPN servers; and ARX. We also
    derive revenues from the sales of services including annual
    maintenance contracts, installation, training and consulting
    services. We carefully monitor the sales mix of our revenues
    within each reporting period. We believe customer acceptance
    rates of our new products and feature enhancements are key
    indicators of future trends. We also consider overall revenue
    concentration by customer and by geographic region as additional
    indicators of current and future trends.

•

Cost of revenues and gross margins.

We strive
    to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross
    margins. Significant items impacting cost of revenues are
    hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third-party
    software license fees, amortization of developed technology, and
    personnel and overhead expenses. Our margins have remained
    relatively stable over the past two years; however factors such
    as sales price, product mix, inventory obsolescence, returns,
    component price increases, and warranty costs could
    significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter
    and represent the significant indicators we monitor on a regular
    basis.

•

Operating expenses.

Operating expenses are
    substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses.
    Existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant
    factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense
    trends. Other significant operating expenses that we monitor
    include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees,
    computer costs related to the development of new products,
    facilities and depreciation expenses.

•

Liquidity and cash flows.

Our financial
    condition remains strong with significant cash and investments
    and no long term debt. The increase in cash and investments
    during the fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to net income from
    operations, with operating activities providing cash of
    $169.7 million. Going forward, we believe the primary
    driver of cash flows will be net income from operations. On
    September 12, 2007, we acquired all of the capital stock of
    Acopia Networks for cash of $210.0 million. Capital
    expenditures for fiscal year 2007 were comprised primarily of
    tenant improvements and information technology infrastructure
    and equipment to support the growth of our core business
    activities. We will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions
    of or investments in businesses, products, or technologies that
    we believe are strategic, which may require the use of cash.

•

Balance sheet.

We view cash, short-term and
    long-term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable
    balances and day’s sales outstanding as important
    indicators of our financial health. Deferred revenues continued
    to increase due to the growth in the amount of annual
    maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance
    renewal contracts related to our existing product installation
    base. Our day’s sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of
    fiscal year 2007 was 57 days. We expect to maintain this
    metric in the mid

50-day

range
    going forward.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. The preparation of these financial
    statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and
    on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
    estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the
    more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation
    of our financial statements.



Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue in
    accordance with the guidance provided under Statement of
    Position (“SOP”)

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,”

and

SOP No. 98-9

“Modification of

SOP No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain
    Transactions,”

Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 48,

“Revenue
    Recognition When Right of Return Exists,”

and SEC Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101,

“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,”

and SAB No. 104,

“Revenue
    Recognition.”

We sell products through distributors, resellers, and directly
    to end users. We recognize product revenue upon shipment, net of
    estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be
    probable and no significant obligations remain. In certain
    regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate
    returns, revenue is recognized upon sale to the end user. In
    this situation, we receive a sales report from the channel
    partner to determine when the sales transaction to the end user
    has occurred. Payment terms to domestic customers are generally
    net 30 days to net 45 days. Payment terms to
    international customers range from net 30 to 90 days
    based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual
    markets. We have offered extended payment terms ranging from
    three to six months to certain customers, in which case, revenue
    is recognized when payments are made.

Whenever a software license, hardware, installation and
    post-contract customer support (“PCS”) elements are
    combined into a package with a single “bundled” price,
    a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the
    bundled package based on their respective fair values as
    determined when the individual elements are sold separately. We
    determine fair value based on the type of customer and region in
    which the package is sold. Where fair value of certain elements
    are not available, we recognize revenue on the ’residual
    method’ permitted under

SOP 98-9

based on the fair value of undelivered PCS. Revenues from the
    license of software are recognized when the software has been
    shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software.
    When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate
    returns, we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse.
    Revenues for PCS are recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the service contract term. PCS includes rights to upgrades, when
    and if available, a limited period of telephone support,
    updates, and bug fixes. Installation revenue is recognized when
    the product has been installed at the customer’s site.
    Consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates, plus
    out-of-pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized when the
    consulting has been completed. Training revenue is recognized
    when the training has been completed.

Reserve for Doubtful Accounts.

Estimates are
    used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are
    based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a
    percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging
    category. In determining these percentages, we evaluate
    historical write-offs, current trends in the credit quality of
    our customer base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We
    perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’
    financial condition and do not require any collateral. If there
    is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or
    actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our
    allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient.

Reserve for Product Returns.

In some
    instances, product revenue from distributors is subject to
    agreements allowing rights of return. Product returns are
    estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the
    time revenues are recognized. Accordingly, we reduce recognized
    revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is
    recorded. When rights of return are present and we cannot
    estimate returns, revenue is recognized when such rights lapse.
    The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon
    changes in historical rates of returns and other related
    factors. It is possible that these estimates will change in the
    future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates.

Reserve for Warranties.

A warranty reserve is
    established based on our historical experience and an estimate
    of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on
    products sold as of the balance sheet date. While we believe
    that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment
    applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and
    payable could differ materially from what will actually
    transpire in the future.

Accounting for Income Taxes.

We utilize the
    liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in
    SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income
    Taxes”

(“SFAS 109”). Accordingly, we are
    required to estimate our



income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as
    part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial
    statements. This process involves estimating our actual current
    tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax
    audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting
    from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting
    purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and
    liabilities. Due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax
    rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which
    we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax
    liability could change in the future, which may result in
    additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of
    operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Stock-Based Compensation.

We account for
    stock-based compensation in accordance with Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

(“FAS 123R”), using
    the straight-line attribution method for recognizing
    compensation expense. We recognized $41.2 million and
    $24.8 million of stock-based compensation expense for the
    years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As
    of September 30, 2007, there was $74.1 million of
    total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost, the majority
    of which will be recognized over the next two years. Going
    forward, stock-based compensation expenses may increase as we
    issue additional equity-based awards to continue to attract and
    retain key employees.

We issue incentive awards to our employees through stock-based
    compensation consisting of stock options and restricted stock
    units (“RSU’s”). The value of RSU’s is
    determined using the fair value method, which in this case, is
    based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of
    our common stock on the date of grant. Alternatively, in
    determining the fair value of stock options, we use the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model that employs the following
    key assumptions. Expected volatility is based on the annualized
    daily historical volatility of our stock price over the expected
    life of the option. Expected term of the option is based on
    historical employee stock option exercise behavior, the vesting
    terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten
    years. Our stock price volatility and option lives involve
    management’s best estimates at that time, both of which
    impact the fair value of the option calculated under the
    Black-Scholes methodology and, ultimately, the expense that will
    be recognized over the life of the option.

FAS 123R also requires that we recognize compensation
    expense for only the portion of stock options or RSU’s that
    are expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture
    rates that are derived from historical employee termination
    behavior. We reduced our forfeiture rate from 5% to 4% in the
    second quarter of fiscal 2007 to better reflect our historical
    behavior. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those
    estimated by management, additional adjustments to stock-based
    compensation expense may be required in future periods.

Compensation cost recognized for the year ended
    September 30, 2007 includes: (a) compensation cost for
    all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as
    of July 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FASB
    Statement No. 123, “

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation”

and (b) compensation cost for all
    share-based payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005,
    based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the provisions of FAS 123R.

In August 2007, the Company granted 276,400 RSU’s to
    certain current executive officers. Fifty percent of the
    aggregate number of RSU’s granted at such time vest in
    equal quarterly increments over two years, until such portion of
    the grant is fully vested on November 1, 2009. Twenty five
    percent of the RSU grant is subject to the Company achieving
    specified percentage increases in total revenue for fiscal year
    2008, relative to fiscal year 2007. The remaining twenty five
    percent is subject to the Company meeting specified performance
    criteria for fiscal year 2009 to be set by the Compensation
    Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.

In December 2006, the Company granted 456,000 RSU’s to
    certain current executive officers. Fifty percent of the
    aggregate number of RSU’s granted at such time vest in
    equal quarterly increments over two years, until such portion of
    the grant is fully vested on November 1, 2008. Twenty five
    percent of the RSU grant was subject to the Company achieving
    specified percentage increases in total revenue for fiscal year
    2007, relative to fiscal year 2006. This twenty five percent was
    fully earned in fiscal 2007. The remaining



twenty five percent is subject to the Company meeting specified
    performance criteria for fiscal year 2008 to be set by the
    Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.

We are required to recognize compensation costs for awards with
    performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the
    performance condition will be acheived. We are required to
    reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date
    and adjust compensation costs based on our probability
    assessment.

Goodwill and intangible assets.

We have a
    significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our
    balance sheet related to acquisitions. Intangible assets are
    carried and reported at acquisition cost, net of accumulated
    amortization subsequent to acquisition. Intangible assets are
    amortized over the estimated useful lives, which generally range
    from three to five years. Intangible assets are reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment
    might exist in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets.”

Projected undiscounted net cash flows expected
    to be derived from the use of those assets are compared to the
    respective net carrying amounts to determine whether any
    impairment exists. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of
    the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets.

The determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and
    intangible assets and the extent to which, if any, there is
    impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on
    our part, including the useful life over which the intangible
    assets are to be amortized, and the estimates of the value of
    future net cash flows, which are based upon further estimates of
    future revenues, expenses and operating margins. In applying
    SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,”

we review our goodwill annually for impairment
    in the second fiscal quarter, or more frequently when indicators
    of impairment are present.

Net Revenues.

Total net revenues increased
    33.4% in fiscal year 2007 from fiscal year 2006, compared to an
    increase of 40.0% in fiscal year 2006 from fiscal year 2005. The
    continued revenue growth was due to increased demand for our
    Application Traffic Management (ATM) products and higher
    services revenues resulting from our increased installed base of
    products. During fiscal year 2007, each of our primary
    geographic regions reported higher revenues compared to the
    prior year period. International revenues represented 41.6%,
    42.6% and 40.5% of net revenues in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. We expect international sales will continue
    to represent a significant portion of net revenues, although we
    cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a
    percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels.

Net product revenues increased 28.9% in fiscal year 2007 and
    38.8% in fiscal year 2006 as compared to the previous fiscal
    year, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2007 was primarily
    due to absolute growth in the volume of product sales of our
    BIG-IP product line as well as incremental revenues derived from
    sales of our



TrafficShield and WAN Optimization product lines. Sales of our
    BIG-IP family of application delivery networking products
    represented 91.0%, 89.4% and 89.1% of total product revenues in
    fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Net service revenues increased 48.9% in fiscal year 2007
    compared to a 44.3% increase for fiscal year 2006 from the prior
    year, respectively. The increase of services revenues in
    absolute dollars was the result of increased purchases and
    renewals of maintenance contracts as our installed base of
    products increased.

Ingram Micro Inc., one of our domestic distributors, accounted
    for 11.6%, 13.6%, and 18.6% of our total net revenues in fiscal
    years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Avnet Technology
    Solutions, another domestic distributor accounted for 13.2% and
    11.6% of our total net revenue in fiscal 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Avnet Technology Solutions accounted for 10.6% of
    our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2007.

Cost of Net Product Revenues.

Cost of net
    product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our
    contract manufacturers, manufacturing overhead, freight,
    warranty, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, and
    amortization expenses in connection with developed technology
    from acquisitions. In absolute dollars, product cost increased
    to $84.1 million in fiscal year 2007 as compared to
    $63.6 million and $49.0 million in fiscal years 2006
    and 2005, respectively. The year over year increases were
    primarily due to the higher volume of units shipped compared
    with the prior period. Fiscal 2007 increases also include an
    increase in warranty expense and indirect manufacturing costs
    over prior periods. Fiscal 2006 increase also included an
    increase in indirect manufacturing cost primarily related to the
    amortization charges of our acquired technology.

Cost of Net Service Revenues.

Cost of net
    service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of
    our professional services staff, travel, facilities, and
    depreciation expenses. Cost of net service revenues as a
    percentage of net service revenues remained relatively stable at
    25.8% in fiscal year 2007 as compared to 27.5% and 26.2% in
    fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in
    absolute dollars year over year is primarily due to increased
    salary and benefits attributed to growth in headcount.
    Professional services headcount at the end of fiscal year 2007
    increased to 279 from 205 at the end of fiscal year 2006 and 147
    at the end of fiscal year 2005. In addition, stock compensation
    expense increased to $2.4 million in fiscal year 2007 from
    $1.5 million in fiscal year 2006. Going forward, we expect
    to continue to increase our cost of service revenues to support
    our expanded product lines and growing customer base.

Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing
    expenses consist of salaries, commissions and related benefits
    of our sales and marketing staff, the costs of our marketing
    programs, including public relations, advertising and trade
    shows, travel, facilities and depreciation expenses. Sales and
    marketing expense increased 37.7% in fiscal year 2007 as
    compared to 41.9% and 35.2% in fiscal years 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The increase in sales and marketing expense was
    primarily due to increased commissions and personnel costs of
    $25.4 million and $21.0 million and $14.6 million
    for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively which is
    consistent with the increased revenue and headcount for the
    corresponding periods. Sales and marketing headcount at the end
    of fiscal 2007 increased to 669 from 442 at the end of fiscal
    2006 and 331 at the end of fiscal 2005. Stock-based compensation
    charges of $15.8 million, $10.1 million and
    $2.4 million also contributed to the overall increase in
    fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We expect to
    continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in absolute
    dollars in order to grow revenues and increase our market share.

Research and Development.

Research and
    development expenses consist of the salaries and related
    benefits for our product development personnel, prototype
    materials and expenses related to the development of new and
    improved products, facilities and depreciation expenses.
    Research and development expenses increased 40.4% in fiscal year
    2007 as compared to 56.0% and 29.0% in fiscal years 2006 and
    2005, respectively. The increase in research and development
    expense was primarily due to increased salary and benefit
    expenses of $12.2 million, $8.4 million and
    $3.2 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively which is consistent with the increased headcount
    for the corresponding periods. Research and development
    headcount at the end of fiscal 2007 increased to 450 from 287 at
    the end of fiscal 2006 and 217 at the end of fiscal 2005. The
    growth in employee headcount was primarily related to
    enhancement of our current products and the development of new
    advanced products. Stock-based compensation charges of
    $10.2 million, $6.9 million and $1.5 million also
    contributed to the overall increase in fiscal years 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. We expect to continue to increase
    research and development expenses as our future success is
    dependent on the continued development of our products.

General and Administrative.

General and
    administrative expenses consist of the salaries, benefits and
    related costs of our executive, finance, information technology,
    human resource and legal personnel, third-party professional
    service fees, bad debt charges, facilities, and depreciation
    expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 25.9% in
    fiscal year 2007 as compared with 53.5% in fiscal year 2006 and
    61.7% in fiscal year 2005. The increase in fiscal year 2007 of
    $10.1 million was due primarily to an increase in
    stock-based compensation charges of $6.5 million, increased
    salary and benefit expenses of $4.0 million and
    $3.1 million of other general operating expenses. These
    increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenses
    incurred by third parties for legal, accounting, tax and other
    professional services in connections with the Special Committee
    investigation of $4.4 million. The increase in fiscal year
    2006 is due primarily to expenses incurred



by third parties for legal, accounting, tax and other
    professional services in connection with the Special Committee
    investigation of $7.0 million, an increase in stock-based
    compensation charges of $5.1 million and, increased salary
    and benefit expenses of $2.7 million. The year over year
    increase in salary and benefits is consistent with the growth in
    headcount. General and administrative headcount at the end of
    fiscal 2007 increased to 184 from 134 at the end of fiscal 2006
    and 97 at the end of fiscal 2005 The increase in general and
    administrative expenses is expected to remain at these increased
    levels as the Company continues to build its infrastructure to
    support the worldwide growth of our business.

    expense was $14.0 million in 2007 and reflects the amount
    allocated to IPR&D that we acquired in the Acopia
    acquisition. IPR&D represents the present value of
    estimated after-tax cash flows expected to be generated by
    purchased technology, which, at the acquisition date, had not
    yet reached technological feasibility. We based our estimates
    and projections related to IPR&D on assumptions we believed
    to be reasonable at the time of the acquisition but that are
    inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If we do not
    successfully develop this product, our business, operating
    results and financial condition may be adversely affected.

Other Income, Net.

Other income, net, consists
    of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and
    losses. Other income, net, increased 61.7% in fiscal year 2007
    and increased 115.8% in fiscal year 2006 as compared to the
    previous fiscal year, respectively. The significant increase was
    due to a combination of higher yields and increased investment
    balances. The increased investment balances are the result of
    cash provided from operating and financing activities during the
    fiscal years 2006 and fiscal year 2005.

Provision for Income Taxes.

We recorded a
    39.7% provision for income taxes for the fiscal year 2007
    compared to 38.6% in fiscal year 2006 and 39.4% in fiscal 2005.
    The increase in the provision for income taxes is primarily due
    to the write-off of acquired in-process research and
    development. As of fiscal year-end 2007, we do not have a
    valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of
    the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that
    the assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making
    this determination we have considered projected future taxable
    income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies
    in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance. Our
    net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2007, 2006 and
    2005 were $43.3 million, $23.3 million and
    $40.4 million, respectively. Our world wide effective tax
    rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including
    variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic
    locations in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our
    net deferred tax assets, resolution of potential exposures, tax
    positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic
    locations in which we operate, introduction of new accounting
    standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in
    the various geographic locations in which we operate. We have
    recorded liabilities to



address potential tax exposures related to business and income
    tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing
    authorities. The ultimate resolution of these potential
    exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded
    which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense.

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term
    investments totaled $474.8 million as of September 30,
    2007 compared to $492.2 million as of September 30,
    2006, representing a decrease of $17.4 million. The net
    decrease was primarily due to cash requirements for the purchase
    of Acopia Networks in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which
    were partially offset by cash flow from operations. In fiscal
    year 2006, overall cash and investments increased
    $127.2 million compared to the fiscal year 2005. The
    increase was due to the cash flow from operations and cash from
    employee stock option exercises.

Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2007
    was $169.7 million compared to $125.4 million in
    fiscal year 2006 and $85.0 million in fiscal year 2005.
    Cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from
    cash generated from net income, after adjusting for non-cash
    charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities as
    adjusted for various non-cash items including stock-based
    compensation, depreciation and amortization charges.

Cash used in investing activities was $188.1 million for
    the fiscal year 2007, $204.4 million for fiscal year 2006
    and $126.8 million for fiscal year 2005. The cash used in
    fiscal year 2007 was primarily the result of the purchase of
    investments partially offset by the sale of investments and
    $207.1 million of cash payments, net of cash acquired, to
    shareholders of Acopia Networks, which was acquired in September
    2007. The cash used in fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to the
    purchase of investments and property and equipment, partially
    offset by the sale of investments. The cash used in fiscal year
    2005 was primarily due to the purchase of investments and
    property and equipment partially offset by the sale of
    investments

Cash provided by financing activities was $35.5 million for
    fiscal year 2007 compared to $65.1 million and
    $68.9 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    During the fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 our financing
    activities consisted entirely of cash proceeds and tax benefits
    received from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases
    under our employee stock purchase plan.

We expect that our existing cash and investment balances and
    cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated
    working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable
    future.

    on our behalf based on our production forecast. We are obligated
    to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer
    procures in accordance with the forecast, unless cancellation is
    given within applicable lead times.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities”

(“SFAS 159”),
    which allows entities to measure eligible financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value. The Statement also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different
    measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
    liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective for the Company’s
    fiscal years beginning October 1, 2008. The Company is
    currently assessing the potential effect if any of implementing
    this standard.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
    effective for the Company’s fiscal years beginning
    October 1, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal
    years. The Company is currently assessing the potential effect
    if any of implementing this standard.

In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108,

“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
    when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements”

(“SAB 108”), which is
    effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006.
    SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on the consideration
    of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying
    current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality
    assessment. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
    application of SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for
    Income Taxes.”

The Interpretation addresses the
    determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be
    claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
    statements. Under FIN 48, the Company may recognize the tax
    benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely
    than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination
    by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the
    position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial
    statements from such a position should be measured based on the
    largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood
    of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
    penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and
    requires increased disclosures. The provisions of FIN 48
    are effective for the company beginning October 1, 2007.
    The impact of the Company’s reassessment of its tax
    positions in accordance with the requirements of FIN 48 is
    expected to yield no change in the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk.

Our cash equivalents
    consist of high-quality securities, as specified in our
    investment policy guidelines. The policy limits the amount of
    credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5% of
    the total portfolio with the exception of U.S. treasury
    securities, commercial paper and money market funds, which are
    exempt from size limitation. The policy requires investments in
    securities that mature in three years or less, with the average
    maturity being no greater than one and a half years. These
    securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease
    in value if interest rates increase. A decrease of one percent
    in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease
    of approximately $9.5 million in our interest income for
    the fiscal year 2007.

Foreign Currency Risk.

The majority of our
    sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a
    result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency
    transaction gains and losses to date. While we have conducted
    some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2007 and expect to continue to do so,
    we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or
    losses will be significant at our current level of operations.
    However, as we continue to expand our operations
    internationally, transaction gains or losses may become
    significant in the future. We have not engaged in foreign
    currency hedging to date. However, we may do so in the future.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To The Board of Directors and Shareholders

of F5 Networks, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of F5 Networks, Inc. and its subsidiaries
    at September 30, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended September 30, 2007 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
    all material respects, the information set forth therein when
    read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of September 30, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A,
    management has excluded Acopia Networks, Inc. from its
    assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of
    September 30, 2007 because it was acquired by the Company
    in a purchase business combination during 2007. We have also
    excluded Acopia Networks, Inc. from our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting. Acopia Networks, Inc. is a
    wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues
    represent $5,327,000 and $1,637,000, respectively, of the
    related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for
    the year ended September 30, 2007.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

The
    Company

F5 Networks, Inc. (“the Company”) F5 Networks makes,
    sells and services products that optimize the delivery of
    network-based applications and the performance and availability
    of servers, data storage devices and other network resources.
    The Company’s application delivery networking products
    improve the performance, availability and security of
    applications running on Internet-based networks by inspecting
    and modifying traffic passing between servers running
    applications and clients using these applications to ensure that
    it is delivered securely and in a way that optimizes the
    performance of both the network and the applications. With the
    purchase of Acopia Networks in September 2007, the Company
    acquired a line of file virtualization products that improve the
    management and utilization of network attached storage (NAS)
    systems. These products automate many storage management tasks
    that are performed manually today, and eliminate the disruption
    associated with data migration, automated storage tiering, data
    replication, and dynamic load balancing. The Company also offers
    a broad range of services such as consulting, training,
    installation, maintenance, and other technical support services.

Stock
    Split

On July 25, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    declared a two-for-one split of the Company’s common stock.
    The stock split resulted in the issuance of one additional share
    of common stock for every share of its common stock issued and
    outstanding as of the record date of August 10, 2007. All
    share and per-share data, as well as share-based award
    information included in these Consolidated Financial Statements
    and Notes thereto, have been retroactively adjusted to reflect
    the stock split.

Accounting
    Principles

The Company’s consolidated financial statements and
    accompanying notes are prepared on the accrual basis of
    accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States of America.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date
    of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are
    used in accounting for revenue recognition, reserves for
    doubtful accounts, product returns, obsolete and excess
    inventory, warranties, valuation allowances on deferred tax
    assets and purchase price allocations. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
    purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash
    equivalents. The Company invests its cash and cash equivalents
    in deposits with three major financial institutions, which, at
    times, exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not
    experienced any losses on its cash and cash equivalents.



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Investments

The Company classifies its investment securities as available
    for sale. Investment securities, consisting of corporate and
    municipal bonds and notes and United States government
    securities, are reported at fair value with the related
    unrealized gains and losses included as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
    shareholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and
    declines in value of securities judged to be other than
    temporary are included in other income (expense). The cost of
    investments for purposes of computing realized and unrealized
    gains and losses is based on the specific identification method.
    Investments in securities with maturities of less than one year
    or where management’s intent is to use the investments to
    fund current operations are classified as short-term
    investments. Investments with maturities of greater than one
    year are classified as long-term investments.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company extends credit to customers and is therefore subject
    to credit risk. The Company performs initial and ongoing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and does
    not require collateral. An allowance for doubtful accounts is
    recorded to account for potential bad debts. Estimates are used
    in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based
    upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of
    remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In determining
    these percentages, the Company evaluates historical write-offs,
    and current trends in customer credit quality, as well as
    changes in credit policies.

The Company maintains its cash and investment balances with high
    credit quality financial institutions.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

Short-term and long-term investments are recorded at fair value
    as the underlying securities are classified as available for
    sale and marked-to-market at each reporting period. The fair
    value is determined using quoted market prices for the
    securities held.

Inventories

The Company outsources the manufacturing of its pre-configured
    hardware platforms to contract manufacturers, who assemble each
    product to the Company’s specifications. As protection
    against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for
    its service teams, the Company also stocks limited supplies of
    certain key product components. The Company reduces inventory to
    net realizable value based on excess and obsolete inventories
    determined primarily by historical usage and forecasted demand.
    Inventories consist of hardware and related component parts and
    are recorded at the lower of cost or market (as determined by
    the

first-in,

first-out method).

Inventories consist of the following (in thousands):

Restricted
    Cash

Restricted cash represents escrow accounts established in
    connection with lease agreements for the Company’s
    corporate headquarters and, to a lesser extent, our
    international facilities. Under the terms of the



F5

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

lease for our corporate headquarters, the amount required to be
    held in escrow reduces and eventually eliminates at various
    dates throughout the duration of the lease term. During fiscal
    year 2007, the amount required to be held in escrow was
    $3.6 million as set forth in the lease agreement for our
    corporate headquarters.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation of
    property and equipment are provided using the straight-line
    method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging
    from two to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized
    over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life
    of the improvements. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs
    is charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for major
    improvements are capitalized at cost. Gains or losses on the
    disposition of assets are reflected in the income statements at
    the time of disposal.

    the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated
    fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date. We
    have adopted the requirements of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”).
    SFAS No. 142 requires goodwill to be tested for
    impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in
    certain circumstances, and written down when impaired. Goodwill
    of $24.2 million was recorded in connection with the
    acquisition of uRoam, Inc. in fiscal year 2003, goodwill of
    $25.5 million was recorded in connection with the
    acquisition of MagniFire Websystems Inc. in fiscal year 2004,
    goodwill of $32.0 million was recorded in connection with
    the acquisition of Swan Labs, Inc. (“Swan Labs”), and
    goodwill of $152.3 million was recorded in connection with
    the acquisition of Acopia Networks, Inc. in the fourth quarter
    of 2007. In March 2007, we completed our annual impairment test
    and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill.

Other
    Assets

Other assets primarily consist of software development costs and
    acquired technology.

Software development costs are charged to research and
    development expense until technological feasibility is
    established. The Company accounts for internally-generated
    software development costs in accordance with
    SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of
    Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
    Marketed.” Thereafter, until the product is released for
    sale, software development costs are capitalized and reported at
    the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value of each
    product. The



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing
    assessment of recoverability of costs require considerable
    judgment by the Company with respect to certain internal and
    external factors, including, but not limited to, anticipated
    future gross product revenues, estimated economic life and
    changes in hardware and software technology. The Company did not
    capitalize any software development costs in fiscal year 2007,
    2006 or 2005. Amortization costs related to previously
    capitalize software development was $249,000, $272,000, and
    $317,000 for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively and
    has been recorded as additional cost of product revenues.

Acquired technology and customer relationship assets are
    recorded at cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives
    of five years. Acquired technology of $15.0 million in
    fiscal 2007, $8.6 million in fiscal 2006 and
    $5.0 million in fiscal year 2004 was recorded in connection
    with the acquisitions of Acopia, Swan Labs, Inc. and MagniFire,
    respectively. Related amortization expense, which is charged to
    cost of product revenues, totaled $3.4 million,
    $3.2 million and $1.6 million during the fiscal years
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets
    whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
    When such events occur, management determines whether there has
    been an impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted net
    future cash flows to the related asset’s carrying value. If
    an impairment exists, the asset is written down to its estimated
    fair value.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s products are integrated with software that is
    essential to the functionality of the equipment. Accordingly,
    the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the guidance
    provided under Statement of Position (SOP)

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,” and

SOP No. 98-9

“Modification of

SOP No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain
    Transactions,” Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 48, “Revenue Recognition When
    Right of Return Exists,” and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (“SAB”) No. 104, “Revenue Recognition.”

The Company sells products through distributors, resellers, and
    directly to end users. The Company recognizes product revenue
    upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that
    collection is reasonably assured and no significant performance
    obligations remain. In certain regions where the Company does
    not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns, the Company
    defers revenue on sales to its distributors until they have
    received information from the channel partner indicating that
    the distributor has sold the product to its customer. Payment
    terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 to
    45 days. Payment terms to international customers range
    from net 30 to net 90 days based on normal and
    customary trade practices in the individual markets. The Company
    offers extended payment terms to certain customers, in which
    case, revenue is recognized when payments are due.

Whenever a software license, hardware, installation and
    post-contract customer support (“PCS”) elements are
    sold together, a portion of the sales price is allocated to each
    element based on their respective fair values as determined when
    the individual elements are sold separately. We determine fair
    value based on the type of customer and region in which the
    package is sold. Where fair value of certain elements are not
    available, we recognize revenue on the ’residual
    method’ permitted under

SOP 98-9

based on the fair value of undelivered PCS. Revenues from the
    license of software are recognized when the software has been
    shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software.
    When rights of return are present and the Company cannot
    estimate returns, it recognizes revenue when such rights of
    return lapse. Revenues for PCS are recognized on a straight-line
    basis over the service contract term. PCS includes a limited
    period of telephone support updates, bug fixes and rights to
    upgrades, when and if available. Installation revenue is
    recognized when the product



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

has been installed at the customer’s site. Consulting
    services are customarily billed at fixed rates, plus
    out-of-pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized when the
    consulting has been completed. Training revenue is recognized
    when the training has been completed.

Shipping
    and Handling

Shipping and handling fees charged to our customers are
    recognized as product revenue in the period shipped and the
    related costs for providing these services are recorded as a
    cost of sale.

Guarantees
    and Product Warranties

In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its
    products, the Company indemnifies other parties, including
    customers, resellers, lessors, and parties to other transactions
    with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company
    has agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses
    arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of
    intellectual property infringement or other claims made against
    certain parties. These agreements may limit the time within
    which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the
    claim. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements
    with its officers and directors, and the Company’s bylaws
    contain similar indemnification obligations to the
    Company’s agents. It is not possible to determine the
    maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements
    due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and
    the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
    agreement.

The Company offers warranties of one year for hardware, with the
    option of purchasing additional warranty coverage in yearly
    increments. The Company accrues for warranty costs as part of
    its cost of sales based on associated material product costs and
    technical support labor costs. During the years ended
    September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, warranty expense was
    $3.7 million, $1.8 million and $2.2 million,
    respectively.

Research
    and Development

Research and development expenses consist of salaries and
    related benefits of product development personnel, prototype
    materials and expenses related to the development of new and
    improved products, and an allocation of facilities and
    depreciation expense. Research and development expenses are
    reflected in the statements of income as incurred.

In-Process
    Research and Development

Acquired in-process research and development,
    (“IPR&D”) reflects the amount allocated to
    IPR&D that the Company acquired in acquisitions. IPR&D
    represents the present value of estimated after-tax cash flows
    expected to be generated by purchased technology, which, at the
    acquisition date, had not yet reached technological feasibility
    and had no alternative future use. We recorded
    $14.0 million of IPR&D cost in fiscal 2007 related to
    our acquisition of Acopia.

Advertising

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred
    $2.2 million, $1.3 million and $1.7 million in
    advertising costs during the fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for
    income taxes as set forth by SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes”

(“SFAS 109”). Deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based upon differences between the
    financial statement and income tax bases of assets and
    liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
    which the differences are expected to reverse. The realization
    of deferred tax assets is based on historical tax positions and
    estimates of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is
    recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Foreign
    Currency

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign
    subsidiaries is the local currency in which the respective
    entity is located, with the exception of F5 Networks, Ltd., in
    the United Kingdom that uses the U.S. dollar as its
    functional currency. An entity’s functional currency is
    determined by the currency of the economic environment in which
    the majority of cash is generated and expended by the entity.
    The financial statements of all majority-owned subsidiaries and
    related entities, with a functional currency other than the
    U.S. dollar, have been translated into U.S. dollars in
    accordance with SFAS No. 52

“Foreign Currency
    Translation.”

All assets and liabilities of the
    respective entities are translated at year-end exchange rates
    and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates
    during the respective period. Translation adjustments are
    reported as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of
    the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated
    in currencies other than the functional currency, including
    U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on those foreign currency
    transactions are included in determining net income or loss for
    the period of exchange. The net effect of foreign currency gains
    and losses were not significant during the fiscal years ended
    September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Segments

The Company complies with the requirements of
    SFAS No. 131,

“Disclosure about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information,”

which establishes
    annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise’s
    operating segments and related disclosures about its products,
    services, geographic areas and major customers. Management has
    determined that the Company operated in one segment for fiscal
    2007 and prior years and will continue to evaluate its reporting
    structure prospectively.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

On July 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment”

(“FAS 123R”). Prior to July 1, 2005, the
    Company accounted for share-based payments under the recognition
    and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”), and related
    Interpretations, as permitted by FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“FAS 123”). In accordance with APB 25, no
    compensation cost was required to be recognized for options
    granted that had an exercise price equal to the market value of
    the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

The Company adopted FAS 123R using the
    modified-prospective-transition method. Under that transition
    method, compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year 2005 and
    beyond includes: a) compensation cost for all share-based
    payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of July 1,
    2005, based on the grant-date fair

value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    FAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share-based
    payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005, based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of FAS 123R. The results for the prior periods
    have not been restated.

Effective July 1, 2005 the Company adopted the
    straight-line attribution method for recognizing compensation
    expense. Previously under the disclosure-only provisions of
    SFAS 123, the Company used the accelerated method of
    expense recognition pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 28,

Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable
    Stock Option or Award Plans

(“FIN 28”). For
    all unvested options outstanding as of July 1, 2005, the
    previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense, based
    on the fair value at the original grant date, will be recognized
    on an accelerated basis over the remaining vesting period. For
    share-based payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005,
    compensation expense, based on the fair value on the date of
    grant, will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the
    vesting period.

The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the price
    of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. However, in
    determining the fair value of stock options, we use the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model that employs the following
    key assumptions.

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
    curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company does not
    anticipate declaring dividends in the foreseeable future.
    Expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical
    volatility of our stock price commensurate with the expected
    life of the option. Expected term of the option is based on an
    evaluation of the historical employee stock option exercise
    behavior, the vesting terms of the respective option and a
    contractual life of ten years. Our stock price volatility and
    option lives involve management’s best estimates at that
    time, both of which impact the fair value of the option
    calculated under the Black-Scholes methodology and, ultimately,
    the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option.
    SFAS 123R also requires that we recognize compensation
    expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are
    expected to vest. Therefore, the Company applies estimated
    forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee
    termination behavior. An estimated forfeiture rate of 4% was
    used for fiscal 2007 and 5% for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. If
    the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by
    management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may
    be required in future periods.

The following table shows the pro forma effect on the
    Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share
    for the year ended September 30, 2005, had compensation
    expense been determined based upon the fair value at the grant
    date for awards consistent with the methodology prescribed by
    SFAS 123. The Company adopted SFAS 123R on
    July 1, 2005, the beginning of its fourth quarter of fiscal
    2005; therefore, stock-based compensation expense shown in the
    pro forma table relates to expense through June 30, 2005
    while the Company was still under the disclosure only provisions
    of SFAS 123. Stock-based compensation expense for the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 has been included
    in results of operations. These pro forma effects may not be
    representative of expense in future periods since the estimated
    fair value of stock options on the date of grant is amortized to
    expense over the vesting period, and additional options may be
    granted or options may be cancelled in future years:

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities”

(“SFAS 159”),
    which allows entities to measure eligible financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value. The Statement also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different
    measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
    liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective for the Company’s
    fiscal years beginning October 1, 2008. The Company is
    currently assessing the potential effect if any of implementing
    this standard.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
    effective for the Company’s fiscal years beginning
    October 1, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal
    years. The Company is currently assessing the potential effect
    if any of implementing this standard.

In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108,

“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
    when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements”

(“SAB 108”), which is
    effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006.
    SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on the consideration
    of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying
    current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality
    assessment. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
    application of SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for
    Income Taxes.”

The Interpretation addresses the
    determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be
    claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
    statements. Under FIN 48, the Company may recognize the tax
    benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely
    than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination
    by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the
    position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial
    statements from such a position should be measured based on the
    largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood
    of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
    penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and
    requires increased disclosures. The provisions of FIN 48
    are effective for the company beginning October 1, 2007.
    The impact of the Company’s reassessment of its tax
    positions in accordance with the requirements of FIN 48 is
    expected to yield no change in the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits.

The Company invests in securities that are rated investment

    caused by interest rate increases and not credit quality. The
    Company has determined the unrealized losses are temporary as
    the duration of the decline in value of investments has been
    short, the extent of the decline, in both dollars and as a
    percentage of costs, is not significant, and the Company has the
    ability and intent to hold the investments until it recovers at

Business
    Combinations

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for under the
    purchase method of accounting in accordance with
    SFAS No. 141,

“Business Combinations.”

The total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and
    intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on
    their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price
    over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The fair value
    assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed are based on estimates and assumptions
    provided by management, and other information compiled by
    management, including independent valuations, prepared by
    valuation specialists that utilize established valuation
    techniques appropriate for the technology industry. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and
    other Intangible Assets,”

goodwill is not amortized but
    instead is tested for impairment at least annually.

Fiscal
    Year 2007 Acquisition of Acopia Networks

On September 12, 2007, the Company acquired all of the
    capital stock of Acopia Networks, Inc. (“Acopia”), a
    privately held Delaware corporation headquartered in Lowell,
    Massachusetts for $207.8 million in cash. The Company also
    incurred $2.2 million of direct transaction costs for a
    total purchase price of approximately $210.0 million.
    Acopia provides high-performance, intelligent file
    virtualization solutions. These solutions will be highly
    complementary to Company’s strategy of optimizing the
    application infrastructure from the core of the datacenter to
    the edge of the network. As a result of the merger, the Company
    acquired all the assets of Acopia, all property, equipment and
    other assets that Acopia used in its business and assumed all
    the liabilities of Acopia. The results of operations of Acopia
    have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements from the date of acquisition.

    customer relationships and $0.4 million to trade name and a
    specific non-compete agreement. To determine the value of the
    developed technology, a combination of cost and market
    approaches were used. The cost approach required an estimation
    of the costs required to reproduce the developed technology. The
    market approach measures the fair value of the technology
    through an analysis of recent comparable transactions. To
    determine the value of customer relationships, the income
    approach was used. The income approach estimates the fair value
    based on the earnings and cash flow capacity of an asset.

Developed technology, customer relationships and trade name will
    be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
    useful life of five years. The non-compete agreement will be
    amortized on a straight-line basis over the thirty six month
    term of the agreement.

Fiscal
    Year 2006 Acquisition of Swan Labs

On October 4, 2005, the Company acquired all of the capital
    stock of Swan Labs, a privately held Delaware corporation
    headquartered in San Jose, California for
    $43.0 million in cash. The Company also incurred
    $3.2 million of direct transaction costs for a total
    purchase price of approximately $46.2 million. As a result
    of the merger, the Company acquired all the assets of Swan Labs,
    all property, equipment and other assets that Swan Labs used in
    its business and assumed all the liabilities of Swan Labs. Swan
    Labs provides WAN (Wide Area Network) optimization and
    application acceleration products and services. The addition of
    Swan Labs is intended to allow us to quickly enter the WAN
    optimization market, broaden the Company’s customer base,
    and augment the Company’s existing product line. The
    results of operations of Swan Labs have been included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date

At September 30, 2007, the Company had U.S. net
    operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
    $86.4 million, a portion of which begins to expire in
    fiscal 2022 if not utilized. All U.S. net operating loss
    carry-forwards relate to entities acquired by the Company and
    are limited in use by I.R.C. Sec. 382. At September 30,
    2007, the Company also had net operating loss carry-forwards of
    approximately $2.4 million related to operations in the
    United Kingdom that carry forward indefinitely. At
    September 30, 2007 the Company also had federal research
    and development credit carry-forwards and other federal credit
    carry-forwards of approximately $2.4 million which if not
    utilized will begin to expire in 2022 and state research and
    development and investment carry-forwards of approximately
    $1.2 million which if not utilized may begin to expire in
    fiscal year 2017. At September 30, 2006 the Company had
    approximately $10.8 million of net operating loss
    carry-forwards of which approximately $6.7 million were
    related to operations in the United Kingdom and approximately
    $187,000 were related to operations in Israel, both of which
    carry-forward indefinitely. At September 30, 2006, the
    Company had federal research credit and other credit
    carry-forwards of approximately $7.9 million and state
    research credit carry-forwards of approximately $695,000.

United States income and foreign withholding taxes have not been
    provided on approximately $6.6 million of undistributed
    earnings from the Company’s international subsidiaries. The
    Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability for the
    undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because the
    Company currently does not expect to remit those earnings in the
    foreseeable future. Determination of the amount of unrecognized
    deferred tax liability related to undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries is not practicable because such liability,
    if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when
    remittance occurs.

On December 20, 2006, the U.S. federal research credit
    was extended for two years for qualified research expenses paid
    or incurred after December 31, 2005, and before
    January 1, 2008, as amended by the Tax Relief and Health
    Care Act of 2006. In fiscal 2007, the Company experienced an
    increase in its R&D credit available for use of
    approximately $1.6 million due to this legislation.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Common
    Stock

Equity
    Incentive Plans

In fiscal 2005, the Company modified the method in which it
    issues incentive awards to its employees through stock-based
    compensation. In prior years, stock-based compensation consisted
    only of stock options. Beginning in 2005, the majority of awards
    consisted of restricted stock unit awards and to a lesser degree
    stock options. Employees vest in restricted stock units and
    stock options ratably over the corresponding service term,
    generally one to four years. The Company’s stock options
    expire 10 years from the date of grant. Restricted stock
    units are payable in shares of the Company’s common stock
    as the periodic vesting requirements are satisfied. The value of
    a restricted stock unit is based upon the fair market value of
    the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The value
    of restricted stock units is determined using the intrinsic
    value method and is based on the number of shares granted and
    the quoted price of the Company’s common stock on the date
    of grant. Alternatively, the Company uses the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock
    options. Compensation expense related to restricted stock units
    and stock options is recognized over the vesting period. The
    Company has adopted a number of stock-based compensation plans
    as discussed below.

1998 Equity Incentive Plan.

In November 1998,
    the Company adopted the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 1998
    Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of non-qualified
    and incentive stock options, stock purchase awards and stock
    bonuses for employees and other service providers. Upon certain
    changes in control of the Company, all outstanding and unvested
    options or stock awards under the 1998 Plan will vest at the
    rate of 50%, unless assumed or substituted by the acquiring
    entity. During the fiscal year 2007, the Company issued no
    non-qualified and incentive stock options or stock purchase
    awards and issued 119,630 stock bonuses to employees. As of
    September 30, 2007, there were options to purchase
    969,498 shares outstanding and 4,168 shares available
    for awards under the 1998 Plan.

1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

In May
    1999, the board of directors approved the adoption of the 1999
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan. A total of 4,000,000 shares of common stock have been
    reserved for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
    The Employee Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to
    acquire shares of the Company’s common stock through
    periodic payroll deductions of up to 15% of base compensation.
    No employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock,
    determined at the fair market value of the shares at the time
    such option is granted, in one calendar year. The Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan has been implemented in a series of offering
    periods, each 6 months in duration. The price at which the
    common stock may be purchased is 85% of the lesser of the fair
    market value of the Company’s common stock on the first day
    of the applicable offering period or on the last day of the
    respective purchase period. As of September 30, 2007 there
    were 1,465,772 shares available for awards under the
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

2000 Equity Incentive Plan.

In July 2000, the
    Company adopted the 2000 Employee Equity Incentive Plan, or the
    2000 Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of
    non-qualified stock options, stock purchase awards and stock
    bonuses for non-executive employees and other service providers.
    A total of 7,000,000 shares of common stock have been
    reserved for issuance under the 2000 Plan. Upon certain changes
    in control of the Company, all outstanding and unvested options
    or stock awards under the 2000 Plan will vest at the rate of
    50%, unless assumed or substituted by the acquiring entity. As
    of September 30, 2007, there were options to purchase
    719,371 shares outstanding and 152,221 shares
    available for awards under the 2000 Plan.

New Hire Incentive Plans.

In October 2003, the
    company adopted a non-qualified stock option plan, or the Hull
    Plan, in connection with the hiring of Thomas Hull, the
    Company’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales. The
    Hull plan provided for a grant of 450,000 non-qualified stock
    options for Mr. Hull. As of September 30, 2007, there
    were options to purchase 230,000 shares outstanding and no
    shares available for awards under the Hull Plan. In August 2004,
    the Company adopted a non-qualified stock option plan, or the

    of September 30, 2007, there were options to purchase
    138,000 shares outstanding and no shares available for
    awards under the Triebes Plan. Upon certain changes in control
    of the Company, 100% of all outstanding and unvested options
    remaining under the Hull Plan and the Triebes Plan will vest and
    become immediately exercisable.

Acquisition Incentive Plans.

In July 2003, the
    Company adopted the uRoam Acquisition Equity Incentive Plan, or
    the uRoam Plan, in connection with the hiring of the former
    employees of uRoam, Inc. A total of 500,000 shares of
    common stock were reserved for issuance under the uRoam Plan.
    The plan provided for discretionary grants of non-qualified and
    incentive stock options, stock purchase awards and stock
    bonuses. The Company has not granted any stock purchase awards
    or stock bonuses under this plan. As of September 30, 2007
    there were options to purchase 31,172 shares outstanding
    and no shares available for awards under the uRoam Plan.

In July 2004, the Company adopted the MagniFire Acquisition
    Equity Incentive Plan, or the MagniFire Plan, in connection with
    the hiring of the former employees of MagniFire Websystems, Inc.

    this plan. As of September 30, 2007 there were options to
    purchase 146,969 shares outstanding and no shares available
    for awards under the MagniFire Plan.

In August 2007, the Company adopted the 2007 Acopia Acquisition
    Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2007 Acopia Plan. The 2007 Acopia
    Plan provides for discretionary grants of non-statutory stock
    options and stock units for employees, directors and consultant
    of Acopia to whom the Company offers employment in connection
    with the Company’s acquisition of Acopia. A total of
    600,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for
    issuance under the 2007 Acopia Plan. Upon certain changes in
    control of the Company, the surviving entity will either assume
    or substitute all outstanding Stock Awards under the 2007 Acopia
    Plan. During the fiscal year 2007, the Company issued no stock
    options or stock units under the 2007 Acopia Plan.

In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Acopia, the
    Company assumed the Acopia 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, or the
    Acopia Plan. A total of 2,230,703 shares of common stock
    were reserved for issuance under the Acopia Plan. The plan
    provides for discretionary grants of non-qualified and incentive
    stock options, restricted stock awards and other stock-based
    awards to persons who were employees, officers, directors,

    options, stock purchase awards or stock bonuses under this plan.

    421,680 shares outstanding and 1,809,023 shares
    available for awards under the Acopia Plan.

    whether due to termination of employment or otherwise, are not
    available for future grant.

2005 Equity Incentive Plan.

In December 2004,
    the Company adopted the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2005
    Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of non-statutory
    stock options and stock units for employees, including officers,
    and other service providers. A total of 7,400,000 shares of
    common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2005
    Plan. Upon certain changes in control of the Company, the
    surviving entity will either assume or substitute all
    outstanding Stock Awards under the 2005 Plan. During the fiscal
    year 2007, the Company issued no stock options and 1,687,802
    stock units under the 2005 Plan. As of September 30, 2007,
    there were options to purchase 75,000 shares outstanding
    and 3,473,618 shares available for awards under the 2005

Litigation

Derivative Suits.

Beginning on or about
    May 24, 2006, several derivative actions were filed against
    certain current and former directors and officers of the
    Company. These derivative lawsuits were filed in: (1) the
    Superior Court of King County, Washington, as In re F5 Networks,
    Inc. State Court Derivative Litigation

(Case No. 06-2-17195-1

SEA), which consolidates Adams v. Amdahl, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-26248-4

    (2) in the U.S. District Court for the Western
    District of Washington, as In re F5 Networks, Inc. Derivative
    Litigation, Master File

No. C06-0794RSL,

which consolidates Hutton v. McAdam, et al. (Case

No. 06-794RSL),

Locals 302 and 612 of the International Union of Operating
    Engineers-Employers Construction Industry Retirement
    Trust v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1057RSL),

and Easton v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1145RSL).

On August 2, 2007, another derivative lawsuit,
    Barone v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C07-1200P),

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
    District of Washington. It is expected that this lawsuit will be
    consolidated with the other lawsuits pending in the
    U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.
    The complaints generally allege that certain of the
    Company’s current and former directors and officers,
    including, in general, each of the Company’s current
    outside directors (other than Deborah L. Bevier who joined the
    Company’s Board of Directors in July 2006) breached
    their fiduciary duties to the Company by engaging in alleged
    wrongful conduct concerning the manipulation of certain stock
    option grant dates. The Company is named solely as a nominal
    defendant against whom the plaintiffs seek no recovery. The
    Company’s combined motion to consolidate and stay the State
    Court Derivative Litigation was granted in a court order dated
    April 3, 2007. The Company’s motion to dismiss the
    consolidated federal derivative actions based on
    plaintiffs’ failure to make demand on the Company’s
    Board of Directors prior to filing suit was granted in a court
    order dated August 6, 2007 with leave to amend the
    allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint. Plaintiffs filed an

filed a motion to dismiss based on plaintiffs’ failure to
    make demand on the Company’s Board of Directors prior to
    filing suit.

The Company is not aware of any additional pending legal
    proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
    operating results, or financial condition. The Company may in
    the future be party to litigation arising in the ordinary course
    of business, including claims that allegedly infringe upon
    third-party trademarks or other intellectual property rights.
    Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the
    expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.

Geographic
    Sales and Significant Customers

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
    for which separate financial information is available and
    evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or
    decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and
    in assessing performance. For fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    the Company was organized as, and operated in, one reportable
    segment: the development, marketing and sale of application
    delivery networking products that optimize the security,
    performance & availability of network applications,
    servers and storage systems. The Company manages its business
    based on four geographic regions: the Americas (primarily the
    United States); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA);
    Japan; and Asia Pacific. The Company’s chief operating
    decision-making group reviews financial information presented on
    a consolidated basis accompanied by information about revenues
    by geographic region. The Company’s foreign offices conduct
    sales, marketing and support activities. Management evaluates
    performance based primarily on revenues in the geographic
    locations in which the Company operates. Revenues are attributed
    by geographic location based on the location of the customer.
    The Company’s assets are primarily located in the United
    States and not allocated to any specific region. Therefore,
    geographic information is presented only for net product revenue.

The following presents revenues by geographic region (in
    thousands):

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that
    required information is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the required timeframe, as specified in the
    rules set forth by the Securities Exchange Commission. Our
    disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
    that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and
    communicated to management, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosures.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, evaluated the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
    September 30, 2007 and, based on this evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer have concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
    September 30, 2007.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
    absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
    because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over
    financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence
    and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and
    breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over
    financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or
    improper management override. Because of such limitations, there
    is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or
    detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
    reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known
    features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is
    possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
    not eliminate, this risk.

Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    September 30, 2007. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on the
    results of this assessment and on those criteria, management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of September 30, 2007. Management has excluded
    Acopia Networks, Inc. from its assessment of internal control
    over financial reporting as of September 30, 2007 because
    it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business
    combination during 2007. Acopia Networks, Inc. is a wholly-owned
    subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent
    $5,327,000 and $1,637,000, respectively, of the related
    consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year
    ended September 30, 2007.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of September 30, 2007 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
    herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During the fourth fiscal quarter, there were no changes to our
    internal control over financial reporting that materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal controls over financial reporting.
