Item 1.

Business.

Description of Business

F5 Networks provides integrated products and
services to manage, control and optimize Internet traffic and
content. Our five core products, the BIG-IP® IP Application
Switch & Controller, 3-DNS® Controller,
GLOBAL-SITE™ Controller, EDGE-FX® Cache, and the
SEE-IT™ Network Manager, help manage traffic and content to
servers and network devices in a way that maximizes availability
and throughput. Our unique iControl™ Architecture
integrates our products together and also allows our customers
to integrate them with other third party products. Our solutions
address many elements required for successful Internet and
Intranet business applications, including high availability,
high performance, intelligent load balancing, fault tolerance,
security, streamlined manageability, and global data management
and content control. By enhancing Internet performance
availability and content distribution, our solutions enable our
customers and partners to maximize the use of the Internet in
their business.

Industry Background

Significant growth in the number of Internet
users coupled with the increased availability of powerful new
tools and equipment that enable the development, processing and
distribution of data across the Internet, has led to a
proliferation of Internet-based applications and services, such
as e-commerce, e-mail, electronic file transfers and online
interactive applications. Recently, increases in the number of
Internet users, the use of broadband service, the number of Web
sites using sophisticated business applications and the richness
of Internet content itself, together with unpredictable traffic,
have increased the complexity of Internet service delivery and
strained network infrastructures.

An increasing number of businesses rely on the
Internet as a fundamental commerce and communication tool.
Failure of these businesses to deliver expected availability and
performance for their Internet-based applications can result in
a significant cost to the organization.

To support the dramatic increases in Internet
traffic and complexity, many organizations have aggressively
expanded network server capacity. In this environment,
organizations often deploy multiple servers in a group, or
array, which contains individual application-specific servers or
redundant servers that operate together as a virtual large
server. Server arrays can reduce single points of failure and be
a cost-effective way to increase the potential capacity of the
system by providing the flexibility to add additional servers to
the array as needed. The practice of deploying server arrays in
geographically dispersed sites to help prevent system failure
and direct traffic more efficiently is also a growing trend.

Along with their benefits, server arrays and
geographically dispersed sites have increased the need for
intelligent traffic and content management devices to optimize
server availability and performance. Intelligent traffic
management devices identify which server, whether local or
remote, is best able to handle user requests. They also read and
interpret user requests and route those requests to the most
responsive server or to servers



or arrays that have been designated to handle
specific types of requests. Content management devices include
controllers that replicate published content to ensure that it
is uniformly available on all servers in a network. Cache
servers increase access to content by capturing and storing
content at one or more points between network servers and users.

Currently, many available Internet traffic and
content management products are extensions of hardware-based
switches, which lack the robust functionality required to manage
the increasing complexity of requests and responses that
characterize business activity on the Internet. These products
are typically not designed to address application availability,
nor do they meet the manageability and scalability required by
organizations that depend on the Internet as a fundamental
commerce and communications tool. As a result, we believe they
do not measure up to the demands of today’s rapidly
changing Internet environment.

F5 Solution

F5 is a leading innovator for Internet and
e-Business optimization and automation. We believe our products
deliver the secure and high-performance Internet traffic and
content infrastructure businesses need to succeed.

Our intelligent traffic management products
monitor and manage locally and geographically dispersed servers,
and intelligently direct traffic to the server best able to
handle the user request. Our content management products help
ensure new and updated content is replicated uniformly across
all servers and is readily accessible to all users. As
components of our integrated iControl Architecture, our
solutions ensure Internet quality control by providing the
following key benefits:

High system availability.

Our integrated suite of products works
with servers deployed in a redundant server array over a local
or wide area network to enhance network performance and reduce
single points of failure. Our traffic management products
continuously monitor network performance to enable real-time
detection of server, application and content degradation or
failure. Based on this information, our solutions automatically
direct user requests to functioning servers and applications.
Our products also enable network administrators to deploy new
servers and take individual servers offline for routine
maintenance without disrupting service to end users.

Increased
performance.

Our products provide a
significant performance improvement over other current
approaches. Our traffic and content management products monitor
server and application response time and verify content. This
information is used to intelligently direct user requests to the
server with the fastest response time. They also read and
interpret individual requests and can direct those requests to
specific servers, arrays or sites based on predetermined rules
defined by network managers. As a complement to these products,
our cache servers improve performance by capturing and storing
content at points between network servers and end-users, where
content can be accessed more quickly. By intelligently directing
traffic throughout the network, our solutions reduce server
overload conditions that may cause performance degradation.

Cost-effective scalability.

Our solutions enable more efficient
utilization of existing server capacity by intelligently
directing traffic among servers. This capability allows
organizations to optimize the capacity of existing servers and,
as traffic volume dictates, cost-effectively expand server
capacity through incremental additions of relatively low cost
servers rather than upgrading to larger, more expensive servers.
Our solutions can be used with multiple heterogeneous hardware
platforms, allowing organizations to protect their investments
in their legacy hardware installations as well as integrate
future hardware investments. In addition, strategic deployment
of our cache products can reduce the load on network servers and
minimize the need to add more expensive production server
capacity.

Easier network
manageability.

Our products collect
information that can be used to facilitate network management
and planning from a central location. Leveraging our
products’ strategic location in the network, our solutions
collect data that is crucial for traffic analysis and apply
proprietary trend and analysis tools that synthesize this data
so that network managers can forecast network requirements more
accurately. In addition,



our products automatically synchronize content
across remote locations, helping to ensure users access to the
same content regardless of server location.

Enhanced network control.

Our solutions enable organizations to
prioritize and arrange network traffic based on specific rules
defined by network managers. For example, our products may be
configured to direct traffic over the most cost-efficient
communication links or, alternatively, to deliver the most rapid
response to requests.

Strategy

Our objective is to be the leading provider of
integrated Internet traffic and content management solutions
designed to optimize network availability and performance. Key
components of our strategy to achieve this objective include:

Offer complete secure Internet traffic and
content management solutions.

We plan
to continue expanding our existing suite of products to provide
complete Internet traffic and content management solutions. We
also intend to continue investing in our professional services
group to provide the installation, training and support services
required to help our customers optimize their use of our
integrated traffic and content management products.

Invest in technology to continue to meet
customer needs.

Our current technology
platform has been designed to quickly and easily expand the
features and functionalities of our suite of products and
support the development of additional products that address the
complex and changing needs of our customers. We intend to
maintain our level of investment in research and development to
provide our customers with complete secure Internet traffic and
content management solutions that meet their needs.

Expand sales channels and geographic scope of
sales.

We plan to continue to invest
in the expansion of our sales channels. In addition to
maintaining a strong direct sales force, we intend to further
expand our indirect sales channels through leading industry
resellers, original equipment manufacturers, systems
integrators, Internet service providers and other channel
partners. We are also seeking to aggressively develope our
international sales capabilities, particularly in selected
countries in the European and Asia Pacific markets.

Build and expand relationships with strategic
partners.

We capitalize on products,
technologies and channels that may be available through
partners. We currently have OEM relationships with Dell Computer
Corporation, Nokia and Enterasys Networks. In addition, we have
created significant go-to-market relationships with key
independent software vendors (ISV’s) such as Microsoft,
Oracle, and BEA through our iControl Architecture which enables
these partners to incorporate programmatic interfaces to our
Internet and content management products in their software
programs. We plan to continue to seek relationships with
partners that will enable us to increase the market opportunity
for our products and technologies.

Leverage our market leadership to continue to
build the F5 brand.

We intend to
continue building brand awareness that positions us as one of
the leading providers of intelligent Internet traffic and
content management solutions. Our goal is for the F5 brand to be
synonymous with superior network performance, high quality
customer service and ease of use. To achieve these objectives,
we plan to continue using a broad range of marketing programs,
including active tradeshow participation, advertising in print
publications, direct marketing, high-profile Web events, our
Internet site and joint partner marketing programs.

Products and Technology

We have developed the BIG-IP® IP Application
Switch & Controller, 3-DNS®, GLOBAL-SITE™, the
EDGE-FX™ Cache and the SEE-IT™ Network Manager as an
integrated suite of Internet traffic and content management
products that facilitate high performance, high availability and
scalable access to network server arrays located at a single
site or across multiple, geographically dispersed sites. Our
unique iControl Architecture integrates our traffic and content
management products, provides an interface between third party
solutions and our suite of Internet traffic and content
management products through an Application Programming Interface
(API), and enables total integration and control of Internet
Infrastructure.



Our traffic management products, the BIG-IP and
3-DNS Controllers run on one of two platforms, our existing
Internet protocol (IP) server appliance or our new IP
application switch, the BIG-IP 5000. Our content management
products, EDGE-FX and GLOBAL-SITE, continue to be delivered on
our existing IP server appliances. SEE-IT is a stand-alone
software application.

BIG-IP® 5000 is an IP application switch
uniquely designed to manage traffic for current and next
generation Web services and applications. The BIG-IP 5000
combines the benefits of BIG-IP’s performance-leading
Layer 7 software capabilities, integrated secure sockets
layer (SSL) processing, and high port density (4 gigabit and 24
fast ethernet ports) for scale and economy. The BIG-IP 5000
enables the network infrastructure to accommodate the increasing
demands placed upon the network to support complex Web
applications, data/ voice/ video convergence, and mobile
computing, with vastly simplified management and complete
security. The BIG-IP 5000® provides all-in-one Internet
traffic management, combining: load balancing, content
switching, traffic management, gigabit ethernet switching, SSL
acceleration/ Web acceleration and wide area load balancing into
a single device that dramatically lowers total cost of ownership
and reduces management complexities for enterprises and service
providers.

Our ongoing investment in technology is focused
on achieving continuous performance enhancements, increased
functionality, enhanced ease of use and increased product
integration. The following table describes of our current
traffic and content management products.

IControl API.

IControl is an API (application program interface) that offers a
complete and cohesive architectural solution for the
distribution, delivery, and control of both content and
applications. All of our products are designed to be iControl
enabled. IControl integrates our products together and also
allows integration with third party products. This architecture
allows network managers to configure all components in a network
infrastructure through a single policy that can be centrally
managed. Our most recent version supports two different
transport protocols (COBRA and SOAP) to meet the needs of
different types of businesses.

EDGE-FX Cache.

EDGE-FX is a leading Internet cache server that can be deployed
as a standalone device or integrated with our other products.
EDGE-FX consists of software loaded on a pre-configured,
industry standard hardware platform. EDGE-FX accelerates access
to Web content by storing frequently requested data at strategic
points in a computer network, making it quickly available to
Internet users. As a standalone device, EDGE-FX may be installed
in virtually any network infrastructure. Integrated with our



other traffic and content management products,
EDGE-FX enables customers to implement end-to-end content
delivery solutions and build their own content delivery networks.

EDGE-FX also supports a streaming media extention
option, which enables support for Real Networks, Microsoft
Windows Media or Apple/ Quicktime media types. This option
enables the device to provide live or on-demand serving of
streaming media. As a media enabled cache product, EDGE-FX is a
strategic component in the roll out of private content
distribution networks to enterprise customers. EDGE-FX helps
enable applications such as corporate communications,
travel-less training and other content based uses of the network.

EDGE-FX supports several flexible deployment
options to conserve bandwidth and server resources while
accelerating content to Internet users.

•

Forward Proxy or Transparent Proxy.

EDGE-FX can be deployed in front of
	Web browsers for internal user access. EDGE-FX can be positioned
	as a forward proxy cache, making it valuable for enterprise
	Intranets. Instead of sending requests for Web content directly
	to the origin server, browsers are configured to send requests
	directly to the cache thereby reducing bandwidth utilization
	costs.

•

Reverse Proxy.

When
	deployed in front of Web servers for external user access,
	EDGE-FX offloads client requests from the Web server,
	eliminating the danger of server traffic surges and reducing the
	number or size of servers required.

Designed for massive scalability, multiple
	EDGE-FX caches can be managed with the BIG-IP Cache Controller
	to enable cache farm load balancing, replication of content
	across multiple caches, and Layer 7 management of cached objects.

GLOBAL-SITE Controller.

GLOBAL-SITE, a content delivery
appliance, has been designed to help organizations automate the
distribution and synchronization of content and applications to
local and geographically dispersed sites. GLOBAL-SITE was
developed to work with our other products to intelligently
deploy both program and data files to arrays of heterogeneous
servers as well as the EDGE-FX Cache. GLOBAL-SITE consists of
our proprietary software which is loaded on a pre-configured,
industry-standard hardware platform. GLOBAL-SITE’s
configuration database allows administrators to define standard
rules for content deployment as well as accommodate unique
content distribution events as needed.

SEE-IT Network
Manager.

SEE-IT is a software
application based on F5’s iControl that communicates with
F5 products to help improve the management and functionality of
an organization’s network, thereby driving down the total
cost of ownership. SEE-IT uses data collected by F5 products to
perform monitoring of the F5 appliances, as well as crucial
traffic analysis management functions. By reviewing historical
patterns, network administrators can build predictive models and
forecast usage, which helps them to intelligently plan and
budget for additional server and bandwidth capacity. SEE-IT
consists of the following capabilities:

•

Real-time monitoring

that displays key data on network
	traffic in easy-to-read graphical illustrations, thereby
	enabling network administrators to quickly obtain information
	regarding network and server performance, including data about
	server status and traffic, number of connections, active and
	inactive IP addresses and the availability of individual
	applications.

•

Forward-looking trend and analysis tools

that use the information generated by
	F5’s products to project future network and server needs.
	Network managers and system administrators can use these



tools to create “what if?” scenarios to
	help forecast the need for additional servers, interface
	upgrades and other network capacity requirements.

•

Configuration management

allows users to assure that
	configurations and policies are implemented on each of the F5
	devices. Users can simply and confidently deploy configuration
	or policy updates to respond to the data obtained through the
	monitoring capabilities.

•

Application level views

simplifies the task of understanding
	the purpose of each piece of networking gear that is deployed.
	SEE-IT allows users to “organize” the F5 gear to view
	the network based on the application they are meant to support.

3-DNS
Controller.

3-DNS
is an intelligent wide area traffic management appliance that
manages and distributes user requests across wide area networks.
3-DNS consists of our proprietary software, which we load on a
pre-configured, industry-standard hardware platform. Like
BIG-IP, 3-DNS functions with multiple heterogeneous hardware
platforms and supports a wide variety of network protocols,
including Web, e-mail, audio, video, database and file transfer
protocol, and manages traffic for network devices such as
firewalls, cache servers and multimedia servers.

When an end-user request is received from a local
domain name server or DNS, 3-DNS collects network information
and communicates with each site in the network to determine the
site with the fastest response time. 3-DNS, integrated with
BIG-IP, sends the request to the BIG-IP at the site. BIG-IP then
directs the request to the individual server best able to handle
it. Although organizations can deploy a single 3-DNS in their
network configuration, multiple 3-DNS Controllers are often
deployed within the network to provide redundancy to help ensure
network availability and performance for end users. Additional
3-DNS features include:

•

Dynamic load balancing

optimizes use of available network
	resources across wide area networks.

•

User-defined production rules

allow organizations to pre-configure
	traffic distribution decisions according to their specific user
	requirements.

•

Secure server protection

offers security features for wide area
	networks similar to those BIG-IP provides for local area
	networks.

BIG-IP Controller.

BIG-IP is an intelligent local traffic
management appliance consisting of our proprietary software on a
pre-configured, industry-standard hardware platform. Situated
between a network’s routers and server array, BIG-IP
continuously monitors the array of local servers to ensure
application availability and performance and automatically
directs user requests to the server best able to handle these
requests. By quickly detecting application and server failures,
and directing service toward those servers and applications that
are functioning properly, BIG-IP is designed to shield users
from system failures and provide timely responses to user
requests and data flow. BIG-IP offers a comprehensive selection
of load balancing algorithms that lets network managers choose a
load balancing configuration that best suits their
organization’s particular needs. In addition, BIG-IP
actively queries and checks content received from applications.
If a server and application are responding to users’
requests with incorrect content, BIG-IP redirects requests to
those servers and applications that are responding properly,
thereby helping to ensure the quality of content.

BIG-IP is compatible with any system that uses
the standard Internet communication protocol or IP, and can
operate with multiple, heterogeneous hardware platforms. This
enables organizations to leverage their existing infrastructure
without limiting their options to meet future network needs.
BIG-IP supports a wide variety of network protocols, including
Web, e-mail, audio, video, database and file transfer protocol.
BIG-IP also manages traffic for network devices such as
firewalls that prevent unauthorized access to a network system,
cache servers that store frequently accessed Web content and
multimedia servers. BIG-IP’s ability to intelligently
distribute traffic across server arrays reduces the need for
increasingly larger and more expensive servers to accommodate
increases in network traffic. This configuration also reduces
the single point of failure inherent with a single large server
and allows for the orderly addition of new servers or the
routine maintenance or upgrades of servers without disrupting
service to the end user.



BIG-IP’s unique Layer 7 switching
capability enables the successful delivery of business-critical
applications with 24/7 availability, scalability, and high
performance. Examining traffic at Layer 7 allows
intelligent quality of service (QoS) through routing and
management decisions made based on application information.
BIG-IP enables the use of all of its Layer 7 features
simultaneously without imposing limitations on the length of the
URL, cookie, or location of the cookie – providing
intelligent, granular management of web sites without
performance degradation. Additional BIG-IP features include:

Product Development

We believe that our future success depends on our
ability to build upon our current technology platform, expand
the features and functionalities of our suite of Internet
traffic and content management products and develop additional
products that maintain our technological competitiveness. Our
product development group, which is divided along product lines,
employs a standard process for the design, development,
documentation and quality control of our Internet traffic and
content management solutions. Each product line is headed by a
lead architect, who is responsible for developing the technology
behind the product. To help develop the technology, the lead
architects work closely with our customers to better understand
their requirements. Software engineers who help design and build
the products, and technicians, who perform test engineering,
configuration management, quality assurance and documentation
functions, complete our product development teams. The test
engineering team evaluates the overall quality of our products.
The overall product team determines whether they are ready for
release.

Our product development expenses for fiscal 2001,
2000 and 1999 were $17.4 million, $14.5 million, and
$5.6 million, respectively. Going forward, we expect our
product development expenses to remain consistent with fiscal
2001.

Customers

Our target customers include the Global 1000
corporate enterprises, large e-commerce sites, Internet service
providers and high-traffic Internet or intranet Web sites.
During fiscal 2001 no single reseller or customer exceeded 10%
of our net revenue or our accounts receivable balance. During
fiscal 2000 and 1999,



one of our resellers, Exodus Communications,
accounted for 14% and 22% of our net revenue and 8% and 16% of
our accounts receivable balance, respectively.

Sales and Marketing

We market and sell our Internet traffic and
content management solutions on a global basis through direct
sales and channel partners. We plan to continue investing
significant resources to expand our direct sales force and
further develop our indirect sales channels by developing
relationships with leading industry resellers, original
equipment manufacturers, systems integrators, Internet service
providers and other channel partners. Typically, our agreements
with our channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent
our channel partners from selling competitive products. These
agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation
to renew, and typically do not provide for exclusive sales
territories or minimum purchase requirements.

We continue to seek channel partners for our
products in the United States and selected countries in the
European, Asia Pacific and South American markets.

Our field sales people are located in major
cities throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. The
inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for our regional
sales managers and help manage accounts by serving as a liaison
between our field and internal corporate resources. Our field
systems engineers also support our regional sales managers by
participating in joint sales calls and providing pre-sale
technical resources as needed.

Our marketing programs are focused on creating
awareness of our Internet traffic and content management
solutions targeted at information technology professionals such
as chief information officers. We plan to continue building
strong brand awareness to leverage the value of our Internet
traffic and content management products and professional
services in the marketplace. We believe brand visibility is a
key factor in increasing customer awareness, and our goal is for
the F5 brand to be synonymous with superior performance, high
quality customer service and ease of use. We market our products
and services through a broad range of marketing programs,
including active tradeshow participation, advertising in print
publications, direct marketing, high-profile Web events and our
Internet site.

Professional Services and Technical
Support

We believe that our ability to consistently
provide high-quality customer service and support will be a key
factor in attracting and retaining customers. Prior to the
installation of our Internet traffic and content management
solutions, our professional services team works with
organizations to analyze and understand their special network
needs. They also make recommendations on how to integrate our
solutions to best utilize our product features and functionality
to support their unique network environment. Once our customers
purchase our products, we offer on-site installation and
training services to help our customers make use of the
functionality built into our products. The installation process
generally occurs within 30 days of product shipment to the
customer.

Our technical support team assists our customers
with online updates and upgrades and provides remote support
through a 24x7 help desk. We also offer seminars and training
classes for our customers on the configuration and use of our
products, including local and wide area network system
administration and management. In addition, we provide a full
range of consulting services to our customers, including
comprehensive network management, documentation and performance
analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future
network requirements.

Manufacturing

We outsource the manufacturing of our
pre-configured, industry-standard hardware platforms to several
contract manufacturers, who assemble these hardware platforms to
our specifications. These platforms consist primarily of an
Intel-based computing platform, rack-mounted enclosure system
and custom-designed front panel. We install our proprietary
software onto the hardware platforms and conduct functionality
testing,



quality assurance and documentation control prior
to shipping our products. Subcontractors supply our contract
manufacturers with the standard parts and components for our
products, which consist primarily of motherboards, reboot cards
and chassis for our products, although recently we have begun to
stock certain key components. Generally purchase commitments
with our limited source suppliers are on a purchase order basis.

Competition

Our markets are new, rapidly evolving and highly
competitive, and we expect this competition to persist and
intensify in the future. We compete in the Internet traffic and
content management market primarily on the basis of product
price/performance, features, service, and warranty. Our
principal competitors in the Internet traffic and content
management market include CacheFlow, Cisco Systems, Extreme
Networks, Foundry Networks, Network Appliance, Nortel Networks
and Radware.

Cisco Systems has a product offering similar to
ours and holds the dominant share of the market. Cisco has a
longer operating history and significantly greater financial,
technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Cisco also
has a more extensive customer base and broader customer
relationships including relationships with many of our current
and potential customers that could be leveraged. In addition,
Cisco has large, well established, worldwide customer support
and professional services organizations and a more extensive
direct sales force and sales channels than we do. Cisco and our
other competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or
emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than
we can. There is also the possibility that these companies may
adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share. As a
result, these companies pose a serious competitive threat that
could undermine our ability to win new customers and maintain
our existing customer base. Nevertheless, we believe these
threats are mitigated by differences between the functionality,
performance and integration of our products and those of our
competitors, including Cisco.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark
and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect
our intellectual property rights. We currently do not have any
issued patents but have nine applications pending for various
aspects of our technology. We also enter into confidentiality or
license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate
partners, and control access to, and distribution of, our
software, documentation and other proprietary information.
However, despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and
use our products or technology.

We incorporate software that is licensed from
several third party sources into our products. These licenses
generally renew automatically on an annual basis. We believe
that alternative technologies for this licensed software are
available both domestically and internationally.

Employees

As of September 30, 2001, we employed 490
full-time persons, including 122 in product development, 165 in
sales and marketing, 121 in professional services and technical
support and 82 in finance, administration and operations.

None of our employees are represented by a labor
union. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe that
our employee relations are good.

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings.

On August 8, 2001 a putative securities
class action, captioned Atlas v. F5 Networks, Inc. et al., Civil
Action No. 01-CV-7342, was filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York against the
firms that underwrote our initial public offering, F5 Networks,
and several of our officers and directors. The complaint alleges
violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of
1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated
thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 by F5 Networks and its officers and directors, and seeks
unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class that
purchased F5 Networks’ common stock between June 4,
1999 and December 6, 2000.

On August 15, 2001 a similar complaint,
captioned Lee v. F5 Networks, Inc. et al., Civil Action
No. 01-CV-7625, was filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. The



complaint is substantially identical to the Atlas
complaint: it names the same defendants, contains the virtually
identical claims, and seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a
purported class of purchasers of common stock during an
identical class period.

Various plaintiffs have filed similar actions in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York asserting virtually identical allegations against more
than 200 other issuers. These cases have all been assigned to
the Hon. Shira A. Scheindlin for coordination and decisions
on pretrial motions, discovery, and related matters other than
trial. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the
lawsuits and will defend ourselves vigorously in the litigation.
An unfavorable resolution of the actions could have a material,
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

We are not aware of any additional pending legal
proceedings against us that, individually or in the aggregate,
would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results, or financial condition. We may in the future be party
to litigation arising in the course of our business, including
claims that we allegedly infringe third-party trademarks and
other intellectual property rights. Such claims, even if not
meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant
financial and managerial resources.

Market
for Registrant’s Common Stock and Related Shareholder
Matters.

Market Prices and Dividends on Common
Stock

Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National
Market (symbol: FFIV) and has been traded on Nasdaq since
our initial public offering in June of 1999. The following table
sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock as
reported on Nasdaq.

As of December 27, 2001 there were 117
holders of record of our common stock, although we believe the
number of beneficial holders of our common stock to be
substantially greater.

Our policy has been to reinvest earnings to fund
future growth. Accordingly, we have not paid dividends and do
not anticipate declaring dividends on our common stock in the
foreseeable future.

Recent Sales of Unregistered
Securities

On June 26, 2001, we entered into a Common
Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement with Nokia Finance
International B.V. (“NFI”). Under this Agreement, we
issued and sold to NFI (i) 2,466,421 shares of common stock
and (ii) warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase
additional shares of common stock. We received total proceeds of
$34.9 million, net of $1.8 million in estimated
issuance costs from the sale of these shares and the Warrants.
The Warrants allow NFI to purchase additional shares of common
stock to increase



its ownership percentage in the Company (up to a
maximum of one share less than 20%) during three ten business
day periods beginning on December 31, 2001, June 30,
2002 and December 31, 2002, at an exercise price equal to
the average 10-day closing price before the start of each
period. These securities were sold in reliance on the exemption
from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act as transactions by an issuer not involving a
public offering.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.

The following Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should

Notes

Results of Operations

Overview

Total net revenues declined 1% in fiscal 2001
from fiscal 2000, compared to an increase of 290% in fiscal 2000
from fiscal 1999. The decrease in fiscal 2001 was primarily due
to lower product sales as a result of a downturn in the US
economy in fiscal 2001. Our reduced product sales were partially
offset by an increase in service revenues resulting from
maintenance renewals for our installed base of products. The
increase in fiscal 2000 revenues was due to an expansion of
indirect sales programs and an increase in our installed base
service revenues.

International revenues represented 33%, 19%, and
8% of total sales in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.
Fiscal 2001 was the first complete fiscal year for which we had
subsidiaries in the Asia Pacific region which contributed to the
increase in our international sales. We plan to continue to make
significant investments in our international operations,
particularly in the European and Asia Pacific markets.
International revenues are expected to continue to represent a
significant portion of our net revenues, although we cannot be
assured that these revenues as a percentage of net revenues will
remain at their current levels.

Revenues from the sale of our products and
software licenses are recognized, net of allowances for
estimated returns, when the product has been shipped and the
customer is obligated to pay for the product. Estimated sales
returns are based on historical experience by product and are
recorded at the time revenues are recognized. Services revenue
for installation is recognized when the product has been
installed at the customer’s site. Revenues for customer
support are recognized on a straight-line basis over the service
contract term. Consulting services are customarily billed at
fixed rates, plus out-of-pocket expenses, and revenues from
consulting services are recognized at the end of the quarter in
which they are performed.

Sales of BIG-IP represented 64%, 62%, and 73% of
total net revenues in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively,
and we expect to derive a significant portion of our net
revenues from sales of BIG-IP in the future. During fiscal 2001
no single reseller or customer exceeded 10% of net revenue or
our accounts receivable balance. During fiscal 2000 and 1999,
one of our resellers, Exodus Communications, accounted for 14%
and 22% of net revenue and 8% and 16% of our accounts receivable
balance, respectively. In association with Exodus filing
Chapter 11 bankruptcy, we recorded a non-recurring
adjustment to our bad-debt expense of $1.75 million and a
charge of $226,000 in cost of goods sold related to anticipated
inventory lease payments not received by Exodus during fiscal
2001.

Total cost of net revenues, as a percentage of
total revenues, increased to 42.4% in fiscal 2001 from 30.0% in
fiscal 2000 and 25.9% in fiscal 1999. The increase in fiscal
2001, compared to the prior year, relates to a non-recurring
inventory reserve charge, costs associated with platform
changes, a decrease in average selling price as a result of a
change in product mix and an increase in personnel costs. The
increase in fiscal 2000 was the result of higher production
costs associated with hardware configuration enhancements and
increased personnel costs, including training and consulting.

Total operating expenses were $90.6 million,
$63.2 million, and $25.5 million in fiscal 2001, 2000,
and 1999, respectively. The 43.3% increase in total operating
expense in fiscal 2001, compared to the prior year, is primarily
the result of our continued investment in international
operations, additional personnel costs, facilities costs, an
increase in bad debt as a result of our relationship with Exodus
and non-recurring restructuring charges. The 147.9% increase in
operating expense in fiscal 2000, compared to the prior year, is
primarily a result of an increase in total headcount to 496 from
187 at the end of fiscal 1999.



Revenues
(in thousands):

Net revenues.

Net
revenues consist of sales of our products, which include
software licenses, and services. Services include revenue from
installation, service and support agreements provided as part of
the initial product sale, sales of extended service and support
contracts, and training.

Product revenues.

Product revenues were
$78.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2001 compared to $88.0 million for the year ended
September 30, 2000 and $23.4 million for the year
ended September 30, 1999. The 10.6% decrease in fiscal year
2001 was primarily the result of reduced demand for our products
in the US due to a general slow down in the US economy. Product
revenues for fiscal year 2000 increased 275.7% from the prior
year as a result of an expansion in indirect sales programs and
a higher volume of unit sales from the direct sales force.

Service revenues.

Service revenues were
$28.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2001 compared to $20.7 million for the year ended
September 30, 2000 and $4.4 million for the year ended
September 30, 1999. Service revenues increased by 39.1% in
fiscal year 2001 and 369.1% in fiscal year 2000. These increases
primarily resulted from an increase in the installed base of our
products and the renewal of service and support contracts by our
current customers.

Customers who purchase our products can utilize
our installation services and an initial customer support
contract, typically covering a 12-month period. We generally
combine the software license, installation, and customer support
elements of our products into a package with a single price. We
allocate a portion of the sales price to each element of the
bundled package based on their respective fair values when the
individual elements are sold separately. Customers may also
purchase consulting services and renew their initial customer
support contract.



Gross Margin (in
thousands):

Cost of net revenues.

Cost of net revenues consists
primarily of outsourced hardware components and manufacturing
costs, fees for third-party software products integrated into
our products, service and support personnel and an allocation of
our facilities and depreciation expenses.

Cost of product revenues.

Cost of product revenues increased
34.8% to $33.2 million for the year ended September 30,
2001 from $24.7 million for the year ended
September 30, 2000. The cost of product revenues for fiscal
2000 represents a 341.8% increase over cost of product revenues
of $5.6 million for the year ended September 30, 1999.
Cost of product revenues increased as a percent of net product
revenue to 42.3% for fiscal year 2001 from 28.0% for fiscal year
2000 and 23.8% for fiscal year 1999. The increase in fiscal 2001
was the result of costs associated with platform changes and an
increase in personnel costs. The increase in fiscal 2000 was the
result of higher production costs associated with hardware
configuration enhancements and also changes related to obsolete
inventory and purchase commitments. The cost of raw materials
may fluctuate in the future, which could have a negative impact
on our gross margin.

Cost of service
revenues.

Cost of service revenues
increased to $12.3 million for fiscal 2001 from $7.9 for
fiscal 2000 and $1.6 million for fiscal 1999. Cost of
service revenues increased as a percent of net service revenues
to 42.7% for fiscal year 2001 from 38.3% for fiscal year 2000
and 36.7% for fiscal year 1999. The increase in cost of service
revenue in fiscal 2001 and 2000, compared to the prior years, is
due to an increase in customer base and an increase in personnel
and the related costs.

Provision for excess inventory.

Due to changes in current market
conditions and a revision of our sales forecast, a review was
made of our inventory needs and an assessment of our future
purchase commitments during fiscal 2001. As a result, we
determined two provisions for excess inventory and future
purchase commitments would be recorded. The first provision for
excess inventory was charged to cost of revenues in the amount
of $3.9 million, which consisted of a $3.1 million
inventory valuation allowance and approximately $800,000 of
future purchase commitments. As of September 30, 2001,
$1.5 million of this reserve had been utilized. The second
provision for excess inventory was in the amount of $1.0
million. This charge is associated with charge is associated
with the changes in the configuration of our EDGE-FX Cache
product, which will increase the functionality of the product.
These costs are associated with updating both existing inventory
and product previously sold to customers, as well as costs to
fulfill existing purchase commitments and have been included in
cost of revenues for the for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2001. As of September 30, 2001, $232,000
of this reserve had been utilized.



Operating
expenses (in thousands):

Sales and marketing.

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries,
commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing
staff, costs of our marketing programs, including public
relations, advertising and trade shows, and an allocation of our
facilities and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing
expenses increased by 37.6% to $50.8 million in fiscal 2001
from $36.9 million in fiscal year 2000. In fiscal 2000,
sales and marketing expenses increased by 173% from
$13.5 million in fiscal 1999. The increase in fiscal 2001,
compared to the prior year, was due to an increase in headcount
and the related costs, an increase in advertising and
promotional activities including activities related to new
product launches. The increase in fiscal 2000 was primarily due
to a significant increase in headcount from the prior year. We
expect to continue increasing sales and marketing expenses in
order to grow net revenues and expand our brand awareness.

Research and development.

Research and development expenses
consist primarily of salaries and related benefits for our
product development personnel and an allocation of our
facilities and depreciation expenses. Research and development
expenses increased by 20.4% to $17.4 million in fiscal 2001
from $14.5 million, and in fiscal 2000 by 156% from
$5.6 million in fiscal 1999. The increase in fiscal year
2001 relates primarily to personnel related costs and an
increase in facilities cost related to the new Spokane office.
The increase in fiscal 2000, compared to the prior period, is
also due to a significant increase in headcount. Our future
success is dependent, in large part on the continued enhancement
of our current products and our ability to develop new,
technologically advanced products that meet the sophisticated
needs of our customers. We expect research and development
expenses to remain at a consistent level with fiscal 2001.

General and
administrative.

General and
administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits
and related costs of our executive, finance, human resource and
legal personnel, third-party professional service fees, and an
allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses. General
and administrative expenses increased by 93.0% in fiscal 2001 to
$18.8 million from $9.7 in fiscal year 2000. These expenses
increased in fiscal year 2000 by 151.4% from $3.9 million
for fiscal year 1999. The increases in fiscal 2001 were due to
an increase in bad debt expense due to the relationship with
Exodus Communications and an increase in headcount and other
payroll related costs. The fiscal 2000 increase was primarily
due to increases in the general and administrative headcount.

Restructuring
charge.

During the first fiscal
quarter of 2001, we recorded a restructuring charge of
$1.1 million in connection with management decision to
bring operating expenses in line with the business



revenue growth model. As a result of change in
the business revenue growth model, we terminated 96 employees
throughout all divisions of the company. As of
September 30, 2001, substantially all of the restructuring
charge accrued for during the first fiscal quarter of 2001, had
been paid.

Unearned compensation.

We have recorded a total of
$8.3 million of stock compensation costs since our
inception through September 30, 2001. These charges
represent the difference between the exercise price and the
deemed fair value of certain stock options granted to our
employees and outside directors. These options generally vest
ratably over a four-year period. We are amortizing these costs
using an accelerated method as prescribed by FASB interpretation
No. 28 (“FIN No. 28”) and have recorded
stock compensation charges of $2.6 million,
$2.1 million and $2.5 million for the years ended
September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

We expect to recognize amortization expense
related to unearned compensation of approximately $443,000 and
$83,000 during the years ended September 30, 2002 and 2003,
respectively. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will not
accrue additional stock compensation costs in the future or that
our current estimate of these costs will prove accurate.

Other
Income and Taxes (in thousands):

Other income, net.

Other income consists primarily of
earnings on our cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term
investments. Other income decreased 30.0% to $2.0 million
in fiscal year 2001 from $2.9 million in fiscal year 2000.
Other income increased by 444.0% in fiscal 2000 from
$0.6 million in fiscal year 1999. These fluctuations
primarily relate to interest income of $2.6 million for
fiscal year 2001, $3.2 million for the fiscal year 2000 and
$0.5 million for the fiscal year 1999.

Income taxes.

The
income tax provision increased to $4.1 million in fiscal
2001 from $2.1 million in fiscal 2000 and zero in fiscal
1999. The increase in the provision for income taxes was caused
by our decision to provide for a full valuation allowance
against its deferred tax assets in fiscal year 2001. FASB
Statement 109 provides for the recognition of deferred tax
assets if it is more likely than not that those deferred tax
assets will be realized. Based on the available evidence at the
time, the valuation allowance was partially reversed in fiscal
year 2000 for the assets we considered realizable. In fiscal
year 2001, the changes in the current economic environment
caused us reevaluate the need to provide for a full valuation
allowance. Based on the weight of all the available positive and
negative evidence, we determined that a full valuation allowance
should be provided to completely offset the net deferred tax
assets.

that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our
operating results for the quarters presented. You should not
draw any conclusions about our future results from the results
of operations for any quarter.



Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated
significantly and we expect that future operating results will
be subject to similar fluctuations for a variety of factors,
many of which are substantially outside our control. See
“Risk Factors-Our quarterly operating results are volatile
and may cause our stock price to fluctuate.”

Liquidity and Capital Resources (in
thousands)

From our inception through May 1999, we financed
our operations and capital expenditures primarily through the
sale of approximately $12.4 million in equity securities.
In June 1999, we completed an initial public offering of
2,860,000 shares of common stock and raised approximately
$25.5 million, net of offering costs. In October 1999, we
completed a secondary public offering of 500,000 shares of
common stock and raised approximately $31.4 million, net of
offering costs.

On June 26, 2001, we entered into a Common
Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement with Nokia Finance
International B.V. (“NFI”). Under this agreement, we
issued and sold to NFI (i) 2,466,421 shares of common stock
and (ii) warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase
additional shares of common stock. We received total proceeds of
$34.9 million, net of $1.8 million in estimated
issuance costs from the sale of these shares and the Warrants.
The Warrants allow NFI to purchase additional shares of common
stock to increase its ownership percentage in the company (up to
a maximum of one share less than 20%) during three ten business
day periods beginning on December 31, 2001, June 30,
2002 and December 31, 2002, at an exercise price equal to
the average 10-day closing price before the start of each period.

We recorded the issuance of the common stock and
Warrants by allocating the net proceeds to the Common Stock and
the Warrants, based upon their relative fair values at the date
of issuance. The fair value allocated to the Warrants was
$1.7 million based on an independent valuation. Based upon
the relative fair value at the date of issuance, the amount of
net proceeds allocated to the Warrants and included as a
component of common stock was $1.6 million. The amount
allocated to the common stock was $33.3 million.

Cash used in operating activities during fiscal
2001 was $11.7 million, compared to cash provided by
operating activities of $9.8 million in fiscal 2000 and
cash used in operating activities of $2.0 million in fiscal
1999. Cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2001 resulted
primarily from operating losses, partially offset by a decrease
in net accounts receivable. Cash used for operating expenses in
fiscal 1999 resulted from increases in accounts receivable due
to increased sales and other current assets, which were
partially offset by increases in accounts payable, accrued
liabilities and deferred revenues.



Cash used in investing activities was
$8.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2001,
$16.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2000
and $5.6 million for the year ended September 30,
1999. The $8.1 million used in fiscal 2001 includes
$9.2 million used to purchase property and equipment,
partially offset by a construction refund. The cash used for
investing activities in fiscal 2000 was the result of
$13.3 million used to purchase property and equipment and
$3.0 million used to invest in restricted cash in order to
obtain an irrevocable standby letter of credit to secure our
commitment to lease office space. In fiscal 1999, the
$5.6 million cash used in investing activities was the
result of $2.6 million used to purchase property and
equipment and $3.0 million used to invest in restricted cash
related to the lease.

As of September 30, 2001, our principal
commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating
leases. In April 2000, we entered into a lease agreement on two
buildings for a new corporate headquarters. The lease commenced
in July 2000 on the first building; and the lease on the second
building commenced in October 2000. The lease for both buildings
expires in 2012 with an option for renewal. We established a
restricted escrow account in connection with this lease
agreement. Under the term of the lease, a $6.0 million
irrevocable standby letter of credit is required through
November 2012, unless the lease is terminated before then. This
amount has been included on our balance sheet as of
September 30, 2001 as a component of restricted cash.
Although we have no other material commitments, we anticipate an
increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments
consistent with our anticipated growth in our operations,
infrastructure and personnel. In the future we may also require
a larger inventory of products in order to provide better
availability to customers and achieve purchasing efficiencies.
Any such increase can be expected to reduce cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments. We expect that our
existing cash balances and cash from operations will be
sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital
expenditures for the foreseeable future.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July of 2001 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 141
“Business Combinations” which is effective for all
business combinations initiated after July 1, 2001. SFAS
No. 141, supersedes APB Opinion No. 16, Business
Combinations, and FASB Statement No. 38, Accounting for
Pre-acquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises and
requires that all business combinations be accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting. Further, SFAS No. 141
requires certain intangibles to be recognized as assets apart
from goodwill if they meet certain criteria and also requires
expanded disclosures regarding the primary reasons for
consummation of the combination and the allocation of the
purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed by major balance sheet caption. We do not believe the
standard will have a significant impact on our financial
position.

In July of 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 142 supercedes APB Opinion
No. 17, Intangible Assets, and addresses financial
accounting and reporting for intangible assets acquired
individually or with a group of other assets and the accounting
and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets
subsequent to their acquisition. Under the model set forth in
SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized to earnings,
but instead be subject to periodic testing for impairment. We do
not believe the standard will have a significant impact on our
financial position.

In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”
FASB 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It
applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of
long-lived assets that result from the acquisition,
construction, development, and (or) the normal operation of a
long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. The
provisions of FAS 143 will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2002, however early application is
permitted. We do not believe FAS 143 will have a
significant impact on our financial statements.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.” This Statement addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment or disposal of



long-lived assets. This Statement supersedes FASB
Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,
and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion
No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations —
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business,
and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions, for the disposal of a segment of a business. The
provisions of FAS 144 will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. We are currently
evaluating the implications of adoption of FAS 144 and
anticipates adopting its provisions in fiscal year 2002.

Risk Factors

In addition to the other information in this
report, the following risk factors should be carefully
considered in evaluating our company and its business.

Our quarterly
operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to
fluctuate.

Our quarterly operating results have varied
significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the
future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future
operating results. In particular, we anticipate that the size of
customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger
business accounts. A delay in the recognition of revenue, even
from just one account, may have a significant negative impact on
our results of operations for a given period. In the past, a
significant portion of our sales have been realized near the end
of a quarter. Accordingly, a delay in an anticipated sale past
the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our
results of operations for that quarter. Furthermore, we base our
decisions regarding our operating expenses on anticipated
revenue trends and our expense levels are relatively fixed.
Consequently, if revenue levels fall below our expectations, our
net income will decrease because only a small portion of our
expenses vary with our revenues. See Item 7 of Part
II — “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of
our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be
relied upon as indicators of future performance. Our operating
results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and
investors in some future quarter or quarters. Our failure to
meet these expectations will likely seriously harm the market
price of our common stock.

Our business
may be harmed by economic and market conditions.

Our business is subject to the effects of general
economic conditions in the United States and globally and market
conditions in the Internet and technology sectors in particular.
Unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending has
contributed to a decline in our product sales during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2001. A continued downturn in the economic
conditions or economic uncertainty could adversely impact
potential customers’ ability and willingness to purchase
our products, which would cause a further decline in our sales
and operating results.

Our success
depends on sales of our
BIG-IP®

.

We currently derive approximately 64% of our net
revenues from sales of our BIG-IP product line. In addition, we
expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from
sales of BIG-IP in the future. Implementation of our strategy
depends upon BIG-IP being able to solve critical network
availability and performance problems of our customers. If
BIG-IP is unable to solve these problems for our customers, our
business and results of operations will be seriously harmed.

Our success
depends on our timely development of new products and
features.

We expect the Internet traffic and content
management market to be characterized by rapid technological
change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer
requirements and evolving industry standards. Our continued
success depends on our ability to identify and develop new
products and new features for our existing products to meet the
demands of these changes, and for those products and features to
be accepted by our existing and target customers. If we are
unable to identify, develop and deploy new



products and new product features on a timely
basis, or if those products do not gain market acceptance, our
business and results of operations may be seriously harmed. See
Item 1 of Part I —
“Business — Product Development.”

We may not be able to compete effectively
	in the emerging Internet traffic and content management
	market.

Our markets are new, rapidly evolving and highly
competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify
in the future. Our principal competitors in the Internet traffic
and content management market include Cisco Systems, CacheFlow,
Foundry Networks, Inktomi, Network Appliances, Extreme Networks,
Nortel Networks and RadWare. We expect to continue to face
additional competition as new participants enter the Internet
traffic and content management market. In addition, larger
companies with significant resources, brand recognition and
sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing
Internet traffic and content management solutions and emerge as
significant competitors. Potential competitors may bundle their
products or incorporate an Internet traffic and content
management component into existing products in a manner that
discourages users from purchasing our products. Potential
customers may also choose to purchase additional or larger
servers instead of our products. See Item 1 of
Part I — “Business —
Competition.”

The average selling price of our products
	may decrease and our costs may increase, which may negatively
	impact gross profits.

We anticipate that the average selling prices of
our products will decrease in the future in response to
competitive pricing pressures, increased sales discounts, new
product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors.
Therefore, in order to maintain our gross profits, we must
develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a
timely basis and continually reduce our product costs. Our
failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to
decline, which will seriously harm our business and results of
operations. In addition, we may experience substantial
period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results due to
the erosion of our average selling prices.

It is difficult to predict our future
	operating results because we have an unpredictable sales
	cycle.

Our products have a lengthy sales cycle which is
difficult to predict. Historically, our sales cycle has ranged
from approximately two to three months. Sales of BIG-IP, 3-DNS,
GLOBAL-SITE, SEE-IT, and EDGE-FX require us to educate potential
customers in their use and benefits. The sale of our products is
subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting, approval
and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and
governmental entities may require. For example, customers
frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis
and devote time and resources to testing our products before
they decide whether or not to purchase. Customers may also defer
orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or
enhancements by us or our competitors. As a result, our products
have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the
uncertainty of our future operating results.

We may not be able to sustain or develop
	new distribution relationships.

Our sales strategy requires that we establish
multiple and maintain distribution channels in the United States
and internationally through leading industry resellers, original
equipment manufacturers, systems integrators, Internet service
providers and other channel partners. We have a limited number
of agreements with companies in these channels, and we may not
be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or
maintain our existing relationships. During fiscal 2001 no
single reseller or customer exceeded 10% of net revenue or our
accounts receivable balance. If we are unable to establish and
maintain our indirect sales channels, our business and results
of operations will be seriously harmed.



Our expansion into international markets
	may not succeed.

We intend to continue expanding into
international markets. We have limited experience in marketing,
selling and supporting our products internationally.
International sales represented 33% of our net revenues for the
year ended September 30, 2001, 19% of our net revenues for
the year ended September 30, 2000 and 7.7% of our net
revenues for the year ended September 30, 1999. We have
engaged sales personnel in Australia, Europe, and Asia Pacific.
Our continued growth will require further expansion of our
international operations in selected countries in the European
and Asia Pacific markets. If we are unable to expand our
international operations successfully and in a timely manner,
our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed.
Such expansion may be more difficult or take longer than we
anticipate, and we may not be able to successfully market, sell,
deliver and support our products internationally.

Our operating results are exposed to risks
	associated with international commerce.

As our international sales increase, our
operating results become more exposed to international operating
risks. These risks include risks related to foreign currency
exchange rates, managing foreign sales offices, regulatory,
political, or economic conditions in specific countries, changes
in laws and tariffs, inadequate protection of intellectual
property rights in foreign countries, foreign regulatory
requirements, and natural disasters. All of these factors could
have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our success depends on our key personnel
	and our ability to attract, train and retain qualified marketing
	and sales, professional services and customer support
	personnel.

Our success depends to a significant degree upon
the continued contributions of our key management, product
development, sales, marketing and finance personnel, many of
whom will be difficult to replace. The complexity of our
Internet traffic and content management products and their
integration into existing networks and ongoing support, as well
as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort,
requires us to retain highly-trained professional services,
customer support and sales personnel. In spite of the economic
downturn, competition for qualified professional services,
customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense
because of the limited number of people available with the
necessary technical skills and understanding of our products.
Our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely
affected by volatility or reductions in our stock price, since
these employees are generally granted stock options. The loss of
services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain
and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in
hiring qualified personnel, may seriously harm our business and
results of operations.

Our business may be harmed if our contract
	manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies
	of our products.

We rely on third party contract manufacturers to
assemble our products. We outsource the manufacturing of our
pre-configured, industry-standard hardware platforms to three
contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to
our specifications. We have experienced minor delays in
shipments from these contract manufacturers in the past which
have not had a material impact on our results of operations. We
may experience delays in the future or other problems, such as
inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product, any of
which may seriously harm our business and results of operations.
The inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with
adequate supplies of our products or the loss of our contract
manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders
while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may seriously
harm our business and results of operations.

If the demand for our products grows, we will
need to increase our material purchases, contract manufacturing
capacity and internal test and quality functions. Any
disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue, may seriously
harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs
or cancellation of orders by our customers. See Item 1 of
Part I — “Business —
Manufacturing.”



Our business could suffer if there are any
	interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components
	from our third-party sources.

We currently purchase several hardware components
used in the assembly of our products from limited sources. Lead
times for these components vary significantly. Any interruption
or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components, or
the inability to procure a similar component from alternate
sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, will
seriously harm our business and results of operations. See
Item 1 of Part I —
“Business — Manufacturing.”

Undetected software errors may seriously
	harm our business and results of operations.

Software products frequently contain undetected
errors when first introduced or as new versions are released. We
have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new
products and product upgrades. We expect that these errors will
be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after
commencement of commercial shipments. These problems may cause
us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the
attention of our engineering personnel from our product
development efforts and cause significant customer relations
problems. We may also be subject to liability claims for damages
related to product errors. While we carry insurance policies
covering this type of liability, these policies may not provide
sufficient protection should a claim be asserted. A material
product liability claim may seriously harm our business and
results of operations.

Our products must successfully operate with
products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in
a network, it may be difficult to identify the source of the
problem. The occurrence of software errors, whether caused by
our products or another vendor’s products, may result in
the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products. The
occurrence of any of these problems may seriously harm our
business and results of operations.

We may not adequately protect our
	intellectual property and our products may infringe on the
	intellectual property rights of third parties.

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark
and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of
confidential and proprietary information to protect our
intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our
proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or
otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring
unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be
certain that the steps we have taken will prevent
misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign
countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights
as fully as in the United States. In addition, we have not
entered into non-competition agreements with several of our
former employees.

From time to time, third parties may assert
exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual
property rights claims or initiate litigation against us or our
contract manufacturers, suppliers or customers with respect to
existing or future products. Our license agreements typically
require us to indemnify our customers for infringement actions
related to our technology, which could cause us to become
involved in infringement claims against our customers. We may in
the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties
for infringement of our proprietary rights to determine the
scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our
competitors. Any of these claims, with or without merit, may be
time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of
technical and management personnel or require us to cease using
infringing technology, develop non-infringing technology or
enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or
licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on
acceptable terms, if at all. In the event of a successful claim
of infringement and our failure or inability to develop
non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar
technology on a timely basis, our business and results of
operations may be seriously harmed.

Our stock price may be
	volatile.

Our stock price has historically experienced
substantial volatility. In addition, the stock market and
technology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price
and volume fluctuations that often have been



unrelated to the performance of these companies.
In the future, the price of our stock may be affected by a
number of factors, including variations between our operating
results and analysts’ expectations, announcements by us or
our competitors, or general market conditions.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.

Interest Rate Risk.

We do not hold derivative financial
instruments or equity securities in our investment portfolio.
The Board of Directors authorized one transaction to purchase
and sell publicly traded company options. Our cash equivalents
consist of high-quality securities, as specified in our
investment policy guidelines. The policy limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 20%
of the total portfolio with the exception of treasury
securities, commercial paper and money market funds, which are
exempt from size limitation. The policy limits all short-term
investments to mature in two years or less, with the average
maturity being one year or less. These securities are subject to
interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates
increase.

Foreign Currency Risk.

Currently the majority of our sales
and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result, we
have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and
losses to date. While we have conducted some transactions in
foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended September 30,
2001 and expect to continue to do so, we do not anticipate that
foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant at our
current level of operations. However, as we continue to expand
our operations internationally, they may become significant in
the future. We have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to
date, however we may do so in the future.

2.     Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies:

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United Sates of America.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and all majority owned subsidiaries. Significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
year balances to conform to the current year presentation. These
reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net loss,
shareholders’ equity or cash flows.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements is in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Estimates that are particularly susceptible to
changes in the near term are the adequacy of allowances for
sales returns and bad debt, inventory obsolescence, warranty
costs and deferred taxes.

Cash Equivalents and Short-term
Investments

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments,
consisting of investments in money market funds and short-term
investments which are readily convertible to cash without
penalty and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
The Company’s cash equivalents and short term investments
balance consists of the following (in thousands):



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company places its temporary cash investments
with five major financial institutions.

The Company’s customers are from diverse
industries and geographic locations. Net revenues from
international customers are primarily denominated in U.S.
Dollars and were approximately $35.0 million,
$20.6 million and $2.2 million for the years ended
September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During
fiscal 2001 no single reseller or customer exceeded 10% of the
Company’s net revenue or accounts receivable balance.
During fiscal 2000 and 1999, one of the Company’s
resellers, Exodus Communications, accounted for 14% and 22% of
net revenue and 8% and 16% of the Company’s accounts
receivable balance, respectively. In association with Exodus
filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the Company recorded a
non-recurring adjustment to its bad-debt expense of
$1.75 million and $226,000 in cost of goods sold related to
the leased inventory during fiscal 2001. The Company does not
require collateral to support credit sales. Allowances are
maintained for potential credit losses and sales returns.

Inventories

Inventories consist of hardware and the related
component parts and are recorded at the lower of cost or market
(as determined by the first-in, first-out method).

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash represents a restricted escrow
account established in connection with a lease agreement for the
company’s corporate headquarters. Under the term of the
lease, a $6.0 million standby letter of credit is required
through November 2012, unless the lease is terminated before
then.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of
capital leases are provided on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets of 2 to 5 years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term
of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements.

The cost of normal maintenance and repairs is
charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for major
improvements are capitalized at cost. Gains or losses on the
disposition of assets in the normal course of business are
reflected in the results of operations at the time of disposal.

Software Development Costs

Software development costs incurred in
conjunction with product development are charged to research and
development expense until technological feasibility is
established. Thereafter, until the product is released for sale,
software development costs are capitalized and reported at the
lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value of each
product. The establishment of technological feasibility and the
on-going assessment of recoverability of costs require
considerable judgment by the Company with respect to certain
internal and external factors, including, but not limited to,
anticipated future gross product revenues, estimated economic
life and changes in hardware and software technology. The
Company amortizes capitalized software costs using the
straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the
product, generally three years. In fiscal 2001, the Company
capitalized $327,000 in software development costs, generally
representing labor costs, and recorded no related amortization.



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically evaluates the carrying
value of long-lived assets to be held and used, including, but
not limited to, property and equipment, other assets, and
deferred income taxes, when events and circumstances warrant
such a review. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is
considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow
from the asset is separately identifiable and is less than its
carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the
long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the
anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of
are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are
reduced for the cost to dispose.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 48,
“Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists,” SEC
Staff Accounting Bulleting (SAB) No. 101,
“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,”
Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 97-2,
“Software Revenue Recognition,” and SOP No. 98-9
“Modification of SOP No. 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions.”

The Company sells products through resellers,
original equipment manufacturers and other channel partners, as
well as to end users, under similar terms. Typically this
combines software license, installation and customer support
elements into a package with a single “bundled” price
and allocates a portion of the sales price to each element of
the bundled package based on their respective fair values when
the individual elements are sold separately. Revenues from the
license of software, net of an allowance for estimated returns,
are recognized when the product has been shipped and the
customer is obligated to pay for the product. Installation
revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the
customer’s site. Revenues for customer support are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the service contract
term. Estimated sales returns are based on historical experience
by product and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized.

The following presents revenues by shipment
destination for the years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999 (in
thousands):

Warranty Expense

The Company generally offers warranties between
90 days and one year depending on whether it relates to
hardware or software. Estimated future warranty obligations
related to products are provided by charges to operations in the
period in which the related revenue is recognized. These
estimates are based on historical warranty experience and other
relevant information of which the Company is aware. During the
years ended September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999 warranty
expense was $0.4 million, $2.3 million and
$0.3 million, respectively.

Advertising expense was approximately $1.5 million,
$1.6 million and $1.0 million for the years ended
September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the
liability method of accounting. Under the liability method,
deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between
the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities
at enacted tax rates in effect in the year in which the
differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are
established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to
estimated amounts expected to be realized.

Foreign Currency Translation

The financial statements of F5 Networks, Ltd., F5
Networks, Singapore Pte. Ltd. and F5 Networks, Japan K.K. have
been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 “Foreign
Currency Translation.” Under the provisions of this
Statement, all assets and liabilities in the balance sheet of
the subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates, and
translation gains and losses are reported as a component of
comprehensive income (loss) and are accumulated in a
separate component of shareholders’ equity. Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect
of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in
currencies other than the functional currency, including US
dollars. Gains and losses on those foreign currency transactions
are included in determining net income or loss for the period of
exchange. Transaction losses for the fiscal years ended
September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999 of $139,000, $84,000, and
$0, respectively, were charged to operations.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130,
“Reporting Comprehensive Income,” in June 1997. This
statement establishes standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income in the financial statements and was adopted
by the Company during the quarter ended September 30, 1999.
In addition to net income (loss), comprehensive income
(loss) includes charges or credits to equity that are not
the result of transactions with shareholders. For the Company,
this includes foreign currency translation and unrealized gains
and losses on investments. The Company has included components
of comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of
Shareholders’ Equity.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based employee
compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB
No. 25”), “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” and FASB interpretation No. 44 (“FIN
No. 44”) accounting for certain transactions involving
stock compensation, and complies with the disclosure provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(“SFAS No. 123”), “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.” Under APB No. 25,
compensation expense is based on the difference, if any, on the
date of the grant, between the deemed fair value of the
Company’s stock and the exercise price of the option. The
unearned compensation is being amortized in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 28
on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the
individual options. The Company accounts for equity instruments
issued to nonemployees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 123.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

For certain financial instruments, including cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, recorded amounts approximate market value,
due to the short maturities of these instruments.

Earnings per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by
dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
(loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by
the weighted average number of common and dilutive common stock
equivalent shares outstanding during the period. For periods in
which the Company incurred a net loss, dilutive common stock
equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation as their
impact would have been antidilutive. The antidilutive securities
not included in diluted net loss per share calculation totaled
1,533,386 shares.

The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the years
ended September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999 (in thousands,
except per share data).

Derivatives

In the first quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities (“SFAS 133”) which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
and for hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires that an
entity recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities on
the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.
The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative
depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation.

The Company designates the derivatives based upon
criteria established by SFAS 133. For a derivative
designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized
in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting
loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being
hedged. For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the
effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is
initially reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into
earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The
ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings
immediately. The impact of derivatives on the Company’s
financial position in fiscal 2001, has been insignificant.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In July of 2001 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 141
“Business Combinations” which is effective for all
business combinations initiated after July 1, 2001. SFAS
No. 141, supersedes APB Opinion No. 16, Business
Combinations, and FASB Statement No. 38, Accounting for
Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises and
requires that all business combinations be accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting. Further, SFAS No. 141
requires certain intangibles to be recognized as assets apart
from goodwill if they meet certain criteria and also requires
expanded disclosures regarding the primary reasons for
consummation of the combination and the allocation of the
purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed by major balance sheet caption. The Company does not
believe the standard will have a significant impact on the
financial position of the company.

In July of 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 142 supercedes APB Opinion
No. 17, Intangible Assets, and addresses financial
accounting and reporting for intangible assets acquired
individually or with a group of other assets and the accounting
and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets
subsequent to their acquisition. Under the model set forth in
SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized to earnings,
but instead be subject to periodic testing for impairment. The
Company does not believe the standard will have a significant
impact on the financial position of the company.

In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”
FASB 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It
applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of
long-lived assets that result from the acquisition,
construction, development, and (or) the normal operation of a
long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. The
provisions of FAS 143 will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2002, however early application is
permitted. The Company does not believe the standard will have a
significant impact its financial statements.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.” This Statement addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
This Statement supersedes FASB Statement No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, and the accounting and
reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the
Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual
and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, for the
disposal of a segment of a business. The provisions of
FAS 144 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. The Company is currently evaluating the
implications of adoption of FAS 144 and anticipates
adopting its provisions in fiscal year 2002.

The tax effects of the temporary differences that
give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets are
as follows (in thousands):

The Company’s deferred tax assets include
net operating loss carry forwards of approximately
$27 million. During the first three quarters of fiscal year
2001, the Company maintained a partial valuation allowance
consistent with prior year against its deferred tax assets. In
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the Company re-evaluated
the need to provide a full valuation allowance. Due to changes
in the current economic environment and based on the weight of
all the available positive and negative evidence, the Company
determined that it was not more likely than not, that the
deferred taxes would be recognized and therefore, a full
valuation allowance should be provided to completely offset the
net deferred tax assets.

the grant date, and expire 10 years from the grant date.
The Company has not granted any stock purchase awards or stock
bonuses under the 2000 Plan. Upon certain changes in control of
the Company, the surviving entity will either assume or
substitute all outstanding options or stock awards under the
2000 Plan. If the surviving entity determines not to assume or
substitute such options or awards, then with respect to persons
whose service with the Company or an affiliate of the Company
has not terminated before a change in control, the vesting of
50% of these options or stock awards (and the time during which
these awards may be exercised) will accelerate and the options
or awards will be terminated if not exercised before the change
in control. As of September 30, 2001 there were options to
purchase 1,963,414 shares outstanding and

stock options for Mr. McAdam that vest over a period of
four years from the grant date. The second McAdam Plan provides
for a grant of 50,000 options for Mr. McAdam that vest over
a period of two years from the grant date. All options under the

of these options will accelerate and the options will be
terminated if not exercised before the change in control. As of
September 30, 2001, 50,000 shares had been issued,
there were options to purchase 645,000 shares outstanding
and no shares available.

All options under this plan expire 10 years from the grant
date. As of September 30, 2001, there were 200,000 stock
option shares outstanding and no shares available available for

APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for
stock options. In certain instances, the Company has issued
stock options with an exercise price less than the deemed fair
value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant.
Accordingly, total compensation costs related to these stock
options of approximately $0.1 million, $2.0 million and
$4.0 million was deferred

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

during fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively, and is being amortized over the vesting period of
the options, generally four years. Amortization of stock
compensation costs of approximately $2.6 million,
$2.1 million and $2.5 million has been recognized as
an expense for the years ended September 30, 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

A summary of stock option transactions are as
follows:

1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In May 1999, the board of directors approved the
adoption of the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
“Purchase Plan”). A total of 1,000,000 shares of
common stock has been reserved for issuance under the Purchase
Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to acquire
shares of the Company’s common stock through periodic
payroll deductions of up to 15% of base compensation. No
employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock,
determined at the fair market value of the shares at the time
such option is granted, in one calendar year. The Purchase Plan
has been implemented in a series of offering periods, each
6 months in duration. The price at which the common stock
may be purchased is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value
of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the
applicable offering period or on the last day of the respective
purchase period.

Pro forma information regarding net income
(loss) is required by SFAS No. 123, and has been
determined as if the Company had accounted for its stock options
under the minimum value method of that statement for all periods
prior to the Company becoming a public entity and fair value
method of that statement for all periods subsequent to the
Company becoming a public entity. The fair value of each option
is estimated at the date of grant with the following
weighted-average assumptions used for the years ended
September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999:

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the
estimated fair value of the options is amortized over the
options’ vesting period. The Company’s pro forma net
income (loss) would have been as follows (in thousands,

9.     Commitments
and Contingencies:

Future minimum operating lease payments (net of
sublease proceeds) for future fiscal years, as of
September 30, 2001, are approximately as follows (in
thousands):

Rent expense under non-cancelable operating
leases amounted to approximately $4.8 million,
$1.9 million and $0.5 million for the years ended
September 30, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

In April 2000, the Company entered into a lease
agreement on two buildings for a new corporate headquarters. The
lease commenced in July 2000 on the first building; and the
lease on the second building commenced in October 2000. The
lease for both buildings expires in 2012 with an option for
renewal. The Company established a restricted escrow account in
connection with this lease agreement. Under the term of the
lease, a $6.0 million irrevocable standby letter of credit
is required through November 2012, unless the lease is
terminated before then. This amount has been included on the
Company’s balance sheet as of September 30, 2000 as a
component of restricted cash. The Company has surplus office
space of approximately 14,000 square feet which it subleased
until 2003 and approximately 110,000 square feet which it
subleased until 2012.

On August 8, 2001 a putative securities
class action, captioned Atlas v. F5 Networks, Inc. et
al., Civil Action No. 01-CV-7342, was filed against the
firms that underwrote F5 Networks’ initial public
offering, F5 Networks, and several of its officers and
directors in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. The complaint alleges violations of
Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated
thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 against the Company and its officers and directors, and
seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class that
purchased F5 Networks’ common stock between
June 4, 1999 and December 6, 2000.

On August 15, 2001 a similar complaint,
captioned Lee v. F5 Networks, Inc. et al., Civil
Action No. 01-CV-7625, was filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The
complaint is substantially identical to the Atlas complaint: it
names the same defendants, contains the virtually identical
claims, and seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported
class of purchasers of common stock during an identical class
period.

Various plaintiffs have filed similar actions in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York asserting virtually identical allegations against more
than 200 other issuers. These cases have all been assigned to
the Hon. Shira A. Scheindlin for coordination and decisions
on pretrial motions, discovery, and related matters other than
trial. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to
the lawsuits and will defend itself vigorously in the
litigation. An unfavorable resolution of the actions could have
a material, adverse effect on the business, results of
operations or financial condition of the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The company may be subject to additional legal
proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary
course of business. Although the outcome of these matters is
currently not determinable, the Company does not expect that the
resolution of the actions could have a material, adverse effect
on the business, results of operations or financial condition of
the Company.

10.     Related Party
Transactions:

In March 1999, the Company issued 150,000 shares
of common stock to an officer of the Company in exchange for a
note receivable. These shares were acquired by exercising stock
options that vest over a period of four years. The note bears
interest at a rate of 4.83%, is collateralized by the shares,
partially guaranteed by the officer and is due in 2003. In
fiscal 2000, total payments of $281,000 were received on the
loan. Under the pledge agreement, the Company has the obligation
to repurchase any remaining unvested shares, and the note
becomes due upon the officer’s termination. Further, the
shares may not be transferred until they are vested, and the
related portion of the loan is repaid. In fiscal 2001, the
officer left the company and returned unvested shares totaling
approximately 56,000 options to purchase shares of common stock,
which were subsequently cancelled. In fiscal 2001, total
payments of $188,000 were received on the loan.

11.     Employee
Benefit Plans:

The Company provides a 401(k) savings plan
whereby eligible employees may voluntarily contribute a
percentage of their compensation. Under the provision of the
plan the Company may, at their discretion, match a portion of
the employees’ eligible contributions. Contributions to the
plan during the years ended September 30, 2001, 2000 and
1999 were approximately $953,000, $833,000 and $612,000,
respectively. Contributions made by the company vest over four
years.

12.     Supplemental
Cash Flow Information:
