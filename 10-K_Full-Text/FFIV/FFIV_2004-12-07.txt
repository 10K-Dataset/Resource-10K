Item 1.

Business

General

F5 Networks, Inc. is a leading provider of
application traffic management products. We develop, manufacture
and sell products and services to help companies efficiently and
securely manage their Internet traffic. Our products enhance the
delivery, optimization and security of application traffic on
Internet-based networks that use the Internet Protocol, or IP.
IP traffic passes through our products where it is inspected and
modified to ensure that it is delivered securely and in a way
that optimizes the performance of both the network and the
applications. Our BIG-IP application traffic management products
help manage IP traffic to servers and network devices in a way
that maximizes the availability, scalability and throughput of
those network components and the applications that run on them.
Our complementary FirePass products provide secure user access
to corporate networks and applications, enabling companies to
extend secure remote access to anyone connected to the Internet
by leveraging standard Web browser technology. Our recently
acquired TrafficShield application firewall product provides
security for IP-based applications and data, protecting them
from hackers and other malicious attacks at the application
layer. Our traffic management and security products share a
common software interface called iControl, which enables them to
communicate with one another and allows them to be integrated
with third party products, including custom and commercial
enterprise applications. The flexibility of our software-based
technology, the breadth of functionality available on our
products and the integration of that functionality through
iControl are characteristics that we believe differentiate our
products from other traffic management devices and security
products. These characteristics enable us to provide
comprehensive solutions that address many elements required for
IP-based networks and business applications, including high
availability, high performance, intelligent traffic management,
streamlined manageability, bandwidth optimization, remote access
to corporate networks, and network and application security. In
connection with our products, we offer a broad range of services
including consulting, training, installation, maintenance and
other technical support services.

On May 31, 2004, we acquired MagniFire
Websystems, Inc., or MagniFire, for $30.5 million. As a
result of the transaction, we acquired all the assets of
MagniFire including its TrafficShield Web application firewall
product line. TrafficShield is an application-level security
device that offers organizations the ability to protect their
applications and data from hackers and other malicious attacks.
The acquisition of MagniFire allows us to quickly enter the
application firewall market, broaden our customer base and
augment our existing product line.

We were incorporated on February 26, 1996 in
the State of Washington. Our headquarters is in Seattle,
Washington and our mailing address is 401 Elliott Avenue West,
Seattle, Washington 98119. The telephone number at our executive
offices is (206) 272-5555. We have subsidiaries or branch
offices in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong,
Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,
Thailand and the United Kingdom. Our annual reports on

Industry Background

Internet Protocol, or IP, is a communications
language used to transmit data over the Internet. Since the late
1990’s, businesses have responded to the power, flexibility
and economy of the Internet by deploying new IP-based
applications, upgrading their client-server applications to new
IP-enabled versions, and enabling existing or legacy
applications for use over the Internet. Over the next several
years, we believe this process will accelerate as more and more
organizations discover the benefits of deploying IP-enabled
applications and new technologies continue to enhance the
performance, reliability and security of both applications and
IP networks. In addition, we believe the growth of Internet
usage will continue to be driven by new applications such as Web
Services, Voice over IP, increased penetration of broadband
Internet access enabling the remote use of more applications,
and the increasing popularity of mobile Internet access through
wireless devices such as cellular telephones, PDAs and notebook
computers.

Internet Architecture

IP requires all data transmitted across the
Internet to be divided into packets at the source and
reassembled at the destination. The Open Systems Interconnect,
or OSI Model, Reference Model is the framework that divides
network functions into seven layers and specifies how the layers
should interact to enable all of a network’s different
hardware and software components to work together to accomplish
this process. Prior to transmission, each packet of data is
automatically given a header that identifies the source and
destination of the packet. This header information is used in
the OSI Model for the purposes of identifying, routing and
sequencing data packets, and is stripped from the data upon
arrival at its destination. Layers 2-4 of the OSI Model perform
standardized, repetitive tasks such as ensuring that packets of
information sent over the Internet arrive at the destination to
which they are addressed and are reassembled in the correct
sequence. Consequently, most Layer 2-4 switches are
hardware-based devices that use application-specific integrated
circuits, or ASICs, and are optimized for speed. Unlike Layers
2-4, Layer 7, which in practice includes the functions
ascribed to Layers 5 and 6 in the OSI model, is complex and
variable and must support end-user applications and processes on
a wide variety of platforms and devices. While most Layer 7
switches rely on hardware-based architectures to maximize
throughput, the demands of Layer 7 processing, or application
traffic management, increasingly require flexibility and
adaptability that can be achieved only through a software-based
solution. The challenge in building highly flexible,
function-rich, software-based switches for application traffic
management is to deliver these capabilities at speeds equal to
or better than hardware-based products.

Application Traffic
    Management

As more applications are IP-enabled, there is
growing demand for Layer 7 technology that can read the entire
contents of a packetized transmission and make intelligent
decisions based on a dynamic set of business rules about how to
handle the transmission to optimize the availability,
performance and security of applications, servers and the
network. Basic Layer 7 functions include load-balancing
(monitoring the load on multiple servers and routing traffic to
the one that is least busy), health-checking (monitoring the
performance of servers and applications to ensure that they are
working properly before routing traffic to them), and automatic
scaling (detecting the addition of new servers to an existing
array). In addition, Layer 7 application traffic management
encompasses a growing number of functions that have typically
been performed by the server or the application itself, or by
point solutions running on separate devices. Functions in this
category include: SSL Acceleration — using Secure
Socket Layer, or SSL, encryption to secure traffic between the
server and the browser on an end user’s client device; Rate
Shaping —



prioritizing transmissions according to preset
rules that give precedence to different types of traffic;
Compression — reducing the volume of data transmitted
to take maximum advantage of available bandwidth; TCP
Optimization — improving server efficiency by
maintaining an open connection with a server during interactive
sessions; IPv6 Translation — enabling communication
and interoperability between networked devices using IPv6, the
newest version of the Internet Protocol, and those using the
older version IPv4; and modifying the content of a transaction
to improve security.

Since most large enterprises have
hundreds — if not thousands — of servers and
applications, it is not practical to build these and other
functions into every application or host them on every server.
Even if it were, maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the
net result would be a negative impact on the overall performance
of servers and applications. Deploying point solutions in the
network eliminates those problems but creates a new set of
challenges. Using point solutions from multiple vendors can
create interoperability issues, and problems that do occur can
be difficult to troubleshoot. From a security standpoint, it is
also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through
multiple devices. As a result, enterprise customers are
demanding products that integrate the growing number of Layer 7
application traffic management and security functions on a
single platform.

Secure Access and Application
    Security

As enterprises continue to IP-enable their
networks and business applications, one of the key challenges
they face is providing employees, partners and customers with
secure access to corporate applications, whether they are in the
office or logging on to the network from a remote location. At
the same time, enterprises need to ensure that access is limited
to those applications for which a user is specifically
authorized. Currently, the most widespread solution for secure
remote access is technology that uses the IP Security, IPSec,
Protocol to establish a secure virtual private network, VPN,
between a remote device, such as a user’s home PC or a
laptop, and the corporate network. Although with IPSec, the VPN
tunnel is very secure, there are a number of drawbacks
associated with IPSec VPNs. One is that IPSec requires the
remote device to have special software installed on it, and
maintaining the most current version of this software on all
user devices is time consuming and costly. A more serious issue
is that once IPSec establishes a connection between a user and
the corporate network, the user has full access to any
application in the network and the only way to prevent
unauthorized use is to secure each application or physically
segment the network. As an alternative to using IPSec VPNs for
remote access, new technology that employs SSL encryption to
establish a secure VPN has emerged and is making rapid inroads
in the market. Because this technology relies on the SSL
capabilities resident in any standard Web browser, it is not
necessary to install additional software on the remote device.
This makes it possible to access the network from a cell phone,
PDA, kiosk, laptop, PC, or any other device with a standard
browser. In addition, SSL VPN technology supports the creation
of separate VPN tunnels to each application for which a user is
authorized. This allows enterprises to exercise more control
over who can gain access to various parts of the network and to
specific applications.

Along with the need to provide secure
connectivity between users and applications, enterprises face an
immediate and growing need to protect applications and other
data center resources from application-level security threats
that pass through conventional firewalls and slip past intrusion
detection and prevention (IDS and IPS) devices. SQL Slammer
Worm, a virus that infected millions of servers in a matter of
minutes and nearly shut down the Internet in January 2003, is a
prime example. By exploiting characteristics of the User
Datagram Protocol, or UDP, which allows direct transmission of
data to a server, SQL Slammer Worm slipped past network security
devices disguised as a simple data request. Once inside the
application, the code rewrote the server’s own
instructions, replicating and sending copies of itself to
thousands of other servers. Because it was a
“day-zero” attack — i.e., a brand new threat
with no prior history — intrusion detection and
prevention devices were not equipped with a signature to
identify the SQL Slammer Worm and were unable to prevent it.

In the wake of the SQL Slammer Worm and plagued
by other malicious attacks, enterprises have begun to look
beyond traditional security measures for solutions that can
detect and shut down day-zero, application-level attacks. Under
the general category of application security, these solutions
apply a



“positive” security model that
contrasts with the “negative” security model used by
IDS and IPS devices. In a negative security model, incoming
traffic is checked against a list of signatures for known worms,
viruses and other security threats, and if no match is found the
traffic is allowed to pass. In a positive security model,
incoming traffic is checked against a set of rules that define
what specific elements are permissible in traffic headed for a
particular application and rejects traffic containing anything
that does not conform to the rules. In the case of SQL Slammer
Worm, a positive security device would have recognized that the
UDP packet carrying the SQL Slammer Worm was not a simple data
request and blocked the transmission.

Although products that incorporate a positive
security model have been around for many years, they have been
inherently slow and this has limited their use to enterprises
that have historically placed a high priority on security. Now
that application-level attacks threaten to paralyze global
business, there is growing demand among enterprises for
application security that can ward off these attacks. The
challenge is to deliver products that apply a positive security
model to application traffic without slowing network performance.

The F5 Solution

We are a leading provider of application traffic
management products which ensure the security, optimization and
delivery of applications to any user, anywhere. We believe our
products offer the most intelligent architecture and advanced
functionality in the marketplace along with performance,
flexibility and usability features that benefit organizations by
improving the way they serve their employees, customers and
constituents while lowering operational costs.

Software Based
Products.

From inception, we have been
committed to the belief that the complexity of Layer 7 traffic
management requires a software-based rather than a
hardware-based solution. We believe our application traffic
management software enables us to deliver the broadest range of
integrated functionality in the market and facilitates the
addition and integration of new functionality. We also believe
that integrating our software with commodity hardware components
enables us to build products that deliver superior performance,
functionality and flexibility at competitive prices.

Full Proxy
Architecture.

The core of our software
technology is the Traffic Management Operating System, or TM/
OS, introduced in September 2004 as part of BIG-IP version 9. We
believe this is a major enhancement of our existing technology
that enables BIG-IP version 9 to deliver functionality that is
superior on many levels to any other application traffic
management product in the market. With TM/OS, BIG-IP version 9
employs a full proxy architecture that enables it to inspect,
modify and direct both inbound and outbound traffic flows across
multiple packets. This ability to manage both inbound and
outbound traffic enables BIG-IP version 9 to direct, optimize
and secure application traffic in ways that are not possible
with other traffic management solutions.

Modular
Functionality.

In addition to its full
proxy architecture, TM/ OS is specifically designed to
facilitate the development and integration of application
traffic management and security functions as modules that can be
added to BIG-IP’s core functionality as needed. Add-on
modules currently available with BIG-IP version 9 include:
Intelligent Compression; SSL Acceleration; Layer 7 Rate Shaping;
Advanced Client Authentication; IPv6 Gateway; and others.

Application
Awareness.

Our products are designed
using a common architecture, called iControl, with a common
interface that allows them to communicate with one another and
with third-party software and devices. Through our unique, open
iControl application programming interface, third-party
applications and network devices can take an active role in
shaping IP network traffic, directing traffic based on exact
business requirements specified by our customers. This
“application awareness” capability is one of the most
important features of our software-based products and serves as
a further point of differentiation for our solution in
comparison with those offered by our competitors.

Another key benefit of our software-based
solution is that it allows the customer to incorporate specific
business rules and processes into the software. This capability,
which we call iRules, is a simple



tool that can be used to define how the user
wants to direct, persist on, or filter traffic based on the
needs of each application.

Furthermore, our Universal Inspection Engine, the
core of our application traffic management technology, is unique
in its ability to inspect IP traffic down to the packet payload
level and can direct traffic according to flexible iRules
specified by the user. This “deep packet inspection”
technology enables powerful offloading, inspection and
processing of application-level transactions.

Integrated Traffic Management and Security
Solutions.

The combination of our full
proxy architecture with enhanced versions of our Universal
Inspection Engine and iRules enables BIG-IP to intercept,
inspect and act on the contents of traffic from virtually every
type of IP-enabled application. Our full proxy architecture also
allows TM/ OS to support an integrated traffic management and
security solution that can detect and prevent many network-level
attacks.

Our FirePass technology provides secure, remote
access through SSL VPNs. Depending on a user’s
authorization and the type of device they are using, FirePass
can provide full network access or limited access to specific
applications and resources. The FirePass technology also allows
remote users to access applications or resources that are
connected to the network but are not Web-enabled, including
legacy hosts, desktops and client-server applications.

Our recently acquired TrafficShield technology
uses a full proxy architecture to inspect traffic flows and a
policy engine that applies a positive security model by
comparing the traffic with rules that define permissible traffic
for specific applications. As a result, TrafficShield has the
potential to prevent “day-zero” attacks and other
types of security threats that pass through traditional
firewalls and signature-based devices such as intrusion
detection and intrusion prevention systems. TrafficShield also
has a learning component that keeps the policy engine up-to-date
by monitoring changes in applications.

Currently we are developing stand-alone FirePass
and TrafficShield appliances that incorporate TM/OS and are
tightly integrated with our BIG-IP application switches and
appliances. We also plan to introduce FirePass and TrafficShield
software modules that will run on top of BIG-IP and provide
customers with application traffic management and security on a
single platform.

Strategy

Our objective is to lead the industry in
delivering the enabling architecture which integrates the
network with the applications. This allows organizations to
significantly improve costly and time consuming business
processes and provide new sources of revenue through highly
differentiated offerings. Key components of our strategy include:

Offering a complete application security
solution and product set.

We plan to
utilize the core technologies from our BIG-IP, FirePass and
TrafficShield products to deliver standalone and integrated
systems that protect applications from hostile and inadvertent
threats, including user-to-system application security and
system-to-system application security problems. We believe these
solutions will differentiate our products in the security market
and provide a unique solution to the problem of vulnerability of
mission-critical applications.

Continue expanding our presence in growing
segments of the traffic management
market.

We intend to continue
targeting emerging and expanding segments of our traditional
traffic management market. These segments include IP
infrastructure, Web Services infrastructure, utility computing
and data center virtualization infrastructure.

Investing in technology to continue to meet
customer needs.

We will continue to
invest in research and development to provide our customers with
comprehensive, integrated application traffic management and
security solutions. Our product development efforts will
continue to leverage the unique attributes of our software-based
platforms to deliver new features and functions that address the
complex and changing needs of our customers. We will continue to
use commodity hardware in order to ensure performance and cost
competitiveness.



Enhancing the existing channel
model.

We are investing significant
resources in order to further develop our indirect sales
channels. We plan to expand our indirect sales channels through
leading industry resellers, systems integrators, Internet
service providers and other channel partners. We are also
recruiting new channel partners and leveraging our existing
channels to sell our new security products.

Continuing to build and expand relationships
with strategic iControl partners.

We
plan to capitalize on our strategic relationships with
enterprise software vendors who have created interfaces to our
products through our iControl application programming interface.
These vendors provide us significant leverage in the selling
process, because they recommend our products to their customers.
In order to differentiate ourselves further from our competitors
we plan to explore opportunities to further embed iControl into
existing and new third party products and to jointly market and
sell our solutions to enterprise customers with these key
partners.

Enhancing our brand.

We plan to continue building brand awareness that positions us
as one of the leading providers of secure application traffic
management solutions. Our goal is for the F5 brand to be
synonymous with superior performance, high-quality customer
service and ease of use.

Products

Our core technology is software for IP
application traffic management and security, including secure
remote access. Our products are systems that integrate our
software with hardware that is built using a combination of
commodity components and our own custom ASIC for Layer 4
processing. Our systems include three product families: BIG-IP,
FirePass and TrafficShield.

BIG-IP Traffic Manager

Our family of BIG-IP Local Traffic Managers
includes both IP application switches and server appliances.
Members of the BIG-IP family differ primarily in the hardware
configurations that make up each system. Our most recent product
launch, which included the introduction of BIG-IP version 9
software, introduced three new application switches: a high-end
(BIG-IP 6400), mid-range (BIG-IP 3400), and an entry-level
(BIG-IP 1500) system. In addition to CPUs for Layer 7
processing, these systems come equipped with our own proprietary
ASIC for high-performance Layer 4 processing, a commodity
Layer 2-3 switch for connectivity, and a commodity SSL ASIC for
SSL encryption and decryption. The BIG-IP 520 and 540 server
appliances are equipped with CPUs for high-speed Layer 4-7
processing and are designed to accommodate easily-installed
upgrade cards that provide fast, integrated SSL encryption and
decryption.

Other products in our BIG-IP systems family
include BIG-IP Global Traffic Manager, formerly called 3-DNS
Controller, and BIG-IP ISP Traffic Manager, formerly called Link
Controller. BIG-IP Global Traffic Manager allows enterprises
with geographically dispersed data centers to direct traffic to
a particular data center in accordance with customized business
rules, or to redirect traffic to an available data center if one
of their sites becomes overloaded or is shut down for any
reason. BIG-IP ISP Traffic Manager allows enterprises with more
than one Internet service provider to manage the use of their
available bandwidth to minimize costs while ensuring the highest
quality of service. BIG-IP Global Traffic Manager and BIG-IP ISP
Traffic Manager are sold separately on individual IP application
switches and server appliances, or bundled with BIG-IP Local
Traffic Manager on a single system.

FirePass

Our FirePass systems provide SSL VPN access for
remote users of IP networks and any applications connected to
those networks from any standard Web browser on any device. The
components of FirePass include a dynamic policy engine, which
manages user authentication and authorization privileges, and
special components that enable corporations to give remote users
controlled access to the full array of applications and
resources within the network.



Our FirePass line of SSL VPN servers currently
includes the FirePass 1000 and the FirePass 4100, which support
100 and 1000 concurrent users, respectively. Both support the
complete range of FirePass software features and offer a
comprehensive solution for Web-based remote access to corporate
applications and desktops. In the future, FirePass software will
be available as an add-on module for our BIG-IP product family.

TrafficShield

We acquired the TrafficShield technology with the
acquisition of MagniFire in May 2004 and launched our first
F5-branded TrafficShield products in October 2004. TrafficShield
is a Web application firewall that provides comprehensive,
proactive, application-layer protection against both generalized
and targeted attacks. TrafficShield employs a positive security
model (‘deny all unless allowed’) to permit only valid
and authorized application transactions. As a result,
TrafficShield has the potential to prevent “day-zero”
attacks and other types of security threats that pass through
traditional firewalls and signature-based devices such as
intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems. In the
future, TrafficShield software will be available as an add-on
module for our BIG-IP product family.

Enabling Technologies

Our application traffic management products come
equipped with iControl and iControl Services Manager functions,
which are designed to facilitate the broader use of our
products. iControl allows customers and independent software
vendors to modify their programs to communicate with our
products, eliminating the need for human involvement, lowering
the cost of performing basic network functions and reducing the
likelihood of error. Although we do not derive revenue from
iControl itself, the sale of iControl-enabled applications by
independent software vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle helps
promote and often leads directly to the sale of our other
products.

iControl Services Manager takes advantage of
iControl to provide a single, centralized management and
operational interface for our devices. This feature allows
customers with dozens or hundreds of our products to upgrade or
modify the software on those products simultaneously from a
single console. This lowers the cost and simplifies the task of
deploying, managing and maintaining our products and reduces the
likelihood of error when blanket changes are implemented.

Product Development

We believe our future success depends on our
ability to maintain technology leadership by constantly
improving our products and by developing new products to meet
the changing needs of our customers. Our product development
group employs a standard process for the development,
documentation and quality control of software and systems that
is designed to meet these goals. This process includes working
with management, product marketing, customers and partners to
identify new or improved solutions that meet the evolving needs
of our addressable markets.

Our principal software engineering group is
located in our headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Our core
FirePass product development team is located in San Jose,
California. Our TrafficShield product development team, which
includes the original developers of that technology, is located
in Tel Aviv, Israel. Our hardware engineering group is located
in Spokane, Washington. Members of these teams collaborate
closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and
performance of our hardware and software systems.

During the fiscal years ended September 30,
2004, 2003 and 2002, we had research and product development
expenses of $24.4 million, $19.2 million and
$18.0 million, respectively.

Customers

Our customers include a wide variety of
enterprise customers (Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global
1000 companies). Although we do not target specific
vertical markets, enterprise customers in financial



services, manufacturing, transportation and
mobile telecommunications currently make up the largest
percentage of our customer base. The other significant
components of our customer base are Internet service providers,
Internet hosting companies and Internet commerce companies. In
fiscal year 2004, international sales represented 39.4% of our
net revenues. Refer to note 10 to our consolidated
financial statements included in this annual report on
Form 10-K for additional information regarding our revenues
by geographic area.

Consistent with our goal of building a strong
channel sales model, the majority of our revenue is generated by
sales though our distributors, value-added resellers and systems
integrators. For fiscal year 2004, sales to Ingram Micro Inc.,
one of our distributors, represented 19.1% of our revenues. Our
agreement with Ingram Micro is a standard, non-exclusive
distribution agreement that renews automatically on an annual
basis and is terminable by either party with 30 days’
prior written notice. The agreement grants Ingram Micro the
right to distribute our products to resellers in North America
and certain other territories internationally, with no minimum
purchase requirements.

Sales and Marketing

Sales

We sell our products and services to large
enterprise customers through a variety of channels, including
distributors, value-added resellers and systems integrators. A
substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2004 was
derived from these channel sales. We also sell our products and
services to major accounts through our own direct sales force.
In most cases, service contracts are negotiated directly with
the customer. Typically, our agreements with our channel
partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling
competitive products. These agreements typically have terms of
one year with no obligation to renew, and typically do not
provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase
requirements.

Direct sales.

Our
field sales personnel are located in major cities throughout
North America, Europe, Japan and the Asia Pacific region. The
inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional
sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison
between the field and internal corporate resources. We sell our
products directly to a limited group of customers, primarily
large enterprise end-users whose accounts are managed by our
major account services team. Field systems engineers also
support our regional sales managers and channel partners by
participating in joint sales calls and providing pre-sale
technical resources as needed.

Distributor and value-added reseller
relationships.

We have established
relationships with large national and international
distributors, local and specialized distributors and value-added
resellers from which we derive the majority of our sales. The
distributors sell our products, and the value-added resellers
not only sell our products, but also assist their customers in
network design, installation and testing. Our field sales
personnel will work closely with our channel partners to assist
them, if necessary, in the selling of our products to their
customers.

Systems integrators.

We also market our products through strategic relationships we
have with systems integrators. Systems integrators leverage
products like ours as a core component of application or
network-based solutions that they deploy for their customers. In
most cases, systems integrators do not directly purchase our
products for resell to their customers. Instead they typically
recommend our products as part of a broader solution. An example
of this approach would be packaged enterprise resource platform,
ERP, or customer relationship management, CRM, solutions
delivered by systems integrators where our traffic management
products provide high availability and increased performance for
the ERP or CRM applications.

Marketing

There are two primary aspects to our marketing
strategy. First, we believe our future success depends on our
ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our
addressable markets and that we



develop valuable solutions to address those
needs. Our marketing organization works directly with customers,
partners and our product development teams to identify and
create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership
position. The second aspect is to continue to build upon our
iControl strategy. We have established relationships with
various independent software vendors who have adapted their
applications to interact with our products via the iControl
interface. iControl enhances the functionality of third party
applications by enabling them to control the network in an
automated way, based on business policies and rules associated
with the application. As a result, customers who purchase
iControl-enabled applications have an incentive to purchase our
products in order to take advantage of the enhanced
functionality made possible through our technical cooperation.
We also offer an on-line community website called DevCentral
that provides technical resources to customers, prospects and
partners wanting to extend and optimize F5 solutions using
iControl to meet their specific needs.

We also engage in a number of marketing programs
and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market
awareness of our technology and products. These include actively
participating in industry trade shows and briefing industry
analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products,
and on new business and technology partnerships. In addition, we
market our products to chief information officers and other
information technology professionals through targeted
advertising, direct mail and high-profile Web events.

Backlog

At the end of fiscal years 2004 and 2003, we had
product backlog of approximately $10.6 million and
$5.3 million, respectively. Backlog represents orders
confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped
generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit
status. Orders are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by
customers or product specification changes by the customers.
Although we believe that the backlog orders are firm, purchase
orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment
without significant penalty. For this reason, we believe that
our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable
indicator of future revenues.

Customer Service and Technical
Support

We believe that our ability to provide
consistent, high-quality customer service and technical support
is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise
customers. Accordingly we offer a broad range of support
services that include installation, phone support, hardware
repair and replacement, software updates, consulting and
training services. We deliver these services directly to end
users and also utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging
the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable. Our
technical support staff is strategically located in regional
service centers to support our global customer base.

Prior to the installation of our products, our
services personnel work with customers to analyze their network
needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and
configure product features and functions to meet those needs.
Our services personnel also provide on-site installation and
training services to help customers make optimal use of product
features and functions.

Our customers typically purchase a one-year
maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services
provided by our technical support team. Maintenance services
provided under the contract include online updates, software
error correction releases, hardware repair and replacement, and
remote support through a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
help desk, although not all service contracts entitle a customer
to round-the-clock call center support. Updates to our software
are only available to customers with a current maintenance
contract. Our technical support team also offers seminars and
training classes for customers on the configuration and use of
products, including local and wide area network system
administration and management. In addition, we have a
professional services team able to provide a full range of
fee-based consulting services, including comprehensive network
management, documentation and performance analysis, and capacity
planning to assist in predicting future network requirements.



We also offer, as part of our maintenance
service, an online, automated, self-help customer support
function called Ask F5 that allows customers to answer many
commonly asked questions without having to call our support
desk. This allows the customer to rapidly address issues and
questions, while significantly reducing the number of calls to
our support desk. This enables us to provide comprehensive
customer support while keeping our support-related expenses at a
manageable, consistent level.

Manufacturing

We outsource the manufacturing of our
pre-configured hardware platforms to contract manufacturers for
assembly according to our specifications. The contract
manufacturers install our software onto the hardware platforms
and conduct functionality testing, quality assurance and
documentation control prior to shipping our products. The
majority of our products are assembled by Solectron Corporation.
Our agreement with Solectron allows them to procure component
inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production
forecast. Subcontractors supply Solectron with standard parts
and components for our products based on our production
forecast. We are contractually obligated to purchase component
inventory that our contract manufacturer procures in accordance
with the forecast, unless we give notice of order cancellation
in advance of applicable lead times. As protection against
component shortages and to provide replacement parts for our
service teams, we also stock limited supplies of certain key
components for our products.

Hardware platforms for our traffic management
products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom
components designed and approved by our hardware engineering
group. Most of our components are purchased from sources which
we believe are readily available from other suppliers. However,
several components used in the assembly of our products are
purchased from single or limited sources such as our proprietary
Layer 4 ASIC that is manufactured for us by a third party
contract semiconductor foundry.

Competition

Our principal competitors in the traffic
management market are Cisco Systems, Inc. and Nortel Networks
Corporation. Other competitors in this market include Foundry
Networks, Inc., NetScaler, Inc., Radware Ltd., and Redline
Networks, Inc. Cisco and Nortel have a longer operating history
and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and
other resources than we do. Cisco and Nortel also have a more
extensive customer base and broader customer relationships,
including relationships with many of our current and potential
customers. In addition, Cisco and Nortel have large,
well-established, worldwide customer support and professional
services organizations and a more extensive direct sales force
and sales channels. Because of our relatively smaller size,
market presence and resources, Cisco, Nortel and other larger
competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to
new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
requirements. There is also the possibility that these companies
may adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share. As a
result, our competitors pose a serious competitive threat that
could undermine our ability to win new customers and maintain
our existing customer base.

SSL VPNs are a potential replacement for IPSec
VPNs, the most widely deployed solution for secure remote access
today. The current leaders in the IPSec VPN market are Check
Point Software Technologies, Ltd. and Juniper Networks, Inc.,
both of which are larger and better-known vendors than we are.
Our principal competitors in the SSL VPN market are Juniper,
Aventail Corporation, Nokia, Nortel, and Symantec. Some of our
competitors have resources and distribution channels that are
much larger than ours and could give them a significant
competitive advantage in the SSL VPN market. Although Nokia
currently resells our BIG-IP traffic management products, we do
not anticipate that our focus on the SSL VPN market will
materially affect Nokia’s resale of our BIG-IP products.

Application firewalls represent an emerging
market that is populated mainly by private,
early-development-stage companies. As we enter this market with
our TrafficShield products, we anticipate that we will also
encounter competition from vendors of traditional firewalls and
other types of security devices, many of which are larger and
better-known vendors than we are.



Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright,
trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure
to protect our intellectual property rights. We have obtained
three patents in the United States and have applications pending
for various aspects of our technology. Our future success
depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights
to the technologies used in our principal products. Despite our
efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties
may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use
trade secrets or other information that we regard as
proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do
not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of
the United States. We cannot assure you that any issued patent
will preserve our proprietary position, or that competitors or
others will not develop technologies similar to or superior to
our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect our
intellectual property rights could harm our business, operating
results and financial condition.

In addition to our own proprietary software, we
incorporate software licensed from several third-party sources
into our products. These licenses generally renew automatically
on an annual basis. We believe that alternative technologies for
this licensed software are available both domestically and
internationally.

Employees

As of September 30, 2004, we employed
613 full-time persons, including 185 in product
development, 229 in sales and marketing, 124 in professional
services and technical support and 75 in finance, administration
and operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor
union. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe that
our employee relations are good.

Item 2.

Properties

Our principal administrative, sales, marketing,
research and development facilities are located in Seattle,
Washington and consist of approximately 195,000 square
feet. In April 2000, we amended and restated the lease agreement
on two buildings for our corporate headquarters. The lease
commenced in July 2000 on the first building; and the lease on
the second building commenced in September 2000. The lease for
both buildings expires in 2012 with an option for renewal. The
lease for the second building has been fully subleased through
2012. We believe that our existing properties are in good
condition and suitable for the conduct of our business. We also
lease office space for our product development personnel in
Spokane, Washington, San Jose, California, Russia and
Israel, and for our sales and support personnel in Washington
D.C., New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, Taiwan, Malaysia,
South Korea, Japan, Australia, Germany, France, and the United
Kingdom. We believe that our future growth can be accommodated
by current facilities or by leasing additional space if
necessary.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

In July and August 2001, a series of putative
securities class action lawsuits were filed in United States
District Court, Southern District of New York against certain
investment banking firms that underwrote the Company’s
initial and secondary public offerings, the Company and some of
the Company’s officers and directors. These cases, which
have been consolidated under In re F5 Networks, Inc. Initial
Public Offering Securities Litigation, No. 01 CV 7055,
assert that the registration statements for the Company’s
June 4, 1999 initial public offering and September 30,
1999 secondary offering failed to disclose certain alleged
improper actions by the underwriters for the offerings. The
consolidated, amended complaint alleges claims against the
Company and those of our officers and directors named in the
complaint under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of
1933, and under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Other lawsuits have been filed making
similar allegations regarding the public offerings of more than
300 other companies. All of these various consolidated cases
have been coordinated for pretrial purposes as In re Initial
Public Offering Securities Litigation, Civil Action
No. 21-MC-92. In October 2002, the directors and officers
were dismissed without prejudice. The issuer defendants filed a
coordinated motion to dismiss these lawsuits in July 2002, which
the Court granted in part and denied in part in an order dated
February 19, 2003. The Court declined to dismiss the
Section 11 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5
claims against the Company. In June 2004, a stipulation of
settlement for the claims against the issuer defendants,
including the Company, was submitted to the court. The
settlement is subject to a number of conditions, including
approval by the Court. If the settlement does not occur, and
litigation against us continues, we believe we have meritorious
defenses and intend to defend the case vigorously. Securities
class action litigation could result in substantial costs and
divert our management’s attention and resources. Due to the
inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately
predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation, and any
unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and operating results.

On March 19, 2003, we sued Radware, Inc.
alleging that Radware infringed F5’s U.S. Patent
No. 6,473,802. The Complaint sought injunctive relief,
damages, enhanced damages, attorneys fees and interest on the
basis that Radware infringed the ‘802 patent. The ‘802
patent is generally directed at the use of cookies to create
persistent sessions between a client and a server. We filed an
amended complaint on March 25, 2004, adding Radware, Ltd.,
as a defendant. Radware, Ltd. and Radware, Inc. denied
infringement, and filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory
judgment that they did not infringe and that the ‘802
patent was invalid. This lawsuit was settled in September, 2004.
Under the settlement agreement, Radware has taken a nonexclusive
license to the ‘802 patent.

On July 20, 2004, Radware, Inc. and Radware,
Ltd. sued us in the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey, asserting that F5 Networks has infringed
and is infringing upon Radware’s U.S. Patent
No. 6,718,359 (“‘359 patent”), which issued
on April 6, 2004. The Complaint alleges that F5 Networks
has “made, used, sold and or offered for sale, and
continues to make, use, sell and or offer for sale products,
including the 3-DNS® product and BIG-IP®, that
incorporate technology and processes that are or when in use are
covered by one or more claims of the ‘359 patent.” The
Complaint seeks injunctive relief prohibiting us and our agents
from “making, using, selling, offering to sell and
importing into the United States any project that infringes, or
contributes to, or induces infringement of, the ‘359
patent,” as well as unspecified “damages, pre-and
post-judgment interest, enhanced damages and attorney
fees.” The ‘359 patent is entitled “Load
Balancing,” and the Complaint alleges that the patent is
“directed to methods and systems relating to
network-proximity determinations and non-geographical load
balancing.” The patent claims appear to be directed to the
concurrent use of various metrics to measure the network
proximity of various servers to a client and/or the use of a
specific method of measuring the number of hops to a server. We
have answered the complaint, denying that F5 or its products
infringe the ‘359 patent, and have filed a counterclaim
seeking a declaratory judgment that the patent is both invalid
and not infringed by F5. No case schedule has been issued.

We are not aware of any additional pending legal
proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
operating results, or financial condition. We may in the future
be party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of
business, including claims that



allegedly infringe upon third-party trademarks or
other intellectual property rights. Such claims, even if not
meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant
financial and managerial resources.

Market Prices of Common Stock

Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National
Market under the symbol “FFIV.” The following table
sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock as
reported on the Nasdaq National Market.

The last reported sales price of our common stock
on the Nasdaq National Market on December 2, 2004 was
$46.95.

As of December 2, 2004, there were 124
holders of record of our common stock. As many of our shares of
common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on
behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total
number of beneficial holders of our common stock represented by
these record holders.

Dividend Policy

Our policy has been to retain cash to fund future
growth. Accordingly, we have not paid dividends and do not
anticipate declaring dividends on our common stock in the
foreseeable future.

Unregistered Securities Sold in 2004

We did not sell any unregistered shares of our
common stock during the fiscal year 2004.

(1)

The combined overall increase in cash, cash
    equivalents, short-term and long-term investments in fiscal 2004
    was primarily due to the net proceeds of $113.6 million
    received from the sale of our common stock in a public offering
    in November 2003.

(2)

Restricted cash represents escrow accounts
    established in connection with lease agreements for our

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a global provider of software and hardware
products and services that help companies efficiently and
securely manage their Internet traffic. Our products enhance the
delivery, optimization and security of application traffic on
Internet-based networks. We market and sell our products
primarily through indirect sales channels in North America,
Europe, Japan and the Asia Pacific region. Enterprise customers
(Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global 1000 companies) in
financial services, manufacturing, transportation and mobile
telecommunications industries continue to make up the largest
percentage of our customer base.

Our management monitors and analyzes a number of
key performance indicators in order to manage our business and
evaluate our financial and operating performance. Those
indicators include:



which we have paid $29.2 million as of
    September 30, 2004 with the remainder expected to be paid
    in the upcoming fiscal year. We will continue to evaluate
    possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses, products,
    or technologies that we believe are strategic, which may require
    the use of cash.

•

Balance sheet.

We
    view cash, short-term and long-term investments, deferred
    revenue, accounts receivable balances and day’s sales
    outstanding as important indicators of our financial health.
    Deferred revenues increased 47.1% to $28.1 million at the
    end of fiscal 2004, up from $19.1 million in the prior
    year. The increase was due to continued growth in the amount of
    annual maintenance contracts purchased on new products and
    maintenance renewal contracts related to our existing product
    installation base. Our day’s sales outstanding were 41 and
    55 as of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and
    2003, respectively. The decrease was due to improved collections
    and changes in the linearity of invoicing during the respective
    period.

Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Net Revenues.

Total
net revenues increased 47.7% in fiscal year 2004 from fiscal
year 2003, compared to an increase of 7.0% in fiscal year 2003
from fiscal year 2002. The improvement was due to increased
demand for our application traffic management products and
higher services revenues resulting from our increased installed
base of products. During fiscal year 2004, each of our primary
geographic regions reported higher revenues compared to the
prior year period. International revenues represented 39.4%,
34.9% and 32.2% of net revenues in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. We expect international sales will continue
to represent a significant portion of net revenues, although we
cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a
percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels.

Net product revenues increased 49.8% in fiscal
year 2004 and 2.0% in fiscal year 2003 as compared to the
previous fiscal year, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2004
was primarily due to absolute growth in the volume of product
sales of our BIG-IP product line as well as incremental revenues
derived from sales of our recently introduced FirePass product
line. Sales of our BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager products
represented 73.1%, 82.8%, and 84.1% of total product revenues in
fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease as
a percentage of total sales was due to an improvement in sales
of our other products, such as our FirePass products which
represented 9.6% of product revenues in fiscal year 2004. We
reported no revenue from sales of TrafficShield, our application
security product recently acquired as part of our purchase of
MagniFire.

Net service revenues increased 42.0% in fiscal
year 2004 compared to a 23.3% increase for fiscal year 2003 from
the prior year, respectively. The continued increases in
services revenue were due to an increase



in the renewal of service and support contracts
by existing customers, as well as an increase in service and
support contracts sold with sales of new products.

Ingram Micro Inc., one of our domestic
distributors, accounted for 19.1% and 12.6% of our total net
revenues in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Ingram
Micro accounted for 26.9% and 17.8% of our accounts receivable
as of September 30, 2004, and 2003, respectively. During
fiscal year 2002, no individual customer or distributor
represented more than 10% of our total net revenues or accounts
receivable for fiscal year 2002.

Cost of Net Product
Revenues.

Cost of net product revenues
consist of finished products purchased from our contract
manufacturers, manufacturing overhead, freight, warranty,
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, and amortization
expenses in connection with developed technology from recent
acquisitions. Cost of net product revenues as a percentage of
net product revenues increased to 22.5% in fiscal year 2004 as
compared to 21.2% in fiscal year 2003. The increase was due to
higher indirect product costs including amortization charges of
our acquired technology and warranty costs associated with the
growth in overall product installation base. The decrease in
fiscal year 2003 was primarily the result of lower warranty,
manufacturing and component costs as compared to fiscal year
2002.

Cost of Net Service
Revenues.

Cost of net service revenues
consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional
services staff, travel, facilities, and depreciation expenses.
Cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service
revenues decreased to 24.4% in fiscal year 2004 as compared to
28.6% and 39.8% in fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
continued decrease is the result of leveraging our existing
services operating infrastructure to support the increased net
service revenue. The increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year
2004 is primarily due to increased salary and benefits
attributed to growth in headcount. Professional services
headcount at the end of fiscal year 2004 increased to 124 from
84 at the end of fiscal year 2003. Going forward, we expect to
increase our cost of service revenues to support our expanded
product lines and growing customer base.



Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries, commissions
and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff, the costs
of our marketing programs, including public relations,
advertising and trade shows, travel, facilities and depreciation
expenses. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a
percentage of total net revenues is the result of leveraging our
existing sales and distribution infrastructure to support the
increased net revenues. In absolute dollars, sales and marketing
expenses increased 22.3% in fiscal year 2004 and 5.7% in fiscal
year 2003 as compared to the previous fiscal year, respectively.
The increase in fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to higher
commission, salary, and employee benefit related expenses. The
increase in commission expenses is consistent with the increased
revenue for the corresponding period. The increased salary and
benefits were the result of growth in our employee headcount in
fiscal year 2004. Sales and marketing headcount at the end of
fiscal 2004 increased to 229 from 211 at the end of fiscal 2003.
The increase in fiscal year 2003, compared to fiscal year 2002,
related primarily to increased payroll and related personnel
costs, and to a lesser extent higher travel costs associated
with increased travel activities. We will strive to further
leverage our sales costs as a percentage of net revenues, but
expect to continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in
absolute dollars in order to grow revenues and increase our
market share.

Research and
Development.

Research and development
expenses consist of the salaries and related benefits for our
product development personnel, prototype materials and expenses
related to the development of new and improved products,
facilities and depreciation expenses. In absolute dollars,
research and development expenses increased 26.6% in fiscal year
2004 and 7.0% in fiscal year 2003 as compared to the previous
fiscal year, respectively. The increases in fiscal years 2004
and 2003 were primarily due to higher salary and benefits costs
attributed to an increase in headcount to 185 from 145 in fiscal
year 2003 and 127 in fiscal 2002. The growth in employee
headcount was primarily related to our acquisition of uRoam,
Inc. in July of 2003 and the acquisition of MagniFire in May of
2004. We expect to continue to increase research and development
expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued
enhancement of our current products and our ability to develop
new, technologically advanced products that meet the changing
needs of our customers.

General and
Administrative.

General and
administrative expenses consist of the salaries, benefits and
related costs of our executive, finance, information technology,
human resource and legal personnel, third-party professional
service fees, bad debt charges, facilities, and depreciation
expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as
a percentage of total net revenues is the result of leveraging
our existing corporate infrastructure to support the increased
net revenues. In absolute dollars, general and administrative
expenses increased 31.0% in fiscal year 2004 and decreased 20.1%
in fiscal year 2003 as compared to the previous fiscal year,
respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2004 is due to
increased



salary and benefit expenses, higher legal
expenses related to a patent suit filed by us against a
competitor that has since been settled, and increased
professional services fees. General and administrative headcount
at the end of fiscal 2004 increased to 75 from 67 at the end of
fiscal 2003. The decrease in fiscal year 2003 is primarily due
to lower bad debt charges and a decrease in professional
services related to patent prosecution and other activities
related to our intellectual property.

Restructuring
Charges.

During the third quarter of
fiscal year 2002, we recorded a restructuring charge of
$2.8 million in connection with management’s decision
to exit the cache appliance business. As a result of changes in
the business, we wrote down certain assets, consolidated
operations and terminated 47 employees throughout all divisions
of the Company. In July 2002, all identified employees had been
notified and terminated resulting in an additional charge of
$0.5 million related to employee separation costs.

Amortization of Unearned
Compensation.

We have recorded
$8.3 million of stock compensation costs since our
inception through September 30, 2004. These compensation
costs represented the difference between the exercise price and
the deemed fair value of certain stock options granted to our
employees and outside directors. These stock options generally
vested ratably over a four-year period. We amortized these
compensation costs using an accelerated method as prescribed by
FASB interpretation No. 28 (“FIN No. 28”).
As of December 31, 2003, the balance of unearned
compensation was fully amortized.

Other Income, Net.

Other income, net, consists primarily of income, realized gains
and losses of sales of investments, and foreign currency
transaction gains and losses. Other income, net, increased
263.6% in fiscal year 2004 and decreased 47.1% in fiscal year
2003 as compared to the previous fiscal year, respectively. The
increase in fiscal year 2004 was due to interest income earned
on proceeds from our public offering completed in November of
2003. The decrease in fiscal year 2003 was due to realized
losses on sales of investments, declining interest rates and
interest income, and an increase in foreign currency transaction
losses.

Provision for Income
Taxes.

The primary difference between
the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate was due to
previous unrecognized deferred tax assets.
SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
or SFAS 109, provides for the recognition of deferred tax
assets if realization is more likely than not. Based on
available evidence, which includes our historical operating
performance and the reported cumulative net losses in all prior
years, we had provided for a full valuation allowance against
our deferred tax assets during fiscal years 2003 and 2002. Based
upon our operating performance in fiscal year 2004 and expected
future taxable income, we determined that our U.S. deferred
tax assets were more likely than not to be realizable.
Therefore, the valuation allowance was reversed and as a result
we realized an income tax benefit of $7.3 million. The
credit from the release of the valuation allowance was partially
offset by actual U.S. and international tax expenses resulting
in a net benefit for income taxes of $3.9 million in fiscal
year



2004. The provision for income taxes in fiscal
years 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of taxes payable in
foreign jurisdictions.

We currently expect our effective tax rate for
fiscal 2005 to be approximately 37%, however our effective tax
rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including
variations in estimated taxable income in our geographic
locations, changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax
assets or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have funded our operations with our cash
balances, cash generated from operations and proceeds from
public offerings.

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments
and long-term investments totaled $222.3 million as of
September 30, 2004 compared to $79.0 million as of
September 30, 2003, representing an increase of
$143.3 million. The increase was due to the net proceeds of
$113.6 million from the sale of 5,175,000 shares of
common stock in a public offering in November 2003. In addition,
cash flow from operations and cash from employee stock option
exercises contributed significantly to the overall increase
since the beginning of our fiscal year. The overall increase in
cash for the year was partially offset by net cash used for the
acquisition of MagniFire of $29.2 million as of
September 30, 2004.

Cash provided by operating activities during
fiscal year 2004 was $40.6 million compared to
$14.6 million in fiscal year 2003 and cash provided in
operating activities was $9.5 million in fiscal year 2002.
Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years 2004 and
2003 resulted primarily from cash generated from net income,
after adjusting for non-cash charges, changes in operating
assets and liabilities and an increase in advance payments from
customers. Advanced payments from customers increased due to
higher sales of service maintenance contracts, which are
typically billed at the beginning of the contract term and
recognized as revenue over the service period. In fiscal year
2002, cash provided by operating activities, after adjusting for
non-cash charges, resulted primarily from changes in operating
assets and liabilities, partially offset by net losses for the
period.

Cash used in investing activities was
$164.7 million for the fiscal year 2004, $38.1 million
for fiscal year 2003 and $12.7 million for fiscal year
2002. The cash used in fiscal year 2004 was due to the purchase
of investments, primarily made possible by the proceeds of our
public offering, and the purchase of property and equipment and
the acquisition of MagniFire, partially offset by the sale of
investments. The cash used in fiscal year 2003 was primarily the
result of the cash used to acquire substantially all the assets
of uRoam and the purchase of investments and property and
equipment partially offset by the sale of investments. The cash
used in the fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to the purchase
of investments and property and equipment partially offset by
the sale of investments.

Cash provided by financing activities was
$138.5 million for fiscal year 2004 compared to
$12.8 million for fiscal year 2003 and $5.5 million
for the fiscal year 2002. During the fiscal year 2004, our
financing activities consisted of $113.6 million net
proceeds received from a public stock offering as well as cash
received from the exercise of employee stock options and
purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. In fiscal
years 2003 and 2002, our financing activities primarily related
to cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and
the purchase of common shares under our employee stock purchase
plan.



We expect that our existing cash and investment
balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our
anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the
foreseeable future.

Obligations and Commitments

The following table summarizes our contractual
payment obligations and commitments as of September 30,
2004:

We lease our facilities under operating leases
that expire at various dates through 2012.

Purchase obligations are comprised of purchase
commitments with our contract manufacturers. The agreement with
our primary contract manufacturer allows them to procure
component inventory on our behalf based on our production
forecast. We are obligated to purchase component inventory that
the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the
forecast, unless cancellation is given within applicable lead
times.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting
policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments
used in the preparation of our financial statements.

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided
under Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2,
“Software Revenue Recognition,” and SOP No. 98-9
“Modification of SOP No. 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions,”
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 48, “Revenue Recognition When Right of
Return Exists,” and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
(SAB) No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements,” and SAB No. 104, “Revenue
Recognition.”

We sell products through distributors, resellers,
and directly to end users. We recognize product revenue upon
shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that collection is
determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain.
In certain regions where we do not have the ability to
reasonably estimate returns, revenue is recognized upon sale to
the end user. In this situation, we receive a sales report from
the channel partner to determine when the sales transaction to
the end user has occurred. Payment terms to domestic customers
are generally net 30 days. Payment terms to international
customers range from net 30 to 90 days based on normal and
customary trade practices in the individual markets. We have
offered extended payment terms ranging from three to six months
to certain customers, in which case, revenue is recognized when
payments are made.

Whenever a software license, hardware,
installation and post-contract customer support
(PCS) elements are combined into a package with a single
“bundled” price, a portion of the sales price is
allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their
respective fair values as determined when the individual
elements are sold separately. Revenues from the license of
software are recognized when the software has been shipped and
the customer is obligated to pay for the software. When rights
of return are



present and we cannot estimate returns, we
recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse. Revenues for
PCS are recognized on a straight-line basis over the service
contract term. PCS includes rights to upgrades, when and if
available, a limited period of telephone support, updates, and
bug fixes. Installation revenue is recognized when the product
has been installed at the customer’s site. Consulting
services are customarily billed at fixed rates, plus
out-of-pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized when the
consulting has been completed. Training revenue is recognized
when the training has been completed.

Reserve for Doubtful
Accounts.

Estimates are used in
determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based
upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of
our remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In
determining these percentages, we evaluate historical
write-offs, current trends in the credit quality of our customer
base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We perform
ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial
condition and generally do not require any collateral. If there
is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or
actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our
allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient.

Reserve for Product
Returns.

In some instances, product
revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing
rights of return. Product returns are estimated based on
historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are
recognized. Accordingly, we reduce recognized revenue for
estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded. When
rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns,
revenue is recognized when such rights lapse. The estimates for
returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in
historical rates of returns, inventory in the distribution
channel and other related factors. It is possible that these
estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts
could vary from our estimates.

Reserve for
Warranties.

A warranty reserve is
established based on our historical experience and an estimate
of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on
products sold as of the balance sheet date. While we believe
that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment
applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and
payable could differ materially from what will actually
transpire in the future.

Accounting for Income
Taxes.

We utilize the liability method
of accounting for income taxes pursuant to SFAS 109.
Accordingly, we are required to estimate our income taxes in
each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the
process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. This
process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure,
including assessing the risks associated with tax audits,
together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the
different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large
number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that
our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future,
which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely
affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows.

SFAS 109 provides for the recognition of
deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those
deferred tax assets will be realized. Management reviews
deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and makes
estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic
sources of taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation
allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated
realizable value. We determined that the valuation allowance
relating to net operating loss carryovers in the United Kingdom
was still necessary and maintained a valuation allowance of
approximately $2.6 million as of September 30, 2004.
However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we reversed
the valuation allowance on our U.S deferred tax assets and as a
result realized a benefit of $7.3 million. This credit was
partially offset by actual tax expenses of $3.4 million
resulting in a net benefit for income taxes of $3.9 million
for the fiscal year 2004. Factors such as our cumulative
profitably in the U.S. and our projected future taxable income
were the key criteria in deciding to release the valuation
allowance. If the estimates and assumptions used in our
determination change in the future, we could be required to
revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our
deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional
income taxes.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-1,
“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments.” EITF 03-1
provides guidance on other-than-temporary impairment models for
marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under
SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities,” and SFAS No. 124,
“Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit
Organizations,” and non-marketable equity securities
accounted for under the cost method. The EITF developed a basic
three-step model to evaluate whether an investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired. On September 30, 2004, the
FASB approved the issuance of FASB Staff Position
(FSP) EITF 03-1-1, which delays the effective date
until additional guidance is issued for the application of the
recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1 to
investments in securities that are impaired. We do not expect
the adoption of EITF 03-1 to have a material effect on our
results of operations or financial condition.

On March 31, 2004, the FASB issued an
Exposure Draft, “Share-Based Payment — An Amendment of
FASB Statement No. 123 and 95.” The proposed Statement
addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise
receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity
instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are
based on the fair value of the enterprise’s equity
instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such
equity instruments. The proposed Statement would eliminate the
ability to account for share-based compensation transactions
using APB No. 25, and generally would require instead that
such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value based
method. As proposed, companies would be required to recognize an
expense for compensation cost related to share-based payment
arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase
plans. As proposed, the new rules would be applied on a modified
prospective basis as defined in the Exposure Draft, and would be
effective for public companies for periods beginning after
June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating option
valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of the evolving
accounting standards related to employee stock options. Current
estimates of option values using the Black-Scholes method may
not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies
ultimately adopted in the final rules.

In September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus
on Issue No. 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently
Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share.”
EITF 04-8 requires that all issued securities that have
embedded conversion features that are contingently exercisable
upon the occurrence of a market-price condition should be in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether
the market price trigger has been met. EITF 04-8 will
become effective in the period when the proposed amendment to
SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share”, becomes
effective. We currently have no contingently convertible debt
and the adoption of EITF 04-8 is not expected to materially
impact our diluted earnings per share.

Risk Factors

In addition to the other information in this
report, the following risk factors should be carefully
considered in evaluating our company and its business.

Our success depends on sales and continued
    innovation of our BIG-IP product line

For the fiscal year ended September 30,
2004, we derived 73.1% of our product revenues from sales of our
BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager product line. We expect to derive a
significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our BIG-IP
products in the future. Implementation of our strategy depends
upon BIG-IP being able to solve critical network availability
and performance problems of our customers. If BIG-IP is unable
to solve these problems for our customers, or if we are unable
to sustain the high levels of innovation in BIG-IP’s
product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will
continue to be a competitive market environment, our business
and results of operations will be harmed.



Our success depends on our timely development
of new products and features, market acceptance of new product
offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle
of our products

We expect the secure application traffic
management market to be characterized by rapid technological
change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer
requirements and evolving industry standards. Our continued
success depends on our ability to identify and develop new
products and new features for our existing products to meet the
demands of these changes, and for those products and features to
be accepted by our existing and target customers. If we are
unable to identify, develop and deploy new products and new
product features on a timely basis, our business and results of
operations may be harmed.

In September 2004, we announced the release of
our next-generation BIG-IP product featuring the Traffic
Management Operating System, or TM/ OS. This major new version
of BIG-IP represents the culmination of over two years of
research and development efforts and our continued success
depends significantly on the acceptance of the new hardware and
software platforms associated with this release by our existing
and target customers.

The current life cycle of our products is
typically 12 to 24 months. The introduction of new products
or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our
existing products, or replace sales of some of our current
products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful
product introduction, and may cause customers to defer
purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new
products. This could harm our operating results by decreasing
sales, increasing our inventory levels of older products and
exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence. We have
also experienced, and may in the future experience, delays in
developing and releasing new products and product enhancements.
This has led to, and may in the future lead to, delayed sales,
increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated.
Also, in the development of our products, we have experienced
delays in the prototyping of our products, which in turn has led
to delays in product introductions. In addition, complexity and
difficulties in managing product transitions at the end-of-life
stage of a product can create excess inventory of components
associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased
expenses. Any or all of the above problems could materially harm
our business and operating results.

We may not be able to compete effectively in
the emerging secure application traffic management
market

The markets we serve are new, rapidly evolving
and highly competitive, and we expect competition to persist and
intensify in the future. Our principal competitors in the secure
application traffic management market include Cisco Systems,
Inc., Nortel Networks Corporation, Foundry Networks, Inc.,
NetScaler, Inc., Redline Networks, Inc., Radware Ltd. and
Juniper Networks, Inc. We expect to continue to face additional
competition as new participants enter the secure application
traffic management market. In addition, larger companies with
significant resources, brand recognition and sales channels may
form alliances with or acquire competing traffic management or
security solutions and emerge as significant competitors.
Potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate
an Internet traffic management or security component into
existing products in a manner that discourages users from
purchasing our products.

Our quarterly and annual operating results are
volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate

Our quarterly and annual operating results have
varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in
the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our
future operating results. In particular, we anticipate that the
size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on
larger business accounts. A delay in the recognition of revenue,
even from just one account, may have a significant negative
impact on our results of operations for a given period. In the
past, a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of
a quarter. Accordingly, a delay in an anticipated sale past the
end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of
operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that year.
Additionally, we have exposure to the credit risks of some of
our customers and sub-tenants. Although we have programs in
place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated
risk, there



can be no assurance that such programs will be
effective in reducing our credit risks adequately. We monitor
individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements,
seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our
customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate
to cover exposure for potential losses. If there is a
deterioration of a sub-tenant’s or major customer’s
creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected,
future resulting losses, if incurred, could harm our business
and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Further, our operating results may be below the
expectations of securities analysts and investors in future
quarters or years. Our failure to meet these expectations will
likely harm the market price of our common stock.

The average selling price of our products may
decrease and our costs may increase, which may negatively impact
gross profits

We anticipate that the average selling prices of
our products will decrease in the future in response to
competitive pricing pressures, increased sales discounts, new
product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors.
Therefore, in order to maintain our gross profits, we must
develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a
timely basis and continually reduce our product costs. Our
failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to
decline, which will harm our business and results of operations.
In addition, we may experience substantial period-to-period
fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of
our average selling prices.

It is difficult to predict our future
operating results because we have an unpredictable sales
cycle

Our products have a lengthy sales cycle, which is
difficult to predict. Historically, our sales cycle has ranged
from approximately two to three months and has tended to
lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on
the enterprise market. Also, as our distribution strategy has
evolved into more of a channel model, utilizing value-added
resellers, distributors and systems integrators, the level of
variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has
increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of
many of our sales transactions. Sales of our BIG-IP, FirePass
and TrafficShield products require us to educate potential
customers in their use and benefits. Sales of our products are
subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting, approval
and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and
governmental entities may require. For example, customers
frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis
and devote time and resources to testing our products before
they decide whether or not to purchase. Customers may also defer
orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or
enhancements by our competitors or us. As a result, our products
have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the
uncertainty of our future operating results.

Our business may be harmed if our contract
manufacturer is not able to provide us with adequate supplies of
our products or if this single source of hardware assembly is
lost or impaired

We rely on a third party contract manufacturers
to assemble our products. We outsource the manufacturing of our
hardware platforms to contract manufacturers who assemble these
hardware platforms to our specifications. We have experienced
minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the
past. However, if we experience major delays in the future or
other problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient
quantity of product, any one or a combination of these factors
may harm our business and results of operations. The inability
of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate
supplies of our products or the loss of our contract
manufacturer may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders
while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our
business and results of operations. In particular, because we
subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to a single
contract manufacturer, with whom we do not have a long-term
contract, any termination, loss or impairment in our arrangement
with this single source of hardware assembly, or any impairment
of their facilities or operations, would harm our business,
financial condition and results of operation.



If the demand for our products grows, we will
need to increase our raw material and component purchases,
contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality
functions. Any disruptions in product flow may limit our
revenue, may harm our competitive position and may result in
additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers.

Our business could suffer if there are any
interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components
from our third-party sources

We currently purchase several hardware components
used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or
limited sources. Lead times for these components vary
significantly. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of
these hardware components, or the inability to procure a similar
component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a
reasonable time, may delay assembly and sales of our products
and, hence, our revenues, and may harm our business and results
of operations.

We may not adequately protect our intellectual
property and our products may infringe on the intellectual
property rights of third parties

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright,
trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure
of confidential and proprietary information to protect our
intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our
proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or
otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring
unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be
certain that the steps we have taken will prevent
misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign
countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights
as fully as in the United States.

Our industry is characterized by the existence of
a large number of patents and frequent claims and related
litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property
rights. In the ordinary course of our business, we are involved
in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding
their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we
will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims.
If we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, or
if we otherwise settle such claims, we could be compelled to pay
damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those
intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they
no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights. Any license
could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at
all. Similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid
infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical. In
addition, we have initiated, and may in the future initiate,
claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of
our proprietary rights, including infringement of a patent we
hold on our “cookie persistence” technology, to
determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or
those of our competitors. Any of these claims, whether claims
that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others, or vice
versa, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in
costly litigation and diversion of technical and management
personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology,
develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or
licensing agreements. Further, our license agreements typically
require us to indemnify our customers and resellers for
infringement actions related to our technology, which could
cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against
our customers or resellers. Any of the above-described
circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes
could result in our business and results of operations being
harmed.

Future changes in financial accounting
standards or our revenue recognition policies may cause adverse
unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results
of operations

A change in accounting policies can have a
significant effect on our reported results and may even affect
our reporting of transactions completed before the change is
effective. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of
pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the
future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current
practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or
the way we conduct our business.



In particular, if we are required to record stock
option grants as compensation expense on our income statement,
our profitability may be reduced significantly. The current
methodology for expensing such stock options is based on, among
other things, the historical volatility of the underlying stock.
Our stock price has been historically volatile. Therefore, the
adoption of an accounting standard requiring companies to
expense stock options would negatively impact our profitability
and may adversely impact our stock price. In addition, the
adoption of such a standard could limit our ability to continue
to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool, which
could, in turn, hurt our ability to recruit employees and retain
existing employees.

Similarly, while we believe our current revenue
recognition policies and practices are consistent with
applicable accounting standards, current revenue recognition
accounting standards, and accounting guidance with respect to
such standards, are subject to change. Such changes could lead
to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting
practices, and such changes could significantly reduce our
future revenues and earnings, which would likely have a material
adverse effect on the price of our common stock.

We are required to comply with
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 regarding
internal control attestation and any inability to do so may
negatively impact the report on our financial statements to be
provided by our independent auditors

We are in the process of implementing the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 which requires our management to assess the effectiveness
of our internal controls over financial reporting and include an
assertion in our annual report as to the effectiveness of our
controls. Subsequently, our independent auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, will be required to attest to
whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal
controls over financial reporting is fairly stated in all
material respects and separately report on whether it believes
we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
controls over financial reporting as of September 30, 2005.
We are in the process of performing the system and process
documentation, evaluation and testing required for management to
make this assessment and for the auditors to provide its
attestation report. We have not completed this process or its
assessment, and this process will require significant amounts of
management time and resources.

We expect to comply with the reporting disclosure
requirements of Section 404 by our year ending
September 30, 2005, including remediation of any
deficiencies identified in our existing internal controls.
However, if we are not able to remediate any identified
deficiencies in a timely fashion or to otherwise comply with the
Section 404 requirements for the year ending
September 30, 2005, we will not be able to give assurance
regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls and the
attestation report on our evaluation of our internal controls
provided by our independent auditors may be negatively affected.

We may not be able to sustain or develop new
distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to
a significant distribution partner could hurt our
business

Our sales strategy requires that we establish and
maintain multiple distribution channels in the United States and
internationally through leading industry resellers, systems
integrators, Internet service providers and other channel
partners. We have a limited number of agreements with companies
in these channels, and we may not be able to increase our number
of distribution relationships or maintain our existing
relationships. If we are unable to establish and maintain our
indirect sales channels, our business and results of operations
will be harmed. In addition, one domestic distributor of our
products accounted for 19.1% and 12.6% of our total net revenue
for the fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. A substantial
reduction or delay in sales of our products to this or any other
key distribution partner could harm our business, operating
results and financial condition.



Undetected software errors may harm our
business and results of operations

Software products frequently contain undetected
errors when first introduced or as new versions are released. We
have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new
products and product upgrades. We expect that these errors will
be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after
commencement of commercial shipments. These problems may cause
us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the
attention of our engineering personnel from our product
development efforts and cause significant customer relations
problems. We may also be subject to liability claims for damages
related to product errors. While we carry insurance policies
covering this type of liability, these policies may not provide
sufficient protection should a claim be asserted. A material
product liability claim may harm our business and results of
operations.

Our products must successfully operate with
products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in
a network, it may be difficult to identify the source of the
problem. The occurrence of software errors, whether caused by
our products or another vendor’s products, may result in
the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products. The
occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and
results of operations.

Our expansion into international markets may
not succeed

We intend to continue expanding into
international markets. International sales represented 39.4% of
our net revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2004, 34.9% of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2003 and 32.2% of our net revenues for the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2002. We have engaged sales
personnel throughout Japan, Europe and the Asia Pacific region.
Our continued growth will require further expansion of our
international operations in the Japanese, European, Asia Pacific
and other markets. If we are unable to expand our international
operations successfully and in a timely manner, our business and
results of operations may be harmed. Such expansion may be more
difficult or take longer than we anticipate, and we may not be
able to successfully market, sell, deliver and support our
products internationally.

Our operating results are exposed to risks
associated with international commerce

As our international sales increase, our
operating results become more exposed to international operating
risks. These risks include risks related to potential recessions
in economies outside the United States, foreign currency
exchange rates, managing foreign sales offices, regulatory,
political, or economic conditions in specific countries,
military conflict or terrorist activities, changes in laws and
tariffs, inadequate protection of intellectual property rights
in foreign countries, foreign regulatory requirements, and
natural disasters. All of these factors could have a material
adverse effect on our business. In particular, in fiscal year
2004, we derived 15.7% of our total revenue from the Japanese
market. This revenue is dependent on a number of factors outside
our control, including the viability and success of our
resellers and the strength of the Japanese, which has been weak
in recent years.

Acquisitions, including our recent acquisition
of MagniFire, present many risks and we may not realize the
financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time
of the transaction

With respect to our May 2004 acquisition of all
of the capital stock of MagniFire, as well as any other future
acquisitions we may undertake, we may find that the acquired
assets do not further our business strategy as expected, or that
we paid more than what the assets are later worth, or that
economic conditions change, all of which may generate future
impairment charges. There may be difficulty integrating the
operations and personnel of the acquired business, and we may
have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired
business. In the case of the acquisition of MagniFire, because
it was based in Israel and because the employees we hired in
connection with the acquisition were not relocated to Seattle,
the above-mentioned integration and personnel retention issues
represent a particular risk to us. We may have difficulty in
incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our
existing product lines. Our ongoing business and
management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by
transition or



integration issues and the complexity of managing
geographically and culturally diverse locations. We may have
difficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures
and policies across locations. We may experience significant
problems or liabilities associated with the product quality,
technology and other matters.

Our inability to successfully operate and
integrate newly-acquired businesses appropriately, effectively
and in a timely manner, or to retain key personnel of MagniFire
or any other acquired business, could have a material adverse
effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in
demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions
and other advances in technology, as well as on our revenues,
gross margins and expenses. In particular, in connection with
our acquisition of MagniFire, we initiated a significant change
in our organizational structure, forming a new security business
unit headed by one of our most senior executives. The aim of
this new division, which includes our FirePass and TrafficShield
products, is to provide focus and expertise across research and
development, marketing, sales and services to position our
business for success and leadership in application security;
however, we may find that this organizational realignment does
not achieve our desired goals with respect to the application
security market and that the shift in resources away from our
core application traffic management market may result in a
weakening of our competitive position in the latter market and
ultimately have a material adverse effect on our overall
business results.

Our success depends on our key personnel and
our ability to attract, train and retain qualified marketing and
sales, professional services and customer support
personnel

Our success depends to a significant degree upon
the continued contributions of our key management, product
development, sales, marketing and finance personnel, many of
which may be difficult to replace. The complexity of our secure
application traffic management products and their integration
into existing networks and ongoing support, as well as the
sophistication of our sales and marketing effort, requires us to
retain highly trained professional services, customer support
and sales personnel. In spite of the economic downturn,
competition for qualified professional services, customer
support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because
of the limited number of people available with the necessary
technical skills and understanding of our products. Our ability
to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by
volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock, since
these employees are generally granted stock options. The loss of
services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain
and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in
hiring qualified personnel, may harm our business and results of
operations.

We face litigation risks

We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course
of our business. Litigation in general, and intellectual
property and securities litigation in particular, can be
expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations.
Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult
to predict. We believe that we have defenses in the lawsuits
pending against us and we are vigorously contesting these
allegations. Responding to the allegations has been, and will
likely continue to be, expensive and time-consuming for us. An
unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect
our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Anti-takeover provisions could make it more
difficult for a third party to acquire us

Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue
up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine
the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions,
including voting rights, of those shares without any further
vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of
common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected
by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be
issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have
the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of
control of our company without further action by our
stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other
rights of the holders of common stock. Further, certain
provisions of our bylaws, including a provision limiting the
ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of



stockholders without giving advance notice, may
have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or
management of our company, which could have an adverse effect on
the market price of our common stock. In addition, our articles
of incorporation provide for a staggered board, which may make
it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board
of directors. Similarly, state anti-takeover laws in the State
of Washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or
delay a change of control of our company.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About
    Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk.

Our cash equivalents consist of high-quality securities, as
specified in our investment policy guidelines. The policy limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a
maximum of 5% of the total portfolio with the exception of
U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper and money market
funds, which are exempt from size limitation. The policy
requires investments in securities that mature in three years or
less, with the average maturity being no greater than one and a
half years. These securities are subject to interest rate risk
and will decrease in value if interest rates increase. A
decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have
resulted in a decrease of approximately $1.8 million in our
interest income.

Foreign Currency
Risk.

The majority of our sales and
expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result,
we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction
gains and losses to date. While we have conducted some
transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2004 and expect to continue to do so, we do
not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses
will be significant at our current level of operations. However,
as we continue to expand our operations internationally,
transaction gains or losses may become significant in the
future. We have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date.
However, we may do so in the future.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

The Company

F5 Networks, Inc. (the Company) provides products
and services to help companies efficiently and securely manage
their Internet traffic. The Company’s products enhance the
delivery, optimization and security of application traffic on
Internet-based networks. Internet traffic passes through the
Company’s products where it is inspected and modified to
ensure that it is delivered securely and in a way that optimizes
the performance of both the network and the applications. The
Company also offers a broad range of services such as
consulting, training, installation, maintenance, and other
technical support services.

Certain Risks and Uncertainties

The Company’s products and services are
concentrated in highly competitive markets characterized by
rapid technological advances, frequent changes in customer
requirements and evolving regulatory requirements and industry
standards. Failure to anticipate or respond adequately to
technological advances, changes in customer requirements and
changes in regulatory requirements or industry standards could
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business
and operating results. Additionally, certain other factors could
affect the Company’s future operating results and cause
actual results to differ materially from expectations, including
but not limited to, dependence on a third party manufacturer,
difficulties in managing growth, difficulties in attracting and
retaining qualified personnel, dependence on key personnel,
enforcement of intellectual property rights, the lengthening of
sales cycles and an uneven pattern of quarterly results.

Accounting Principles

The Company’s consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes are prepared on the accrual
basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as
of the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Estimates are used in accounting for revenue recognition,
reserves for doubtful accounts, product returns, obsolete and
excess inventory, warranties, valuation allowance on deferred
tax assets and purchase price allocations. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with purchased maturities of three months or less to
be cash equivalents. The Company invests its cash and cash
equivalents in deposits with three major financial institutions,
which, at times, exceed federally insured limits. The Company
has not experienced any losses on its cash and cash equivalents.



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Investments

The Company classifies its investment securities
as available for sale. Investment securities, consisting of
corporate and municipal bonds and notes and United States
government securities, are reported at fair value with the
related unrealized gains and losses included as a component of
shareholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and
declines in value of securities judged to be other than
temporary are included in other income (expense). The cost of
investments for purposes of computing realized and unrealized
gains and losses is based on the specific identification method.
Investments in securities with maturities of less than one year
or where management’s intent is to use the investments to
fund current operations are classified as short-term
investments. Investments with maturities of greater than one
year are classified as long-term investments.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company extends credit to customers and is
therefore subject to credit risk. The Company performs initial
and ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial
condition and does not require collateral. An allowance for
doubtful accounts, in an amount based on historical levels, is
recorded to account for potential bad debts. Estimates are used
in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based
upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of
remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In determining
these percentages, the Company evaluates historical write-offs,
and current trends in customer credit quality, as well as
changes in credit policies.

The Company maintains its cash and investment
balances with high credit quality financial institutions.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

For certain financial instruments, including cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, recorded amounts approximate fair market
value, due to the short maturities of these instruments.

Short-term and long-term investments are recorded
at fair value as the underlying securities are classified as
available for sale and marked-to-market at each reporting period.

Inventories

The Company outsources the manufacturing of its
pre-configured hardware platforms to contract manufacturers, who
assemble each product to the Company’s specifications. As
protection against component shortages and to provide
replacement parts for its service teams, the Company also stocks
limited supplies of certain key product components. Inventories
consist of hardware and related component parts and are recorded
at the lower of cost or market (as determined by the first-in,
first-out method).

Inventories consist of the following (in
thousands):



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash represents escrow accounts
established in connection with lease agreements for the
Company’s corporate headquarters and, to a lesser extent,
our international facilities. Under the terms of the lease for
our corporate headquarters, the amount required to be held in
escrow will be reduced and eventually eliminated at various
dates throughout the duration of the lease term as set forth in
the lease agreement.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of
capital leases are provided using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from two to
five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser
of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the
improvements. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs is
charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for major
improvements are capitalized at cost. Gains or losses on the
disposition of assets are reflected in the results of operations
at the time of disposal.

Property and equipment consist of the following
(in thousands):

Depreciation and amortization expense totaled
approximately $4.0 million, $4.7 million, and
$5.4 million for the fiscal years ended September 30,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price
over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired as of the
acquisition date. The Company has adopted the requirements of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
(SFAS No. 142). SFAS No. 142 requires
goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and
between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down
when impaired. Goodwill of $24.2 million was recorded in
connection with the acquisition of uRoam, Inc. in fiscal year
2003 and goodwill of $25.9 million was recorded in
connection with the acquisition of MagniFire in fiscal year
2004. The Company completed its annual impairment test and
concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal
year 2004.

Other Assets

Other assets primarily consist of software
development costs and acquired technology.

Software development costs are charged to
research and development expense until technological feasibility
is established. We account for internally-generated software
development costs in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, “Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or
Otherwise Marketed.” Thereafter, until the product is
released for sale, software development costs are capitalized
and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

realizable value of each product. The
establishment of technological feasibility and the on-going
assessment of recoverability of costs require considerable
judgment by the Company with respect to certain internal and
external factors, including, but not limited to, anticipated
future gross product revenues, estimated economic life and
changes in hardware and software technology. During the years
ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company capitalized
$424,000 and $474,000 of software development costs,
respectively. Related amortization costs of $328,000 and
$298,000 were recorded during the fiscal years 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Acquired technology is recorded at cost and
amortized over its estimated useful life of five years. Acquired
technology of $5.0 million in fiscal year 2004 and
$3.0 million in fiscal year 2003 was recorded in connection
with the acquisitions of MagniFire and uRoam, respectively.
Related amortization expense totaled $933,000 and $100,000
during the fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived
assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. When such events occur, management determines
whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated
undiscounted net future cash flows to the related asset’s
carrying value. If impairment exists, the asset is written down
to its estimated fair value.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
the guidance provided under Statement of Position
(SOP) No. 97-2, “Software Revenue
Recognition,” and SOP No. 98-9 “Modification of
SOP No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to
Certain Transactions,” Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 48, “Revenue Recognition
When Right of Return Exists,” and SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements,” and SAB No. 104, “Revenue
Recognition.”

The Company sells products through distributors,
resellers, and directly to end users. The Company recognizes
product revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns,
provided that collection is determined to be probable and no
significant obligations remain. In certain regions where the
Company does not have the ability to reasonably estimate
returns, revenue is recognized upon sale to the end user. In
this situation, the Company receives a sales report from the
channel partner to determine when the sales transaction to the
end user has occurred. Payment terms to domestic customers are
generally net 30 days. Payment terms to international
customers range from net 30 to 90 days based on normal and
customary trade practices in the individual markets. The Company
has offered extended payment terms ranging from three to six
months to certain customers, in which case, revenue is
recognized when payments are made.

Whenever a software license, hardware,
installation and post-contract customer support, or PCS,
elements are combined into a package with a single
“bundled” price, a portion of the sales price is
allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their
respective fair values as determined when the individual
elements are sold separately. Revenues from the license of
software are recognized when the software has been shipped and
the customer is obligated to pay for the software. When rights
of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, the
Company recognizes revenue when such rights of return lapse.
Revenues for PCS are recognized on a straight-line basis over
the service contract term. PCS includes rights to upgrades, when
and if available, a limited period of telephone support,
updates, and bug fixes. Installation revenue is recognized when
the product has been installed at the customer’s site.
Consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates, plus
out-of-pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized when the
consulting has been completed. Training revenue is recognized
when the training has been completed.



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling fees charged to our
customers are recognized as revenue in the period shipped;
however, the related costs for providing these services are
recorded as a cost of sale.

Guarantees and Product Warranties

In the normal course of business to facilitate
sales of its products, the Company indemnifies other parties,
including customers, resellers, lessors, and parties to other
transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters.
The Company has agreed to hold the other party harmless against
losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or
out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made
against certain parties. These agreements may limit the time
within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount
of the claim. In addition, the Company has entered into
indemnification agreements with its officers and directors, and
the Company’s bylaws contain similar indemnification
obligations to the Company’s agents. It is not possible to
determine the maximum potential amount under these
indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior
indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each particular agreement.

The Company generally offers warranties of
90 days for hardware and one year for software, with the
option of purchasing additional warranty coverage in increments
of one year. The Company accrues for warranty costs as part of
its cost of sales based on associated material product costs and
technical support labor costs. During the years ended
September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 warranty expense was
$0.9 million, $0.3 million and $1.6 million,
respectively.

The following table summarizes the activity
related to product warranties (in thousands):

Research and Development

Research and development expenses consist of
salaries and related benefits of product development personnel
and an allocation of facilities and depreciation expense.
Research and development expenses are reflected in the statement
of operations as incurred.

Advertising

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The
Company incurred $1.7 million, $1.0 million and
$1.5 million in advertising costs during the fiscal years
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company utilizes the liability method of
accounting for income taxes as set forth by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes,” or SFAS 109. Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences
between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
in which the differences are expected to reverse. The
realization of deferred tax assets is based on historical tax

positions and expectations about future taxable
income. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely
than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.

Foreign Currency

The financial statements of all majority-owned
subsidiaries and related entities, with a functional currency
other than the U.S. dollar, have been translated into
U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 52 “Foreign Currency
Translation.” The functional currency for the
company’s foreign subsidiaries is the local currency in
which the respective entity is located, with the exception of F5
Networks, Ltd., in the United Kingdom that uses the
U.S. dollar as its functional currency. An entity’s
functional currency is determined by the currency of the
economic environment in which the majority of cash is generated
and expended by the entity. All assets and liabilities of the
respective entities are translated at year-end exchange rates
and all revenues and expenses are translated at the average
exchange rate for the period presented. Translation adjustments
are reported as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensible income (loss).

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency,
including U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on those foreign
currency transactions are included in determining net income or
loss for the period of exchange. Net transaction losses of
$466,000 and $544,000 were charged to operations for the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A net
transaction gain of $15,000 was realized for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2002.

Segments

The Company complies with the requirements of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 131, “Disclosure about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,” which establishes
annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise’s
operating segments and related disclosures about its products,
services, geographic areas and major customers. Management has
determined that the Company operates in one segment.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based employee
compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB
No. 25), “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” FASB Interpretation No. 44 (FIN
No. 44), “Accounting for Certain Transactions
Involving Stock Compensation,” and related interpretations
and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(SFAS No. 123), “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” Under APB No. 25, compensation expense
is based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant,
between the deemed fair value of the Company’s stock and
the exercise price of the option. The unearned compensation is
being amortized in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 28 on an accelerated
basis over the vesting period of the individual options. The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and
related interpretations.

The pro forma effect on the Company’s net
income (loss) and net income (loss) per share of applying
SFAS No. 123, utilizing the assumptions described in
note 7 “Shareholders’ Equity,” would have
been as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

Earnings Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by
dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
(loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by
the weighted average number of common and dilutive common stock
equivalent shares outstanding during the period.

The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands,
except per share data).

Approximately 1.4 and 2.6 million of common
shares potentially issuable from stock options for the years
ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 are excluded from the
calculation of diluted earnings per share because the effect was
antidilutive. For fiscal year 2002, in which the Company
incurred a net loss, all common stock equivalent shares are
excluded from the calculation as their impact would have been
antidilutive.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-1,
“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments.” EITF 03-1
provides guidance on other-than-temporary impairment models for
marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under
SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities,” and SFAS No. 124,
“Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit
Organizations,” and non-marketable equity securities
accounted for under the cost method. The EITF developed a basic
three-step model to evaluate whether an investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired. On September 30, 2004, the
FASB approved the issuance of FASB Staff Position
(FSP) EITF 03-1-1, which delays the effective date
until additional guidance is issued for the application of the
recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1 to
investments in securities that are impaired. The Company does
not expect the adoption of EITF 03-1 to have a material
effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial
condition.

On March 31, 2004, the FASB issued an
Exposure Draft, “Share-Based Payment — An Amendment of
FASB Statement No. 123 and 95.” The proposed Statement
addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise
receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity
instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are
based on the fair value of the enterprise’s equity
instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such
equity instruments. The proposed Statement would eliminate the
ability to account for share-based compensation transactions
using APB No. 25, and generally would require instead that
such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value based
method. As proposed, companies would be required to recognize an
expense for compensation cost related to share-based payment
arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase
plans. As proposed, the new rules would be applied on a modified
prospective basis as defined in the Exposure Draft, and would be
effective for public companies for periods beginning after
June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating option
valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of the evolving
accounting standards related to employee stock options. Current
estimates of option values using the Black-Scholes method may
not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies
ultimately adopted in the final rules.

In September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus
on Issue No. 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently
Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share.”
EITF 04-8 requires that all issued securities that have
embedded conversion features that are contingently exercisable
upon the occurrence of a market-price condition should be in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether
the market price trigger has been met. EITF 04-8 will
become effective in the period when the proposed amendment to
SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share”, becomes
effective. The Company currently has no contingently convertible
debt and the adoption of EITF 04-8 is not expected to
materially impact diluted earnings per share.

Business Combinations

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
“Business Combinations.” The total purchase price is
allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The
excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded
as goodwill. The fair value assigned to the tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on
estimates and assumptions provided by management, and other
information compiled by management, including independent
valuations, prepared by valuation specialists that utilize
established valuation techniques appropriate for the technology
industry. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and other Intangible
Assets,” goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested
for impairment at least annually.

Acquisition of MagniFire Websystems,
Inc.

On May 31, 2004, the Company completed its
acquisition of MagniFire Websystems, Inc. a provider of web
application firewall products. As a result of the merger, the
Company acquired all the assets of MagniFire, including
MagniFire’s web application firewall product line
(TrafficShield), all property, equipment and other assets that
MagniFire used in its business and assumed certain of the
liabilities of MagniFire. The purchase price was
$30.5 million including $1.5 million of transactions
costs. The results of operations of MagniFire have been included
in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from
June 1, 2004 to September 30, 2004.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The purchase price allocation is as follows (in
thousands):

Of the total estimated purchase price,
$5.0 million was allocated to developed technology. To
determine the value of the developed technology, a combination
of cost and market approaches were used. The cost approach
required an estimation of the costs required to reproduce the
acquired technology. The market approach measures the fair value
of the technology through an analysis of recent comparable
transactions. The $5.0 million allocated to developed
technology is being amortized on a straight-line basis over an
estimated useful life of five years.

At the time of the acquisition, the estimated
purchase price was allocated to goodwill in the amount of
$24.8 million, including the Company’s full valuation
allowance on deferred taxes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2004, the Company reversed the valuation allowance and
therefore increased the amount allocated to goodwill by an
additional $1.1 million due to the deferred tax liability
that was assumed as a result of the acquisition.

Acquisition of uRoam, Inc.

On July 23, 2003, the Company acquired
substantially all of the assets of uRoam, Inc. (uRoam),
including uRoam’s FirePass product line, and assumed
certain liabilities for cash of $25.0 million. The Company
also incurred $2.4 million of direct transaction costs for
a total purchase price of $27.4 million. uRoam’s
FirePass server is a comprehensive remote access product that
enables users to access applications in a secure fashion using
industry standard Secured Socket Layer technology. The acquired
technology is currently being amortized over its estimated
useful life of five years using the straight-line method. The
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired of
$24.2 million was recorded as goodwill. The results of
operations of uRoam have been included in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

of business and other changes in the overall business, the
Company incurred restructuring charges of $3.3 million in
the fiscal year 2002. The restructuring charges included
employee termination benefits, impaired assets, consolidation of
excess facilities, and other obligations for which the Company
no longer derives an economic benefit. There were no
restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal years 2004 and
2003. As of September 30, 2004, total cash payments and
write-offs of approximately $2.7 million had been recorded.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The activity of the remaining restructuring
liability included as a component of accrued liabilities on the
balance sheet as of September 30, 2004 and 2003 is
presented below (in thousands):

The excess facilities charge was the result of
the Company’s decision to exit its support facility in
Washington D.C. and was estimated based on current comparable
rates for leases in the respective market. In April 2003, the
excess facilities were subleased at the then current market
value. The difference between the lease payments and sublease
income has historically been applied against the restructuring
liability. The excess facilities liability is scheduled to be
paid over the remaining term of the lease ending in April 2007.
During the three months ended December 31, 2003, timely
receipts of sublease income were not received and the
collectibility of sublease income was in question. Because of
this uncertainty, neither the rent payment nor receipt of
sublease income was applied against the restructuring liability
during the December quarter. However, during the remainder of
fiscal 2004 we received payments of sublease income and have
therefore applied the rent payment and the sublease income
against the restructuring liability. In the event we are unable
to collect sublease income throughout the duration of the lease
term, the actual loss may be increased from the original
estimate.

The tax effects of the temporary differences that
give rise to the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as
follows (in thousands):

The Company had provided for a full valuation
allowance against the deferred tax assets during fiscal years
2003 and 2002. The Company determined that the valuation
allowance primarily relating to net operating loss carryovers in
the United Kingdom was still necessary and maintained a
valuation allowance of approximately $2.6 million as of
September 30, 2004. However, based on an evaluation of
current operating results and expected future taxable income the
Company determined that the U.S. deferred tax assets were
more likely than not to be realizable and reversed the related
valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

At September 30, 2004, the Company had
approximately $63.1 million of U.S. net operating loss
carry-forwards resulting from tax benefits associated with
employee stock option plans, a portion of which begins to expire
in 2011. When an employee exercises a stock option issued under
a nonqualified plan, or has a disqualifying disposition related
to a qualified plan, the Company receives an income tax benefit
for the difference between the fair market value of the stock
issued at the time of the exercise and the employee’s
option price, tax effected. In connection with the release of
the valuation allowance in fiscal year 2004, the Company
recognized cumulative tax benefits related to the exercise of
employee stock options in the amount of $26.4 million.
These benefits are recorded as an increase to stockholders’
equity. During the fiscal years 2003 and 2002, no adjustments
were made to stockholders’ equity relating to tax benefits
from employee stock transactions due to the full valuation
allowance on deferred tax assets.

The Company’s deferred tax assets also
include net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
$9.2 million related to operations in the United Kingdom
that carry-forward indefinitely. The Company also has Research
and Experimentation Credit carry-forwards which will begin to
expire in fiscal year 2011.

1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In May 1999, the board of directors approved the
adoption of the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan). A total of 2,000,000 shares of common

Purchase Plan. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible
employees to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock
through periodic payroll deductions of up to 15% of base
compensation. No employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth
of stock, determined at the fair market value of the shares at
the time such option is granted, in one calendar year. The
Employee Stock Purchase Plan has been implemented in a series of
offering periods, each 6 months in duration. The price at
which the common stock may be purchased is 85% of the lesser of
the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the
first day of the applicable offering period or on the last day
of the respective purchase period. As of September 30, 2004
there were 1,148,872 shares available for awards under the

Litigation

In July and August 2001, a series of putative
securities class action lawsuits were filed in United States
District Court, Southern District of New York against certain
investment banking firms that underwrote the Company’s
initial and secondary public offerings, the Company and some of
the Company’s officers and directors. These cases, which
have been consolidated under In re F5 Networks, Inc. Initial
Public Offering Securities Litigation, No. 01 CV 7055,
assert that the registration statements for the Company’s
June 4, 1999 initial public offering and September 30,
1999 secondary offering failed to disclose certain alleged
improper actions by the underwriters for the offerings. The
consolidated, amended complaint alleges claims against the
Company and those of our officers and directors named in the
complaint under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of
1933, and under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Other lawsuits have been filed making
similar allegations regarding the public offerings of more than
300 other companies. All of these various consolidated cases
have been coordinated for pretrial purposes as In re Initial
Public Offering Securities Litigation, Civil Action
No. 21-MC-92. In October 2002, the directors and officers
were dismissed without prejudice. The issuer defendants filed a
coordinated motion to dismiss these lawsuits in July 2002, which
the Court granted in part and denied in part in an order dated
February 19, 2003. The Court declined to dismiss the
Section 11 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5
claims against the Company. In June 2004, a stipulation of
settlement for the claims against the issuer defendants,
including the Company, was submitted to the court. The
settlement is subject to a number of conditions, including
approval by the Court. If the settlement does not occur, and
litigation against us continues, we believe we have meritorious
defenses and intend to defend the case vigorously. Securities
class action litigation could result in substantial costs and
divert our management’s attention and resources. Due to the
inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately
predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation, and any
unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and operating results.

On March 19, 2003, we sued Radware, Inc.
alleging that Radware infringed F5’s U.S. Patent
No. 6,473,802. The Complaint sought injunctive relief,
damages, enhanced damages, attorneys fees and interest on the
basis that Radware infringed the ‘802 patent. The ‘802
patent is generally directed at the use of cookies to create
persistent sessions between a client and a server. We filed an
amended complaint on March 25, 2004, adding Radware, Ltd.,
as a defendant. Radware, Ltd. and Radware, Inc. denied
infringement, and filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory
judgment that they did not infringe and that the ‘802
patent was invalid. This lawsuit was settled in September, 2004.
Under the settlement agreement, Radware has taken a nonexclusive
license to the ‘802 patent.

On July 20, 2004, Radware, Inc. and Radware,
Ltd. sued us in the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey, asserting that F5 Networks has infringed
and is infringing upon Radware’s U.S. Patent
No. 6,718,359 (“‘359 patent”), which issued
on April 6, 2004. The Complaint alleges that F5 Networks
has “made, used, sold and or offered for sale, and
continues to make, use, sell and or offer for sale products,
including the 3-DNS® product and BIG-IP®, that
incorporate technology and processes that are or when in use are
covered by one or more claims of the ‘359 patent.” The
Complaint seeks injunctive relief prohibiting us and our agents
from “making, using, selling, offering to sell and
importing into the United States any project that infringes, or
contributes to, or induces infringement of, the ‘359
patent,” as well as unspecified “damages, pre-and
post-judgment interest, enhanced damages and attorney
fees.” The ‘359 patent is entitled “Load
Balancing,“and the Complaint alleges that the patent is
“directed to methods and systems relating to
network-proximity determinations and non-geographical load
balancing.” The patent claims appear to be directed to the
concurrent use of various metrics to measure the network
proximity of various servers to a client and/or the use of a
specific method of measuring the number of

hops to a server. We have answered the complaint,
denying that F5 or its products infringe the ‘359 patent,
and have filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment
that the patent is both invalid and not infringed by F5. No case
schedule has been issued.

We are not aware of any additional pending legal
proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
operating results, or financial condition. We may in the future
be party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of
business, including claims that allegedly infringe upon
third-party trademarks or other intellectual property rights.
Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the
expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.

Quarterly Results of Operations

The following presents the Company’s
unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters
ended September 30, 2004. The information should be read in
conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and
related notes included elsewhere in this report. This unaudited
information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited
financial statements and includes all adjustments, consisting
only of normal recurring adjustments that were considered
necessary for a fair presentation of our operating results for
the quarters presented.

(1)

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003,
    the Company reversed a $250,000 reserve initially established
    for an amount considered potentially uncollectible. The amount
    was recovered pursuant to a settlement agreement and the
    reversal of the reserve was recorded as a credit to general and
    administrative expenses.

(2)

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the
    Company reversed the valuation allowance on U.S. deferred
    tax assets and as a result realized an income tax benefit of
    $7.3 million. The credit from the reversal of the valuation
    allowance was partially offset by actual U.S. and international
    tax expenses during the period.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

As of September 30, 2004, we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e).
Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to timely alert them to any
material information relating to the Company (including its
consolidated subsidiaries) that must be included in our periodic
SEC filings. There have been no significant changes in the
Company’s internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect internal controls subsequent to their
evaluation.

We intend to review and evaluate the design and
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an
ongoing basis and to improve our controls and procedures over
time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the
future. Our goal is to ensure that our senior management has
timely access to all material financial and non-financial
information concerning our business. While we believe the
present design of our disclosure controls and procedures is
effective to achieve our goal, future events affecting our
business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and
procedures.

We are in the process of implementing the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 which requires our management to assess the effectiveness
of our internal controls over financial reporting and include an
assertion in our annual report as to the effectiveness of our
controls. Subsequently, our independent auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, will be required to attest to
whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal
controls over financial reporting is fairly stated in all
material respects and separately report on whether it believes
we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
controls over financial reporting as of September 30, 2005.
We are in the process of performing the system and process
documentation, evaluation and testing required for management to
make this assessment and for the auditors to provide its
attestation report. We have not completed this process or its
assessment, and this process will require significant amounts of
management time and resources. In the course of evaluation and
testing, management may identify deficiencies that will need to
be addressed and remediated.
