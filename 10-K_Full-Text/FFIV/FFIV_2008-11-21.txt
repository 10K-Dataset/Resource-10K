Item 1.

Business

General

F5 Networks is a leading provider of technology that optimizes
    the delivery of network-based applications and the performance
    and availability of servers, data storage devices and other
    network resources.

Founded in 1996, F5 pioneered load-balancing technology that
    distributes internet traffic evenly across multiple web servers,
    making them look like a single server. Today, our BIG-IP
    application delivery controllers sit in front of web and
    application servers, balancing traffic and performing
    compute-intensive functions such as encrypting and unencrypting
    transmissions, screening traffic for security threats,
    maintaining open connections with servers, speeding the flow of
    traffic and a variety of other functions that improve the
    performance, availability and security of applications and would
    otherwise be performed by the servers themselves. By offloading
    functions from servers, BIG-IP makes servers more efficient and
    reduces the number of servers needed to run specific
    applications. BIG-IP also supports software modules that manage
    the flow of traffic between multiple data centers and across
    multiple service provider connections, ensuring that this
    traffic is always routed to the most available resource. In
    addition, we offer complementary products that provide secure
    remote access to corporate networks and optimize the delivery of
    applications over wide-area networks.

We believe our application delivery controllers and related
    products are superior to competing technology in both
    functionality and performance. The core of these products is our
    full-proxy Traffic Management Operating System (TMOS) that
    enables them to inspect and modify traffic flows to and from
    servers at



network speed and supports a broad array of functions that
    enhance the speed, performance and availability of applications.
    iRules, a scripting language based on TCL (Tools Command
    Language), is a unique feature of TMOS that enables customers
    and third parties to write customized rules to inspect and
    modify traffic. TMOS also supports a common software interface
    called iControl, which enables our products to communicate with
    one another and with third-party products, including custom and
    commercial enterprise applications. TMOS is designed to support
    the addition of new functionality as software modules and to
    exploit the performance-enhancing features of our purpose-built
    hardware platforms. Correspondingly, our hardware architecture
    integrates industry standard components in ways that exploit the
    unique features and characteristics of TMOS to deliver
    performance that is demonstrably superior to competing products.

Just as our application delivery controllers make many servers
    look like one, ARX storage virtualization products sit in front
    of networked attached storage (NAS), making multiple storage
    devices from different vendors look like a single device to the
    individual clients, servers and applications that use them. This
    frees users and storage administrators from the time-consuming
    task of mapping individual drives to specific clients and
    applications. In addition, ARX products simplify the migration
    of data between storage devices, the addition of new storage
    devices, and the distribution of data across tiers of storage
    that reflect the relative importance or immediacy of the data.

In connection with our products, we offer a broad range of
    services including consulting, training, installation,
    maintenance and other technical support services.

F5 Networks was incorporated on February 26, 1996 in the
    State of Washington. Our headquarters is in Seattle, Washington
    and our mailing address is 401 Elliott Avenue West, Seattle,
    Washington 98119. The telephone number at our executive offices

Industry
    Background

Growth of
    IP Networks

Internet Protocol (IP) is a communications language used to
    transmit data over the Internet. Since the late 1990s,
    businesses have responded to the power, flexibility and
    efficiency of the Internet by deploying new

IP-based

applications, upgrading their client-server applications to new

IP-enabled

versions, and enabling existing or legacy applications for use
    over the Internet. At the same time, organizations have become
    more geographically dispersed, and increasingly mobile
    workforces depend on access to corporate applications and data
    from remote locations and a variety of client devices such as
    cellular telephones, personal digital assistants and notebook
    computers.

Over the next several years, we believe these trends will
    accelerate as more organizations discover the benefits of

IP-enabled

applications. In addition, we believe the growth of Internet
    usage will continue to be driven by new applications, such as
    Web Services and Voice over IP, the growth of broadband Internet
    access and new usage and infrastructure models such as
    “cloud computing.”

In conjunction with the growth of Internet traffic, the
    proliferation of data and, in particular, unstructured data such
    as voice, video, images, email, spreadsheets and formatted text
    files, presents an enormous and increasing challenge to IT
    organizations. Along with the growing volume of unstructured
    data that is business-critical and must be retained and readily
    accessible to individuals and applications, new regulations
    mandate that company email, web pages and other files must be
    retained indefinitely. In response to this challenge, IT
    organizations spend an increasing amount of their budget on NAS
    and other types of storage systems.



Trend
    Toward Virtualization

From a broad perspective, the goal of IT organizations is to
    optimize the secure delivery of applications and data to users
    wherever they are and whenever they need them. To achieve this
    goal, organizations are embracing virtualization technologies
    that enable them to group or partition data center resources to
    meet user demand and reconfigure these virtual resources easily
    and quickly as demand changes. Server virtualization, which
    allows organizations to improve utilization of physical servers
    by partitioning them into multiple virtual servers, is well
    known and widely deployed. Application delivery controllers free
    up both physical and virtual server processing power by
    offloading common functions, such as encryption and compression
    from multiple physical or virtual servers, and dynamically
    manage the flow of traffic between users and both virtual and
    physical servers, making them look like a single resource to the
    user. Server virtualization puts additional pressure on storage
    resources by increasing storage capacity and traffic
    requirements. Sitting in front of storage systems, file
    virtualization devices perform functions similar to application
    delivery controllers, presenting the appearance of a single
    resource to users and applications and dynamically managing the
    transfer of files between users and applications and multiple
    storage devices.

Application
    Delivery Networking

Internet traffic passing between client devices and servers is
    divided into discrete packets which travel by multiple routes to
    their destination where they are reassembled. The disassembly,
    routing, and reassembly of transmissions are relatively
    straightforward and require little intelligence. By contrast,
    application delivery networking — managing,
    inspecting, modifying and redirecting application traffic going
    to and from servers — requires intelligent systems
    capable of performing a broad array of functions.

Basic application delivery networking (ADN) functions include
    load-balancing (distributing traffic across multiple servers
    while making them appear to be a single server) and
    health-checking (monitoring the performance of servers and
    applications to ensure that they are working properly before
    routing traffic to them). In addition, ADN encompasses a growing
    number of functions that have typically been performed by the
    server or the application itself, or by point solutions running
    on separate devices. These include:

•

SSL Acceleration — using Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
    encryption to secure traffic between the server and the browser
    on an end user’s client device;

•

Rate Shaping — prioritizing transmissions according to
    preset rules that give precedence to different types of traffic;

•

Compression — reducing the volume of data transmitted
    to take maximum advantage of available bandwidth;

•

TCP Optimization — improving server efficiency by
    maintaining an open connection with a server during interactive
    sessions;

•

IPv6 Translation — enabling communication and
    interoperability between networked devices using IPv6, the
    newest version of the Internet Protocol, and those using the
    older version IPv4;

•

Application Security — protecting critical web
    applications from attacks such as Google hacking, cross-site
    scripting, and parameter tampering;

•

Web Acceleration — enhancing the performance of web
    applications over wide area networks by reducing latency,
    eliminating errors, and resolving other issues that slow
    delivery;

•

WAN Optimization — improving the performance of
    applications accessed over wide area network links by reducing
    the number of round trips required and ensuring maximum use of
    available bandwidth;

•

Global Traffic Management — ensuring high
    availability, maximum performance and global management for
    applications running across multiple, globally-dispersed data
    centers; and

•

Link Load Balancing — monitoring availability and
    performance of multiple WAN connections and intelligently
    managing bi-directional traffic flows to ensure uninterrupted,
    optimized Internet access.



Since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not
    thousands — of servers and applications, it is not
    practical to replicate these functions on each server or build
    them into the applications themselves. Even if it were,
    maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the net result would
    be a negative impact on the overall performance of servers and
    applications. Deploying point solutions in the network
    eliminates those problems but creates a new set of challenges.
    Using point solutions from multiple vendors can create
    interoperability issues, and problems that do occur can be
    difficult to troubleshoot. From a security standpoint, it is
    also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through
    multiple devices. As a result, enterprise customers are
    increasingly demanding products that integrate ADN functions on
    a single platform.

File
    Virtualization

Along with other types of IP traffic, the volume of file-based
    information created and accessed by Internet users and network
    applications is growing rapidly. According to some estimates,
    the volume of unstructured files is expected to triple annually
    over the next several years. The challenge of storing and
    managing unstructured files is becoming increasingly costly and
    complex, and reducing the cost and complexity is quickly moving
    up the list of data center priorities.

In many large organizations whose employees are geographically
    dispersed, unstructured data is stored on local file servers,
    which are difficult to manage, costly to maintain and generally
    underutilized. Information on these devices is easy for local
    users to access but often inaccessible to others in the
    organization. To reduce the cost, complexity, and redundancy of
    dispersed file systems, many IT organizations are consolidating
    file storage on centralized NAS devices and other types of
    storage systems. Migrating and consolidating files is difficult
    and time-consuming, however, and centralized storage systems
    pose a different set of problems.

Centralized storage of files can slow access for remote users
    and applications, spurring interest in technology that can speed
    the transfer of files across wide area networks (WANs). In
    addition, only users and applications that are physically mapped
    to a specific drive can store and access data on that drive. As
    the drive fills up, files must be moved manually to a new drive
    and affected users and applications must be remapped to that
    drive. In large organizations, this often constitutes a
    round-the-clock chore for many highly-skilled employees.

Another major storage problem stems from the fact that all files
    are not created equal. Many businesses and other organizations
    have policies or other obligations to retain email and other
    files, increasing the volume of data to archive and, in some
    cases, to keep indefinitely. Since it is unlikely that these
    files will be accessed frequently, if at all, in the course of
    normal business, it makes little sense to store them on
    expensive, high-performance systems designed to provide
    immediate access to business-critical information. As a result,
    IT organizations are beginning to deploy tiers of storage
    systems that match cost, capacity, and performance to the type
    of information being stored, how frequently it is accessed, and
    its relative importance to the business. Often, the most
    cost-effective solution is a combination of storage systems from
    different vendors, an approach that typically entails migrating
    huge amounts of data between incompatible devices. Once that is
    completed, organizations face the challenge of automating the
    tiering process and the management of aging files.

Whether or not they deploy tiered file systems, many
    organizations are beginning to address the mounting cost in time
    and resources of backing up data stored on employee desktops,
    local file servers, and other devices. According to some
    estimates, approximately 80% of the files organizations back up
    have not changed since the previous

back-up.

Worse yet, a large and growing percentage are music and video
    files, family photographs, and other personal files.

Responding to increasing demand from IT organizations, a number
    of storage vendors and a handful of other companies offer
    solutions that address some or all of these issues and can be
    loosely grouped under the heading of file virtualization.
    Collectively, these solutions encompass a variety of
    technological approaches designed to optimize and simplify the
    storage of unstructured data.



F5
    Solutions

Application
    Delivery Networking

F5 is a leading provider of application delivery networking
    products that ensure the security, optimization and availability
    of applications for any user, anywhere. We believe our products
    offer the most intelligent architecture and advanced
    functionality in the marketplace along with performance,
    flexibility and usability features that help organizations
    improve the way they serve their employees, customers, and
    partners while lowering operational costs.

Software Based Products.

From inception, we
    have been committed to the belief that the complexity of
    application-level processing requires the flexibility of a
    software-based solution. We believe our modular software
    architecture enables us to deliver the broadest range of
    integrated functionality in the market and facilitates the
    addition and integration of new functionality. We also believe
    that integrating our software with commodity hardware components
    enables us to build products that deliver superior performance,
    functionality and flexibility at competitive prices.

Full Proxy Architecture.

The core of our
    software technology is the Traffic Management Operating System
    (TMOS) introduced in September 2004 as part of BIG-IP version 9.
    We believe this is a major enhancement of our previous
    technology that enables our products to deliver functionality
    that is superior on many levels to any other application
    delivery networking product in the market. With TMOS, our
    products can inspect, modify and direct both inbound and
    outbound traffic flows across multiple packets. This ability to
    manage application traffic to and from servers adds value to
    applications that pass through our devices in ways that are not
    possible with other application delivery networking solutions.

Modular Functionality.

In addition to its full
    proxy architecture, TMOS is specifically designed to facilitate
    the development and integration of application delivery
    networking functions as modules that can be added to
    BIG-IP’s core functionality to keep pace with rapidly
    evolving customer needs. Add-on modules currently available with
    BIG-IP include: Intelligent Compression; SSL Acceleration; Rate
    Shaping; Advanced Client Authentication; IPv6 Gateway; Caching;
    and others. We also offer Application Security Manager (ASM),
    Global Traffic Manager (GTM), Link Controller, and
    WebAccelerator as software modules on BIG-IP.

Application Awareness.

The open architecture
    of TMOS includes an application programming interface (API)
    called iControl that allows our products to communicate with one
    another and with third-party software and devices. Through this
    unique feature, third- party applications and network devices
    can take an active role in shaping IP network traffic, directing
    traffic based on exact business requirements defined by our
    customers and solutions partners and tailored to specific
    applications. This “application awareness” capability
    is one of the most important features of our software-based
    products and further differentiates our solutions from those of
    our competitors.

Adaptive Intelligence.

The full-proxy
    capabilities of TMOS enable it to inspect or “read”
    the entire contents of a transmission across multiple packets
    and identify specific elements of that transmission, including
    items such as names, dates, and any type of number or label. By
    taking advantage of our unique scripting capability, based on
    Tool Command Language (TCL), customers can use those elements as
    variables to create iRules that modify the content and direct
    the flow of traffic in ways tailored to the dynamic needs of
    their applications. iRules is a unique feature of TMOS that
    gives our products flexibility unmatched by competing products.

Integrated Application Layer Solutions.

The
    combination of our full proxy architecture and enhanced iRules
    enables BIG-IP to intercept, inspect and act on the contents of
    traffic from virtually every type of

IP-enabled

application. In addition, the modularity of the TMOS
    architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions
    that secure, optimize and ensure the availability of
    applications and the networks they run on.



Data
    Solutions

F5’s data solutions products address many of the problems
    associated with managing today’s rapidly expanding file
    storage infrastructure. Our ARX product family of intelligent
    file virtualization devices represents a unique set of
    capabilities that optimize the performance and utilization of
    NAS storage systems.

Non-disruptive Data Migration.

ARX automates
    the movement of files between heterogeneous storage devices
    without affecting access and without requiring client
    reconfiguration. Enterprises can perform seamless
    hardware & software upgrades on file storage
    platforms, server consolidation, even vendor switches, all
    during business hours.

Automated Storage Tiering.

ARX automates the
    movement of data between tiers of storage, and the placement of
    data on appropriate tiers of storage, irrespective of platform
    or vendor. Organizations can lower the cost of storage and
    shrink backup and recovery windows by automatically placing data
    on appropriate storage devices without affecting access to the
    data.

Dynamic Load Balancing.

ARX dynamically
    distributes files across multiple file storage devices,
    eliminating “hotspots” or bottlenecks. Companies can
    improve application performance and increase productivity using
    the storage infrastructure that is already in place.

    infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented
    where information is exchanged, allowing organizations to
    respond quickly to changing business needs, improve costly and
    time consuming business processes and develop new sources of
    revenue through highly differentiated offerings. Key components
    of our strategy include:

Offering
    a complete, integrated application delivery product
    suite.

Since the introduction of our TMOS architecture for application
    delivery networking, we have developed TMOS-based versions of
    our own legacy products, such as GTM and Link Controller, and
    acquired technology, including Application Security Manager
    (ASM), WebAccelerator, and WANJet. ASM and WebAccelerator are
    currently available as software modules on our BIG-IP family of
    application delivery controllers. In addition, we are currently
    developing the next generation of TMOS-based versions of our WAN
    Optimization and secure remote access products, TMOS-based
    versions of WANJet and FirePass, which we plan to release in
    fiscal year 2009. We believe this approach sharply
    differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings
    and provides customers with an expanding array of integrated
    application delivery networking solutions that can be customized
    to meet their specific needs.

Investing
    in technology to continue to meet customer needs.

We continue to invest in research and development to provide our
    customers with comprehensive, integrated solutions. In
    application delivery networking, our product development efforts
    leverage the unique attributes of our software-based platforms
    to deliver new features and functions that address the complex
    and changing needs of our customers. Our acquisition investments
    in ARX are aimed at providing data solutions to the complex
    challenge of efficiently storing and managing the huge and
    growing volume of unstructured files created by network users
    and applications. For both our application delivery controllers
    and file virtualization products, development of
    high-performance, proprietary hardware is a key component of our
    investment strategy. In developing these products, we will
    continue to use commodity hardware in order to ensure
    performance and cost competitiveness.



Enhancing
    channel sales and distribution model.

We continue to invest significant resources in developing and
    expanding our indirect sales and distribution channels by
    cultivating our relationships with our existing partners and
    actively developing new relationships. Our efforts to recruit
    new partners are aimed primarily at large value-added resellers,
    systems integrators, and industry-leading systems manufacturers.

Continuing
    to build and expand relationships with strategic technology
    partners.

To compete successfully against Cisco and other large
    competitors who have an established presence in our target
    accounts, we have developed strategic technology partnerships
    with enterprise software vendors, such as Microsoft, Oracle and
    SAP, who also have an established presence in those accounts. By
    taking advantage of our open application programming interface,
    called iControl, these vendors can enable their applications to
    control our products in the network, enhancing overall
    application performance. In addition, we have worked closely
    with several of these vendors to develop configurations of our
    products, called application ready networks that are
    specifically tuned to simplify deployment and optimize the
    performance of their applications. In return, these vendors
    provide us significant leverage in the selling process by
    recommending our products to their customers. We plan to
    continue building on our existing relationships and to extend
    our competitive edge by developing new relationships with other
    strategic partners.

Leveraging
    DevCentral, our online community of network architects and
    developers.

Customization of our products using iRules enhances their
    “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems
    in both their applications and their networks that would be
    difficult if not impossible to solve by other means. To promote
    the use of iRules, we host an online community where network
    architects and developers can discuss and share the ways in
    which they use iRules to solve problems and enhance the
    security, performance and availability of applications. A
    corollary benefit is that many of the iRules solutions posted by
    DevCentral participants have become standard features in new
    releases of TMOS.

Enhancing
    our brand.

We plan to continue building awareness of F5 as a leading
    provider of application delivery networking products that enable
    agility, improve efficiency and optimize the security,
    performance and availability of network applications, servers
    and storage systems. Our goal is to make the F5 brand synonymous
    with superior technology, high quality customer service, trusted
    advice and definitive business value.

Products

Our core technology is hardware and software for application
    delivery networking, including application security, secure
    remote access, WAN optimization and file virtualization.

All of our products are systems that integrate our software with
    purpose-built hardware that incorporates commodity components.
    Our BIG-IP product family, which represents the bulk of our
    sales, supports a growing number of features and functions as
    software modules — including GTM (Global Traffic
    Manager), Link Controller, ASM (Application Security Manager)
    and WebAccelerator. We also sell FirePass, WANJet and
    WebAccelerator as separate, stand-alone appliances.

BIG-IP

Products in our family of BIG-IP application delivery
    controllers all run TMOS and differ primarily in the hardware
    configurations that make up each system. Our current BIG-IP
    systems include five hardware platforms. In fiscal year 2008 we
    introduced new entry- level products (BIG-IP 1600 and 3600),
    which replaced BIG-IP 1500 and 3400, delivering more
    functionality and twice the performance at approximately the
    same price. During fiscal year 2009, we also plan to introduce
    new products to replace our mid-range (BIG-IP 6400 and
    6800) and high-end (BIG-IP 8400 and 8800) platforms.
    In addition to local area traffic management, which is standard
    on every system, BIG-IP supports a growing number of add-on
    software products and



features. Software products currently available on all BIG-IP
    platforms except BIG-IP 1600 include GTM, Link Controller, ASM,
    and WebAccelerator. Standard features on all platforms include
    Advanced Client Authentication, Advanced Routing, Fast Cache,
    Intelligent Compression, IPv6 Gateway, L7 Rate Shaping, Message
    Security Module, Protocol Security Module and SSL Acceleration.

VIPRION

Introduced in January 2007, VIPRION is our chassis-based
    application delivery controller that scales from one to four
    blades, each equipped with two dual-core processors and
    equivalent in performance to a BIG-IP 8800. Using clustered
    multiprocessing, custom disaggregation ASICs and advanced
    software, VIPRION allows customers to add or remove blades
    without disrupting traffic and distributes traffic across all
    available processors, effectively creating a single virtual
    processor. VIPRION helps customers simplify their networks by
    offloading servers and consolidating devices, saving management
    costs as well as power, space, and cooling in the datacenter and
    by reducing the number of application delivery controllers they
    need to deliver even the most demanding applications. By
    offloading computationally intense processes, VIPRION can also
    significantly reduce the number of application servers needed.

FirePass

FirePass appliances provide SSL VPN access for remote users of
    IP networks and any applications connected to those networks
    from any standard Web browser on any device. The components of
    FirePass include a dynamic policy engine, which manages user
    authentication and authorization privileges, and special
    components that enable corporations to give remote users
    controlled access to the full array of applications and
    resources within the network. FirePass also supports Application
    Ready Access, providing full reverse-proxy services for
    market-leading application portals including those of SAP,
    Oracle, Microsoft, and others.

Currently, we sell three FirePass products: The FirePass 1200
    appliance is designed for small to medium enterprises and branch
    offices and supports from 10 to 100 concurrent users. The
    FirePass 4100 controller is designed for medium size enterprises
    and, from a price/performance standpoint, is recommended for up
    to 500 concurrent users. The FirePass 4300 appliance is designed
    for medium to large enterprises and service providers and
    supports up to 2,000 concurrent users.

Application
    Security Manager (ASM)

Application Security Manager is a Web application firewall that
    provides comprehensive, proactive, application-layer protection
    against both generalized and targeted attacks. Available as a
    software module on BIG-IP LTM, ASM employs a positive security
    model (‘deny all unless allowed’) combined with
    signature-based detection. As a result, ASM can prevent
    “day-zero” attacks in addition to known security
    threats. ASM is available as a stand-alone hardware platform.

WebAccelerator

WebAccelerator speeds web transactions by optimizing individual
    network object requests, connections, and end-to-end
    transactions from the browser through to databases.
    WebAccelerator enhances web application performance from any
    location, speeding up interactive performance, improving
    download times, utilizing bandwidth more efficiently, and
    dramatically reducing the cost and response time of delivering
    Web-enabled applications to distributed users where it is not
    possible to deploy an end point device. WebAccelerator devices
    can also be placed at key remote locations to provide
    acceleration to end-users above and beyond TCP optimizations and
    HTTP compression.

WebAccelerator is available as a software module on BIG-IP LTM
    or as a stand-alone appliance.

WANJet

WANJet combines WAN optimization and traffic-shaping in a single
    device to accelerate file transfers, email, data replication,
    and other applications over IP networks. It provides LAN-like
    performance on any



WAN, ensuring predictable application performance for all users,
    and encrypts and secures all transfers without performance
    penalties. WANJet is deployed as a dual-sided (symmetric)
    solution that optimizes application traffic to and from data
    centers and branch offices.

For data centers, the WANJet 500 features pass-through fault
    tolerance and scalability for up to 20,000 optimized
    connections. For branch offices, the WANJet 300 combines
    pass-through fault tolerant features, silent operation, and
    performance for up to 1,000 optimized connections. WANJet
    solutions work seamlessly across all wide-area networks
    including dedicated links, IP VPNs, frame relay, and even
    satellite connections.

Enterprise
    Manager

Enterprise Manager takes advantage of our iControl interface to
    provide a single, centralized management console for our ADN
    products. Enterprise Manager allows customers with dozens or
    hundreds of our products to discover and view those products in
    a single window, and to upgrade or modify the software on those
    products simultaneously. This lowers the cost and simplifies the
    task of deploying, managing and maintaining our products and
    reduces the likelihood of error when blanket changes are
    implemented.

Enterprise Manager 500 and Enterprise Manager 3000 are
    appliance-based devices on dedicated, enterprise-grade
    platforms. Enterprise Manager 500 provides control for up to 50
    F5 devices, and Enterprise Manager 3000 provides control for up
    to 300 F5 devices.

ARX

The ARX product family is a series of high performance,
    enterprise-class intelligent file virtualization devices that
    dramatically simplify the management of file storage
    environments and lower total storage costs by automating data
    management tasks and eliminating the disruption associated with
    storage management operations. The ARX series is powered by the
    FreedomFabric network operating system, which automates many
    storage management tasks that are performed manually today, and
    eliminates the disruption associated with those tasks.
    FreedomFabric’s unique suite of storage management policies
    includes data migration, automated storage tiering, data
    replication, and dynamic load balancing.

Currently, the ARX series includes four products. The ARX 500,
    the low end of the series, is a stand-alone device that can
    manage more than 120 million files. The ARX 1000 is a
    stand-alone device and can manage more than 380 million
    files. In October 2008, we introduced the ARX 4000, a fixed
    form-factor device supporting 10 gigabit Ethernet and capable of
    managing more than 2 billion files. The high-end ARX 6000
    is a chassis-based device with multiple blades that can manage
    more than 2 billion files.

Additionally in October 2008, we introduced F5 Data Manager, a
    software product that interfaces directly with most file storage
    devices, including ARX file virtualization platforms. Data
    Manager gathers valuable file storage statistics and provides
    graphical reporting and trending functions to give users
    visibility into their constantly changing data storage
    environments, helping them respond to business needs and better
    plan for future growth.

Enabling
    Technologies

iControl is an application programming interface that allows
    customers and independent software vendors to modify their
    programs to communicate with our products, eliminating the need
    for human involvement, lowering the cost of performing basic
    network functions and reducing the likelihood of error. Although
    we do not derive revenue from iControl itself, the sale of
    iControl-enabled applications by independent software vendors
    such as Microsoft and Oracle helps promote and often leads
    directly to the sale of our other products.

iRules is a built-in feature of our TMOS architecture that
    allows customers to manipulate and manage any IP application
    traffic that passes through our TMOS-based products. iRules has
    an easy-to-learn scripting syntax and enables users to customize
    how they intercept, inspect, transform, and direct inbound or
    outbound application traffic.



Product
    Development

We believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain
    technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and
    by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our
    customers. Our product development group employs a standard
    process for the development, documentation and quality control
    of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals.
    This process includes working with management, product
    management, customers and partners to identify new or improved
    solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable
    markets.

Our principal software engineering group is located in our
    headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Our core product
    development teams for FirePass, WANJet and WebAccelerator are
    located in San Jose, California. We also have a smaller
    development facility for WANJet and WebAccelerator in Belfast,
    Northern Ireland. Our core Application Security Manager (ASM)
    product development team is located in Tel Aviv, Israel. Our ARX
    product development team is located in Lowell, Massachusetts.
    Our hardware engineering group is located in Spokane,
    Washington. In addition, we maintain a dedicated facility for
    product testing and quality control in Tomsk, Russia. Members of
    all these teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure
    the interoperability and performance of our hardware and
    software systems.

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and
    2006, we had research and product development expenses of
    $103.4 million, $69.0 million, and $49.2 million,
    respectively.

Customers

Our customers include a wide variety of enterprise customers and
    service providers among Fortune 1000 and Business Week Global
    1000 companies, including those in technology,
    telecommunications, financial services, transportation, and
    manufacturing industries, along with government customers. In
    fiscal year 2008, international sales represented 42.5% of our
    net revenues. Refer to Note 10 of our consolidated
    financial statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic
    area.

Sales and
    Marketing

Sales

We sell our products and services to large enterprise customers
    and service providers through a variety of channels, including
    distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”) and
    systems integrators. A substantial amount of our revenue for
    fiscal year 2008 was derived from these channel sales. Our sales
    teams work closely with our channel partners and sell our
    products and services directly to a limited number of major
    accounts.

F5 sales teams.

Our inside sales team
    generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and
    helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field
    and internal corporate resources. Our field sales personnel are
    located in major cities in four sales regions: the Americas;
    Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia
    Pacific region (APAC). Field sales personnel work closely with
    our channel partners to assist them, as necessary, in the sale
    of our products and services to their customers. We also sell
    our products and services directly to a limited group of
    customers, primarily large enterprises, whose accounts are
    managed by our major account services team. Field systems
    engineers support our regional sales managers and channel
    partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing
    pre-sale technical resources as needed.

Distributors and VARs.

Consistent with our
    goal of building a strong channel sales model, we have
    established relationships with a number of large national and
    international distributors, local and specialized distributors
    and VARs. We derive a majority of our product sales from these
    distributors and VARs.

Our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and
    do not prevent them from selling competitive products. These
    agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation
    to renew, and typically do not provide for exclusive sales
    territories or minimum purchase requirements.



For fiscal year 2008, sales to two of our distributors, Ingram
    Micro, Inc., and Avnet Technologies, represented 10.5% and 14.0%
    of our total revenues, respectively. Our agreements with these
    distributors are standard, non-exclusive distribution agreements
    that renew automatically on an annual basis and can be
    terminated by either party with 30 days prior written
    notice. The agreements grant Ingram Micro and Avnet Technologies
    the right to distribute our products to resellers in North
    America and certain other territories internationally, with no
    minimum purchase requirements.

Systems integrators.

We also market our
    products through strategic relationships with systems
    integrators, who include our products as core components of
    application or network-based solutions they deploy for their
    customers. In most cases, systems integrators do not directly
    purchase our products for resale to their customers. Instead
    they typically recommend our products as part of broader
    solutions, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or
    customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, that
    incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced
    performance.

Marketing

Our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our
    continued success depends on our ability to understand and
    anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to
    develop valuable solutions that meet those needs. In line with
    this belief, our marketing organization works directly with
    customers, partners and our product development teams to
    identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our
    leadership position. In addition, our business development team,
    which is a component of our marketing organization, closely
    monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary
    markets for opportunities to acquire or partner with those whose
    solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to
    expand our addressable market.

Another key component of our marketing strategy is to develop
    and expand our iControl partnerships. Working closely with our
    partners, we have developed solution sets called Application
    Ready Networks (ARNs) that help ensure the successful deployment
    and delivery of their applications over the network. The result
    of methodical testing and research, ARNs provide
    architecture-based, best-practice documentation on how to deploy
    F5 products with applications from major software vendors such
    as Microsoft, Oracle and SAP, helping joint customers unlock the
    full potential of those applications.

To support the growing number of developers using our products,
    including network and application architects, we continue to
    promote and expand DevCentral, our on-line community website
    that provides technical resources to customers, prospects and
    partners wanting to extend and optimize F5 solutions using
    iRules. A key aspect of DevCentral is an on-line forum where
    developers as well as application and network architects discuss
    and share solutions they have written with iRules. At the end of
    fiscal 2008, DevCentral had more than 32,600 registered members.

We also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives
    aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of
    our technology and products. These include actively
    participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events
    with channel and technology partners, and briefing industry
    analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products,
    business relationships and technology partnerships. In addition,
    we market our products to chief information officers and other
    information technology professionals through targeted
    advertising, direct mail and high-profile Web events.

Backlog

At the end of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, we had product backlog
    of approximately $10.9 million and $9.9 million,
    respectively. Backlog represents orders confirmed with a
    purchase order for products to be shipped generally within
    90 days to customers with approved credit status. Orders
    are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers or
    product specification changes by customers. Although we believe
    that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be
    cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant
    penalty. For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at
    any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues.



Customer
    Service and Technical Support

We believe that our ability to provide consistent, high-quality
    customer service and technical support is a key factor in
    attracting and retaining large enterprise customers.
    Accordingly, we offer a broad range of support services that
    include installation, phone support, hardware repair and
    replacement, software updates, consulting and training services.
    We deliver these services directly to end users and also utilize
    a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our
    channel partners when applicable. Our technical support staff is
    strategically located in regional service centers to support our
    global customer base.

Prior to the installation of our products, our services
    personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and
    determine the best way to deploy our products and configure
    product features and functions to meet those needs. Our services
    personnel also provide

on-site

installation and training services to help customers make
    optimal use of product features and functions.

Our customers typically purchase a one-year maintenance contract
    which entitles them to an array of services provided by our
    technical support team. Maintenance services provided under the
    contract include online updates, software error correction
    releases, hardware repair and replacement, and remote support
    through a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week help desk,
    although not all service contracts entitle a customer to
    round-the-clock call center support. Updates to our software are
    only available to customers with a current maintenance contract.
    Our technical support team also offers seminars and training
    classes for customers on the configuration and use of products,
    including local and wide area network system administration and
    management. In addition, we have a professional services team
    able to provide a full range of fee-based consulting services,
    including comprehensive network management, documentation and
    performance analysis, and capacity planning to assist in
    predicting future network requirements.

We also offer, as part of our maintenance service, an online,
    automated, self-help customer support function called “Ask
    F5” that allows customers to answer many commonly asked
    questions without having to call our support desk. This allows
    the customer to rapidly address issues and questions, while
    significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk.
    This enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while
    keeping our support-related expenses at a manageable, consistent
    level.

Manufacturing

We outsource the manufacturing of our pre-configured hardware
    platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly
    according to our specifications.

Flextronics was our primary third party manufacturer in 2008.
    Flextronics also installs our software onto the hardware
    platforms and conducts functionality testing, quality assurance
    and documentation control prior to shipping our products. Our
    agreement with Flextronics allows it to procure component
    inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production
    forecast. Subcontractors supply Flextronics with standard parts
    and components for our products based on our production
    forecast. We are contractually obligated to purchase component
    inventory that our contract manufacturer procures in accordance
    with the forecast, unless we give notice of order cancellation
    in advance of applicable lead times. As protection against
    component shortages and to provide replacement parts for our
    service teams, we also stock limited supplies of certain key
    components for our products.

Hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of
    commodity parts and certain custom components designed and
    approved by our hardware engineering group. Most of our
    components are purchased from sources which we believe are
    readily available from other suppliers. However, several
    components used in the assembly of our products are purchased
    from single or limited sources such as our proprietary Packet
    Velocity ASIC for Layer 4 processing that is manufactured for us
    by a third-party contract semiconductor foundry.

Competition

The increasing breadth of our product offerings has enabled us
    to address a growing array of opportunities, many of which are
    outside the bounds of the traditional Layer 4-7 market. Within
    what Gartner Group calls the Application Acceleration market, we
    compete in the Application Delivery Controller (ADC) market,



which encompasses the traditional Layer 4-7 market, and the WAN
    Optimization Controller market. Over the next several years, we
    believe these two market segments will merge as WAN optimization
    effectively becomes a feature of Application Delivery. With the
    availability of ASM and WebAccelerator as software modules on
    BIG-IP, these products have already become features of our
    overall ADN solution, and our strategic roadmap includes plans
    to integrate FirePass with BIG-IP over the next 12 to
    18 months. For the immediate future, however, the WAN
    optimization and secure remote access application security
    market segments will continue to be viewed as discrete markets.

In 2008, approximately 88% of our products and services were
    sold into the ADC market where our primary competitor is Cisco
    Systems, Inc. Other competitors in this market include Citrix
    Systems, Inc., and to a lesser degree Nortel Networks
    Corporation and Radware Ltd.

In the adjacent WAN Optimization market, WANJet competes mainly
    with products from BlueCoat Systems, Cisco, Citrix, Juniper
    Networks, Inc. and Riverbed Technology, Inc. None of our
    competitors offers an integrated product with advanced features
    comparable to WebAccelerator.

In the SSL VPN remote access market, we compete with Juniper,
    Citrix, Nokia Corporation, Nortel, SonicWall, Inc., Symantec
    Corporation and a number of smaller players. Because SSL VPNs
    are a potential replacement for IPSec VPNs, the most widely
    deployed solution for secure remote access today, we also
    compete with Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. which,
    along with Juniper, is a market leader in IPSec VPNs. Citrix
    offers a web firewall acquired from Teros, Inc. as a module on
    its Netscaler products.

Application firewalls represent an emerging market that is
    populated mainly by private, early-development-stage companies.
    Other companies that have acquired products similar to ASM
    include Citrix Systems. None of our competitors offers a
    high-performance product similar to our Application Security
    Module, which is tightly integrated with our application
    delivery products.

File virtualization remains an early-stage market, the growth of
    which has been slowed by the recent global economic downturn. We
    believe our ARX file virtualization products are unique in terms
    of technology and functionality and are well positioned within
    this emerging market. However, large storage vendors such as EMC
    Corporation, NetApp Inc., Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.,
    and Cisco offer competing products with overlapping
    functionality.

Many of our competitors have a longer operating history and
    greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than
    we do. These larger competitors also have a more extensive
    customer base and broader customer relationships, including
    relationships with many of our current and potential customers.
    In addition, many have large, well-established, worldwide
    customer support and professional services organizations and
    more extensive direct sales force and sales channels. Because of
    our relatively smaller size, market presence and resources, our
    larger competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we
    can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
    requirements. These companies may also adopt aggressive pricing
    policies to gain market share. As a result, our competitors
    could undermine our ability to win new customers and maintain
    our existing customer base.

Intellectual
    Property

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
    trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our
    intellectual property rights. We have obtained 32 patents in the
    United States and have applications pending for various aspects
    of our technology. Our future success depends in part on our
    ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies
    used in our principal products. Despite our efforts to protect
    our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy
    aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or
    other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition,
    the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our
    proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States.
    Any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position, and
    competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or
    superior to our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect
    our intellectual property rights could harm our business,
    operating results and financial condition.



In addition to our own proprietary software, we incorporate
    software licensed from several third-party sources into our
    products. These licenses generally renew automatically on an
    annual basis. We believe that alternative technologies for these
    licenses are available both domestically and internationally.

Employees

As of September 30, 2008, we had 1,694 full-time
    employees, including 460 in product development, 716 in sales
    and marketing, 323 in professional services and technical
    support and 195 in finance, administration and operations. None
    of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have
    experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee
    relations are good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

In addition to the other information in this report, the
    following risk factors should be carefully considered in
    evaluating our company and its business.

Our
    success depends on our timely development of new products and
    features, market acceptance of new product offerings and proper
    management of the timing of the life cycle of our
    products

The application delivery networking and file virtualization
    markets are characterized by rapid technological change,
    frequent new product introductions, changes in customer
    requirements and evolving industry standards. Our continued
    success depends on our ability to identify and develop new
    products and new features for our existing products to meet the
    demands of these changes, and the acceptance of those products



and features by our existing and target customers. If we are
    unable to identify, develop and deploy new products and new
    product features on a timely basis, our business and results of
    operations may be harmed.

The current life cycle of our products is typically 12 to
    24 months. The introduction of new products or product
    enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing
    products, or replace sales of some of our current products,
    thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product
    introduction, and may cause customers to defer purchasing our
    existing products in anticipation of the new products. This
    could harm our operating results by decreasing sales, increasing
    our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to
    greater risk of product obsolescence. We have also experienced,
    and may in the future experience, delays in developing and
    releasing new products and product enhancements. This has led
    to, and may in the future lead to, delayed sales, increased
    expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated. Also, in
    the development of our products, we have experienced delays in
    the prototyping of our products, which in turn has led to delays
    in product introductions. In addition, complexity and
    difficulties in managing product transitions at the end-of-life
    stage of a product can create excess inventory of components
    associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased
    expenses. Any or all of the above problems could materially harm
    our business and results of operations.

Our
    success depends on sales and continued innovation of our
    Application Delivery Networking product lines

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, we derived
    approximately 92.0% of our net product revenues, or
    approximately 64.1% of our total net revenues, from sales of our
    Application Delivery Networking (“ADN”) product lines.
    We continue to expect to derive a significant portion of our net
    revenues from sales of our ADN products in the future.
    Implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being
    able to solve critical network availability and performance
    problems of our customers. If our ADN products are unable to
    solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to
    sustain the high levels of innovation in our ADN product feature
    set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a
    competitive market environment, our business and results of
    operations will be harmed.

We may
    not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application
    delivery networking and file virtualization
    markets

The markets we serve are new, rapidly evolving and highly
    competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify
    in the future. Our principal competitors in the application
    delivery networking market include Cisco, Nortel, Citrix, and
    Radware. In the adjacent WAN Optimization market, we compete
    with Riverbed, Juniper, Blue Coat Systems, Cisco and Citrix. In
    the file virtualization market, we compete with EMC, Net-App,
    Brocade and Cisco. We expect to continue to face additional
    competition as new participants enter our markets. As we
    continue to expand globally, we may see new competitors in
    different geographic regions. In addition, larger companies with
    significant resources, brand recognition, and sales channels may
    form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery
    networking solutions from other companies and emerge as
    significant competitors. Potential competitors may bundle their
    products or incorporate an Internet traffic management or
    security component into existing products in a manner that
    discourages users from purchasing our products. Any of these
    circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and
    negatively impact our financial performance.

Our
    quarterly and annual operating results are inherently
    unpredictable and may cause our stock price to
    fluctuate

Our quarterly and annual operating results have varied
    significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the
    future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future
    operating results. In particular, we anticipate that the size of
    customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger
    business accounts. A delay in the recognition of revenue, even
    from just one account, may have a significant negative impact on
    our results of operations for a given period. In the past, a
    majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a
    quarter. Accordingly, a delay in an anticipated sale past the
    end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of
    operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that fiscal year.
    Additionally, we have exposure to



the credit risks of some of our customers and sub-tenants.
    Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor
    and mitigate the associated risk, there can be no assurance that
    such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks
    adequately. We monitor individual payment capability in granting
    credit arrangements, seek to limit the total credit to amounts
    we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we
    believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses. If
    there is a deterioration of a sub-tenant’s or a major
    customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher
    than expected, future losses, if incurred, could harm our
    business and have a material adverse effect on our operating
    results.

Further, our operating results may be below the expectations of
    securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years.
    Our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the
    market price of our common stock. Such a decline could occur,
    and has occurred in the past, even when we have met our publicly
    stated revenue

and/or

earnings guidance.

The
    average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs
    may increase, which may negatively impact gross
    profits

It is possible that the average selling prices of our products
    will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing
    pressures, increased sales discounts, new product introductions
    by us or our competitors or other factors. Therefore, in order
    to maintain our gross profits, we must develop and introduce new
    products and product enhancements on a timely basis and
    continually reduce our product costs. Our failure to do so will
    cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline, which will
    harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we may
    experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future
    operating results due to the erosion of our average selling
    prices.

It is
    difficult to predict our future operating results because we
    have an unpredictable sales cycle

Our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our
    revenue is difficult to predict. Historically, our sales cycle
    has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended
    to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on
    the enterprise market. Also, as our distribution strategy has
    evolved into more of a channel model, utilizing value-added
    resellers, distributors and systems integrators, the level of
    variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has
    increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of
    many of our sales transactions. Sales of our products require us
    to educate potential customers in their use and benefits. Sales
    of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal
    budgeting, approval and competitive evaluation processes that
    large corporations and governmental entities may require. For
    example, customers frequently begin by evaluating our products
    on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our
    products before they decide whether or not to purchase.
    Customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated
    releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or
    us. As a result, our products have an unpredictable sales cycle
    that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating
    results.

Our
    business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not
    able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if
    a single source of hardware assembly is lost or
    impaired

We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to
    third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware
    platforms to our specifications. We have experienced minor
    delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past.
    However, if we experience major delays in the future or other
    problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of
    product, any one or a combination of these factors may harm our
    business and results of operations. The inability of our
    contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of
    our products or the loss of one or more of our contract
    manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders
    while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our
    business and results of operations. In particular, we currently
    subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking
    products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not
    have a long-term contract. If our arrangement with this single
    source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise
    impaired, and we were not able to engage another contract
    manufacturer in a timely manner, our business, financial
    condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.



If the demand for our products grows, we will need to increase
    our raw material and component purchases, contract manufacturing
    capacity and internal test and quality control functions. Any
    disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue, may harm our
    competitive position and may result in additional costs or
    cancellation of orders by our customers.

Our
    business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays
    in the supply of hardware components from our third-party
    sources

We currently purchase several hardware components used in the
    assembly of our products from a number of single or limited
    sources. Lead times for these components vary significantly. The
    unavailability of suitable components, any interruption or delay
    in the supply of any of these hardware components or the
    inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources
    at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, may delay
    assembly and sales of our products and, hence, our revenues, and
    may harm our business and results of operations.

We are
    subject to governmental export and import controls that could
    subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in
    international markets

Our products are subject to U.S. export controls and may be
    exported outside the U.S. only with the required level of
    export license or through an export license exception because we
    incorporate encryption technology into our products. In
    addition, various countries regulate the import of certain
    encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our
    ability to distribute our products or our customers’
    ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in
    our products or changes in export and import regulations may
    create delays in the introduction of our products in
    international markets, prevent our customers with international
    operations from deploying our products throughout their global
    systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our
    products to certain countries altogether. Any change in export
    or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach
    to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in
    the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such
    regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by,
    or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to,
    existing or potential customers with international operations.
    For example, we will need to comply with Waste Electrical and
    Electronic Equipment Directive laws, which are being adopted by
    certain European Economic Area countries on a

country-by-country

basis. Failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely
    basis, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, operating results and financial condition. Any
    decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to
    export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our
    business, operating results and financial condition.

We may
    not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and
    our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of
    third parties

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
    trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure of
    confidential and proprietary information to protect our
    intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our
    proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or
    otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring
    unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be
    certain that the steps we have taken will prevent
    misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign
    countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights
    as fully as in the United States.

Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number
    of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding
    patent and other intellectual property rights. In the ordinary
    course of our business, we are involved in disputes and
    licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed
    proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always
    successfully defend ourselves against such claims. If we are
    found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, or if we
    otherwise settle such claims, we could be compelled to pay
    damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those
    intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they
    no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights. Any license
    could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at
    all. Similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid
    infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or
    impractical. In addition, we have initiated, and may in the
    future initiate, claims or



litigation against third parties for infringement of our
    proprietary rights, or to determine the scope and validity of
    our proprietary rights or those of our competitors. Any of these
    claims, whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary
    rights of others, or vice versa, with or without merit, may be
    time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of
    technical and management personnel or require us to cease using
    infringing technology, develop non-infringing technology or
    enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Further, our license
    agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers,
    distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to
    our technology, which could cause us to become involved in
    infringement claims made against our customers, distributors or
    resellers. Any of the above-described circumstances relating to
    intellectual property rights disputes could result in our
    business and results of operations being harmed.

Many of our products include intellectual property licensed from
    third parties. In the future, it may be necessary to renew
    licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new
    licenses for other technology. These third party licenses may
    not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. The
    inability to obtain certain licenses, or litigation regarding
    the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related
    intellectual property issues, could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, operating results and financial
    condition. Furthermore, we license some third party intellectual
    property on a non-exclusive basis and this may limit our ability
    to protect our intellectual property rights in our products.

We may
    not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships
    and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution
    partners could hurt our business

We sell our products and services through multiple distribution
    channels in the United States and internationally, including
    leading industry distributors, value-added resellers, systems
    integrators, and other indirect channel partners. We have a
    limited number of agreements with companies in these channels,
    and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution
    relationships or maintain our existing relationships. Recruiting
    and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in
    our technologies requires significant time and resources. If we
    are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels,
    our business and results of operations will be harmed. In
    addition, two domestic distributors of our products together
    accounted for 24.5% and 24.8% of our total net revenue for the
    fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. A substantial
    reduction or delay in sales of our products to these
    distribution partners, if not replaced by sales to other
    indirect channel partners and distributors, could harm our
    business, operating results and financial condition.

Undetected
    software or hardware errors may harm our business and results of
    operations

Our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first
    introduced or as new versions are released. We have experienced
    these errors or defects in the past in connection with new
    products and product upgrades. We expect that these errors or
    defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced
    products after commencement of commercial shipments. These
    problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair
    costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from
    our product development efforts and cause significant customer
    relations problems. We may also be subject to liability claims
    for damages related to product errors or defects. While we carry
    insurance policies covering this type of liability, these
    policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be
    asserted. A material product liability claim may harm our
    business and results of operations.

Our products must successfully operate with products from other
    vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may
    be difficult to identify the source of the problem. The
    occurrence of software or hardware problems, whether caused by
    our products or another vendor’s products, may result in
    the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products. The
    occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and
    results of operations.

Adverse
    general economic conditions or reduced information technology
    spending may adversely impact our business

A substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for
    information technology by large enterprise customers and service
    providers, the overall economic health of our current and
    prospective



customers and the continued growth and evolution of the
    Internet. National, regional and local economic conditions, such
    as recessionary economic cycles, protracted economic slowdown or
    further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact
    demand for our products. The purchase of our products is often
    discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of
    capital and other resources. Continued weak economic conditions
    or a reduction in information technology spending even if
    economic conditions improve would likely result in longer sales
    cycles and reduced product sales, each of which would adversely
    impact our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

Our
    investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that
    may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these
    investments

At September 30, 2008, the fair value of our AAA rated
    municipal auction rate securities, (“ARS”) that were
    valued at reported market prices was approximately
    $47.5 million. Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed
    for approximately $53.4 million in par value of municipal
    ARS we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. We may not
    be able to liquidate these investments and realize their full
    carrying value unless the issuer calls the security, a
    successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the
    auction process, or the security matures. While we do not
    believe the decline in the carrying values of these municipal
    ARS is permanent, if the issuers of these securities are unable
    to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings
    are lowered, we may be required to record future impairment
    charges related to these investments, which would harm our
    results of operations. We believe these investments may remain
    illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result, we have
    classified these investments as long-term as of
    September 30, 2008.

Our
    operating results are exposed to risks associated with
    international commerce

As our international sales increase, our operating results
    become more exposed to international operating risks. These
    risks include risks related to recessionary economic cycles or
    protracted slowdowns in economies outside the United States,
    foreign currency exchange rates, managing foreign sales offices,
    regulatory, political or economic conditions in specific
    countries, military conflict or terrorist activities, changes in
    laws and tariffs, inadequate protection of intellectual property
    rights in foreign countries, foreign regulatory requirements and
    natural disasters. All of these factors could have a material
    adverse effect on our business. We intend to continue expanding
    into international markets. International sales represented
    42.5% and 41.6% of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended
    September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In particular,
    in fiscal year 2008, we derived 9.0% of our total revenue from
    the Japanese market. This revenue is dependent on a number of
    factors outside our control, including the viability and success
    of our resellers and the strength of the Japanese economy.

Changes
    in governmental regulations could negatively affect our
    revenues

Our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by
    the United States and various foreign governments including, but
    not limited to, environmental regulations and regulations
    implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the
    import or export of some technologies, especially encryption
    technology. Changes in governmental regulation and our inability
    or failure to obtain required approvals, permits or
    registrations could harm our international and domestic sales
    and adversely affect our revenues, business and operations.

Acquisitions
    present many risks and we may not realize the financial and
    strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the
    transaction

With respect to our past acquisitions, as well as any other
    future acquisitions we may undertake, we may find that the
    acquired businesses, products or technologies do not further our
    business strategy as expected, that we paid more than what the
    assets are later worth or that economic conditions change, all
    of which may generate future impairment charges. Our
    acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers, financial
    markets or investors. There may be difficulty integrating the
    operations and personnel of the acquired business, and we may
    have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired
    business. We may have difficulty in integrating the acquired
    technologies or products with our existing product lines. Our
    ongoing business and



management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by
    transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing
    geographically and culturally diverse locations. We may have
    difficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures
    and policies across locations. We may experience significant
    problems or liabilities associated with product quality,
    technology and other matters.

Our inability to successfully operate and integrate
    newly-acquired businesses appropriately, effectively and in a
    timely manner, or to retain key personnel of any acquired
    business, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
    take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated
    traffic management and security solutions and other advances in
    technology, as well as on our revenues, gross margins and
    expenses.

Our
    success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract
    and retain qualified sales and marketing, operations, product
    development and professional services personnel

Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued
    contributions of our key management, product development, sales,
    marketing and finance personnel, many of whom may be difficult
    to replace. The complexity of our application delivery
    networking products and their integration into existing networks
    and ongoing support, as well as the sophistication of our sales
    and marketing effort, requires us to retain highly trained
    professional services, customer support and sales personnel.
    Competition for qualified professional services, customer
    support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because
    of the limited number of people available with the necessary
    technical skills and understanding of our products. Our ability
    to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by
    volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock, since
    these employees are generally granted restricted stock units or
    stock options. The loss of services of any of our key personnel,
    the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the
    future or delays in hiring qualified personnel, may harm our
    business and results of operations.

We
    face litigation risks

We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business.
    Litigation in general, and intellectual property and securities
    litigation in particular, can be expensive, lengthy and
    disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results
    of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
    Responding to lawsuits has been, and will likely continue to be,
    expensive and time-consuming for us. An unfavorable resolution
    of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business, results
    of operations or financial condition.

Our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our
    prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks
    associated with litigation. Beginning in May 2006 several
    derivative actions were filed against certain current and former
    directors and officers (as discussed further in Part II,
    Item 8, Note 7, “Commitments and
    Contingencies — Litigation”) based on allegations
    relating to our historical stock option practices. We cannot
    assure you that this current litigation will result in the same
    conclusions reached by the special committee of outside
    directors formed by our Board of Directors to conduct a review
    of our stock option practices (the “Special
    Committee”).

We may in the future be subject to additional litigation arising
    in relation to our historical stock option practices and the
    restatement of our prior financial statements. Litigation may be
    time consuming, expensive and distracting for management from
    the conduct of our business. The adverse resolution of any
    lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure
    you that any future litigation relating to our historical stock
    option practices will result in the same conclusions reached by
    the Special Committee. Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse
    findings in any of these matters, we could be required to pay
    damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us
    which could adversely affect our business, results of operations
    or financial condition.



The
    matters relating to the Special Committee’s review of our
    historical stock option practices and the restatement of our
    consolidated financial statements has resulted in regulatory
    proceedings against us and may result in future regulatory
    proceedings, which could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition

On November 8, 2006, we announced that the Special
    Committee had completed its review of our historical stock
    option practices. Upon completion of its review, the Special
    Committee found that the recorded grant dates for certain stock
    options granted during fiscal years 1999 to 2004 should be
    adjusted as the measurement date for accounting purposes and the
    accounting treatment used for the vesting of certain stock
    options was incorrect. Based on the Special Committee’s
    review, to correct the accounting treatment, we amended our
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K/A

(as amended) for the year ended September 30, 2005 and our
    Quarterly Reports on

Form 10-Q

for the three months ended December 31, 2005 and
    March 31, 2006 to restate the consolidated financial
    statements contained in those reports.

In May 2006, we received notice from both the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the United States
    Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York (the
    “Department of Justice”) that they were conducting
    informal inquiries into our historical stock option practices.
    We have fully cooperated with both agencies. Considerable legal
    and accounting expenses related to our historical stock option
    practices have been incurred and we may in the future be subject
    to additional regulatory proceedings or actions arising in
    relation to our historical stock option practices and the
    restatement of our prior period financial statements. Any
    potential regulatory proceeding or action may be time consuming,
    expensive and distracting for management from the conduct of our
    business. The adverse resolution of any potential regulatory
    proceeding or action could adversely affect our business,
    results of operations or financial condition. We cannot assure
    you that the SEC and Department of Justice inquiries, or any
    future regulatory action relating to our historical stock option
    practices, will result in the same conclusions reached by the
    Special Committee. Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse
    findings in any of these matters, we could be required to pay
    damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us,
    including criminal penalties, which could adversely affect our
    business, results of operations or financial condition.

Anti-takeover
    provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to
    acquire us

Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the
    price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions,
    including voting rights, of those shares without any further
    vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of
    common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected
    by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be
    issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have
    the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of
    control of our company without further action by our
    shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other
    rights of the holders of common stock. Further, certain
    provisions of our bylaws, including a provision limiting the
    ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of
    shareholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect
    of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of
    our company, which could have an adverse effect on the market
    price of our common stock. In addition, our articles of
    incorporation provide for a staggered board, which may make it
    more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of
    Directors. Similarly, state anti-takeover laws in the State of
    Washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a
    change of control of our company.

Properties

Our principal administrative, sales, marketing, research and
    development facilities are located in Seattle, Washington and
    consist of approximately 190,000 square feet. In April
    2000, we amended and restated the lease agreement on two of the
    three buildings for our corporate headquarters. The lease
    commenced in July 2000 on the first building; and the lease on
    the second building commenced in September 2000. The lease for



both buildings expires in 2012 with an option for renewal. The
    lease for the second building has been partially subleased
    through 2012. We believe that our existing properties are in
    good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business. We
    also lease office space for our product development personnel in
    Spokane, Washington, San Jose, California, Lowell,
    Massachusetts, Israel, Northern Ireland, and Russia and for our
    sales and support personnel in Illinois, Washington D.C., New
    York, New Jersey, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, Taiwan, Thailand,
    India, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand,
    Germany, France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Netherlands and the
    United Kingdom. We believe that our future growth can be
    accommodated by our current facilities or by leasing additional
    space if necessary.

In October 2006, we entered into an office lease agreement to
    lease a total of approximately 137,000 square feet of
    office space in a building known as 333 Elliott West, which is
    adjacent to the three buildings that serve as our corporate
    headquarters. The lease expires in 2018. Construction on this
    project was substantially completed in the third quarter of
    fiscal year 2008. During 2008, as part of an office
    consolidation we entered into two separate sublease agreements
    to sublease approximately 112,500 square feet of building
    333 Elliott West. These sublease terms expire in 2011 and 2013,
    respectively.

Legal
    Proceedings

Regulatory
    proceedings

Derivative Suits.

Beginning on or about
    May 24, 2006, several derivative actions were filed against
    certain of our current and former directors and officers. These
    derivative lawsuits were filed in: (1) the Superior Court
    of King County, Washington, as In re F5 Networks, Inc. State
    Court Derivative Litigation (Case

No. 06-2-17195-1

SEA), which consolidates Adams v. Amdahl, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-17195-1

SEA), Wright v. Amdahl, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-19159-5

SEA), and Sommer v. McAdam, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-26248-4

SEA) (the “State Court Derivative Litigation”); and
    (2) in the U.S. District Court for the Western
    District of Washington, as In re F5 Networks, Inc. Derivative
    Litigation, Master File

No. C06-0794RSL,

which consolidates Hutton v. McAdam, et al. (Case

No. 06-794RSL),

Locals 302 and 612 of the International Union of Operating
    Engineers-Employers Construction Industry Retirement
    Trust v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1057RSL),

and Easton v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1145RSL)

(the “Federal Court Derivative Litigation”). On
    August 2, 2007, another derivative lawsuit, Barone v.
    McAdam et al. (Case

No. C07-1200P)

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
    District of Washington. The Barone lawsuit was designated a
    related case to the Federal Court Derivative Litigation on
    September 4, 2007. The complaints generally allege that
    certain of our current and former directors and officers,
    including, in general, each of our current outside directors
    (other than Deborah L. Bevier and Scott Thompson who joined our
    Board of Directors in July 2006 and January 2008, respectively)
    breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by engaging in
    alleged wrongful conduct concerning the manipulation of certain
    stock option grant dates. We are named solely as a nominal
    defendant against whom the plaintiffs seek no recovery. Our
    combined motion to consolidate and stay the State Court
    Derivative Litigation was granted in a court order dated
    April 3, 2007. Our motion to dismiss the consolidated
    federal derivative actions based on plaintiffs’ failure to
    make demand on our Board of Directors prior to filing suit was
    granted in a court order dated August 6, 2007 with leave to
    amend the allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint. Plaintiffs
    filed an amended consolidated federal derivative action
    complaint on September 14, 2007. We filed a motion to
    dismiss the amended complaint based on plaintiff’s failure
    to make demand on our Board of Directors prior to filing suit.
    On July 3, 2008, before ruling on our pending dismissal
    motion, the federal court entered an order certifying certain
    issues of Washington state law to the Washington Supreme Court
    for resolution. Briefing the Washington Supreme Court on the
    certified issues began on September 15, 2008 and the
    hearing is currently set for March 24, 2009. The federal
    derivative actions are stayed pending resolution of the
    certification proceeding. We intend to continue to vigorously
    pursue dismissal of the derivative actions.

SEC and Department of Justice Inquiries.

In
    May 2006, we received notice from both the SEC and the
    Department of Justice that they were conducting informal
    inquiries into our historical stock option practices, and have
    fully cooperated with both agencies. Considerable legal and
    accounting expenses related to our historical stock option
    practices have been incurred to date. We may in the future be
    subject to additional regulatory proceedings or actions arising
    in relation to our historical stock option practices and the
    restatement



of our prior period financial statements. Although regulatory
    proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, we do not
    believe the results of any pending actions will, individually or
    in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

We are not aware of any other pending legal proceedings than
    those mentioned above that, individually or in the aggregate,
    would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
    results, or financial condition. We may in the future be party
    to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business,
    including claims that we allegedly infringe upon third-party
    trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Such claims,
    even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of
    significant financial and managerial resources.

Restatement
    of Consolidated Financial Statements

In our Annual Report on

Form 10-K/A

No. 2 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005
    (filed on December 12, 2006), we restated our consolidated
    financial statements for the years ended September 30,
    2005, 2004 and 2003, and the selected consolidated financial
    data as of and for the years ended September 30, 2005,
    2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001. In addition, we restated our
    consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended
    December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006 in our Quarterly
    Reports on

Form 10-Q/A

for the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and March 31,
    2006, each of which was filed on December 13, 2006. All
    financial information included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

reflects our restatement.

Overview

We are a global provider of software and hardware products and
    services that help companies efficiently and securely manage the
    delivery, optimization and security of application and data
    traffic on Internet-based networks, and to optimize the
    performance and utilization of data storage infrastructure and
    other network resources. We market and sell our products
    primarily through multiple indirect sales channels in the
    Americas (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East,
    and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia Pacific region (APAC).
    Enterprise customers (Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global
    1000 companies) in technology, telecommunications,
    financial services, transportation, and manufacturing
    industries, along with government customers, continue to make up
    the largest percentage of our customer base.



Our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance
    indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our
    financial and operating performance. Those indicators include:

•

Revenues.

The majority of our revenues are
    derived from sales of our Application Delivery Networking
    (“ADN”) products; BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager, BIG-IP
    Global Traffic Manager, BIG-IP ISP Traffic Manager,
    TrafficShield Application Firewall, WANJet, and WebAccelerator;
    FirePass SSL VPN servers; and our ARX file virtualization
    products. We also derive revenues from the sales of services
    including annual maintenance contracts, installation, training
    and consulting services. We carefully monitor the sales mix of
    our revenues within each reporting period. We believe customer
    acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements
    are key indicators of future trends. We also consider overall
    revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as
    additional indicators of current and future trends.

•

Cost of revenues and gross margins.

We strive
    to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross
    margins. Significant items impacting cost of revenues are
    hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third-party
    software license fees, amortization of developed technology and
    personnel and overhead expenses. Our margins have remained
    relatively stable over the past two years. However, factors such
    as sales price, product mix, inventory obsolescence, returns,
    component price increases and warranty costs could significantly
    impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter and represent
    significant indicators we monitor on a regular basis.

•

Operating expenses.

Operating expenses are
    substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses.
    Existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant
    factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense
    trends. Other significant operating expenses that we monitor
    include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees,
    computer costs related to the development of new products,
    facilities and depreciation expenses.

•

Liquidity and cash flows.

Our financial
    condition remains strong with significant cash and investments
    and no long term debt. The decrease in cash and investments was
    primarily due to $200 million of cash used to repurchase
    outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program in
    fiscal 2008, largely offset by cash provided by operating
    activities of $193.7 million for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2008. Going forward, we believe the primary
    driver of cash flows will be net income from operations. Capital
    expenditures for fiscal year 2008 were comprised primarily of
    tenant improvements and information technology infrastructure
    and equipment to support the growth of our core business
    activities. We will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions
    of, or investments in businesses, products, or technologies that
    we believe are strategic, which may require the use of cash.

•

Balance sheet.

We view cash, short-term and
    long-term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable
    balances and day’s sales outstanding as important
    indicators of our financial health. Deferred revenues continued
    to increase due to the growth in the amount of annual
    maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance
    renewal contracts related to our existing product installation
    base. Our day’s sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of
    fiscal year 2008 was 51 days. We expect to maintain this
    metric in the mid

50-day

range
    going forward.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. The preparation of these financial
    statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and
    on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
    estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the
    more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation
    of our financial statements.



Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue in
    accordance with the guidance provided under Statement of
    Position (“SOP”)

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,”

and

SOP No. 98-9

“Modification of

SOP No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain
    Transactions,”

Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 48,

“Revenue
    Recognition When Right of Return Exists,”

and SEC Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101,

“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,”

and SAB No. 104,

“Revenue
    Recognition.”

We sell products through distributors, resellers, and directly
    to end users. We recognize product revenue upon shipment, net of
    estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be
    probable and no significant obligations remain. In certain
    regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate
    returns, we defer revenue on sales to our distributors until we
    receive information from the channel partner indicating that the
    distributor has sold the product to its customer. Payment terms
    to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to
    net 45 days. Payment terms to international customers
    range from net 30 days to net 90 days based
    on normal and customary trade practices in the individual
    markets. We have offered extended payment terms ranging from
    three to six months to certain customers, in which case revenue
    is recognized when payments are made.

Whenever product, training and post-contract customer support
    (“PCS”) elements are combined into a package with a
    single “bundled” price, a portion of the sales price
    is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on
    their respective fair values as determined when the individual
    elements are sold separately. We determine fair value based on
    the type of customer and region in which the package is sold.
    Where fair value of certain elements are not available, we
    recognize revenue on the “residual method” permitted
    under

SOP 98-9

based on the fair value of undelivered elements. Revenues from
    the sale of product are recognized when the product has been
    shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product.
    When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate
    returns, we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse.
    Revenues for PCS are recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the service contract term. PCS includes a limited period of
    telephone support updates, repair or replacement of any failed
    product or component that fails during the term of the
    agreement, bug fixes and rights to upgrades, when and if
    available. Consulting services are customarily billed at fixed
    rates, plus out-of-pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized
    when the consulting has been completed. Training revenue is
    recognized when the training has been completed.

Reserve for Doubtful Accounts.

Estimates are
    used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are
    based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a
    percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging
    category. In determining these percentages, we evaluate
    historical write-offs, current trends in the credit quality of
    our customer base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We
    perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’
    financial condition and do not require any collateral. If there
    is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or
    actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our
    allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient.

Reserve for Product Returns.

In some
    instances, product revenue from distributors is subject to
    agreements allowing rights of return. Product returns are
    estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the
    time revenues are recognized. Accordingly, we reduce recognized
    revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is
    recorded. When rights of return are present and we cannot
    estimate returns, revenue is recognized when such rights lapse.
    The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon
    changes in historical rates of returns and other related
    factors. It is possible that these estimates will change in the
    future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates.

Reserve for Warranties.

A warranty reserve is
    established based on our historical experience and an estimate
    of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on
    products sold as of the balance sheet date to those customers
    with no service contract. While we believe that our warranty
    reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is
    appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable could
    differ materially from what will actually transpire in the
    future.

Accounting for Income Taxes.

We utilize the
    liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in
    SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income
    Taxes”

(“SFAS 109”). Accordingly, we are
    required to estimate our income taxes in each of the
    jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of
    preparing our



consolidated financial statements. This process involves
    estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing
    the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing
    temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of
    items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result
    in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due to the evolving
    nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large
    number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that
    our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future,
    which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely
    affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash
    flows.

Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2008, we adopted Financial
    Interpretation No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109”

(“FIN 48”). Further
    information may be found in Note 5, “Income
    Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of
    this

Form 10-K.

Stock-Based Compensation.

We account for
    stock-based compensation in accordance with Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment”

(“FAS 123R”), using the straight-line
    attribution method for recognizing compensation expense. We
    recognized $60.6 million and $41.2 million of
    stock-based compensation expense for the years ended
    September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of
    September 30, 2008, there was $82.9 million of total
    unrecognized stock-based compensation cost, the majority of
    which will be recognized over the next two years. Going forward,
    stock-based compensation expenses may increase as we issue
    additional equity-based awards to continue to attract and retain
    key employees.

We issue incentive awards to our employees through stock-based
    compensation consisting of stock options and restricted stock
    units (“RSUs”). The value of RSUs is determined using
    the fair value method, which in this case, is based on the
    number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common
    stock on the date of grant. Alternatively, in determining the
    fair value of stock options, we use the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model that employs the following key assumptions.
    Expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical
    volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the
    option. Expected term of the option is based on historical
    employee stock option exercise behavior, the vesting terms of
    the respective option and a contractual life of ten years. Our
    stock price volatility and option lives involve
    management’s best estimates at that time, both of which
    impact the fair value of the option calculated under the
    Black-Scholes methodology and, ultimately, the expense that will
    be recognized over the life of the option.

FAS 123R also requires that we recognize compensation
    expense for only the portion of stock options or RSUs that are
    expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates
    that are derived from historical employee termination behavior.
    In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we began estimating
    forfeitures by class of employee to better reflect our
    historical behavior. Based on historical differences with
    forfeitures of stock-based awards granted to our executive
    officers and Board of Directors versus grants awarded to all
    other employees, we developed separate forfeiture expectations
    for these two groups. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the
    estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive
    officers and Board of Directors was approximately 4% and the
    estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other
    employees was approximately 10%. If the actual number of
    forfeitures differs from those estimated by management,
    additional adjustments to stock-based compensation expense may
    be required in future periods.

Compensation cost recognized for the year ended
    September 30, 2008 includes: (a) compensation cost for
    all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as
    of July 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FASB
    Statement No. 123, “

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation”

and (b) compensation cost for all
    share-based payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005,
    based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the provisions of FAS 123R.

In August 2008, we granted 383,400 RSUs to certain current
    executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of
    RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments
    over two years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested
    on August 1, 2010. Twenty-five percent of the RSU grant, or
    a portion thereof, is subject to our achievement of specified
    percentage increases in total revenue during the period
    beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 through the
    third quarter of fiscal year 2009, relative to the same periods
    in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. The executive officers can
    receive additional RSUs in amounts up



to 25% of that number of RSUs subject to this total revenue
    increase target if the target is exceeded. The remaining
    twenty-five percent is subject to our achievement of specified
    percentage increases in total revenue during the period
    beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 through the
    third quarter of fiscal year 2010, relative to the same periods
    in fiscal years 2008 and 2009, as will be set by the
    Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.

In August 2007, we granted 276,400 RSUs to certain current
    executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of
    RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments
    over two years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested
    on August 1, 2009. Twenty-five percent of the RSU grant is
    subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in
    total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal year 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal year
    2008, relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2006 and
    2007. This twenty-five percent was fully earned in fiscal 2008.
    The remaining twenty-five percent is subject to our achievement
    of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the
    period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008
    through the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, relative to the
    same periods in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, as set by the
    Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.

In December 2006, we granted 456,000 RSUs to certain current
    executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of
    RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments
    over two years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested
    on November 1, 2008. Twenty-five percent of the RSU grant
    was subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases
    in total revenue for fiscal year 2007, relative to fiscal year
    2006. This twenty-five percent was fully earned in fiscal 2007.
    The remaining twenty-five percent was subject to our achievement
    of specified percentage increases in total revenue for fiscal
    year 2008, relative to fiscal year 2007. This twenty-five
    percent was fully earned in fiscal 2008.

We recognize compensation costs for awards with performance
    conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance
    condition will be achieved. We reassess the probability of
    vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs
    based on our probability assessment.

On January 23, 2008, we announced that our Board of
    Directors had approved a new program to repurchase up to
    $200 million of our outstanding common stock. As of
    September 30, 2008, we had completed the repurchase and
    repurchased and retired approximately 7.7 million shares at
    an average price of $25.90 per share.

Goodwill and intangible assets.

We have a
    significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our
    balance sheet related to acquisitions. Intangible assets are
    carried and reported at acquisition cost, net of accumulated
    amortization subsequent to acquisition. Intangible assets are
    amortized over the estimated useful lives, which generally range
    from three to five years. Intangible assets are reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment
    might exist in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets.”

Projected undiscounted net cash flows expected
    to be derived from the use of those assets are compared to the
    respective net carrying amounts to determine whether any
    impairment exists. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of
    the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets.

The determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and
    intangible assets and the extent to which, if any, there is
    impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on
    our part, including the useful life over which the intangible
    assets are to be amortized, and the estimates of the value of
    future net cash flows, which are based upon further estimates of
    future revenues, expenses and operating margins. In applying
    SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,”

we review our goodwill annually for impairment
    in the second fiscal quarter, or more frequently when indicators
    of impairment are present. As a result of the current economic
    environment, we re-evaluated our goodwill and intangible assets
    at September 30, 2008, and concluded that there were no
    indicators of impairment.

Investments.

Our investments are diversified
    among high-credit quality debt securities in accordance with our
    investment policy. We classify our investments as
    available-for-sale, which are reported at fair market value with
    the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity.
    Realized gains and losses and declines in value of investments
    judged to be other than



temporary are included in other income (expense). To date, we
    have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to
    other-than-temporary declines in the estimated fair values of
    our marketable debt securities. However, the fair value of our
    investments is subject to volatility. Declines in the fair value
    of our investments judged to be other than temporary could
    adversely affect our future operating results. We used the
    income approach to determine the fair value of our auction rate
    securities (“ARS”) using a discounted cash flow
    analysis. The assumptions we used in preparing the discounted
    cash flow model include estimates for interest rates; estimates
    for discount rates using yields of comparable traded instruments
    adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors, amount of cash
    flows and expected holding periods for the ARS. We believe these
    investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months
    and as a result, we have classified these investments as
    long-term as of September 30, 2008.

Net Revenues.

Total net revenues increased
    23.7% in fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007, compared to an
    increase of 33.4% in fiscal year 2007 from fiscal year 2006. The
    revenue growth was due to increased demand for our core ADN
    products and revenue from our ARX file virtualization products.
    In addition, service revenues contributed to the overall revenue
    growth as a result of our increased installed base of products.
    International revenues represented 42.5%, 41.6% and 42.6% of net
    revenues in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We
    expect international sales will continue to represent a
    significant portion of net revenues, although we cannot provide
    assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net
    revenues will remain at current levels.

Net product revenues increased 15.3% in fiscal year 2008 from
    fiscal year 2007 and 28.9% in fiscal year 2007 as compared to
    fiscal year 2006. The increase of $60.0 million in net
    product sales for fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to growth
    in the volume of product sales of our ADN products of
    $45.4 million. In addition, net product revenue from our
    ARX file virtualization products, introduced at the end of
    fiscal year 2007 increased $17.6 million. Sales of our ADN
    products represented 92.0%, 94.5% and 93.8% of total product
    revenues in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Net service revenues increased 48.6% in fiscal year 2008 from
    fiscal year 2007 and 48.9% in fiscal year 2007 as compared to
    the fiscal year 2006. The increases in service revenue were the
    result of increased purchases or renewals of maintenance
    contracts as our installed base of products continues to
    increase.

Ingram Micro Inc., one of our domestic distributors, accounted
    for 10.5%, 11.6% and 13.6% of our total net revenues in fiscal
    years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Avnet Technology
    Solutions, another domestic distributor, accounted for 14.0%,
    13.2% and 11.6% of our total net revenue in fiscal years 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Avnet Technology Solutions
    accounted for 10.5% of our accounts receivable as of
    September 30, 2008.

Cost of Net Product Revenues.

Cost of net
    product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our
    contract manufacturers, manufacturing overhead, freight,
    warranty, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and
    amortization expenses in connection with developed technology
    from acquisitions. Product cost increased to $102.4 million
    in fiscal year 2008 as compared to $84.1 million and
    $63.6 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    The year over year increases were primarily due to a higher
    volume of units shipped. The fiscal year 2008 increase also
    included shipments of our ARX file virtualization products and
    increased indirect manufacturing costs over prior periods. The
    fiscal year 2007 increase also include an increase in warranty
    expense and indirect manufacturing cost over the prior period.

Cost of Net Service Revenues.

Cost of net
    service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of
    our professional services staff, travel, facilities and
    depreciation expenses. Cost of net service revenues as a
    percentage of net service revenues decreased to 23.6% in fiscal
    year 2008 from 25.8% in fiscal year 2007 and 27.5% in fiscal
    year 2006 primarily due to the scalability of our existing
    customer support infrastructure and increased revenue from
    maintenance contracts. The absolute dollar increase year over
    year is primarily due to increased salary and benefits
    attributed to growth in headcount. Professional services
    headcount at the end of fiscal year 2008 increased to 323 from
    279 at the end of fiscal year 2007 and 205 at the end of fiscal
    year 2006. Going forward, we expect to continue to increase our
    cost of service revenues to support our expanded product lines
    and growing customer base.

Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing
    expenses consist of salaries, commissions and related benefits
    of our sales and marketing staff, the costs of our marketing
    programs, including public relations, advertising and trade
    shows, travel, facilities and depreciation expenses. Sales and
    marketing expense increased 35.1% in fiscal year 2008 as
    compared to 37.7% and 41.9% in fiscal years 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The increase in sales and marketing expense was
    primarily due to increased commissions and personnel costs which
    totaled $42.3 million, $25.4 million and
    $21.0 million for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, which is consistent with the increased revenue for
    the corresponding periods. The fiscal year 2008 increase over
    the prior period was primarily due to a full year of expenses
    related to our ARX file virtualization personnel as compared to
    the 17 days of comparable expenses in fiscal year 2007.
    Sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2008
    increased to 716 from 669 at the end of fiscal 2007 and 442 at
    the end of fiscal 2006. Stock-based compensation charges of
    $24.1 million, $15.8 million and $10.1 million
    also contributed to the overall increase in fiscal years 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. We expect to continue to increase
    sales and marketing expenses in order to grow revenues and
    increase our market share.

Research and Development.

Research and
    development expenses consist of the salaries and related
    benefits for our product development personnel, prototype
    materials and expenses related to the development of new and
    improved products, facilities and depreciation expenses.
    Research and development expenses increased 49.8% in fiscal year
    2008 as compared to increases of 40.4% and 56.0% in fiscal years
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in research and
    development expense was primarily due to increased personnel
    costs which totaled $19.7 million, $12.2 million and
    $8.4 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, which is consistent with the increased revenue for
    the corresponding periods. The fiscal year 2008 increase over
    the prior period was primarily due to a full year of expenses
    related to our ARX file virtualization personnel as compared to
    the 17 days of comparable expenses in fiscal year 2007.
    Research and development headcount at the end of fiscal 2008
    increased to 460 from 450 at the end of fiscal 2007 and 287 at
    the end of fiscal 2006. The growth in headcount was primarily
    related to the enhancement of our current products, the
    development of new, technologically advanced products that meet
    the changing needs of our customers and additional headcount
    related to our ARX file virtualization products. Stock-based
    compensation charges of $16.3 million, $10.2 million
    and $6.9 million also contributed to the overall increase
    in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We expect to
    continue to increase research and development expenses as our
    future success is dependent on the continued development of our
    products.

General and Administrative.

General and
    administrative expenses consist of the salaries, benefits and
    related costs of our executive, finance, information technology,
    human resource and legal personnel, third-party



professional service fees, bad debt charges, facilities, and
    depreciation expenses. General and administrative expenses
    increased 13.7% in fiscal year 2008 as compared with 25.9% in
    fiscal year 2007 and 53.5% in fiscal year 2006. The increase in
    fiscal year 2008 of $6.7 million was due primarily to an
    increase of $3.2 million in stock-based compensation
    charges and an increase of $3.5 million in salary and
    benefit expenses. The increase in fiscal year 2007 of
    $10.1 million was due primarily to increases of
    $6.5 million in stock-based compensation charges,
    $4.0 million in salary and benefit expenses and
    $3.1 million in other general operating expenses. General
    and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2008 increased
    to 195 from 184 at the end of fiscal 2007 and 134 at the end of
    fiscal 2006. General and administrative expense is expected to
    remain at these increased levels as we continue to build our
    infrastructure to support the worldwide growth of our business.

In-process research and development.

Acquired
    in-process research and development (“IPR&D”)
    expense was $14.0 million in 2007 and reflects the amount
    allocated to IPR&D that we acquired in the Acopia Networks,
    Inc. (“Acopia”) acquisition. IPR&D represents the
    present value of estimated after-tax cash flows expected to be
    generated by purchased technology, which, at the acquisition
    date, had not yet reached technological feasibility. We based
    our estimates and projections related to IPR&D on
    assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time of the
    acquisition but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
    If we do not successfully develop this product, our business,
    operating results and financial condition may be adversely
    affected.

Loss on facility exit and sublease.

During
    2008, we exited a research and development facility in Bellevue,
    Washington for which there was remaining operating lease
    obligations through 2014. In addition, during this period we
    consolidated our corporate headquarters, partially subleasing
    the building located at 333 Elliott Avenue West in Seattle,
    Washington for which there was remaining operating lease
    obligations through 2018. As a result of the expected loss on
    the facility exit and sublease agreements, we recorded a charge
    of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008
    pursuant to SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for
    Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”

(“SFAS 146”), and FTB

No. 79-15,

“Accounting for Loss on a Sublease Not Involving the
    Disposal of a Segment”

Other Income, Net.

Other income, net, consists
    of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and
    losses. Other income, net decreased 32.8% in fiscal year 2008,
    as compared to fiscal year 2007 and increased 61.7% in fiscal
    year 2007 as compared to the fiscal years 2006. Interest income
    was $17.5 million, $27.3 million and
    $17.2 million for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The decrease in other income, net for fiscal year
    2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to decreased
    interest income as a result of reduced investment balances,
    partially offset by cash provided from operating and investing



activities. Investment balances decreased in fiscal year 2008 as
    a result of the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our
    stock repurchase program and additional cash required for the
    acquisition of Acopia in September 2007. The fiscal year 2007
    increase was due to a combination of higher yields and increased
    investment balance over the prior period. The increased
    investment balances in fiscal year 2007 and 2006 are the result
    of additional cash provided from operating and financing
    activities during the respective fiscal years.

Provision for Income Taxes.

We recorded a
    37.1% provision for income taxes for the fiscal year 2008
    compared to 39.7% in fiscal year 2007 and 38.6% in fiscal year
    2006. The reduction in the effective tax rate from fiscal year
    end 2007 to fiscal year end 2008 is largely attributable to an
    increase in the U.S. Domestic Manufacturing Deduction and a
    decrease in the limitation on deductibility of the compensation
    of certain officers.

At September 30, 2008, we did not have a valuation
    allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the
    jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the
    assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making this
    determination we have considered projected future taxable income
    and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in
    assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance. Our net
    deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2008, 2007 and 2006
    were $52.8 million, $43.3 million and
    $23.3 million, respectively. Our worldwide effective tax
    rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including
    variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic
    locations in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our
    net deferred tax assets, resolution of potential exposures, tax
    positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic
    locations in which we operate, and the introduction of new
    accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations
    thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate.
    We have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures
    related to business and income tax positions we have taken that
    could be challenged by taxing authorities. The ultimate
    resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less
    than the liabilities recorded which could result in an
    adjustment to our future tax expense.

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term
    investments totaled $451.3 million as of September 30,
    2008 compared to $474.8 million as of September 30,
    2007, representing a decrease of $23.5 million. The
    decrease was primarily due to approximately $200 million of
    cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock under our stock
    repurchase program in fiscal 2008 which amount was largely
    offset by cash provided by operating activities of
    $193.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2008.
    In fiscal year 2007, overall cash provided by investing
    activities decreased $17.4 million compared to fiscal year
    2006. The net decrease was primarily due to cash requirements
    for the purchase of Acopia in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007,
    which amounts were partially offset by cash flow from operations.

At September 30, 2008, we held $52.3 million (par
    value) of long-term investments comprised of tax-exempt ARS,
    which are variable-rate debt securities and have a long-term
    maturity with the interest being reset through Dutch auctions
    that are typically held every 7, 28 or 35 days. The
    securities have historically traded at par and are callable at
    par at the option of the issuer. Interest is typically paid at
    the end of each auction period or semi-annually. We limit our
    investments in ARS to securities that carry an AAA (or
    equivalent) rating from recognized rating agencies and limit the
    amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.



At the time of initial investment and at the date of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K,

all of our ARS remain AAA rated.

Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately
    $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS we held because
    sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these auctions failed to
    clear, higher interest rates for those securities went into
    effect. However, the funds associated with these failed auctions
    will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a
    successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the
    auction process or the security matures. The underlying assets
    of the municipal ARS we hold, including the securities for which
    auctions have failed, are generally student loans which are
    guaranteed by the U.S. government.

We have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers
    of our ARS are presently at risk of default. Through
    September 30, 2008, we have continued to receive interest
    payments on the ARS in accordance with their terms. We believe
    we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant
    loss primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying
    securities. However, due to recent changes and uncertainty in
    the ARS market, we believe these investments may remain illiquid
    for longer than twelve months and as a result, we have
    classified these investments as long-term as of
    September 30, 2008. We currently have the ability and the
    intent to hold these ARS investments until recovery of the
    auction process or until maturity.

Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2008
    was $193.7 million compared to $169.7 million in
    fiscal year 2007 and $125.4 million in fiscal year 2006.
    Cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from
    cash generated from net income, after adjusting for non-cash
    charges such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and
    amortization charges and changes in operating assets and
    liabilities.

Cash provided by investing activities was $13.7 million for
    fiscal year 2008, compared to cash used in investing activities
    of $188.1 million for fiscal year 2007 and
    $204.4 million for fiscal year 2006. The cash provided by
    investing activities in fiscal year 2008 was primarily the
    result of the sale of investments partially offset by the
    purchase of investments. The cash used in fiscal year 2007 was
    primarily the result of the purchase of investments partially
    offset by the sale of investments and $207.1 million of
    cash payments, net of cash acquired, to shareholders of Acopia,
    which was acquired in September 2007. The cash used in fiscal
    year 2006 was primarily due to the purchase of investments and
    property and equipment, partially offset by the sale of
    investments.

Cash used in financing activities was $181.7 million for
    fiscal year 2008, compared to cash provided by financing
    activities of $35.5 million and $65.1 million in
    fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. In the second quarter
    of fiscal 2008, our Board of Directors approved a stock
    repurchase program to repurchase up to $200 million of the
    Company’s outstanding common stock. Cash used in financing
    activities for fiscal 2008 included $200 million to
    repurchase common stock under this plan, which was partially
    offset by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases
    under our employee stock purchase plan. During fiscal years 2007
    and 2006 our financing activities consisted entirely of cash
    proceeds and tax benefits received from the exercise of stock
    options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase
    plan.

We expect that our existing cash and investment balances and
    cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated
    working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable
    future.

We lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at

    table the impact of approximately $4.2 million related to
    unrecognized income tax benefits as of September 30, 2008,
    due to the adoption of FASB interpretation No. 48,
    “

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes —
    an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

.” We
    cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by
    period related to this obligation.

Purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with
    our contract manufacturers. The agreement with our primary
    contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory
    on our behalf based on our production forecast. We are obligated
    to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer
    procures in accordance with the forecast, unless cancellation is
    given within applicable lead times.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements

—

an amendment of Accounting
    Research Bulletin No. 51”

(“SFAS 160”), which amends Accounting
    Research Bulletin No. 51 to establish accounting and
    reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a
    subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.
    SFAS 160 is effective for the Company’s fiscal years
    beginning October 1, 2010. The Company does not expect the
    adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material impact on its
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,

“Business Combinations”

(“SFAS 141R”)

,

which establishes
    principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring
    identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed,
    and any noncontrolling interest in an acquisition, at their fair
    value as of the acquisition date. SFAS 141R is effective
    for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on
    or after October 1, 2009. This standard will change the
    Company’s accounting treatment for business combinations on
    a prospective basis.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities”

(“SFAS 159”),
    which allows entities to measure eligible financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value. The Statement also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different
    measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
    liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective for the Company’s
    fiscal years beginning October 1, 2008. The Company is
    currently assessing the potential effect if any of implementing
    this standard but does not expect it to have a material effect
    on its consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the
    FASB released a FASB Staff Position (FSP

FAS 157-2

-

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

) which
    delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company
    adopted this standard on October 1, 2008. The Company is
    currently assessing the potential effect if any of



implementing this standard but does not expect it to have a
    material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk.

Our cash equivalents
    consist of high-quality securities, as specified in our
    investment policy guidelines. The policy limits the amount of
    credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5% of
    the total portfolio with the exception of U.S. treasury
    securities, commercial paper and money market funds, which are
    exempt from size limitation. The policy requires investments in
    securities that mature in three years or less, with the average
    maturity being no greater than one and a half years. These
    securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease
    in value if interest rates increase. A decrease of one percent
    in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease
    of approximately $3.7 million in our interest income for
    the fiscal year 2008.

At September 30, 2008, the fair value of our AAA rated
    municipal ARS was approximately $47.5 million. ARS are
    collateralized long-term debt instruments that provide liquidity
    through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable
    interest rate at pre-determined intervals, typically every 7, 28
    or 35 days. Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for
    approximately $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS
    we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these
    auctions failed to clear, higher interest rates for those
    securities went into effect. However, the funds associated with
    these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer
    calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is
    found outside of the auction process or the security matures.
    The underlying assets of the municipal ARS we hold, including
    the securities for which auctions have failed, are generally
    student loans which are guaranteed by the U.S. government.
    Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources
    of cash, we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of
    our municipal ARS will have a material impact on our overall
    ability to meet our liquidity needs. We have the intent and
    ability to hold these securities until liquidation. These
    securities have been classified as long-term at
    September 30, 2008 based on the fact that we believe it
    could take longer than twelve months to liquidate the positions.

Foreign Currency Risk.

The majority of our
    sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a
    result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency
    transaction gains and losses to date. While we have conducted
    some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008 and expect to continue to do so,
    we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or
    losses will be significant at our current level of operations.
    However, as we continue to expand our operations
    internationally, transaction gains or losses may become
    significant in the future. We have not engaged in foreign
    currency hedging to date. However, we may do so in the future.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To The Board of Directors and Shareholders

of F5 Networks, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of F5 Networks, Inc. and its subsidiaries
    at September 30, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended September 30, 2008 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
    all material respects, the information set forth therein when
    read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of September 30, 2008, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
    responsible for these financial statements and financial
    statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control
    over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting appearing under item 9A. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, on
    October 1, 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

The
    Company

F5 Networks, Inc. (the “Company”) provides products
    and services to help companies manage their Internet Protocol
    (IP) traffic and file storage infrastructure efficiently and
    securely. The Company’s application delivery networking
    products improve the performance, availability and security of
    applications on Internet-based networks. Internet traffic
    between network-based applications and clients passes through
    these devices where the content is inspected to ensure that it
    is safe and modified as necessary to ensure that it is delivered
    securely and in a way that optimizes the performance of both the
    network and the applications. The Company’s storage
    virtualization products simplify and reduce the cost of managing
    files and file storage devices, and ensure fast, secure, easy
    access to files for users and applications. The Company also
    offers a broad range of services that include consulting,
    training, installation, maintenance and other technical support
    services.

Accounting
    Principles

The Company’s consolidated financial statements and
    accompanying notes are prepared on the accrual basis of
    accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States of America.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date
    of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are
    used in accounting for revenue recognition, reserves for
    doubtful accounts, product returns, obsolete and excess
    inventory, warranties, valuation allowances on deferred tax
    assets and purchase price allocations. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
    original maturities of three months or less to be cash
    equivalents. The Company invests its cash and cash equivalents
    in deposits with three major financial institutions, which, at
    times, exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not
    experienced any losses on its cash and cash equivalents.

Investments

The Company classifies its investment securities as available
    for sale. Investment securities, consisting of corporate and
    municipal bonds and notes and United States government
    securities, are reported at fair value with the related
    unrealized gains and losses included as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
    shareholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and
    declines in value of securities judged to be other than
    temporary are included in other income (expense). The cost of
    investments for purposes of computing realized and unrealized
    gains and losses is based on the specific identification method.
    Investments in securities with maturities of less than one year
    or where management’s intent is to use the investments to



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

fund current operations are classified as short-term
    investments. Investments, other than auction rate securities
    (“ARS”) with maturities of greater than one year are
    classified as long-term investments.

The Company’s ARS securities are classified as

available-for-sale

and are reported as long term, as the Company does not believe
    that they will be able to liquidate these securities in the next
    twelve months. The Company has the intent and ability to hold
    these securities until liquidation. The Company used a
    discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of
    ARS. The assumptions the Company used in preparing the
    discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates;
    estimates for discount rates using yields of comparable traded
    instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors,
    amount of cash flows and expected holding periods for the ARS.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company extends credit to customers and is therefore subject
    to credit risk. The Company performs initial and ongoing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and does
    not require collateral. An allowance for doubtful accounts is
    recorded to account for potential bad debts. Estimates are used
    in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based
    upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of
    remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In determining
    these percentages, the Company evaluates historical write-offs,
    and current trends in customer credit quality, as well as
    changes in credit policies.

The Company maintains its cash and investment balances with high
    credit quality financial institutions. Included within the
    Company’s investment portfolio are investments in ARS. The
    Company’s ARS investments are currently not liquid as a
    result of continued auction failures. If the issuers are not
    able to meet their payment obligations or if the Company sells
    its ARS investments before they recover, the Company may lose
    some or all of its principal invested or may be required to
    further reduce the carrying value.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

Short-term and long-term investments are recorded at fair value
    as the underlying securities are classified as available for
    sale and

marked-to-market

at each reporting period. The fair value is determined using
    quoted market prices for the securities held with the exception
    of ARS, which are valued based on a discounted cash flow model.

Inventories

The Company outsources the manufacturing of its pre-configured
    hardware platforms to contract manufacturers, who assemble each
    product to the Company’s specifications. As protection
    against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for
    its service teams, the Company also stocks limited supplies of
    certain key product components. The Company reduces inventory to
    net realizable value based on excess and obsolete inventories
    determined primarily by historical usage and forecasted demand.
    Inventories consist of hardware and related component parts and
    are recorded at the lower of cost or market (as determined by
    the

first-in,

first-out method).

Inventories consist of the following (in thousands):

Restricted
    Cash

Restricted cash primarily represents escrow accounts established
    in connection with lease agreements for the Company’s
    corporate headquarters and, to a lesser extent, the
    Company’s international facilities. Under the terms of the
    lease for the Company’s corporate headquarters, the amount
    required to be held in escrow reduces and eventually eliminates
    at various dates throughout the duration of the lease term.
    During fiscal year 2008, the amount required to be held in
    escrow was $2.4 million as set forth in the lease agreement
    for the Company’s corporate headquarters.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation of
    property and equipment are provided using the straight-line
    method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging
    from two to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized
    over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life
    of the improvements. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs
    is charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for major
    improvements are capitalized at cost. Gains or losses on the
    disposition of assets are reflected in the income statements at
    the time of disposal.

    2006, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated
    fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date.
    The Company has adopted the requirements of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

“Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets”

(“SFAS No. 142”). SFAS No. 142
    requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis
    and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written
    down when impaired. Goodwill of $150.2 million was recorded
    in connection with the acquisition of Acopia Networks, Inc.
    (“Acopia”), in the fourth quarter of 2007, goodwill of
    $32.0 million was recorded in connection with the
    acquisition of Swan Labs, Inc. (“Swan Labs”) in fiscal
    year 2006, goodwill of $25.5 million was recorded in
    connection with the acquisition of MagniFire Websystems Inc. in
    fiscal year 2004 and goodwill of $24.2 million was recorded
    in connection with the acquisition of uRoam, Inc. in fiscal year
    2003. In March 2008, the Company completed its annual impairment
    test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill.
    Additionally, as a result of the current economic environment
    the Company re-evaluated goodwill for impairment at
    September 30, 2008, and concluded that there was no
    impairment.

Other
    Assets

Other assets primarily consist of software development costs and
    acquired technology.



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Software development costs are charged to research and
    development expense until technological feasibility is
    established. The Company accounts for internally-generated
    software development costs in accordance with
    SFAS No. 86,

“Accounting for the Costs of
    Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
    Marketed.”

Thereafter, until the product is released
    for sale, software development costs are capitalized and
    reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable
    value of each product. The establishment of technological
    feasibility and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of
    costs require considerable judgment by the Company with respect
    to certain internal and external factors, including, but not
    limited to, anticipated future gross product revenues, estimated
    economic life and changes in hardware and software technology.
    During fiscal year 2008, the Company capitalized
    $1.7 million of software development costs. The Company did
    not capitalize any software development costs in fiscal years
    2007 or 2006. Amortization costs related to capitalized software
    development was $202,000, $249,000, and $272,000 for fiscal
    years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively and has been recorded
    as additional cost of product revenues.

Acquired technology and customer relationship assets are
    recorded at cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives
    of five years. The estimated useful life of these assets is
    assessed and evaluated for reasonableness periodically. Acquired
    technology of $15.0 million in fiscal 2007 and
    $8.0 million in fiscal 2006 was recorded in connection with
    the acquisitions of Acopia and Swan Labs, respectively.
    Amortization expense related to acquired technology, which is
    charged to cost of product revenues, totaled $6.1 million,
    $3.4 million and $3.2 million during the fiscal years
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Amortization of all other intangible assets, including customer
    relationships, patents and trademarks was $969,000, $486,000 and
    $464,000 during the fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets
    whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
    When such events occur, management determines whether there has
    been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted net
    future cash flows to the related asset’s carrying value. If
    impairment exists, the asset is written down to its estimated
    fair value. No impairment of long-lived assets was noted at
    September 30, 2008.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s products are integrated with software that is
    essential to the functionality of the equipment. Accordingly,
    the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the guidance
    provided under Statement of Position (SOP)

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,”

and

SOP No. 98-9

“Modification of

SOP No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain
    Transactions,”

Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 48,

“Revenue
    Recognition When Right of Return Exists,”

and SEC Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,

“Revenue Recognition.”

The Company sells products through distributors, resellers, and
    directly to end users. The Company recognizes product revenue
    upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that
    collection is determined to be probable and no significant
    performance obligations remain. In certain regions where the
    Company does not have the ability to reasonably estimate
    returns, the Company defers revenue on sales to its distributors
    until they have received information from the channel partner
    indicating that the distributor has sold the product to its
    customer. Payment terms to domestic customers are generally net
    30 days to net 45 days. Payment terms to international
    customers range from net 30 days to net 90 days based
    on normal and customary trade practices in the individual
    markets. The Company offers extended payment terms to certain
    customers, in which case, revenue is recognized when payments
    are due.

Whenever product, training and post-contract customer support
    (“PCS”) elements are sold together, a portion of the
    sales price is allocated to each element based on their
    respective fair values as determined when



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the individual elements are sold separately. The Company
    determines fair value based on the type of customer and region
    in which the package is sold. Where fair value of certain
    elements are not available, the Company recognizes revenue on
    the “residual method” permitted under

SOP 98-9

based on the fair value of undelivered elements. Revenues from
    the sale of product are recognized when the product has been
    shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product.
    When rights of return are present and the Company cannot
    estimate returns, it recognizes revenue when such rights of
    return lapse. Revenues for PCS are recognized on a straight-line
    basis over the service contract term. PCS includes a limited
    period of telephone support updates, repair or replacement of
    any failed product or component that fails during the term of
    the agreement, bug fixes and rights to upgrades, when and if
    available. Consulting services are customarily billed at fixed
    rates, plus

out-of-pocket

expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has
    been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training
    has been completed.

In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)

06-03,

“How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
    Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
    Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation)”

,
    the Company accounts for taxes collected from customers and
    remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded
    from revenues.

Shipping
    and Handling

Shipping and handling fees charged to the Company’s
    customers are recognized as product revenue in the period
    shipped and the related costs for providing these services are
    recorded as a cost of sale.

Guarantees
    and Product Warranties

In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its
    products, the Company indemnifies other parties, including
    customers, resellers, lessors, and parties to other transactions
    with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company
    has agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses
    arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of
    intellectual property infringement or other claims made against
    certain parties. These agreements may limit the time within
    which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the
    claim. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements
    with its officers and directors, and the Company’s bylaws
    contain similar indemnification obligations to the
    Company’s agents. It is not possible to determine the
    maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements
    due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and
    the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
    agreement.

The Company offers warranties of one year for hardware for those
    customers without service contracts, with the option of
    purchasing additional warranty coverage in yearly increments.
    The Company accrues for warranty costs as part of its cost of
    sales based on associated material product costs and technical
    support labor costs. During the years ended September 30,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, warranty expense was $10.4 million,
    $8.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively.

Research
    and Development

Research and development expenses consist of salaries and
    related benefits of product development personnel, prototype
    materials and expenses related to the development of new and
    improved products, and an allocation of facilities and
    depreciation expense. Research and development expenses are
    reflected in the statements of income as incurred.

In-Process
    Research and Development

Acquired in-process research and development
    (“IPR&D”) reflects the amount allocated to
    IPR&D that the Company acquired in acquisitions. IPR&D
    represents the present value of estimated after-tax cash flows
    expected to be generated by purchased technology, which, at the
    acquisition date, had not yet reached technological feasibility
    and had no alternative future use. The Company recorded
    $14.0 million of IPR&D cost in fiscal 2007 related to
    its acquisition of Acopia.

Advertising

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred
    $1.5 million, $2.2 million and $1.3 million in
    advertising costs during the fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for
    income taxes as set forth by SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes”

(“SFAS 109”). Deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based upon differences between the
    financial statement and income tax bases of assets and
    liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
    which the differences are expected to reverse. The realization
    of deferred tax assets is based on historical tax positions and
    estimates of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is
    recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized.

In fiscal year 2008, the Company adopted the Financial
    Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) Financial
    Interpretation No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes”

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48
    clarifies the application of SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes.”

The
    Interpretation addresses the determination of whether tax
    benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return
    should be recorded in the financial statements. Under
    FIN 48, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an
    uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that
    the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
    authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The
    tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a
    position should be measured based on the largest benefit that
    has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income
    taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased
    disclosures.

Foreign
    Currency

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign
    subsidiaries is the local currency in which the respective
    entity is located, with the exception of F5 Networks, Ltd., in
    the United Kingdom that uses the U.S. dollar as its
    functional currency. An entity’s functional currency is
    determined by the currency of the economic environment in which
    the majority of cash is generated and expended by the entity.
    The financial statements of all majority-owned subsidiaries and
    related entities, with a functional currency other than the
    U.S. dollar, have been translated into U.S. dollars in
    accordance with SFAS No. 52

“Foreign Currency
    Translation.”

All assets and liabilities of the
    respective entities are translated at year-end exchange rates
    and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates
    during the respective period. Translation adjustments are
    reported as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) in shareholder’s equity.



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of
    the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated
    in currencies other than the functional currency, including
    U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on those foreign currency
    transactions are included in determining net income or loss for
    the period of exchange. The net effect of foreign currency gains
    and losses were not significant during the fiscal years ended
    September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Segments

The Company complies with the requirements of
    SFAS No. 131,

“Disclosure about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information,”

which establishes
    annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise’s
    operating segments and related disclosures about its products,
    services, geographic areas and major customers. Management has
    determined that the Company operated in one segment for fiscal
    2008 and prior years and will continue to evaluate its reporting
    structure prospectively.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance
    with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Statement No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment”

(“FAS 123R”), using the straight-line
    attribution method for recognizing compensation expense. The
    Company recognized $60.6 million, $41.2 million and
    $24.8 million of stock-based compensation expense for the
    fiscal years ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. As of September 30, 2008, there was
    $82.9 million of total unrecognized stock-based
    compensation cost, the majority of which will be recognized over
    the next two years. Going forward, stock-based compensation
    expenses may increase as the Company issues additional
    equity-based awards to continue to attract and retain key
    employees.

The Company issues incentive awards to its employees through
    stock-based compensation consisting of stock options and
    restricted stock units (“RSUs”). On August 1,
    2008, the Company awarded approximately 1.5 million RSUs to
    employees and executive officers pursuant to the Company’s
    annual equity awards program. The value of RSUs is determined
    using the intrinsic value method, which in this case, is based
    on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Alternatively,
    in determining the fair value of stock options, the Company uses
    the Black-Scholes option pricing model that employs the
    following key assumptions.

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
    curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company does not
    anticipate declaring dividends in the foreseeable future.
    Expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical
    volatility of the Company’s stock price commensurate with
    the expected life of the option. Expected term of the option is
    based on an evaluation of the historical employee stock option
    exercise behavior, the vesting terms of the respective option
    and a contractual life of ten years. The Company’s stock
    price volatility and option lives involve management’s best
    estimates at that time, both of which impact the fair value of
    the option calculated under the Black-Scholes methodology and,
    ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the life of
    the option. SFAS 123R also requires the Company to
    recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options
    or stock units that are expected to vest. Therefore, the Company
    applies estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from
    historical employee termination behavior. In the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2008, the Company began estimating forfeitures by
    class of employee to better reflect



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

historical behavior. Based on historical differences with
    forfeitures of stock-based awards granted to the Company’s
    executive officers and Board of Directors versus grants awarded
    to all other employees, the Company has developed separate
    forfeiture expectations for these two groups. The estimated
    forfeiture rate for grants awarded to the Company’s
    executive officers and Board of Directors was approximately 4%
    and the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all
    other employees was approximately 10% in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2008. An estimated forfeiture rate of 4% was used for the
    first three quarters of fiscal 2008 and for fiscal 2007 and an
    estimated forfeiture rate of 5% was used for fiscal 2006. If the
    actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by
    management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may
    be required in future periods.

Compensation cost recognized for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2008 includes: (a) compensation cost for
    all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as
    of July 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FASB
    Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

and (b) compensation cost for all
    share-based payments granted or modified subsequent to
    July 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated
    in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
    the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing
    net income by the weighted average number of common and dilutive
    common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
    diluted net income per share (in thousands, except per share

“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial

an amendment of Accounting
    Research Bulletin No. 51”

(“SFAS 160”), which amends Accounting
    Research Bulletin No. 51 to establish accounting and
    reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a
    subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.
    SFAS 160 is effective for the Company’s



F5

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

fiscal years beginning October 1, 2010. The Company does
    not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material
    impact on its consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,

“Business Combinations”

(“SFAS 141R”)

,

which establishes
    principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring
    identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed,
    and any noncontrolling interest in an acquisition, at their fair
    value as of the acquisition date. SFAS 141R is effective
    for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on
    or after October 1, 2009. This standard will change the
    Company’s accounting treatment for business combinations on
    a prospective basis.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities”

(“SFAS 159”),
    which allows entities to measure eligible financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value. The Statement also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different
    measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
    liabilities. The Company adopted this standard on
    October 1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the
    potential effect if any of implementing this standard but does
    not expect it to have a material effect on its consolidated
    financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the
    FASB released a FASB Staff Position (FSP

FAS 157-2

-

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

) which
    delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company
    adopted this standard on October 1, 2008. The Company is
    currently assessing the potential effect if any of implementing
    this standard but does not expect it to have a material effect
    on its consolidated financial statements.

The Company invests in securities that are rated investment
    grade or better. The unrealized losses on investments for fiscal
    2008 were primarily caused by reductions in the values of the
    ARS due to the illiquid markets and were partially offset by
    unrealized gains related to interest rate decreases. The Company
    has determined the unrealized losses are temporary as the
    duration of the decline in value of investments has been short,
    the extent of the decline, in both dollars and as a percentage
    of costs, is not significant, and the Company has the ability
    and intent to hold the investments until it recovers at least
    substantially all of the cost of the investments.

The following table summarizes investments that have been in a
    continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months
    and those that have been in a continuous unrealized loss
    position for more than 12 months as of September 30,

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s investments include ARS, which are
    variable-rate debt securities. The Company limits its
    investments in ARS to securities that carry an AAA (or
    equivalent) rating from recognized rating agencies and limits
    the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. At the time of
    initial investment and at the date of this report, all ARS
    remain AAA rated. In the past, the auction process allowed
    investors to obtain immediate liquidity if so desired by selling
    the securities at their face amounts. Liquidity for these
    securities has historically been provided by an auction process
    that resets interest rates on these investments on average every
    7-35 days. However, as has been reported in the financial
    press, the disruptions in the credit markets adversely affected
    the auction market for these types of securities. The Company
    believes that the appropriate presentation of these securities
    is long-term investments as reflected in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2008, as the
    Company does not believe it will be able to liquidate these
    securities in the next twelve months.

Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately
    $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS the Company
    held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. The funds
    associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a
    successful auction occurs or a buyer is found outside the
    auction process. The Company recorded an unrealized loss on
    these securities of $4.7 million as of September 30,
    2008. The Company does not believe this loss to be other than
    temporary. However, the Company will reassess this conclusion in
    future reporting periods based on several factors, including
    continued failure of auctions, failure of investments to be
    redeemed, deterioration of the credit ratings of investments,
    market risk and other factors. Such a reassessment may result in
    a conclusion that the investments are more than temporarily
    impaired.

The Company liquidated two of its ARS at par value for
    $2.5 million and $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2008. The Company also liquidated one other ARS
    subsequent to September 30, 2008, at par value for
    $4.9 million.

Business
    Combinations

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for under the
    purchase method of accounting in accordance with
    SFAS No. 141,

“Business Combinations.”

The total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and
    intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on
    their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price
    over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The fair value
    assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed are based on estimates and assumptions
    provided by management, and other information compiled by
    management, including independent valuations, prepared by
    valuation specialists that utilize established valuation
    techniques appropriate for the technology industry. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and
    other Intangible Assets,”

goodwill is not amortized but
    instead is tested for impairment at least annually.

Fiscal
    Year 2007 Acquisition of Acopia

On September 12, 2007, the Company acquired all of the
    capital stock of Acopia, a privately held Delaware corporation
    headquartered in Lowell, Massachusetts for $207.8 million
    in cash. The Company also incurred $2.2 million of direct
    transaction costs for a total purchase price of approximately
    $210.0 million. Acopia provides high-performance,
    intelligent file virtualization solutions. These solutions will
    be highly complementary to Company’s strategy of optimizing
    the application infrastructure from the core of the datacenter
    to the edge of the network. As a result of the merger, the
    Company acquired all the assets of Acopia, all property,
    equipment and other assets that Acopia used in its business and
    assumed all the liabilities of Acopia. The results of operations
    of Acopia have been included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Of the total estimated purchase price, $15.0 million was
    allocated to developed technology, $14.0 million to
    in-process research and development, $2.1 million to
    customer relationships and $0.4 million to trade name and a
    specific non-compete agreement. To determine the value of the
    developed technology, a combination of cost and market
    approaches were used. The cost approach required an estimation
    of the costs required to reproduce the developed technology. The
    market approach measures the fair value of the technology
    through an analysis of recent comparable transactions. To
    determine the value of customer relationships, the income
    approach was used. The income approach estimates the fair value
    based on the earnings and cash flow capacity of an asset.

Developed technology, customer relationships and trade name will
    be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
    useful life of five years. The non-compete agreement will be
    amortized on a straight-line basis over the thirty six month
    term of the agreement.

Fiscal
    Year 2006 Acquisition of Swan Labs

On October 4, 2005, the Company acquired all of the capital
    stock of Swan Labs, a privately held Delaware corporation
    headquartered in San Jose, California for
    $43.0 million in cash. The Company also incurred
    $3.2 million of direct transaction costs for a total
    purchase price of approximately $46.2 million. As a result
    of the merger, the Company acquired all the assets of Swan Labs,
    all property, equipment and other assets that Swan Labs used in
    its business and assumed all the liabilities of Swan Labs. Swan
    Labs provides WAN (Wide Area Network) optimization and
    application acceleration products and services. The addition of
    Swan Labs is intended to allow us to quickly enter the WAN
    optimization market, broaden the Company’s customer base,
    and augment the Company’s existing product line. The
    results of operations of Swan Labs have been included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date
    of acquisition.

At September 30, 2008, the Company had U.S. net
    operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
    $80.2 million, a portion of which begins to expire in
    fiscal 2022 if not utilized. All U.S. net operating loss
    carry-forwards relate to entities acquired by the Company and
    are limited in use by I.R.C. Sec. 382. At September 30,
    2008, the Company also had net operating loss carry-forwards of
    approximately $413,000 related to operations in the United
    Kingdom that carry forward indefinitely. At September 30,
    2008 the Company also had federal research and development
    credit carry-forwards of approximately $2.4 million which,
    if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2022 and state research
    and development and investment credit carry-forwards of
    approximately $1.2 million, which if not utilized, may
    begin to expire in fiscal year 2017. The aforementioned credit
    carry-forwards are limited in use under I.R.C. Sec. 383. At
    September 30, 2007 the Company had approximately
    $93 million of net operating loss carry-forwards of which
    approximately $2.4 million were related to operations in
    the United Kingdom which carry-forward indefinitely. At
    September 30, 2007, the Company had federal research credit
    and other credit carry-forwards of approximately
    $2.4 million and state research and investment credit
    carry-forwards of approximately $1.2 million.

United States income and foreign withholding taxes have not been
    provided on approximately $670,000 of undistributed earnings
    from the Company’s international subsidiaries. The Company
    has not recognized a deferred tax liability for the
    undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because the
    Company currently does not expect to remit those earnings in the
    foreseeable future. Determination of the amount of unrecognized
    deferred tax liability related to undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries is not practicable because such liability,
    if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when
    remittance occurs.

At December 31, 2007 the federal tax credit for increasing
    research activities expired. This credit was reinstated into law
    on October 3, 2008 retroactive to January 1, 2008 for
    qualifying expenditures through December 31, 2009. This
    reinstatement will have a material impact on the Company’s
    effective tax rate for the quarter ending December 31,
    2009. It is estimated that the impact of this reinstatement upon
    the Company’s effective tax rate for the quarter ending
    December 31, 2009 will be 6.5%.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation
    No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — An Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109”

(“FIN 48”), on
    October 1, 2007. Previously, the Company had accounted for
    tax contingencies in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting

Standards 5,

“Accounting for Contingencies”

. As
    required by FIN 48, which clarifies Statement 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes”

, the Company
    recognizes the financial statement impact of a tax position only
    after determining that the relevant tax authority would more
    likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax
    positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount
    recognized in the financial statements is the largest impact
    that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being
    realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax
    authority. At the adoption date, the Company applied FIN 48
    to all tax positions where the statute of limitations remained
    open for all of the Company’s tax years. As a result of the
    implementation of FIN 48, the Company did not incur any
    change in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.

    and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal 2008:

The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties
    (not included in the “unrecognized tax benefits” table
    above) for any uncertain tax positions. This interest and
    penalty expense will be a component of income tax expense. At
    the adoption of FIN 48 the Company had not accrued any
    interest or penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. In the three
    months and twelve months ended September 30, 2008, the
    Company accrued approximately $32,000 and $146,000,
    respectively, of interest expense related to its liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits under FIN 48. No penalties were
    recognized in fiscal 2008 or accrued for at September 30,
    2008.

All unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the
    effective tax rate.

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to
    U.S. federal income tax as well as the income tax of
    multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has
    concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters for fiscal
    years through September 30, 2004. Major jurisdictions where
    there are wholly owned subsidiaries of F5 Networks, Inc. which
    require income tax filings include the United Kingdom, Japan,
    Australia and Germany. Periods open for review by local taxing
    authorities are fiscal years 2006, 2003, 2004 and 2003 for the
    United Kingdom, Japan, Australia and Germany, respectively.
    Within the next four fiscal quarters, the statute of limitations
    will begin to close on the fiscal years ended 2003 and 2004 tax
    returns filed in various states and the fiscal year ended 2005
    federal income tax return.

Equity
    Incentive Plans

In fiscal 2005, the Company modified the method in which it
    issues incentive awards to its employees through stock-based
    compensation. In prior years, stock-based compensation consisted
    only of stock options. Beginning in 2005, the majority of awards
    consisted of restricted stock unit awards and to a lesser degree
    stock options. Employees vest in restricted stock units and
    stock options ratably over the corresponding service term,
    generally one to four years. The Company’s stock options
    expire 10 years from the date of grant. Restricted stock
    units are payable in shares of the Company’s common stock
    as the periodic vesting requirements are satisfied. The value of
    a restricted stock unit is based upon the fair market value of
    the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The value
    of restricted stock units is determined using the intrinsic
    value method and is based on the number of shares granted and
    the quoted price of the Company’s common stock on the date
    of grant. Alternatively, the Company uses the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model

to determine the fair value of its stock options. Compensation
    expense related to restricted stock units and stock options is
    recognized over the vesting period. The Company has adopted a
    number of stock-based compensation plans as discussed below.

1998 Equity Incentive Plan.

In November 1998,
    the Company adopted the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 1998
    Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of non-qualified
    and incentive stock options, stock purchase awards and stock
    bonuses for employees and other service providers. The 1998 Plan
    terminates on November 11, 2008. Upon certain changes in
    control of the Company, all outstanding and unvested options or
    stock awards under the 1998 Plan will vest at the rate of 50%,
    unless assumed or substituted by the acquiring entity. During
    the fiscal year 2007, the Company issued no non-qualified and
    incentive stock options or stock purchase awards and issued
    119,630 stock bonuses to employees. During the fiscal year
    2008, the Company issued no stock options, stock purchase awards
    or stock bonuses under this plan. As of September 30, 2008,
    there were options to purchase 777,878 shares outstanding,

1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

In May
    1999, the board of directors approved the adoption of the 1999
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan. A total of 4,000,000 shares of common stock have been
    reserved for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
    The Employee Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to
    acquire shares of the Company’s common stock through
    periodic payroll deductions of up to 15% of base compensation.
    No employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock,
    determined at the fair market value of the shares at the time
    such option is granted, in one calendar year. The Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan has been implemented in a series of offering
    periods, each 6 months in duration. The price at which the
    common stock may be purchased is 85% of the lesser of the fair
    market value of the Company’s common stock on the first day
    of the applicable offering period or on the last day of the
    respective purchase period. As of September 30, 2008 there
    were 992,968 shares available for awards under the Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan.

2000 Equity Incentive Plan.

In July 2000, the

    bonuses for non-executive employees and other service providers.
    A total of 7,000,000 shares of common stock have been
    reserved for issuance under the 2000 Plan. Upon certain changes
    in control of the Company, all outstanding and unvested options
    or stock awards under the 2000 Plan will vest at the rate of
    50%, unless assumed or substituted by the acquiring entity. As
    of September 30, 2008, there were options to purchase
    618,554 shares outstanding and 154,347 shares
    available for awards under the 2000 Plan. The Company terminated
    the 2000 Plan effective November 1, 2008 and no additional
    shares may be issued from the 2000 Plan.

New Hire Incentive Plans.

In August 2004, the
    Company adopted a non-qualified stock option plan, or the
    Triebes Plan, in connection with the hiring of Karl Triebes, the
    Company’s Senior Vice President of Product Development and
    Chief Technology Officer. The Triebes Plan provided for a grant
    of 600,000 non-qualified stock options for Mr. Triebes. As
    of September 30, 2008, there were options to purchase
    113,000 shares outstanding and no shares available for
    awards under the Triebes Plan. Upon certain changes in control
    of the Company, 100% of all outstanding and unvested options
    remaining under the Triebes Plan will vest and become
    immediately exercisable.

Acquisition Incentive Plans.

In July 2003, the
    Company adopted the uRoam Acquisition Equity Incentive Plan, or

    bonuses. The Company has not granted any stock purchase awards

    Equity Incentive Plan, or the MagniFire Plan, in connection with
    the hiring of the former employees of MagniFire Websystems, Inc.

In August 2007, the Company adopted the 2007 Acopia Acquisition
    Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2007 Acopia Plan. The 2007 Acopia
    Plan provides for discretionary grants of non-statutory stock
    options and stock units for employees, directors and consultant
    of Acopia to whom the Company offers employment in connection
    with the Company’s acquisition of Acopia. A total of
    600,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for
    issuance under the 2007 Acopia Plan. Upon certain changes in
    control of the Company, the surviving entity will either assume
    or substitute all outstanding Stock Awards under the 2007 Acopia
    Plan. During the fiscal year 2008, the Company issued no stock
    options and 392,250 stock units under the 2007 Acopia Plan. As
    of September 30, 2008, there were no stock options
    outstanding and 207,750 shares available for awards under
    the 2007 Acopia Plan. The Company terminated the 2007 Acopia
    Plan effective November 1, 2008 and no additional shares
    may be issued from the 2007 Acopia Plan.

In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Acopia, the
    Company assumed the Acopia 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, or the
    Acopia Plan. Unvested options to acquire Acopia’s common
    stock were converted into options to acquire the Company’s
    common stock in connection with the acquisition. A total of
    2,230,703 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance
    under the Acopia Plan. The plan provides for discretionary
    grants of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted
    stock awards and other stock-based awards to persons who were
    employees, officers, directors, consultants or advisors to
    Acopia on or prior to September 12, 2007. During the fiscal

    Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of non-statutory
    stock options and stock units for employees, including officers,
    and other service providers. A total of 7,400,000 shares of
    common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2005
    Plan. Upon certain changes in control of the Company, the

    stock units under the 2005 Plan. As of September 30, 2008,
    there were options to purchase 60,000 shares outstanding

    restricted stock units were granted during fiscal 2008, 2007 and
    2006 with a per-share weighted average fair value of $30.47,
    $40.98 and $27.21, respectively. Restricted stock units were

Commitments

Operating
    Leases

The majority of the Company’s operating lease payments
    relate to the Company’s three building corporate
    headquarters in Seattle, Washington. The lease on the first and
    second buildings commenced in July and October of 2000. The
    lease for both buildings expires in 2012 and the second building
    has been partially subleased for the remaining term. The lease
    on the third building commenced in June 2008 and will expire in
    2018. The Company also leases additional office space for
    product development and sales and support personnel in the
    United States and internationally.

In October 2006, the Company entered into an office lease
    agreement to lease a total of approximately 137,000 square
    feet of office space in a building known as 333 Elliott West,
    which is adjacent to the three buildings that serve as our
    corporate headquarters. The lease expires in 2018. Construction
    on this project was substantially completed in the third quarter
    of fiscal year 2008. During 2008, the Company entered into two
    separate sublease agreements to sublease approximately
    112,500 square feet of building 333 Elliott West. These
    sublease terms expire in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

Purchase
    Obligations

Purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with
    our contract manufacturers. The agreement with our primary
    contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory
    on our behalf based on our production forecast. We are obligated

    procures in accordance with the forecast, unless cancellation is
    given within applicable lead times.

Litigation

Derivative Suits.

Beginning on or about
    May 24, 2006, several derivative actions were filed against
    certain current and former directors and officers of the
    Company. These derivative lawsuits were filed in: (1) the
    Superior Court of King County, Washington, as In re F5 Networks,

McAdam et al. (Case

and Easton v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1145RSL)(the

“Federal Court Derivative Litigation”). On
    August 2, 2007, another derivative lawsuit, Barone v.
    McAdam et al. (Case

No. C07-1200P),

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
    District of Washington. It is expected that this lawsuit will be
    consolidated with the other lawsuits pending in the
    U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.
    The complaints generally allege that certain of the
    Company’s current and former directors and officers,
    including, in general, each of the Company’s current
    outside directors (other than Deborah L. Bevier and Scott
    Thompson who joined the Company’s Board of Directors in
    July 2006 and January 2008, respectively) breached their
    fiduciary duties to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful
    conduct concerning the manipulation of certain stock option
    grant dates. The Company is named solely as a nominal defendant
    against whom the plaintiffs seek no recovery. The Company’s
    combined motion to consolidate and stay the State Court
    Derivative Litigation was granted in a court order dated
    April 3, 2007. The Company’s motion to dismiss the
    consolidated federal derivative actions based on
    plaintiffs’ failure to make demand on the Company’s
    Board of Directors prior to filing suit was granted in a court
    order dated August 6, 2007 with leave to amend the
    allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint. Plaintiffs filed an
    amended consolidated federal derivative action complaint on
    September 14, 2007. The Company filed a motion to dismiss
    the amended complaint based on plaintiff’s failure to make
    demand on the Company’s Board of Directors prior to filing
    suit. On July 3, 2008, before ruling on the Company’s
    pending dismissal motion, the federal court entered an order
    certifying certain issues of Washington state law to the
    Washington Supreme Court for resolution. Briefing the Washington
    Supreme Court on the certified issues began on
    September 15, 2008 and the hearing is currently set for
    March 24, 2009. The federal derivative actions are stayed
    pending resolution of the certification proceeding. The Company
    intends to continue to vigorously pursue dismissal of the
    derivative actions.

SEC and Department of Justice Inquiries.

In
    May 2006, the Company received notice from both the SEC and the
    Department of Justice that they were conducting informal
    inquiries into the Company’s historical stock option
    practices. The Company has fully cooperated with both agencies.
    Considerable legal and accounting expenses related to our
    historical stock option practices have been incurred to date.
    The Company may in the future be subject to additional
    regulatory proceedings or actions arising in relation to its
    historical stock option practices and the restatement of its
    prior period financial statements. Although regulatory
    proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, the Company
    does not believe the results of any pending actions will,
    individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact
    its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

The Company is not aware of any additional pending legal
    proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
    operating results, or financial condition. The Company may in
    the future be party to litigation arising in the ordinary course
    of business, including claims that we allegedly infringe upon
    third-party trademarks or other intellectual property rights.
    Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the
    expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.

Facility
    Exit and Sublease Agreements

During fiscal year 2008, the Company exited a research and
    development facility in Bellevue, Washington for which it has
    remaining operating lease obligations through 2014. In addition,
    the Company consolidated its corporate headquarters, partially
    subleasing the building located at 333 Elliott Avenue West in
    Seattle, Washington for which it has remaining operating lease
    obligations through 2018. As a result of the expected loss on

Geographic
    Sales and Significant Customers

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
    for which separate financial information is available and
    evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or
    decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and
    in assessing performance. For fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    the Company was organized as, and operated in, one reportable
    segment: the development, marketing and sale of application
    delivery networking products that optimize the security,
    performance & availability of network applications,
    servers and storage systems. The Company manages its business
    based on four geographic regions: the Americas (primarily the
    United States); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA);
    Japan; and the Asia Pacific region (APAC). The Company’s
    chief operating decision-making group reviews financial
    information presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by
    information about revenues by geographic region. The
    Company’s foreign offices conduct sales, marketing and
    support activities. Management evaluates performance based
    primarily on revenues in the geographic locations in which the
    Company operates. Revenues are attributed by geographic location
    based on the location of the customer. The Company’s assets
    are primarily located in the United States and not allocated to
    any specific region. Therefore, geographic information is
    presented only for net product revenue.

The following presents revenues by geographic region (in

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that
    required information is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the required timeframe, as specified in the
    rules set forth by the Securities Exchange Commission. Our
    disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
    that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and
    communicated to management, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosures.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, evaluated the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
    September 30, 2008 and, based on this evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer have concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
    September 30, 2008.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
    absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
    because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over
    financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence
    and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and
    breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over
    financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or
    improper management override. Because of such limitations, there
    is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or
    detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
    reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known
    features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is
    possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
    not eliminate, this risk.

Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    September 30, 2008. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control
    — Integrated Framework

. Based on the results of
    this assessment and on those criteria, management concluded that
    our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
    of September 30, 2008.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of September 30, 2008 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
    herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During the fourth fiscal quarter, there were no changes to our
    internal control over financial reporting that materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal controls over financial reporting.
