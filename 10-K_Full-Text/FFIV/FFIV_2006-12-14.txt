Item 1.

Business

General

F5 Networks, Inc. is a leading provider of application delivery
    networking products that improve the performance, availability
    and security of applications running on networks that use the
    Internet Protocol (IP). IP traffic between servers running
    applications and clients using those applications passes through
    our products where the content is inspected and modified to
    ensure that it is delivered securely and in a way that optimizes
    the performance and availability of both the network and the
    applications.

Our BIG-IP products help manage IP traffic between network
    servers, clients and other devices in a way that maximizes the
    availability, scalability and throughput of those network
    components and the applications that run on them. Our
    complementary FirePass SSL VPN products let enterprises provide
    authorized users connected to the Internet with secure remote
    access to their corporate networks and applications by
    leveraging standard Web browser technology. Our Application
    Security Manager (formerly called TrafficShield) application
    firewall provides content-based, application-level security
    against malicious attacks that network firewalls and other
    security devices can’t prevent. Our WANJet and
    WebAccelerator products optimize the flow of traffic over Wide
    Area Networks, or WANs, to enhance the performance and
    availability of applications for remote users. Our BIG-IP
    products share a common full-proxy operating system, TMOS, or
    Traffic Management Operating System, that enables them to
    inspect and modify traffic flows to and from servers and has
    built-in functionality to secure, optimize and ensure the
    availability of application traffic. iRules, a unique feature of
    TMOS, is a scripting language based on TCL (Tools Command
    Language), that enables customers and third parties to write
    customized rules to inspect and modify traffic. Our application
    delivery networking products that are integrated on the TMOS
    platform also share a common software interface called iControl,
    which enables them to communicate with one another and allows
    them to be integrated with third party products, including
    custom and commercial enterprise applications.

During the past year, we have continued to execute on our
    strategy to migrate all of our products onto the TMOS platform.
    Early in calendar 2006, we introduced new versions of our legacy
    Link Controller and Global Traffic Management products on TMOS
    and a TMOS-based version of TrafficShield, called Application
    Security Manager. In July, we announced that the WebAccelerator
    product would also be available as a module on TMOS as part of
    our 9.4 release.

The flexibility of our software-based technology, the powerful
    capabilities of iRules and iControl, the breadth of features and
    functions available on our products, and the integration of
    those features and functions on TMOS are characteristics that we
    believe differentiate our products from other application
    delivery networking products. These characteristics enable us to
    provide comprehensive solutions that address the core
    requirements of

IP-based

networks and business applications, including high availability,
    high performance, intelligent traffic management, streamlined
    manageability, bandwidth optimization, remote access to
    corporate



networks, and network and application security. In connection
    with our products, we offer a broad range of services including
    consulting, training, installation, maintenance and other
    technical support services.

Industry
    Background

Internet Protocol (IP) is a communications language used to
    transmit data over the Internet. Since the late 1990s,
    businesses have responded to the power, flexibility and economy
    of the Internet by deploying new

IP-based

applications, upgrading their client-server applications to new

IP-enabled

versions, and enabling existing or legacy applications for use
    over the Internet. Over the next several years, we believe this
    process will accelerate as more and more organizations discover
    the benefits of deploying

IP-enabled

applications and new technologies continue to enhance the
    performance, reliability and security of both applications and
    IP networks. In addition, we believe the growth of Internet
    usage will continue to be driven by new applications such as Web
    Services and Voice over IP, the growth of broadband Internet
    access, remote use of applications, and the increasing
    popularity of mobile Internet access through wireless devices
    such as cellular telephones, PDAs and notebook computers.

Internet
    Architecture

IP requires all data transmitted across the Internet to be
    divided into packets at the source and reassembled at the
    destination. The Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) Reference Model
    is the framework that divides network functions into seven
    layers and specifies how the layers should interact to enable
    all of a network’s different hardware and software
    components to work together to accomplish this process. Prior to
    transmission, each packet of data is automatically given a
    header that identifies the source and destination of the packet.
    This header information is used in the OSI Model for the
    purposes of identifying, routing and sequencing data packets,
    and is stripped from the data upon arrival at its destination.
    Layers 2-4 of the OSI Model perform standardized, repetitive
    tasks such as ensuring that packets of information sent over the
    Internet arrive at the destination to which they are addressed
    and are reassembled in the correct sequence. Consequently, most
    Layer 2-4 switches are hardware-based devices that use
    application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and are
    optimized for speed. Unlike Layers 2-4, Layer 7, which in
    practice includes the functions ascribed to Layers 5 and 6 in
    the OSI model, is complex and variable and must support end-user
    applications and processes on a wide variety of platforms and
    devices. While most Layer 4 switches rely on hardware-based
    architectures to maximize throughput, the demands of processing
    data at Layer 7 increasingly require flexibility and
    adaptability that can be achieved only through a software-based
    solution. The challenge in building highly flexible,
    function-rich, software-based switches for application delivery
    networking is to deliver these capabilities at speeds that do
    not slow the speed of network traffic.

Application
    Delivery Networking

As more applications are

IP-enabled,

there is growing demand for Layer 7 technology that can read the
    entire contents or flow of data in a packetized transmission and
    make intelligent decisions based on a dynamic set of business
    rules about how to handle the transmission to make the
    applications, network, and servers



always secure, fast, and available. Basic Layer 7 functions
    include load-balancing (distributing traffic across multiple
    servers while making them appear to be a single server), and
    health-checking (monitoring the performance of servers and
    applications to ensure that they are working properly before
    routing traffic to them). In addition, Layer 7 processing
    encompasses a growing number of functions that have typically
    been performed by the server or the application itself, or by
    point solutions running on separate devices. This category
    includes a growing number of functions, such as the following:

•

SSL Acceleration — using Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
    encryption to secure traffic between the server and the browser
    on an end user’s client device;

•

Rate Shaping — prioritizing transmissions according to
    preset rules that give precedence to different types of traffic;

•

Compression — reducing the volume of data transmitted
    to take maximum advantage of available bandwidth;

•

TCP Optimization — improving server efficiency by
    maintaining an open connection with a server during interactive
    sessions;

•

IPv6 Translation — enabling communication and
    interoperability between networked devices using IPv6, the
    newest version of the Internet Protocol, and those using the
    older version IPv4;

•

Application Security —  protecting critical web
    applications from attacks such as Google hacking, cross-site
    scripting, and parameter tampering;

•

Web Acceleration — enhancing the performance of web
    applications over wide area networks by reducing latency,
    eliminating errors, and resolving other issues that slow
    delivery;

•

WAN Optimization — improving the performance of
    applications accessed over wide area network links by reducing
    the number of round trips required and ensuring maximum use of
    available bandwidth.

•

Global Traffic Management — ensuring high
    availability, maximum performance and global management for
    applications running across multiple, globally-dispersed data
    centers;

•

Link Load Balancing — monitoring availability and
    performance of multiple WAN connections and intelligently
    managing bi-directional traffic flows to ensure uninterrupted,
    optimized Internet access.

In addition to optimizing the performance and availability of
    their networks and applications, enterprises face the
    increasingly complex challenge of providing security for
    applications and data that are accessible over their IP
    networks. Layer 7 or application level security includes three
    basic components: providing employees, partners and customers
    with secure access to corporate applications; ensuring that
    access is limited to those applications for which a user is
    specifically authorized; and protecting the integrity of
    applications and data.

Currently, the most widespread solution for secure remote access
    is technology that uses the IP Security (IPSec) Protocol to
    establish a secure virtual private network (VPN) between a
    remote device, such as a user’s home PC or a laptop, and
    the corporate network. Although an IPSec VPN tunnel is very
    secure, it has a number of drawbacks. One is that IPSec requires
    the remote device to have special software installed on it, and
    maintaining the most current version of this software on all
    user devices is time-consuming and costly. A more serious issue
    is that once IPSec establishes a connection between a user and
    the corporate network, the user has full access to any
    application in the network, and the only way to prevent
    unauthorized use is to secure each application or physically
    segment the network. As an alternative to using IPSec VPNs for
    remote access, technology that employs SSL encryption to
    establish a secure VPN has emerged and is making inroads in the
    market. Because this technology relies on the SSL capabilities
    resident in any standard Web browser, it is not necessary to
    install additional software on the remote device. This makes it
    possible to access the network from a cell phone, PDA, kiosk,
    laptop, PC, or any other device with a standard browser. In
    addition, SSL VPN technology supports the creation of separate
    VPN tunnels to each application for which a user is authorized.
    This allows enterprises to exercise more control over who can
    gain access to various parts of the network and to specific
    applications.



Along with the need to provide secure connectivity between users
    and applications, enterprises face an immediate and growing need
    to protect applications and other data center resources from
    application-level security threats that pass through
    conventional firewalls and slip past intrusion detection and
    prevention (IDS and IPS) devices. The solution to this problem
    requires a “positive” security model that contrasts
    with the “negative” security model used by IDS and IPS
    devices. In a negative security model, incoming traffic is
    checked against a list of signatures for known worms, viruses
    and other security threats, and if no match is found the traffic
    is allowed to pass. In a positive security model, incoming
    traffic is checked against a set of rules that define what
    specific elements are permissible in traffic headed for a
    particular application and rejects traffic containing anything
    that does not conform to the rules.

Although products that incorporate a positive security model
    have been around for many years, they have been inherently slow
    and this has limited their use to enterprises that have
    historically placed a high priority on security. Now that
    application-level attacks threaten to paralyze global business,
    there is growing demand among enterprises for application
    security that can ward off these attacks. The challenge is to
    deliver products that apply a positive security model to
    application traffic without slowing network performance.

Within the past several years, the challenge of delivering
    optimum application performance has grown in scope and
    complexity with the increasing deployment of applications over
    wide area networks. This trend has been fueled by the
    availability of cheap bandwidth which has enabled enterprises to
    consolidate information technology resources in centralized data
    centers. Since the majority of applications are optimized for
    delivery over local area networks, enterprises face enormous and
    increasing difficulties in delivering those applications to
    remote sites in disparate and often far-flung locations.
    Regardless how much bandwidth is available, application
    performance over WANs is affected by many factors, associated
    with both network and application logic, that must be addressed
    in order to achieve satisfactory application performance. At the
    network level, application performance is limited by high
    latency (the effect of physical distance), jitter, packet loss,
    and congestion. At the application level, performance is further
    limited by natural behavior of application protocols (especially
    when faced with latency, jitter, packet loss, and congestion at
    the network level), application protocols that engage in
    excessive handshaking across the network links (often referred
    to as “chattiness”), and the serialization of the
    applications themselves. To overcome these problems, WAN
    optimization solutions combine a number of functions including
    compression, caching and other specialized techniques to reduce
    the amount of data transmitted, eliminate protocol chattiness,
    and streamline application performance across WANs.

Since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not
    thousands — of servers and applications, it is not
    practical to build functions that optimize the performance,
    availability and security of applications into the applications
    themselves. Even if it were, maintenance costs would be
    prohibitive and the net result would be a negative impact on the
    overall performance of servers and applications. Deploying point
    solutions in the network eliminates those problems but creates a
    new set of challenges. Using point solutions from multiple
    vendors can create interoperability issues, and problems that do
    occur can be difficult to troubleshoot. From a security
    standpoint, it is also much more difficult to audit traffic
    passing through multiple devices. As a result, enterprise
    customers are demanding products that integrate the growing
    number of Layer 7 application traffic management and security
    functions on a single platform. In the past, we have referred to
    these functions collectively as “application traffic
    management.” However, as the scope and complexity of
    functions performed at Layer 7 has increased, we believe the
    term “application delivery networking” is more apt to
    describe the components of our addressable market, which include
    application security, application optimization and application
    availability.

The F5
    Solution

We are a leading provider of application delivery networking
    products that ensure the security, optimization and availability
    of applications for any user, anywhere. We believe our products
    offer the most intelligent architecture and advanced
    functionality in the marketplace along with performance,
    flexibility and usability features that help organizations
    improve the way they serve their employees, customers, and
    partners while lowering operational costs.



Software Based Products.

From inception, we
    have been committed to the belief that the complexity of Layer 7
    application delivery networking requires a software-based rather
    than a hardware-based solution. We believe our modular software
    architecture enables us to deliver the broadest range of
    integrated functionality in the market and facilitates the
    addition and integration of new functionality. We also believe
    that integrating our software with commodity hardware components
    enables us to build products that deliver superior performance,
    functionality and flexibility at competitive prices.

Full Proxy Architecture.

The core of our
    software technology is the Traffic Management Operating System
    (TMOS) introduced in September 2004 as part of BIG-IP version 9.
    We believe this is a major enhancement of our previous
    technology that enables our products to deliver functionality
    that is superior on many levels to any other application
    delivery networking product in the market. With TMOS, our
    products can inspect, modify and direct both inbound and
    outbound traffic flows across multiple packets. This ability to
    manage application traffic to and from servers adds value to
    applications that pass through our devices in ways that are not
    possible with other application delivery networking solutions.

Modular Functionality.

In addition to its full
    proxy architecture, TMOS is specifically designed to facilitate
    the development and integration of application delivery
    networking functions as modules that can be added to
    BIG-IP’s core functionality to keep pace with rapidly
    evolving customer needs. Add-on modules currently available with
    BIG-IP version 9 include: Intelligent Compression; SSL
    Acceleration; Layer 7 Rate Shaping; Advanced Client
    Authentication; IPv6 Gateway; Caching; and others. Within the
    past year, we also began shipping Application Security Manager
    (ASM), Global Traffic Manager, Link Controller, and
    WebAccelerator as software modules on BIG-IP.

Application Awareness.

The open architecture
    of TMOS includes an application programming interface (API)
    called iControl that allows our products to communicate with one
    another and with third-party software and devices. Through this
    unique feature, third-party applications and network devices can
    take an active role in shaping IP network traffic, directing
    traffic based on exact business requirements defined by our
    customers and solutions partners and tailored to specific
    applications. This “application awareness” capability
    is one of the most important features of our software-based
    products and further differentiates our solutions from those of
    our competitors.

Adaptive Intelligence.

The full-proxy
    capabilities of TMOS enable it to inspect or “read”
    the entire contents of a transmission across multiple packets
    and identify specific elements of that transmission, including
    items such as names, dates, and any type of number or label.
    Using our industry standard Tool Command Language (TCL)
    scripting capability, customers can use those elements as
    variables to create iRules that modify the content and direct
    the flow of traffic in ways tailored to the dynamic needs of
    their applications. iRules is a unique feature of TMOS that
    gives our products flexibility unmatched by competing products.

Integrated Layer 7 Solutions.

The combination
    of our full proxy architecture and enhanced iRules enables
    BIG-IP to intercept, inspect and act on the contents of traffic
    from virtually every type of

IP-enabled

application. In addition, the modularity of the TMOS
    architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions
    that secure, optimize and ensure the availability of
    applications and the networks they run on.

Strategy

Our objective is to lead the industry in delivering the enabling
    architecture that integrates the network with the applications.
    This allows organizations to significantly improve costly and
    time consuming business processes and provide new sources of
    revenue through highly differentiated offerings. Key components
    of our strategy include:

Offering a complete, integrated application delivery product
    suite that includes application security and WAN optimization.
    In line with this strategy, we have already introduced
    TMOS-based versions of our own legacy products (GTM and Link
    Controller) and products we acquired (Application Security
    Manager and WebAccelerator). We are currently developing
    TMOS-based versions of WANJet and FirePass, and within the next
    year we expect to begin offering TMOS-based versions of
    third-party products. We believe this approach



will continue to differentiate our products and provide
    customers with the broadest possible set of integrated
    application delivery networking solutions.

Investing in technology to continue to meet customer needs. We
    will continue to invest in research and development to provide
    our customers with comprehensive, integrated application
    delivery networking solutions. Our product development efforts
    will continue to leverage the unique attributes of our
    software-based platforms to deliver new features and functions
    that address the complex and changing needs of our customers. We
    will continue to use commodity hardware in order to ensure
    performance and cost competitiveness.

Enhancing the existing channel model. We are investing
    significant resources in order to further develop our indirect
    sales channels. We plan to expand our indirect sales channels
    through leading industry resellers, systems integrators,
    Internet service providers and other channel partners. We are
    also recruiting new channel partners and leveraging our existing
    channels to sell our security and WAN optimization products.

Continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic
    iControl partners. We plan to capitalize on our strategic
    relationships with enterprise software vendors who have created
    interfaces to our products through our iControl application
    programming interface. These vendors provide us significant
    leverage in the selling process, because they recommend our
    products to their customers. In order to differentiate ourselves
    further from our competitors we plan to explore opportunities to
    further embed iControl into existing and new third party
    products and to jointly market and sell our solutions to
    enterprise customers with these key partners.

Leveraging DevCentral, our online community of network
    architects and developers, to promote the use of iRules among
    customers and third-party developers. Customization of our
    products using iRules enhances their “stickiness” by
    allowing customers to solve problems in both their applications
    and their networks that would be difficult if not impossible to
    solve by other means.

Enhancing our brand. We plan to continue building brand
    awareness that positions us as one of the leading providers of
    application delivery networking solutions. Our goal is to make
    the F5 brand synonymous with superior technology, high-quality
    customer service and ease of use.

Products

Our core technology is software for application delivery
    networking, including application security, secure remote
    access, and WAN optimization. Our products are systems that
    integrate our software with hardware that is built using a
    combination of commodity components and our own custom ASIC for
    Layer 4 processing. Our flagship product is BIG-IP, which
    comprises a family of systems that support a growing number of
    features and functions — including GTM, Link
    Controller, ASM (TrafficShield) and WebAccelerator —
    as software modules. We also sell FirePass, ASM (TrafficShield),
    WANJet and WebAccelerator as separate, stand-alone appliances.

BIG-IP

Products in our family of BIG-IP application switches differ
    primarily in the hardware configurations that make up each
    system. Our current BIG-IP systems include five hardware
    platforms: high-end (BIG-IP 8400, 6800 and 6400), mid-range
    (BIG-IP 3400), and an entry-level (BIG-IP 1500). Each system
    uses one or more CPUs for Layer 7 processing, and all but the
    entry-level systems come equipped with our own proprietary
    Packet Velocity ASIC for high-performance Layer 4 processing, a
    commodity Layer 2-3 switch for connectivity, and commodity ASICs
    for SSL encryption and decryption and for compression. In
    addition to local area traffic management, which is standard on
    every system, BIG-IP supports a growing number of add-on
    software products and features. Software products currently
    available on BIG-IP include GTM, Link Controller, ASM, and
    WebAccelerator. Available features include intelligent
    compression, L7 rate shaping, iPv6 gateway, advanced client
    authentication, SSL acceleration, advanced routing and fast
    caching.



FirePass

FirePass appliances provide SSL VPN access for remote users of
    IP networks and any applications connected to those networks
    from any standard Web browser on any device. The components of
    FirePass include a dynamic policy engine, which manages user
    authentication and authorization privileges, and special
    components that enable corporations to give remote users
    controlled access to the full array of applications and
    resources within the network.

Currently, we sell two FirePass products. The FirePass 1200
    Controller is a 1U rack-mount server, designed for small to
    medium enterprise locations, that supports up to 100 concurrent
    users. The FirePass 4100 Controller is a 2U rack-mount server,
    designed for large enterprise locations, that supports up to
    2,000 concurrent users.

Application
    Security Manager (TrafficShield)

Application Security Manager is a Web application firewall that
    provides comprehensive, proactive, application-layer protection
    against both generalized and targeted attacks. ASM employs a
    positive security model (‘deny all unless allowed’) to
    permit only valid and authorized application transactions. As a
    result, ASM can prevent “day-zero” attacks and other
    types of security threats that pass through traditional
    firewalls and signature-based devices such as intrusion
    detection and intrusion prevention systems. ASM is available as
    both a stand-alone system and as an add-on software module for
    our BIG-IP product family.

WANJet

WANJet combines WAN optimization and traffic-shaping in a single
    device to accelerate file transfers, email, data replication,
    and other applications over IP networks. It provides LAN-like
    performance on any WAN, ensuring predictable application
    performance for all users, and encrypts and secures all
    transfers without performance penalties. WANJet is deployed as a
    dual-sided (symmetric) solution that optimizes application
    traffic to and from data centers and branch offices.

The WANJet 400 for data centers features fault tolerance and
    scalability for up to 14,000 optimized connections. For branch
    offices, the WANJet 200 combines fault tolerant features, silent
    operation and performance for up to 1,000 optimized connections.

WebAccelerator

WebAccelerator speeds web transactions by optimizing individual
    network object requests, connections, and

end-to-end

transactions from the browser through to databases.
    WebAccelerator enhances web application performance from any
    location, speeding up interactive performance, improving
    download times, utilizing bandwidth more efficiently, and
    dramatically reducing the cost and response time of delivering
    Web-enabled applications to distributed users where it is not
    possible to deploy an end point device like WANJet.

The WebAccelerator software, acquired with our purchase of Swan
    Labs, Inc. (“Swan Labs”) has been ported to TMOS and
    is available on stand-alone systems or as a software module on
    BIG-IP.

Enabling
    Technologies

iControl is an application programming interface that allows
    customers and independent software vendors to modify their
    programs to communicate with our products, eliminating the need
    for human involvement, lowering the cost of performing basic
    network functions and reducing the likelihood of error. Although
    we do not derive revenue from iControl itself, the sale of
    iControl-enabled applications by independent software vendors
    such as Microsoft and Oracle helps promote and often leads
    directly to the sale of our other products.

Enterprise Manager, which is designed to facilitate the broader
    use of our products, takes advantage of iControl to provide a
    single, centralized management and operational interface for our
    devices. This feature allows customers with dozens or hundreds
    of our products to upgrade or modify the software on those
    products simultaneously from a single console. This lowers the
    cost and simplifies the task of deploying,



managing and maintaining our products and reduces the likelihood
    of error when blanket changes are implemented.

Product
    Development

We believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain
    technology leadership by constantly improving our products and
    by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our
    customers. Our product development group employs a standard
    process for the development, documentation and quality control
    of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals.
    This process includes working with management, product
    management, customers and partners to identify new or improved
    solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable
    markets.

Our principal software engineering group is located in our
    headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Our core product
    development teams for FirePass, WANJet and WebAccelerator are
    located in San Jose, California. There is also a smaller
    development facility for WANJet and WebAccelerator in Belfast,
    Northern Ireland. Our core Application Security Manager
    (TrafficShield) product development team is located in Tel Aviv,
    Israel. Our hardware engineering group is located in Spokane,
    Washington. In addition, we maintain a dedicated facility for
    product testing and quality control in Tomsk, Russia. Members of
    all these teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure
    the interoperability and performance of our hardware and
    software systems.

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and
    2004, we had research and product development expenses of
    $49.2 million, $31.5 million and $24.4 million,
    respectively.

Customers

Our customers include a wide variety of enterprise customers
    (Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global 1000 companies)
    including those in telecommunications, financial services,
    technology, manufacturing, transportation and government. In
    fiscal year 2006, international sales represented 42.6% of our
    net revenues. Refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic
    area.

Sales and
    Marketing

Sales

We sell our products and services to large enterprise customers
    and service providers through a variety of channels, including
    distributors, value-added resellers and systems integrators. A
    substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2006 was
    derived from these channel sales. Our sales teams work closely
    with our channel partners and sell our products and services
    directly to a limited number of major accounts.

F5 sales teams.

Our inside sales team
    generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and
    helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field
    and internal corporate resources. Our field sales personnel are
    located in major cities in four sales regions: the Americas;
    Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia
    Pacific region (APAC). Field sales personnel work closely with
    our channel partners to assist them, as necessary, in the sale
    of our products and services to their customers. We also sell
    our products and services directly to a limited group of
    customers, primarily large enterprises, whose accounts are
    managed by our major account services team. Field systems
    engineers support our regional sales managers and channel
    partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing
    pre-sale technical resources as needed.

Distributors and value-added
    resellerss.

Consistent with our goal of building
    a strong channel sales model, we have established relationships
    with large national and international distributors, local and
    specialized distributors and value-added resellers from which we
    derive the majority of our sales. The distributors sell our
    products, and the value-added resellers not only sell our
    products, but also assist their customers in network design,
    installation and testing. Our agreements with our channel
    partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling
    competitive products. These agreements typically have terms



of one year with no obligation to renew, and typically do not
    provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase
    requirements.

For fiscal year 2006, sales to two of our distributors, Ingram
    Micro, Inc., and GE Access, represented 13.59% and 11.57% of our
    total revenues respectively. Our agreements with these
    distributors are standard, non-exclusive distribution agreements
    that renew automatically on an annual basis and are terminable
    by either party with 30 days’ prior written notice.
    The agreements grant Ingram Micro and GE Access the right to
    distribute our products to resellers in North America and
    certain other territories internationally, with no minimum
    purchase requirements.

Systems integrators.

We also market our
    products through strategic relationships with systems
    integrators, who include our products as core components of
    application or network-based solutions they deploy for their
    customers. In most cases, systems integrators do not directly
    purchase our products for resale to their customers. Instead
    they typically recommend our products as part of broader
    solutions, such as enterprise resource platform (ERP) or
    customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, that
    incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced
    performance.

Marketing

There are three primary aspects to our marketing strategy.
    First, we believe our future success depends on our ability to
    understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable
    markets and to develop valuable solutions that address those
    needs. Our marketing organization works directly with customers,
    partners and our product development teams to identify and
    create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership
    position. The second aspect is to continue to build upon our
    iControl strategy. We have established relationships with
    various independent software vendors who have adapted their
    applications to interact with our products via the iControl
    interface. iControl enhances the functionality of third party
    applications by enabling them to control the network in an
    automated way, based on business policies and rules associated
    with the application. As a result, customers who purchase
    iControl-enabled applications have an incentive to purchase our
    products in order to take advantage of the enhanced
    functionality made possible through our technical cooperation.
    Third, we offer an on-line community website called DevCentral
    that provides technical resources to customers, prospects and
    partners wanting to extend and optimize F5 solutions using
    iRules. A key aspect of DevCentral is an on-line forum where
    developers as well as application and network architects discuss
    and share solutions they have written with iRules. At the end of
    fiscal 2006, DevCentral had more than 11,500 registered members.

We also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives
    aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of
    our technology and products. These include actively
    participating in industry trade shows and briefing industry
    analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products,
    and on new business and technology partnerships. In addition, we
    market our products to chief information officers and other
    information technology professionals through targeted
    advertising, direct mail and high-profile Web events.

Backlog

At the end of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we had product backlog
    of approximately $12.3 million and $11.7 million,
    respectively. Backlog represents orders confirmed with a
    purchase order for products to be shipped generally within
    90 days to customers with approved credit status. Orders
    are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers or
    product specification changes by the customers. Although we
    believe that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be
    cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant
    penalty. For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at
    any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues.

Customer
    Service and Technical Support

We believe that our ability to provide consistent, high-quality
    customer service and technical support is a key factor in
    attracting and retaining large enterprise customers. Accordingly
    we offer a broad range of support



services that include installation, phone support, hardware
    repair and replacement, software updates, consulting and
    training services. We deliver these services directly to end
    users and also utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging
    the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable. Our
    technical support staff is strategically located in regional
    service centers to support our global customer base.

Prior to the installation of our products, our services
    personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and
    determine the best way to deploy our products and configure
    product features and functions to meet those needs. Our services
    personnel also provide

on-site

installation and training services to help customers make
    optimal use of product features and functions.

Our customers typically purchase a one-year maintenance contract
    which entitles them to an array of services provided by our
    technical support team. Maintenance services provided under the
    contract include online updates, software error correction
    releases, hardware repair and replacement, and remote support
    through a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week help desk,
    although not all service contracts entitle a customer to

round-the-clock

call center support. Updates to our software are only available
    to customers with a current maintenance contract. Our technical
    support team also offers seminars and training classes for
    customers on the configuration and use of products, including
    local and wide area network system administration and
    management. In addition, we have a professional services team
    able to provide a full range of fee-based consulting services,
    including comprehensive network management, documentation and
    performance analysis, and capacity planning to assist in
    predicting future network requirements.

We also offer, as part of our maintenance service, an online,
    automated, self-help customer support function called Ask F5
    that allows customers to answer many commonly asked questions
    without having to call our support desk. This allows the
    customer to rapidly address issues and questions, while
    significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk.
    This enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while
    keeping our support-related expenses at a manageable, consistent
    level.

Manufacturing

We outsource the manufacturing of our pre-configured hardware
    platforms to contract manufacturer Solectron Corporation for
    assembly according to our specifications. Solectron installs our
    software onto the hardware platforms and conducts functionality
    testing, quality assurance and documentation control prior to
    shipping our products. Our agreement with Solectron allows them
    to procure component inventory on our behalf based upon a
    rolling production forecast. Subcontractors supply Solectron
    with standard parts and components for our products based on our
    production forecast. We are contractually obligated to purchase
    component inventory that our contract manufacturer procures in
    accordance with the forecast, unless we give notice of order
    cancellation in advance of applicable lead times. As protection
    against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for
    our service teams, we also stock limited supplies of certain key
    components for our products.

Hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of
    commodity parts and certain custom components designed and
    approved by our hardware engineering group. Most of our
    components are purchased from sources which we believe are
    readily available from other suppliers. However, several
    components used in the assembly of our products are purchased
    from single or limited sources such as our proprietary Packet
    Velocity ASIC for Layer 4 processing that is manufactured for us
    by a third-party contract semiconductor foundry.

Competition

The increasing breadth of our product offerings has enabled us
    to address a growing array of opportunities, many of which are
    outside the bounds of the traditional Layer 4-7 market. Within
    what Gartner Group calls the Application Acceleration market, we
    compete in the Application Delivery Controller (ADC) market,
    which encompasses the traditional Layer 4-7 market, and the WAN
    Optimization Controller market. Over the next year or two, we
    believe these two market segments will merge as WANJet is ported
    to TMOS and WAN optimization effectively becomes a feature of
    Application Delivery. With ASM available as a software module on
    BIG-IP and our intention to port FirePass to TMOS within the
    next 12 months, these products will also



become and be viewed as components of our overall Application
    Delivery solution. For the immediate future, however, these
    market segments will continue to be viewed as discrete markets.

In 2006, approximately 90 percent of our products and
    services were sold into the Application Delivery market where
    our primary competitor is Cisco Systems, Inc. Other competitors
    in this market include Nortel Networks Corporation, Juniper
    Networks, Inc., Citrix Systems, Inc., Foundry Networks, Inc. and
    Radware Ltd.

In the adjacent WAN Optimization market, WANJet competes mainly
    with Riverbed Technology, Inc., Juniper, Packeteer, Inc., and to
    a lesser extent Cisco and Citrix. None of our competitors offer
    an integrated product with advanced features comparable to
    WebAccelerator.

In the SSL VPN market, we compete with Juniper, Citrix, Aventail
    Corporation, Nokia, Nortel, and Symantec and a number of smaller
    players. Because SSL VPNs are a potential replacement for IPSec
    VPNs, the most widely deployed solution for secure remote access
    today, we also compete with Check Point Software Technologies,
    Ltd. Which, along with Juniper, are the market leaders in IPSec
    VPNs.

Application firewalls represent an emerging market that is
    populated mainly by private, early-development-stage companies.
    Other companies that have acquired products similar to
    Application Security Manager (TrafficShield) include Citrix
    Systems. None of our competitors offers a high-performance
    product similar to our Application Security Module, which is
    tightly integrated with our application delivery products.

Some of our competitors have a longer operating history and
    greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than
    we do. These larger competitors also have a more extensive
    customer base and broader customer relationships, including
    relationships with many of our current and potential customers.
    In addition, many have large, well-established, worldwide
    customer support and professional services organizations and a
    more extensive direct sales force and sales channels. Because of
    our relatively smaller size, market presence and resources, our
    larger competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we
    can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
    requirements. There is also the possibility that these companies
    may adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share. As a
    result, our competitors could undermine our ability to win new
    customers and maintain our existing customer base.

Intellectual
    Property

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
    trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our
    intellectual property rights. We have obtained three patents in
    the United States and have applications pending for various
    aspects of our technology. Our future success depends in part on
    our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the
    technologies used in our principal products. Despite our efforts
    to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may
    attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use
    trade secrets or other information that we regard as
    proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do
    not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of
    the United States. We cannot assure you that any issued patent
    will preserve our proprietary position, or that competitors or
    others will not develop technologies similar to or superior to
    our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect our
    intellectual property rights could harm our business, operating
    results and financial condition.

In addition to our own proprietary software, we incorporate
    software licensed from several third-party sources into our
    products. These licenses generally renew automatically on an
    annual basis. We believe that alternative technologies for this
    licensed software are available both domestically and
    internationally.

Employees

As of September 30, 2006, we employed 1,068 full-time
    persons, including 287 in product development, 442 in sales and
    marketing, 205 in professional services and technical support
    and 134 in finance, administration and operations. None of our
    employees are represented by a labor union. We have experienced
    no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are
    good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

In addition to the other information in this report, the
    following risk factors should be carefully considered in
    evaluating our company and its business.

Our
    success depends on our timely development of new products and
    features, market acceptance of new product offerings and proper
    management of the timing of the life cycle of our
    products

We expect the application delivery networking market to be
    characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new
    product introductions, changes in customer requirements and
    evolving industry standards. Our continued success depends on
    our ability to identify and develop new products and new
    features for our existing products to meet the demands of these
    changes, and for those products and features to be accepted by
    our existing and target customers. If we are unable to identify,
    develop, and deploy new products and new product features on a
    timely basis, our business and results of operations may be
    harmed.

In September 2004, we announced the release of our
    next-generation BIG-IP product featuring the Traffic Management
    Operating System, or TMOS. This major new version of BIG-IP
    represented the culmination of over two years of research and
    development efforts. TMOS is specifically designed to facilitate
    the development and integration of application delivery
    functions as modules that can be added to BIG-IP’s core
    functionality to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer needs.
    We currently offer software modules as add-ons for this product
    and our continued success depends significantly on our ability
    to integrate new modules and functionality onto this platform
    and the acceptance of the new hardware and software platforms
    associated with this release by our existing and target
    customers.

The current life cycle of our products is typically 12 to
    24 months. The introduction of new products or product
    enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing
    products, or replace sales of some of our current products,
    thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product
    introduction, and may cause customers to defer purchasing our
    existing products in anticipation of the new products. This
    could harm our operating results by decreasing sales, increasing
    our inventory levels of older products, and exposing us to
    greater risk of product obsolescence. We have also experienced,
    and may in the future experience, delays in developing and
    releasing new products and product enhancements. This has led
    to, and may in the future lead to, delayed sales, increased
    expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated. Also, in
    the development of our products, we have experienced delays in
    the prototyping of our products, which in turn has led to delays
    in product introductions. In addition, complexity and
    difficulties in managing product transitions at the

end-of-life

stage of a product can create excess inventory of components
    associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased
    expenses. Any or all of the above problems could materially harm
    our business and operating results.



Our
    success depends on sales and continued innovation of our BIG-IP
    product lines

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, we derived
    89.4% of our product revenues from sales of our BIG-IP family of
    application delivery networking product lines. We expect to
    derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of
    our BIG-IP products in the future. Implementation of our
    strategy depends upon BIG-IP being able to solve critical
    network availability and performance problems of our customers.
    If BIG-IP is unable to solve these problems for our customers or
    if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in
    BIG-IP’s product feature set needed to maintain leadership
    in what will continue to be a competitive market environment,
    our business and results of operations will be harmed.

We may
    not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application
    delivery networking market

The markets we serve are new, rapidly evolving and highly
    competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify
    in the future. Our principal competitors in the application
    delivery networking market include Cisco Systems, Inc., Nortel
    Networks Corporation, Foundry Networks, Inc., Citrix Systems,
    Inc., Radware Ltd. and Juniper Networks, Inc. We expect to
    continue to face additional competition as new participants
    enter our market. In addition, larger companies with significant
    resources, brand recognition, and sales channels may form
    alliances with or acquire competing application delivery
    networking solutions and emerge as significant competitors.
    Potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate
    an Internet traffic management or security component into
    existing products in a manner that discourages users from
    purchasing our products.

Our
    quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and may
    cause our stock price to fluctuate

Our quarterly and annual operating results have varied
    significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the
    future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future
    operating results. In particular, we anticipate that the size of
    customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger
    business accounts. A delay in the recognition of revenue, even
    from just one account, may have a significant negative impact on
    our results of operations for a given period. In the past, a
    majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a
    quarter. Accordingly, a delay in an anticipated sale past the
    end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of
    operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that year.
    Additionally, we have exposure to the credit risks of some of
    our customers and

sub-tenants.

Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor
    and mitigate the associated risk, there can be no assurance that
    such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks
    adequately. We monitor individual payment capability in granting
    credit arrangements, seek to limit the total credit to amounts
    we believe our customers can pay, and maintain reserves we
    believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses. If
    there is a deterioration of a

sub-tenant’s

or major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are
    higher than expected future resulting losses, if incurred, could
    harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our
    operating results.

Further, our operating results may be below the expectations of
    securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years.
    Our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the
    market price of our common stock.

The
    average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs
    may increase, which may negatively impact gross
    profits

It is possible that the average selling prices of our products
    will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing
    pressures, increased sales discounts, new product introductions
    by us or our competitors or other factors. Therefore, in order
    to maintain our gross profits, we must develop and introduce new
    products and product enhancements on a timely basis and
    continually reduce our product costs. Our failure to do so will
    cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline, which will
    harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we may
    experience substantial

period-to-period

fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of
    our average selling prices.



It is
    difficult to predict our future operating results because we
    have an unpredictable sales cycle

Our products have a lengthy sales cycle, which is difficult to
    predict. Historically, our sales cycle has ranged from
    approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as
    we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise
    market. Also, as our distribution strategy has evolved into more
    of a channel model, utilizing value-added resellers,
    distributors and systems integrators, the level of variability
    in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased
    and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our
    sales transactions. Sales of our products require us to educate
    potential customers in their use and benefits. Sales of our
    products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal
    budgeting, approval and competitive evaluation processes that
    large corporations and governmental entities may require. For
    example, customers frequently begin by evaluating our products
    on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our
    products before they decide whether or not to purchase.
    Customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated
    releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or
    us. As a result, our products have an unpredictable sales cycle
    that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating
    results.

Our
    business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not
    able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if
    a single source of hardware assembly is lost or
    impaired

We rely on third party contract manufacturers to assemble our
    products. We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware
    platforms to contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware
    platforms to our specifications. We have experienced minor
    delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past.
    However, if we experience major delays in the future or other
    problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of
    product, any one or a combination of these factors may harm our
    business and results of operations. The inability of our
    contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of
    our products or the loss of our contract manufacturer may cause
    a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a
    replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results
    of operations. In particular, because we subcontract
    substantially all of our manufacturing to a single contract
    manufacturer, with whom we do not have a long-term contract, any
    termination, loss or impairment in our arrangement with this
    single source of hardware assembly, or any impairment of their
    facilities or operations, would harm our business, financial
    condition and results of operation.

If the demand for our products grows, we will need to increase
    our raw material and component purchases, contract manufacturing
    capacity and internal test and quality control functions. Any
    disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue, may harm our
    competitive position and may result in additional costs or
    cancellation of orders by our customers.

Our
    business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays
    in the supply of hardware components from our third-party
    sources

We currently purchase several hardware components used in the
    assembly of our products from a number of single or limited
    sources. Lead times for these components vary significantly. The
    unavailability of suitable components, any interruption or delay
    in the supply of any of these hardware components, or the
    inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources
    at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, may delay
    assembly and sales of our products and, hence, our revenues, and
    may harm our business and results of operations.

We may
    not adequately protect our intellectual property and our
    products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of
    third parties

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
    trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure of
    confidential and proprietary information to protect our
    intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our
    proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or
    otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring
    unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be
    certain that the steps we have taken will prevent
    misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign
    countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights
    as fully as in the United States.



Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number
    of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding
    patent and other intellectual property rights. In the ordinary
    course of our business, we are involved in disputes and
    licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed
    proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always
    successfully defend ourselves against such claims. If we are
    found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, or if we
    otherwise settle such claims, we could be compelled to pay
    damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those
    intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they
    no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights. Any license
    could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at
    all. Similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid
    infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or
    impractical. In addition, we have initiated, and may in the
    future initiate, claims or litigation against third parties for
    infringement of our proprietary rights, to determine the scope
    and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our
    competitors. Any of these claims, whether claims that we are
    infringing the proprietary rights of others, or vice versa, with
    or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly
    litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel
    or require us to cease using infringing technology, develop
    non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing
    agreements. Further, our license agreements typically require us
    to indemnify our customers, distributors and resellers for
    infringement actions related to our technology, which could
    cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against
    our customers, distributors, or resellers. Any of the
    above-described circumstances relating to intellectual property
    rights disputes could result in our business and results of
    operations being harmed.

Many of our products include intellectual property licensed from
    third parties. In the future, it may be necessary to renew
    licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new
    licenses for other technology. These third party licenses may
    not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. The
    inability to obtain certain licenses, or litigation regarding
    the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related
    intellectual property issues, could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, operating results and financial
    condition. Furthermore, we license some third party intellectual
    property on a non-exclusive basis and this may limit our ability
    to protect our intellectual property rights in our products.

We may
    not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships
    and a reduction or delay in sales to a significant distribution
    partner could hurt our business

Our sales strategy requires that we establish and maintain
    multiple distribution channels in the United States and
    internationally through leading industry resellers, systems
    integrators, Internet service providers and other channel
    partners. We have a limited number of agreements with companies
    in these channels, and we may not be able to increase our number
    of distribution relationships or maintain our existing
    relationships. If we are unable to establish or maintain our
    indirect sales channels, our business and results of operations
    will be harmed. In addition, one domestic distributor of our
    products accounted for 13.6% and 18.6% of our total net revenue
    for the fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. A substantial
    reduction or delay in sales of our products to this or any other
    key distribution partner could harm our business, operating
    results and financial condition.

Undetected
    software errors may harm our business and results of
    operations

Software products frequently contain undetected errors when
    first introduced or as new versions are released. We have
    experienced these errors in the past in connection with new
    products and product upgrades. We expect that these errors will
    be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after
    commencement of commercial shipments. These problems may cause
    us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the
    attention of our engineering personnel from our product
    development efforts and cause significant customer relations
    problems. We may also be subject to liability claims for damages
    related to product errors. While we carry insurance policies
    covering this type of liability, these policies may not provide
    sufficient protection should a claim be asserted. A material
    product liability claim may harm our business and results of
    operations.

Our products must successfully operate with products from other
    vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may
    be difficult to identify the source of the problem. The
    occurrence of software errors, whether caused by our products or
    another vendor’s products, may result in the delay or loss
    of market



acceptance of our products. The occurrence of any of these
    problems may harm our business and results of operations.

Our
    operating results are exposed to risks associated with
    international commerce

As our international sales increase, our operating results
    become more exposed to international operating risks. These
    risks include risks related to potential recessions in economies
    outside the United States, foreign currency exchange rates,
    managing foreign sales offices, regulatory, political, or
    economic conditions in specific countries, military conflict or
    terrorist activities, changes in laws and tariffs, inadequate
    protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries,
    foreign regulatory requirements, and natural disasters. All of
    these factors could have a material adverse effect on our
    business. We intend to continue expanding into international
    markets. International sales represented 42.6% and 40.5% of our
    net revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. In particular, in fiscal year 2006, we
    derived 13.1% of our total revenue from the Japanese market.
    This revenue is dependent on a number of factors outside our
    control, including the viability and success of our resellers
    and the strength of the Japanese economy.

Changes
    in governmental regulations could negatively affect our
    revenues

Our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by
    the United States and various foreign governments including, but
    not limited to, environmental regulations and regulations
    implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the
    import or export of some technologies, especially encryption
    technology. Changes in governmental regulation and our inability
    or failure to obtain required approvals, permits, or
    registrations could harm our international and domestic sales
    and adversely affect our revenues, business and operations.

Acquisitions,
    including our recent acquisition of Swan Labs, present many
    risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals
    that are contemplated at the time of the
    transaction

With respect to our acquisitions, as well as any other future
    acquisitions we may undertake, we may find that the acquired
    assets do not further our business strategy as expected, or that
    we paid more than what the assets are later worth, or that
    economic conditions change, all of which may generate future
    impairment charges. There may be difficulty integrating the
    operations and personnel of the acquired business, and we may
    have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired
    business. We may have difficulty in incorporating the acquired
    technologies or products with our existing product lines. Our
    ongoing business and management’s attention may be
    disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and
    the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse
    locations. We may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards,
    controls, procedures and policies across locations. We may
    experience significant problems or liabilities associated with
    the product quality, technology and other matters.

Our inability to successfully operate and integrate
    newly-acquired businesses appropriately, effectively and in a
    timely manner, or to retain key personnel of any acquired
    business, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
    take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated
    traffic management and security solutions and other advances in
    technology, as well as on our revenues, gross margins and
    expenses.

Our
    success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract
    and retain qualified sales and marketing, operations, product
    development and professional services personnel

Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued
    contributions of our key management, product development, sales,
    marketing and finance personnel, many of whom may be difficult
    to replace. The complexity of our application delivery
    networking products and their integration into existing networks
    and ongoing support, as well as the sophistication of our sales
    and marketing effort, requires us to retain highly trained
    professional services, customer support and sales personnel.
    Competition for qualified professional services, customer
    support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because
    of the limited number of people available with the necessary
    technical skills and understanding of our products. Our ability
    to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by
    volatility or reductions in the price of our common



stock, since these employees are generally granted stock
    options. The loss of services of any of our key personnel, the
    inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the
    future or delays in hiring qualified personnel, may harm our
    business and results of operations.

We
    face litigation risks

We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business.
    Litigation in general, and intellectual property and securities
    litigation in particular, can be expensive, lengthy and
    disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results
    of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
    Responding to the allegations has been, and will likely continue
    to be, expensive and time-consuming for us. An unfavorable
    resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business,
    results of operations, or financial condition.

Our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our
    prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks
    associated with litigation. In May 2006 several derivative
    actions were filed against certain current and former directors
    and officers based on allegations relating to our historical
    stock option practices. We cannot assure you that this current
    litigation will result in the same conclusions reached by the
    special committee of outside directors formed by our Board of
    Directors to conduct a review of our stock option practices (the
    “Special Committee”).

We may in the future be subject to additional litigation arising
    in relation to our historical stock option practices and the
    restatement of our prior financial statements. Litigation may be
    time consuming, expensive and distracting for management from
    the conduct of our business. The adverse resolution of any
    lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure
    you that any future litigation relating to our historical stock
    option practices will result in the same conclusions reached by
    the Special Committee. Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse
    findings in any of these matters, we could be required to pay
    damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us
    which could adversely affect our business, results of
    operations, or financial condition.

The
    matters relating to the Special Committee’s review of our
    historical stock option practices and the restatement of our
    consolidated financial statements has resulted in regulatory
    proceedings against us and may result in future regulatory
    proceedings, which could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition

On November 8, 2006, we announced that the Special
    Committee had completed its review of our historical stock
    option practices. Upon completion of its review, the Special
    Committee found that the recorded grant dates for certain stock
    options granted during fiscal years 1999 to 2004 should be
    adjusted as the measurement date for accounting purposes and the
    accounting treatment used for the vesting of certain stock
    options was incorrect. Based on the Special Committee’s
    review, to correct the accounting treatment, we have amended our
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K/A

(as amended) for the year ended September 30, 2005 and our
    Quarterly Reports on

Form 10-Q

for the three months ended December 31, 2005 and
    March 31, 2006 to restate the consolidated financial
    statements contained in those reports.

We have received notice from both the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”) and the United States
    Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York (the
    “Department of Justice”) that they are conducting
    informal inquiries into our historical stock option practices,
    and we have continually cooperated with both agencies.
    Considerable legal and accounting expenses related to our
    historical stock option practices have already been incurred to
    date and significant expenditures may continue to be incurred in
    the future. We may in the future be subject to additional
    regulatory proceedings or actions arising in relation to our
    historical stock option practices and the restatement of our
    prior period financial statements. Any potential regulatory
    proceeding or action may be time consuming, expensive and
    distracting for management from the conduct of our business. The
    adverse resolution of any potential regulatory proceeding or
    action could adversely affect our business, results of
    operations, or financial condition. We cannot assure you that
    the SEC and Department of Justice inquiries, or any future
    regulatory action relating to our historical stock option
    practices, will result in the same conclusions reached by the
    Special Committee. Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse
    findings in any of these matters, we could be required to pay
    damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed



upon us, including criminal penalties, which could adversely
    affect our business, results of operations, or financial
    condition.

As a
    result of our delayed filing of our

Form 10-Q

for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, our inability to
    maintain our

Form S-3

eligibility may adversely affect our ability to raise future
    capital

As a result of our delayed filing of our

Form 10-Q

for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, we will be ineligible
    to register our securities on

Form S-3

for sale by us or resale by other security holders until we have
    timely filed all periodic reports under the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934 for one year from the date the

Form 10-Q

for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 was due. In the
    meantime, we have the ability to use

Form S-1

to raise capital or complete acquisitions, which could increase
    the transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to raise
    capital or complete acquisitions of other companies during this
    period.

Anti-takeover
    provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to
    acquire us

Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the
    price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions,
    including voting rights, of those shares without any further
    vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of
    common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected
    by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be
    issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have
    the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of
    control of our company without further action by our
    stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other
    rights of the holders of common stock. Further, certain
    provisions of our bylaws, including a provision limiting the
    ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of
    stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect
    of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of
    our company, which could have an adverse effect on the market
    price of our common stock. In addition, our articles of
    incorporation provide for a staggered board, which may make it
    more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of
    directors. Similarly, state anti-takeover laws in the State of
    Washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a
    change of control of our company.

Our principal administrative, sales, marketing, research and
    development facilities are located in Seattle, Washington and
    consist of approximately 195,000 square feet. In April
    2000, we amended and restated the lease agreement on two
    buildings for our corporate headquarters. The lease commenced in
    July 2000 on the first building; and the lease on the second
    building commenced in September 2000. The lease for both
    buildings expires in 2012 with an option for renewal. The lease
    for the second building has been fully subleased through 2012.
    We believe that our existing properties are in good condition
    and suitable for the conduct of our business. We also lease
    office space for our product development personnel in Spokane,
    Washington, San Jose, California, Israel, Northern Ireland,
    and Russia and for our sales and support personnel in Washington
    D.C., New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, Taiwan, Malaysia,
    South Korea, Japan, Australia, Germany, France, and the United
    Kingdom. We believe that our future growth can be accommodated
    by current facilities or by leasing additional space if
    necessary.

On October 31, 2006 we entered into an office lease
    agreement to lease a total of approximately 137,000 square
    feet of office space in the building known as 333 Elliott West,
    which is next to the three buildings that currently serve as our
    corporate headquarters. The lease term is 10 years with an
    option for renewal. We plan to occupy this new building during
    the second quarter of fiscal 2008 after construction is
    completed.



Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

Regulatory
    proceedings

Internal Revenue Service Audit.

We received a
    notice from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”)
    indicating the IRS would be auditing our tax returns for 2002,
    2003, and 2004. We have produced documents and other information
    to the IRS and are currently in discussions with the IRS to
    resolve all issues arising from this audit. We do not believe
    this audit and any settlement with the IRS will have a material
    adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results
    of operations.

Derivative Suits.

On May 24, 2006, a
    shareholder action captioned Adams v. Amdahl et al.
    was filed against certain of our current and former officers and
    directors in the King County Superior Court in Washington. The
    complaint generally alleges that the defendants breached their
    fiduciary duties to us in connection with the granting of
    certain stock options. Five additional shareholder derivative
    complaints, based on substantially the same allegations, were
    subsequently filed in the Washington federal and state courts.
    Although litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, we do
    not believe the results of these pending actions will,
    individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact
    on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Nasdaq Delisting.

On July 20, 2006 we
    announced that it would be unlikely that the Special
    Committee’s review would be completed in time for us to
    file our

Form 10-Q

for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, by the SEC’s
    deadline of August 14, 2006. In August 2006, we failed to
    timely file our

Form 10-Q

for the period ended June 30, 2006 as a result of the
    ongoing Special Committee investigation. On August 14,
    2006, we received a written Staff Determination Notice from
    Nasdaq stating that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq’s
    Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) because we had not timely
    filed our Quarterly Report on

Form 10-Q

for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, and that, therefore,
    our securities were subject to delisting. On August 18,
    2006, we appealed Nasdaq’s Staff’s delisting
    determination to the Panel and requested an oral hearing before
    the Panel. On August 23, 2006, Nasdaq’s Staff stayed
    the delisting action pending a final written decision on our
    appeal by the Panel. A hearing before the Panel occurred on
    September 22, 2006. On November 28, 2006, we received
    notice that the Panel had granted our request for continued
    listing on the Nasdaq Global Market, subject to certain
    conditions we expect to satisfy within the time period requested
    by the Panel.

There is no assurance that we will not be subject to inquiries
    related to our stock option grant practices by other federal,
    state or foreign regulatory agencies.

2001 Securities Suits

. In July and August 2001, a series
    of putative securities class action lawsuits were filed in
    United States District Court, Southern District of New York
    against certain investment banking firms that underwrote the
    Company’s initial and secondary public offerings, the
    Company and some of the Company’s officers and directors.
    These cases, which have been consolidated under In re F5
    Networks, Inc. Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation,
    No. 01 CV 7055, assert that the registration statements for
    the Company’s June 4, 1999 initial public offering and
    September 30, 1999 secondary offering failed to disclose
    certain alleged improper actions by the underwriters for the
    offerings. The consolidated, amended complaint alleges claims
    against the Company and those of our officers and directors
    named in the complaint under Sections 11 and 15 of the
    Securities Act of 1933, and under Sections 10(b) and 20(a)
    of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Other lawsuits have been
    filed making similar allegations regarding the public offerings
    of more than 300 other companies. All of these various
    consolidated cases have been coordinated for pretrial purposes
    as In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, Civil
    Action

No. 21-MC-92.

In October 2002, the directors and officers were dismissed
    without prejudice. The issuer defendants filed a coordinated
    motion to dismiss these lawsuits in July 2002, which the Court
    granted in part and denied in part in an order dated
    February 19, 2003. The Court declined to dismiss the
    Section 11 and Section 10(b) and

Rule 10b-5

claims against the Company. In June 2004, a stipulation of
    settlement for the claims against the issuer defendants,
    including the Company, was submitted to the Court. On
    August 31, 2005, the Court granted preliminary approval of
    the settlement. The settlement is subject to a number of
    conditions, including final approval by the Court. If the
    settlement does not occur, and litigation against us continues,
    we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend the
    case vigorously. Securities class action litigation could result
    in



substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and
    resources. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we
    cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the
    litigation, and any unfavorable outcome could have a material
    adverse impact on our business, financial condition and
    operating results.

We are not aware of any additional pending legal proceedings
    that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating
    results, or financial condition. We may in the future be party
    to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business,
    including claims that we allegedly infringe upon third-party
    trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Such claims,
    even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of
    significant financial and managerial resources.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The statements contained below that are not purely historical
    are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. These statements
    include, but are not limited to, statements about our plans,
    objectives, expectations, strategies, intentions or other
    characterizations of future events or circumstances and are
    generally identified by the words “expects,”
    “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,”
    “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,”
    and similar expressions. Because these forward-looking
    statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,
    our actual results could differ materially from those expressed
    or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that
    could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are
    not limited to, those discussed under the heading “Risk
    Factors” herein and in other documents we file from time to
    time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All
    forward-looking statements set forth below are based on
    information available to us on the date hereof. Our business and
    the associated risks may have changed since the date this report
    was originally filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to

Restatement
    of Consolidated Financial Statements

In our Annual Report on

Form 10-K/A

No. 2 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005
    (filed on December 12, 2006), we restated our consolidated
    financial statements for the years ended September 30,
    2005, 2004 and 2003, and the selected consolidated financial
    data as of and for the years ended September 30, 2005,
    2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001. In addition, we restated our
    consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended
    December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006 in our Quarterly
    Reports on Form

10-Q/A

for
    the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and March 31,
    2006, each of which was filed on December 13, 2006. All
    financial information included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

reflects our restatement.

Overview

We are a global provider of software and hardware products and
    services that help companies efficiently and securely manage
    their Internet traffic. Our products enhance the delivery,
    optimization and security of application traffic on
    Internet-based networks. We market and sell our products
    primarily through indirect sales channels in the Americas
    (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and
    Africa (EMEA); Japan and the Asia Pacific region. Enterprise
    customers (Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global
    1000 companies) in financial services, transportation,
    government and telecommunications industries continue to make up
    the largest percentage of our customer base.

Our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance
    indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our
    financial and operating performance. Those indicators include:

•

Revenues.

The majority of our revenues are
    derived from sales of our core products; BIG-IP Local Traffic
    Manager; BIG-IP Global Traffic Manager; BIG-IP ISP Traffic
    Manager; TrafficShield Application Firewall, and FirePass SSL
    VPN servers. We also derive revenues from the sales of services
    including annual maintenance contracts, installation, training
    and consulting services. We carefully monitor the sales mix of
    our revenues within each reporting period. We believe customer
    acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements
    are key indicators of future trends. We also consider overall
    revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as
    additional indicators of current and future trends.

•

Cost of revenues and gross margins.

We strive
    to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross
    margins. Significant items impacting cost of revenues are
    hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third-party
    software license fees, and amortization of developed technology,
    personnel and overhead expenses. Our margins have remained
    relatively stable over the past two years; however factors such
    as sales price, product mix, inventory obsolescence, returns,
    component price increases, and warranty costs could
    significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter
    and represent the significant indicators we monitor on a regular
    basis.



•

Operating expenses.

Operating expenses are
    substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses.
    Existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant
    factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense
    trends. Other significant operating expenses that we monitor
    include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees,
    computer costs related to the development of new products,
    facilities and depreciation expenses.

•

Liquidity and cash flows.

Our financial
    condition remains strong with significant cash and investments
    and no long term debt. The increase in cash and investments
    during the fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to net income from
    operations, with operating activities providing cash of
    $125.4 million. Capital expenditures during the fiscal year
    2006 were comprised primarily of tenant improvements and
    information technology infrastructure and equipment to support
    the growth of our core business activities.

•

Balance sheet.

We view cash, short-term and
    long-term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable
    balances and day’s sales outstanding as important
    indicators of our financial health. Deferred revenues continued
    to increase due to the growth in the amount of annual
    maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance
    renewal contracts related to our existing product installation
    base. Our day’s sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006 was 51. We expect to maintain this metric going
    forward.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. The preparation of these financial
    statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and
    on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
    estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the
    more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation
    of our financial statements.

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue in
    accordance with the guidance provided under Statement of
    Position (“SOP”)

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,”

and

SOP No. 98-9

“Modification of

SOP No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain
    Transactions,”

Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 48,

“Revenue
    Recognition When Right of Return Exists,”

and SEC Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101,

“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,”

and SAB No. 104,

“Revenue
    Recognition.”

We sell products through distributors, resellers, and directly
    to end users. We recognize product revenue upon shipment, net of
    estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be
    probable and no significant obligations remain. In certain
    regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate
    returns, revenue is recognized upon sale to the end user. In
    this situation, we receive a sales report from the channel
    partner to determine when the sales transaction to the end user
    has occurred. Payment terms to domestic customers are generally
    net 30 days to net 45 days. Payment terms to
    international customers range from net 30 to 90 days based
    on normal and customary trade practices in the individual
    markets. We have offered extended payment terms ranging from
    three to six months to certain customers, in which case, revenue
    is recognized when payments are made.

Whenever a software license, hardware, installation and
    post-contract customer support (“PCS”) elements are
    combined into a package with a single “bundled” price,
    a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the
    bundled package based on their respective fair values as
    determined when the individual elements are sold separately.
    Revenues from the license of software are recognized when the
    software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay
    for the software. When rights of return are present and we
    cannot estimate returns, we recognize revenue when such rights
    of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the service contract term. PCS includes
    rights to upgrades, when and if



available, a limited period of telephone support, updates, and
    bug fixes. Installation revenue is recognized when the product
    has been installed at the customer’s site. Consulting
    services are customarily billed at fixed rates, plus

out-of-pocket

expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has
    been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training
    has been completed.

Reserve for Doubtful Accounts.

Estimates are
    used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are
    based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a
    percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging
    category. In determining these percentages, we evaluate
    historical write-offs, current trends in the credit quality of
    our customer base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We
    perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’
    financial condition and do not require any collateral. If there
    is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or
    actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our
    allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient.

Reserve for Product Returns.

In some
    instances, product revenue from distributors is subject to
    agreements allowing rights of return. Product returns are
    estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the
    time revenues are recognized. Accordingly, we reduce recognized
    revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is
    recorded. When rights of return are present and we cannot
    estimate returns, revenue is recognized when such rights lapse.
    The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon
    changes in historical rates of returns and other related
    factors. It is possible that these estimates will change in the
    future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates.

Reserve for Warranties.

A warranty reserve is
    established based on our historical experience and an estimate
    of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on
    products sold as of the balance sheet date. While we believe
    that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment
    applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and
    payable could differ materially from what will actually
    transpire in the future.

Accounting for Income Taxes.

We utilize the
    liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth
    SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income
    Taxes”

(“SFAS 109”). Accordingly, we are
    required to estimate our income taxes in each of the
    jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of
    preparing our consolidated financial statements. This process
    involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including
    assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with
    assessing temporary differences resulting from the different
    treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These
    differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due
    to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with
    the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is
    possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in
    the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and
    adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition
    and cash flows.

Stock-based compensation.

We adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Statement No.  123(R),

Share-Based Payment

(“FAS 123R”), on
    July 1, 2005. Prior to July 1, 2005, we accounted for
    share-based payments under the recognition and measurement
    provisions of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
    Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”), and related Interpretations, as
    permitted by FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation

(“FAS 123”). In
    accordance with APB 25, no compensation cost was required
    to be recognized for options granted that had an exercise price
    equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
    date of grant.

We adopted FAS 123R using the
    modified-prospective-transition method. Under that transition
    method, compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year 2005
    includes: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments
    granted prior to, but not yet vested as of July 1, 2005,
    based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the original provisions of FAS 123, and
    b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted
    subsequent to July 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    FAS 123R. The results for the prior periods have not been
    restated.

Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted the straight-line
    attribution method for recognizing compensation expense.
    Previously under the disclosure-only provisions of
    SFAS 123, the Company used the accelerated method of
    expense recognition pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 28,

Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable
    Stock Option or Award Plans

(“FIN 28”). For
    all unvested options outstanding as of



July 1, 2005, the previously measured but unrecognized
    compensation expense, based on the fair value at the original
    grant date, will be recognized on an accelerated basis over the
    remaining vesting period. For share-based payments granted
    subsequent to July 1, 2005, compensation expense, based on
    the fair value on the date of grant, will be recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the vesting period.

In addition, in 2005, we modified the method in which we issue
    incentive awards to our employees through stock-based
    compensation. In prior years, stock-based compensation consisted
    only of stock options. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2005, we began to grant restricted stock unit awards instead of
    stock options. The value of restricted stock units is determined
    using the intrinsic value method, which in this case, is based
    on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our
    common stock on the date of grant. Alternatively, in determining
    the fair value of stock options, we use the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model that employs the following key assumptions.
    Expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical
    volatility of our stock price, over the expected life of the
    option. Expected term of the option is based on historical
    employee stock option exercise behavior, the vesting terms of
    the respective option and a contractual life of ten years. Our
    stock price volatility and option lives involve
    management’s best estimates at that time, both of which
    impact the fair value of the option calculated under the
    Black-Scholes methodology and, ultimately, the expense that will
    be recognized over the life of the option.

SFAS 123R also requires that we recognize compensation
    expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are
    expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates
    that are derived from historical employee termination behavior.
    Our estimated forfeiture rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2006 is 5%. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from
    those estimated by management, additional adjustments to
    compensation expense may be required in future periods.

Net Revenues.

Total net revenues increased
    40.0% in fiscal year 2006 from fiscal year 2005, compared to an
    increase of 64.4% in fiscal year 2005 from fiscal year 2004. The
    continued revenue growth was due to increased demand for our
    Application Traffic Management (ATM) products and higher
    services revenues resulting from our increased installed base of
    products. During fiscal year 2006, each of our primary
    geographic regions reported higher revenues compared to the
    prior year period. International revenues represented 42.6%,
    40.5% and 39.4% of net revenues in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. We expect international sales will continue
    to represent a significant portion of net revenues, although we
    cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a
    percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels.

Net product revenues increased 38.8% in fiscal year 2006 and
    74.1% in fiscal year 2005 as compared to the previous fiscal
    year, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily
    due to absolute growth in the volume of product sales of our
    BIG-IP product line as well as incremental revenues derived from
    sales of our TrafficShield and WAN Optimization product lines.
    Sales of our BIG-IP family of application delivery



networking products represented 89.4%, 89.1% and 90.3% of total
    product revenues in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

Net service revenues increased 44.3% in fiscal year 2006
    compared to a 37.3% increase for fiscal year 2005 from the prior
    year, respectively. The increase of services revenues in
    absolute dollars was the result of increased purchases and
    renewals of maintenance contracts as our installed base of
    products increased.

Ingram Micro Inc., one of our domestic distributors, accounted
    for 13.6%, 18.6%, and 19.1% of our total net revenues in fiscal
    years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. GE Access, one of our
    domestic distributors, which began selling our products in
    fiscal year 2006 accounted for 11.6% of our total net revenue in
    fiscal 2006. Ingram Micro accounted for 8.5%, 26.2% and 26.9% of
    our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively.

Cost of Net Product Revenues.

Cost of net
    product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our
    contract manufacturers, manufacturing overhead, freight,
    warranty, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, and
    amortization expenses in connection with developed technology
    from acquisitions. In absolute dollars, product cost increased
    to $63.6 million in fiscal year 2006 as compared to
    $49.0 million and $28.4 million in fiscal years 2005
    and 2004, respectively. The increases were primarily due to the
    higher volume of units shipped. Higher indirect product costs
    including amortization charges of our acquired technology
    contributed to the percentage increase as compared to fiscal
    year 2005.

Cost of Net Service Revenues.

Cost of net
    service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of
    our professional services staff, travel, facilities, and
    depreciation expenses. Cost of net service revenues as a
    percentage of net service revenues increased slightly to 27.5%
    in fiscal year 2006 as compared to 26.2% and 24.4% in fiscal
    years 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in fiscal year
    2006 is primarily due to increased salary and benefits
    attributed to growth in headcount. Professional services
    headcount at the end of fiscal year 2006 increased to 205 from
    147 at the end of fiscal year 2005. In addition, stock
    compensation expense increased to $1.5 million in fiscal
    year 2006 from $288,000 in fiscal year 2005. Going forward, we



expect to continue to increase our cost of service revenues to
    support our expanded product lines and growing customer base.

Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing
    expenses consist of salaries, commissions and related benefits
    of our sales and marketing staff, the costs of our marketing
    programs, including public relations, advertising and trade
    shows, travel, facilities and depreciation expenses. In absolute
    dollars, sales and marketing expense increased 41.9% in fiscal
    year 2006 as compared to 35.2% and 21.0% in fiscal years 2005
    and 2004, respectively. The increase in sales and marketing is
    primarily due to higher commission and personnel costs,
    consistent with the increased revenue and headcount for the
    corresponding period. Sales and marketing headcount at the end
    of fiscal 2006 increased to 442 from 331 at the end of fiscal
    2005 and 229 at the end of fiscal 2004. Stock-based compensation
    charges of $10.1 million contributed to the overall
    increase in fiscal year 2006. We expect to continue to increase
    sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in order to
    grow revenues and increase our market share.

Research and Development.

Research and
    development expenses consist of the salaries and related
    benefits for our product development personnel, prototype
    materials and expenses related to the development of new and
    improved products, facilities and depreciation expenses. In
    absolute dollars, research and development expenses increased
    56.0% in fiscal year 2006 and 29.0% in fiscal year 2005 as
    compared to the previous fiscal year, respectively. The
    increases in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were primarily due to
    higher salary and benefits costs attributed to an increase in
    headcount to 287 in fiscal year 2006 from 217 in fiscal year
    2005 and 185 in fiscal 2004. The growth in employee headcount
    was primarily related to enhancement of our current products and
    the development of new advanced products. Stock-based
    compensation charges of $6.9 million contributed to the
    overall increase in fiscal year 2006 compared to
    $1.5 million in fiscal year 2005. We expect to continue to
    increase research and development expenses as our future success
    is dependent on the continued development of our products.

General and Administrative.

General and
    administrative expenses consist of the salaries, benefits and
    related costs of our executive, finance, information technology,
    human resource and legal personnel, third-party professional
    service fees, bad debt charges, facilities, and depreciation
    expenses. In absolute dollars, general and administrative
    expenses increased 53.5% in fiscal year 2006 and increased 61.7%
    in fiscal year 2005 as compared to the previous fiscal year,
    respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2006 is due primarily
    to expenses incurred by third parties for legal, accounting, tax
    and other professional services in connection with the Special
    Committee investigation of $7.0 million, an increase in
    stock-based compensation charges of $5.1 million and,
    increased salary and benefit expenses of $2.7 million. The
    increase in personnel costs is consistent with the growth in
    headcount. General and administrative headcount at the end of
    fiscal 2006 increased to 134 from 97 at the end of fiscal 2005.
    These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt
    expense of approximately $1.5 million. The increase in
    general and administrative expenses is expected



to remain at these increased levels as the Company continues to
    build its infrastructure to support the worldwide growth of our
    business.

Other Income, Net.

Other income, net, consists
    of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and
    losses. Other income, net, increased 115.8% in fiscal year 2006
    and increased 195.7% in fiscal year 2005 as compared to the
    previous fiscal year, respectively. The significant increase was
    due to a combination of higher yields and increased investment
    balances. The increased investment balances are the result of
    cash provided from operating and financing activities during the
    fiscal years 2005 and fiscal year 2004. Net proceeds of
    $113.6 million received from the sale of common stock in a
    public offering completed in November of 2003 was the most
    significant addition to our investment balances.

Provision for Income Taxes.

We recorded a
    38.64% provision for income taxes for the fiscal year 2006. As
    of fiscal year-end 2006 we do not have a valuation allowance on
    any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in
    which we operate because we believe that the assets are more
    likely than not to be realized. In making this determination we
    have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing
    prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the
    appropriateness of a valuation allowance. Our net deferred tax
    assets as of fiscal year end 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
    $23.3 million, $40.4 million and $31.6 million,
    respectively. Our world wide effective tax rate may fluctuate
    based on a number of factors including variations in projected
    taxable income in our various geographic locations in which we
    operate, changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax
    assets, resolution of potential exposures, tax positions taken
    on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in
    which we operate, introduction of new accounting standards or
    changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various
    geographic locations in which we operate. We have recorded
    liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to
    business and income tax positions we have taken that could be
    challenged by taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution of
    these potential exposures may be greater or less than the
    liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our
    future tax expense.

In fiscal year 2004, the primary difference between the
    statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate was due to
    previously unrecognized deferred tax assets which were
    recognized. SFAS 109, provides for the recognition of
    deferred tax assets if realization is more likely than not.
    Based on available evidence, which includes our historical
    operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in
    all prior years, we had provided for a full valuation allowance
    against our deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal year 2003.
    Based upon our operating performance in fiscal year 2004 and
    projected future taxable income, we determined that our
    U.S. deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be
    realizable. Therefore, the valuation allowance was reversed and
    as a result we realized an income tax benefit of
    $11.9 million. The credit from the release of the



valuation allowance was partially offset by actual U.S. and
    international tax expenses resulting in a net benefit for income
    taxes of $8.5 million in fiscal year 2004.

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term
    investments totaled $492.2 million as of September 30,
    2006 compared to $365.0 million as of September 30,
    2005, representing an increase of $127.2 million. The
    increase was due to the cash flow from operations and cash from
    employee stock option exercises. In fiscal year 2005, overall
    cash and investments increased $142.7 million compared to
    the fiscal year 2004. The increase was primarily due to the net
    proceeds of $113.6 million from the sale of
    5,175,000 shares of common stock in a public offering
    completed in November 2003.

Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2006
    was $125.4 million compared to $85.0 million in fiscal
    year 2005 and $40.6 million in fiscal year 2004. Cash
    provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash
    generated from net income, after adjusting for non-cash charges
    and changes in operating assets and liabilities as adjusted for
    various non-cash items including stock-based compensation,
    depreciation and amortization charges.

Cash used in investing activities was $204.4 million for
    the fiscal year 2006, $126.8 million for fiscal year 2005
    and $164.7 million for fiscal year 2004. The cash used in
    fiscal year 2006 was primarily the result of the purchase of
    investments partially offset by the sale of investments and
    $42.8 million of cash payments, net of cash acquired, to
    shareholders of Swan Labs, which was acquired in October 2005.
    The cash used in the fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the
    purchase of investments and property and equipment partially
    offset by the sale of investments. The cash used in fiscal year
    2004 was due to the purchase of investments, primarily made
    possible by the proceeds of our public offering, the purchase of
    property and equipment and the acquisition of MagniFire,
    partially offset by the sale of investments.

Cash provided by financing activities was $65.1 million for
    fiscal year 2006 compared to $68.9 million and
    $138.5 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    During the fiscal years 2006 and 2005, our financing activities
    consisted of cash proceeds received from the exercise of stock
    options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.
    During the fiscal year 2004, our financing activities included
    $113.6 million of net proceeds received from a public stock
    offering as well as cash received from the exercise of employee
    stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase
    plan.

We expect that our existing cash and investment balances and
    cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated
    working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable
    future.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB, issued SFAS, No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
    is currently assessing the potential effect if any of
    implementing this standard.

In September 2006, the SEC issued, No. 108,

“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
    when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements”

(“SAB 108”), which is
    effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006.
    SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on the consideration
    of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying
    current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality
    assessment. We do not expect the adoption of SAB 108 to
    have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN, No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
    application of SFAS No. 109 by providing detailed
    guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement
    and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an
    enterprise’s financial statements. Tax positions must meet
    a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective
    date to be recognized upon the adoption of FIN 48 and in
    subsequent periods. FIN 48 will be effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently
    evaluating the potential effects, if any, of FIN 48 on our
    consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk.

Our cash equivalents
    consist of high-quality securities, as specified in our
    investment policy guidelines. The policy limits the amount of
    credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5% of
    the total portfolio with the exception of U.S. treasury
    securities, commercial paper and money market funds, which are
    exempt from size limitation. The policy requires investments in
    securities that mature in three years or less, with the average
    maturity being no greater than one and a half years. These
    securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease
    in value if interest rates increase. A decrease of one percent
    in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease
    of approximately $3.0 million in our interest income for
    the fiscal year 2006.

Foreign Currency Risk.

The majority of our
    sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a
    result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency
    transaction gains and losses to date. While we have conducted
    some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2006 and expect to continue to do so,
    we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or
    losses will be significant at our current level of operations.
    However, as we continue to expand our operations
    internationally, transaction gains or losses may become
    significant in the future. We have not engaged in foreign
    currency hedging to date. However, we may do so in the future.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of F5 Networks, Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of F5 Networks, Inc.’s
    2006 and 2005 consolidated financial statements and of its
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    September 30, 2006, and an audit of its 2004 consolidated
    financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
    opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement
    schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of F5 Networks, Inc. and its subsidiaries
    at September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended September 30, 2006 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
    all material respects, the information set forth therein when
    read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. These financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

Internal
    control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of September 30, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
    based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
    assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
    conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
    in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
    audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
    obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
    reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
    evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
    control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial



statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

The
    Company

F5 Networks, Inc. (“the Company”) provides products
    and services to help companies efficiently and securely manage
    their Internet traffic. The Company’s products improve the
    performance, availability and security of applications running
    on Internet-based networks. Internet traffic between servers
    running applications and clients using these applications passes
    through the Company’s products where the content is
    inspected to ensure that it is safe and modified as necessary to
    ensure that it is delivered securely and in a way that optimizes
    the performance of both the network and the applications. The
    Company also offers a broad range of services such as
    consulting, training, installation, maintenance, and other
    technical support services.

Accounting
    Principles

The Company’s consolidated financial statements and
    accompanying notes are prepared on the accrual basis of
    accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States of America.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date
    of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are
    used in accounting for revenue recognition, reserves for
    doubtful accounts, product returns, obsolete and excess
    inventory, warranties, valuation allowance on deferred tax
    assets and purchase price allocations. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
    purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash
    equivalents. The Company invests its cash and cash equivalents
    in deposits with three major financial institutions, which, at
    times, exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not
    experienced any losses on its cash and cash equivalents.

Investments

The Company classifies its investment securities as available
    for sale. Investment securities, consisting of corporate and
    municipal bonds and notes and United States government
    securities, are reported at fair value with the related
    unrealized gains and losses included as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
    shareholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and
    declines in value of securities judged to be other than
    temporary are included in other income (expense). The cost of
    investments for purposes of computing realized and unrealized
    gains and losses is based on the specific identification method.
    Investments in securities with maturities of less than one year
    or where management’s intent is to use the investments to
    fund current operations are classified as short-term
    investments. Investments with maturities of greater than one
    year are classified as long-term investments.



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company extends credit to customers and is therefore subject
    to credit risk. The Company performs initial and ongoing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and does
    not require collateral. An allowance for doubtful accounts is
    recorded to account for potential bad debts. Estimates are used
    in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based
    upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of
    remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In determining
    these percentages, the Company evaluates historical write-offs,
    and current trends in customer credit quality, as well as
    changes in credit policies.

The Company maintains its cash and investment balances with high
    credit quality financial institutions.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

Short-term and long-term investments are recorded at fair value
    as the underlying securities are classified as available for
    sale and

marked-to-market

at each reporting period. The fair value is determined using
    quoted market prices for the securities held.

Inventories

The Company outsources the manufacturing of its pre-configured
    hardware platforms to contract manufacturers, who assemble each
    product to the Company’s specifications. As protection
    against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for
    its service teams, the Company also stocks limited supplies of
    certain key product components. The Company reduces inventory to
    net realizable value based on excess and obsolete inventories
    determined primarily by historical usage and forecasted demand.
    Inventories consist of hardware and related component parts and
    are recorded at the lower of cost or market (as determined by
    the

first-in,

first-out method).

Inventories consist of the following (in thousands):

Restricted
    Cash

Restricted cash represents escrow accounts established in
    connection with lease agreements for the Company’s
    corporate headquarters and, to a lesser extent, our
    international facilities. Under the terms of the lease for our
    corporate headquarters, the amount required to be held in escrow
    reduces and eventually eliminates at various dates throughout
    the duration of the lease term. During the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2006, the amount required to be held in
    escrow was $3.6 million as set forth in the lease agreement
    for our corporate headquarters.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation of
    property and equipment are provided using the straight-line
    method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging
    from two to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized
    over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life
    of the improvements. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs
    is charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for major

    respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated
    fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date.
    The Company has adopted the requirements of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

(“SFAS No. 142”). SFAS No. 142
    requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis
    and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written
    down when impaired. Goodwill of $32.0 million was recorded
    in connection with the acquisition of Swan Labs, Inc., in fiscal
    year 2006, goodwill of $25.5 million was recorded in
    connection with the acquisition of MagniFire Websystems Inc., in
    fiscal year 2004 and $24.2 million was recorded in
    connection with the acquisition of uRoam, Inc. in fiscal year
    2003. The Company completed its annual impairment test in the
    second quarter of each fiscal year and concluded that there was
    no impairment of goodwill in fiscal year 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Other
    Assets

Other assets primarily consist of software development costs and
    acquired technology.

Software development costs are charged to research and
    development expense until technological feasibility is
    established. The Company accounts for internally-generated
    software development costs in accordance with
    SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of
    Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
    Marketed.” Thereafter, until the product is released for
    sale, software development costs are capitalized and reported at
    the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value of each
    product. The establishment of technological feasibility and the
    ongoing assessment of recoverability of costs require
    considerable judgment by the Company with respect to certain
    internal and external factors, including, but not limited to,
    anticipated future gross product revenues, estimated economic
    life and changes in hardware and software technology. The
    Company did not capitalize any software development costs in
    fiscal year 2006 and 2005. During the fiscal year 2004, the
    Company capitalized $424,000 of software development costs.
    Related amortization costs of $272,000, $317,000, and $328,000
    were recorded during the fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    respectively.

Acquired technology and customer relationship assets are
    recorded at cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives
    of five years. Acquired technology of $8.6 million in
    fiscal 2006, $5.0 million in fiscal year 2004 and
    $3.0 million in fiscal year 2003 was recorded in connection
    with the acquisitions of Swan Labs,



F5

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inc., MagniFire and uRoam, respectively. Related amortization
    expense, which is charged to cost of product revenues, totaled
    $3.2 million, $1.6 million and $1.0 million
    during the fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets
    whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
    When such events occur, management determines whether there has
    been an impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted net
    future cash flows to the related asset’s carrying value. If
    an impairment exists, the asset is written down to its estimated
    fair value.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s products are integrated with software that is
    essential to the functionality of the equipment. Accordingly,
    the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the guidance
    provided under Statement of Position (“SOP”)

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,”

and

SOP No. 98-9

“Modification of

SOP No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain
    Transactions,”

SFAS No. 48,

“Revenue
    Recognition When Right of Return Exists,”

and SEC Staff
    SAB No. 104,

“Revenue Recognition.”

The Company sells products through distributors, resellers, and
    directly to end users. The Company recognizes product revenue
    upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that
    collection is determined to be probable and no significant
    obligations remain. In certain regions where the Company does
    not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns, the Company
    defers revenue on sales to its distributors until the Company
    has received information from the channel partner indicating
    that the distributor has sold the product to its customer.
    Payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 to
    45 days. Payment terms to international customers range
    from net 30 to 90 days based on normal and customary trade
    practices in the individual markets. The Company has offered
    extended payment terms ranging from three to six months to
    certain customers, in which case, revenue is recognized when
    payments are received.

Whenever a software license, hardware, installation and
    post-contract customer support (“PCS”), elements are
    sold together, a portion of the sales price is allocated to each
    element based on their respective fair values as determined when
    the individual elements are sold separately. Revenues from the
    license of software are recognized when the software has been
    shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software.
    When rights of return are present and the Company cannot
    estimate returns, the Company recognizes revenue when such
    rights of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the service contract term. PCS includes
    rights to upgrades, when and if available, a limited period of
    telephone support, updates, and bug fixes. Installation revenue
    is recognized when the product has been installed at the
    customer’s site. Consulting services are customarily billed
    at fixed rates, plus

out-of-pocket

expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has
    been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training
    has been completed.

Shipping
    and Handling

Shipping and handling fees charged to our customers are
    recognized as product revenue in the period shipped and the
    related costs for providing these services are recorded as a
    cost of sale.

Guarantees
    and Product Warranties

In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its
    products, the Company indemnifies other parties, including
    customers, resellers, lessors, and parties to other transactions
    with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company
    has agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses
    arising from a breach



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property
    infringement or other claims made against certain parties. These
    agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification
    claim can be made and the amount of the claim. The Company has
    entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and
    directors, and the Company’s bylaws contain similar
    indemnification obligations to the Company’s agents. It is
    not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under
    these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of
    prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and
    circumstances involved in each particular agreement.

The Company offers warranties of one year for hardware, with the
    option of purchasing additional warranty coverage in yearly
    increments. The Company accrues for warranty costs as part of
    its cost of sales based on associated material product costs and
    technical support labor costs. During the years ended
    September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, warranty expense was
    $1.8 million, $2.2 million and $0.9 million,
    respectively.

    warranties (in thousands):

Research
    and Development

Research and development expenses consist of salaries and
    related benefits of product development personnel, prototype
    materials and expenses related to the development of new and
    improved products, and an allocation of facilities and
    depreciation expense. Research and development expenses are
    reflected in the statements of income as incurred.

Advertising

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred
    $1.3 million, $1.7 million and $1.7 million in
    advertising costs during the fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for
    income taxes as set forth by SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes”

(“SFAS 109”). Deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based upon differences between the
    financial statement and income tax bases of assets and
    liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
    which the differences are expected to reverse. The realization
    of deferred tax assets is based on historical tax positions and
    estimates of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is
    recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Foreign
    Currency

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign
    subsidiaries is the local currency in which the respective
    entity is located, with the exception of F5 Networks, Ltd., in
    the United Kingdom that uses the U.S. dollar as its
    functional currency. An entity’s functional currency is
    determined by the currency of the economic environment in which
    the majority of cash is generated and expended by the entity.
    The financial statements of all majority-owned subsidiaries and
    related entities, with a functional currency other than the
    U.S. dollar, have been translated into U.S. dollars in
    accordance with SFAS No. 52

“Foreign Currency

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Translation.”

All assets and liabilities of the
    respective entities are translated at year-end exchange rates
    and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates
    during the respective period. Translation adjustments are
    reported as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of
    the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated
    in currencies other than the functional currency, including
    U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on those foreign currency
    transactions are included in determining net income or loss for
    the period of exchange. The net effect of foreign currency gains
    and losses were not significant during the fiscal years ended
    September 30, 2006 and 2005. Net transaction losses of
    $466,000 were charged to operations for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2004.

Segments

The Company complies with the requirements of
    SFAS No. 131,

“Disclosure about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information,”

which establishes
    annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise’s
    operating segments and related disclosures about its products,
    services, geographic areas and major customers. Management has
    determined that the Company operates in one segment.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

On July 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment”

(“FAS 123R”). Prior to July 1, 2005, the
    Company accounted for share-based payments under the recognition
    and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”), and related
    Interpretations, as permitted by FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“FAS 123”). In accordance with APB 25,
    no compensation cost was required to be recognized for options
    granted that had an exercise price equal to the market value of
    the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

The Company adopted FAS 123R using the
    modified-prospective-transition method. Under that transition
    method, compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year 2005
    includes: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments
    granted prior to, but not yet vested as of July 1, 2005,
    based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the original provisions of FAS 123, and
    b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted
    subsequent to July 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair
    value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    FAS 123R. The results for the prior periods have not been
    restated.

Effective July 1, 2005 the Company adopted the
    straight-line attribution method for recognizing compensation
    expense. Previously under the disclosure-only provisions of
    SFAS 123, the Company used the accelerated method of
    expense recognition pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 28,

Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable
    Stock Option or Award Plans

(“FIN 28”). For
    all unvested options outstanding as of July 1, 2005, the
    previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense, based
    on the fair value at the original grant date, will be recognized
    on an accelerated basis over the remaining vesting period. For
    share-based payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005,
    compensation expense, based on the fair value on the date of
    grant, will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the
    vesting period.

The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the price
    of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. However, in
    determining the fair value of stock options, we use the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model that employs the following
    key assumptions.

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
    curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company does not
    anticipate declaring dividends in the foreseeable future.
    Expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical
    volatility of our stock price commensurate with the expected
    life of the option. Expected term of the option is based on an
    evaluation of the historical employee stock option exercise
    behavior, the vesting terms of the respective option and a
    contractual life of ten years. Our stock price volatility and
    option lives involve management’s best estimates at that
    time, both of which impact the fair value of the option
    calculated under the Black-Scholes methodology and, ultimately,
    the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option.
    SFAS 123R also requires that we recognize compensation
    expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are
    expected to vest. Therefore, the Company applies estimated
    forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee
    termination behavior. The estimated forfeiture rate in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 was 5%. If the
    actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by
    management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may
    be required in future periods.

The following table shows the pro forma effect on the
    Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share
    for the years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, had
    compensation expense been determined based upon the fair value
    at the grant date for awards consistent with the methodology
    prescribed by SFAS 123. The Company adopted SFAS 123R
    on July 1, 2005, the beginning of its fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2005; therefore, stock-based compensation expense shown
    in the pro forma table relates to expense through June 30,
    2005 while the Company was still under the disclosure only
    provisions of SFAS 123. Stock-based compensation expense
    for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 has been
    included in results of operations. These pro forma effects may
    not be representative of expense in future periods since the
    estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant is
    amortized to expense over the vesting period, and additional
    options may be granted or options may be cancelled in future
    years:

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
    the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing
    net income by the weighted average number of common and dilutive
    common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB, issued SFAS, No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
    is currently assessing the potential effect if any of
    implementing this standard.

In September 2006, the SEC issued, No. 108,

“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
    when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements”

(“SAB 108”), which is
    effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006.
    SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on the consideration
    of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying
    current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality
    assessment. We do not expect the adoption of SAB 108 to
    have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN, No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
    application of SFAS No. 109 by providing detailed
    guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement
    and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an
    enterprise’s financial statements. Tax positions must meet
    a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective
    date to be recognized upon the adoption of FIN 48 and in
    subsequent periods. FIN 48 will be effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently
    evaluating the potential effects, if any, of FIN 48 on its
    consolidated financial statements.

Business
    Combinations

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for under the
    purchase method of accounting in accordance with
    SFAS No. 141,

“Business Combinations.”

The total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and
    intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on
    their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price
    over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The fair value
    assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed are based on estimates and assumptions
    provided by management, and other information compiled by
    management, including independent valuations, prepared by
    valuation specialists that utilize established valuation
    techniques appropriate for the technology industry. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and
    other Intangible Assets,”

goodwill is not amortized but
    instead is tested for impairment at least annually.

Fiscal
    Year 2006 Acquisition of Swan Labs

On October 4, 2005, the Company acquired all of the capital
    stock of Swan Labs, a privately held Delaware corporation
    headquartered in San Jose, California for
    $43.0 million in cash. The Company also incurred
    $3.2 million of direct transaction costs for a total
    purchase price of approximately $46.2 million. As a result
    of the merger, the Company acquired all the assets of Swan Labs,
    all property, equipment and other assets that Swan Labs used in
    its business and assumed all the liabilities of Swan Labs. Swan
    Labs provides WAN (Wide Area Network) optimization and
    application acceleration products and services. The addition of
    Swan Labs is intended to allow us to quickly enter the WAN
    optimization market, broaden the Company’s customer base,
    and augment the Company’s existing product line. The
    results of operations of Swan Labs have been included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date
    of acquisition.

Of the total estimated purchase price, $8.0 million and
    $0.6 million was allocated to developed technology and
    customer relationships, respectively. To determine the value of
    the developed technology, a combination of cost and market
    approaches were used. The cost approach required an estimation
    of the costs required to reproduce the developed technology. The
    market approach measures the fair value of the technology
    through an analysis of recent comparable transactions. To
    determine the value of customer relationships, the income
    approach was used. The income approach estimates the fair value
    based on the earnings and cash flow capacity of an asset. The
    $8.6 million allocated to developed technology and customer
    relationships will be amortized on a straight-line basis over an
    estimated useful life of five years.

Fiscal
    Year 2004 Acquisition of MagniFire Websystems,
    Inc.

On May 31, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of
    MagniFire Websystems, Inc. a provider of web application
    firewall products. As a result of the merger, the Company
    acquired all the assets of MagniFire, including MagniFire’s
    web application firewall product line (TrafficShield), all
    property, equipment and other assets that MagniFire used in its
    business and assumed certain of the liabilities of MagniFire.
    The purchase price was $30.5 million including
    $1.5 million of transactions costs. The results of
    operations of MagniFire have been included in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements since June 1, 2004.

Of the total estimated purchase price, $5.0 million was
    allocated to developed technology. To determine the value of the
    developed technology, a combination of cost and market
    approaches were used. The cost approach required an estimation
    of the costs required to reproduce the acquired technology. The
    market approach measures the fair value of the technology
    through an analysis of recent comparable transactions. The
    $5.0 million allocated to developed technology is being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life
    of five years.

At the time of the acquisition, the estimated purchase price was
    allocated to goodwill in the amount of $24.8 million,
    including the Company’s full valuation allowance on
    deferred taxes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004,
    the Company reversed the valuation allowance and therefore
    increased the amount allocated to goodwill by an additional
    $1.1 million due to the deferred tax liability that was
    assumed as a result of the acquisition. During the fourth
    quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company adjusted the fair value
    of certain other assets and as a result decreased the amount
    allocated to goodwill by $0.4 million.

As of September 30, 2006, restructuring liabilities were
    $0.01 million and consisted of obligations under an excess
    facility operating lease. The excess facility charge was
    initially recognized during fiscal 2002 as part of the
    Company’s decision to discontinue its cache appliance
    business and exit its support facility in Washington D.C. The
    remaining liability approximates the full amount owed through
    the remainder of the lease term, expiring in 2007, and actual
    losses are not expected to vary from the original estimate.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 the Company
    determined, based on an evaluation of current operating results
    and projected future taxable income that the valuation allowance
    of $2.6 million pertaining to net operating loss
    carry-forwards in the United Kingdom was no longer needed and as
    a result the related valuation allowance was reversed. In fiscal
    2004, the Company determined that the U.S. deferred tax
    assets were more likely than not to be realizable and reversed
    the related valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2004. If the estimates and assumptions used in our
    determination change in the future, we could be required to
    revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our
    deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional
    income taxes.

At September 30, 2006, the Company had no U.S. net
    operating loss carry-forwards resulting from tax benefits
    associated with employee stock option plans. At
    September 30, 2006 the Company had other U.S. net
    operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
    $10.8 million, a portion of which begins to expire in
    fiscal year 2025 if not utilized. At September 30, 2006 the
    Company also had net operating loss carry-forwards of
    approximately $6.7 million related to operations in the
    United Kingdom that carry-forward indefinitely and approximately
    $186,982 of net operating loss carry-forwards related to
    operations in Israel that carry-forward indefinitely. At
    September 30, 2006 the Company also had federal research
    credit carry-forwards and other federal credit carry-forwards of
    approximately $7.9 million which, if not utilized, will
    begin to expire in fiscal year 2021 and state research credit
    carry-forwards of approximately $695,000 which, if not utilized,
    will begin to expire in fiscal year 2024. At September 30,
    2005 the Company had approximately $64.3 million of
    U.S. net operating loss carry-forwards resulting from tax
    benefits associated with employee stock option plans. At
    September 30, 2005 the Company also had net operating loss
    carry-forwards of approximately $7.4 million related to
    operations in the United Kingdom that carry-forward
    indefinitely. At September 30, 2005, the Company also had
    federal research credit carry-forwards of approximately
    $7.2 million and state research credit carry-forwards of
    $349,000.

United States income and foreign withholding taxes have not been
    provided on approximately $2.8 million of undistributed
    earnings from the Company’s international subsidiaries. The
    Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability for the
    undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because the
    Company currently does not expect to remit those earnings in the
    foreseeable future. Determination of the amount of unrecognized

deferred tax liability related to undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries is not practicable because such liability,
    if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when
    remittance occurs.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
    (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA provides for a temporary
    85% dividends received deduction on certain earnings repatriated
    during either fiscal year 2005 or fiscal year 2006. The
    deduction would result in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate
    on the repatriated earnings. To qualify for the deduction, the
    earnings must be reinvested in the U.S. pursuant to a
    domestic reinvestment plan established by a company’s chief
    executive officer and approved by the company’s board of
    directors. Additionally, certain other significant criteria, as
    outlined in the AJCA, must also be met. The Company did not
    elect this provision in fiscal year 2006 or fiscal year 2005.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Common
    Stock

In November 2003, the Company sold 5,175,000 shares,
    including 675,000 shares sold upon the exercise of the
    underwriters’ over-allotment option, of its common stock in
    a public offering at a price of $23.25 per share. The
    proceeds to the Company were $113.6 million, net of
    offering costs of $6.7 million.

Equity
    Incentive Plans

In fiscal 2005, the Company modified the method in which it
    issues incentive awards to its employees through stock-based
    compensation. In prior years, stock-based compensation consisted
    only of stock options. In 2005, the majority of awards consisted
    of restricted stock unit awards and to a lesser degree stock
    options. Employees vest in restricted stock units and stock
    options ratably over the corresponding service term, generally
    one to four years. The Company’s stock options expire
    10 years from the date of grant. Restricted stock units are
    payable in shares of the Company’s common stock as the
    periodic vesting requirements are satisfied. The value of a
    restricted stock unit is based upon the fair market value of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The value of
    restricted stock units is determined using the intrinsic value
    method and is based on the number of shares granted and the
    quoted price of the Company’s common stock on the date of
    grant. Alternatively, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options.
    Compensation expense related to restricted stock units and stock
    options is recognized over the vesting period. The Company has
    adopted a number of stock-based compensation plans as discussed
    below.

1998 Equity Incentive Plan.

In November 1998,
    the Company adopted the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 1998
    Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of non-qualified
    and incentive stock options, stock purchase awards and stock
    bonuses for employees and other service providers. Upon certain
    changes in control of the Company, all outstanding and unvested
    options or stock awards under the 1998 Plan will vest at the
    rate of 50%, unless assumed or substituted by the acquiring
    entity. As of September 30, 2006, there were options to
    purchase 726,572 shares outstanding and 45,838 shares
    available for awards under the 1998 Plan.

1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

In May
    1999, the board of directors approved the adoption of the 1999
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan. A total of 2,000,000 shares of common stock have been
    reserved for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
    The Employee Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to
    acquire shares of the Company’s common stock through
    periodic payroll deductions of up to 15% of base compensation.
    No employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock,
    determined at the fair market value of the shares at the time
    such option is granted, in one calendar year. The Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan has been implemented in a series of offering
    periods, each 6 months in duration. The price at which the
    common stock may be purchased is 85% of the lesser of the fair
    market value of the Company’s common stock on the first day
    of the applicable offering period or on the last day of

the respective purchase period. As of September 30, 2006
    there were 876,814 shares available for awards under the
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

2000 Equity Incentive Plan.

In July 2000, the
    Company adopted the 2000 Employee Equity Incentive Plan, or the
    2000 Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of
    non-qualified stock options, stock purchase awards and stock
    bonuses for non-executive employees and other service providers.
    A total of 3,500,000 shares of common stock have been
    reserved for issuance under the 2000 Plan. Upon certain changes
    in control of the Company, all outstanding and unvested options
    or stock awards under the 2000 Plan will vest at the rate of
    50%, unless assumed or substituted by the acquiring entity. As
    of September 30, 2006, there were options to purchase
    583,218 shares outstanding and 70,504 shares available
    for awards under the 2000 Plan.

New Hire Incentive Plans.

In October 2003, the
    company adopted a non-qualified stock option plan, or the Hull
    Plan, in connection with the hiring of Thomas Hull, the
    Company’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales. The
    Hull plan provided for a grant of 225,000 non-qualified stock
    options for Mr. Hull. As of September 30, 2006, there
    were options to purchase 115,000 shares outstanding and no
    shares available for awards under the Hull Plan. In August 2004,
    the Company adopted a non-qualified stock option plan, or the
    Triebes Plan, in connection with the hiring of Karl Triebes, the
    Company’s Senior Vice President of Product Development and
    Chief Technology Officer. The Triebes Plan provided for a grant
    of 300,000 non-qualified stock options for Mr. Triebes. As
    of September 30, 2006, there were options to purchase
    168,750 shares outstanding and no shares available for
    awards under the Triebes Plan. Upon certain changes in control
    of the Company, 100% of all outstanding and unvested options
    remaining under the Hull Plan and the Triebes Plan will vest and
    become immediately exercisable.

Acquisition Incentive Plans.

In July 2003, the
    Company adopted the uRoam Acquisition Equity Incentive Plan, or
    the uRoam Plan, in connection with the hiring of the former
    employees of uRoam, Inc. A total of 250,000 shares of
    common stock were reserved for issuance under the uRoam Plan.
    The plan provided for discretionary grants of non-qualified and
    incentive stock options, stock purchase awards and stock
    bonuses. The Company has not granted any stock purchase awards
    or stock bonuses under this plan. As of September 30, 2006
    there were options to purchase 26,236 shares outstanding
    and no shares available for awards under the uRoam Plan. In July
    2004, the Company adopted the MagniFire Acquisition Equity
    Incentive Plan, or the MagniFire Plan, in connection with the
    hiring of the former employees of MagniFire Websystems, Inc. A
    total of 415,000 shares of common stock were reserved for
    issuance under the MagniFire Plan. The plan provides for
    discretionary grants of non-qualified and incentive stock
    options, stock purchase awards and stock bonuses. The Company
    has not granted any stock purchase awards or stock bonuses under
    this plan. As of September 30, 2006 there were options to
    purchase 131,792 shares outstanding and no shares available
    for awards under the MagniFire Plan. Options that expire under
    the uRoam Plan or the MagniFire Plan, whether due to termination
    of employment or otherwise, are not available for future grant.

2005 Equity Incentive Plan.

In December 2004,
    the Company adopted the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2005
    Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of non-statutory
    stock options and stock units for employees, including officers,
    and other service providers. A total of 1,700,000 shares of
    common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2005
    Plan. Upon certain changes in control of the Company, the
    surviving entity will either assume or substitute all
    outstanding Stock Awards under the 2005 Plan. During the fiscal
    year 2006, the Company issued 37,500 stock options and 1,233,059
    stock units under the 2005 Plan. As of September 30, 2006,
    there were options to purchase 37,500 shares outstanding
    and 504,883 shares available for awards under the 2005 Plan.

The restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2006 and 2005 vest
    quarterly over a two year period. The restricted stock units
    were granted during fiscal 2006 with a per share weighted

Operating
    Leases

The majority of the Company’s operating lease payments
    relate to the Company’s two building corporate headquarters
    in Seattle, Washington. The lease on the first building
    commenced in July 2000; and the lease on the second building
    commenced in September 2000. The lease for both buildings expire
    in 2012. The second building has been fully subleased until
    2012. The Company also leases additional office space for
    product development and sales and support personnel in the
    United States and internationally.

Litigation

Internal Revenue Service Audit.

The Company
    received a notice from the Internal Revenue Service (the
    “IRS”) indicating the IRS would be auditing its tax
    returns for 2002, 2003, and 2004. The Company has produced
    documents and other information to the IRS and are currently in
    discussions with the IRS to resolve all issues arising from this
    audit. The Company does not believe this audit and any
    settlement with the IRS will have a material adverse impact on
    its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Derivative Suits.

On May 24, 2006, a
    shareholder action captioned Adams v. Amdahl et al.
    was filed against certain of the Company’s current and
    former officers and directors in the King County Superior Court
    in Washington. The complaint generally alleges that the
    defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company in
    connection with the granting of certain stock options. Five
    additional shareholder derivative complaints, based on
    substantially the same allegations, were subsequently filed in
    the Washington federal and state courts. Although litigation is
    subject to inherent uncertainties, the Company does not believe
    the results of these pending actions will, individually or in
    the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Nasdaq Delisting.

On July 20, 2006 the
    Company announced that it would be unlikely that the Special
    Committee’s review would be completed in time for the
    Company to file its

Form 10-Q

for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, by the SEC’s
    deadline of August 14, 2006. In August 2006, the Company
    failed to timely file its

Form 10-Q

for the period ended June 30, 2006 as a result of the
    ongoing Special Committee investigation. On August 14,
    2006, the Company received a written Staff Determination Notice
    from Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with
    Nasdaq’s Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) because it has
    not timely filed



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

its Quarterly Report on

Form 10-Q

for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, and that, therefore,
    the Company’s securities are subject to delisting. On
    August 18, 2006, the Company appealed Nasdaq’s
    Staff’s delisting determination to the Panel and requested
    an oral hearing before the Panel. On August 23, 2006,
    Nasdaq’s Staff stayed the delisting action pending a final
    written decision on the Company’s appeal by the Panel. A
    hearing before the Panel occurred on September 22, 2006. On
    November 28, 2006, the Company received notice that the
    Panel had granted its request for continued listing on the
    Nasdaq Global Market, subject to certain conditions we expect to
    satisfy within the time period requested by the Panel.

The Company is not aware of any additional pending legal
    proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
    operating results, or financial condition. the Company may in
    the future be party to litigation arising in the ordinary course
    of business, including claims that allegedly infringe upon
    third-party trademarks or other intellectual property rights.
    Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the
    expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company has a 401(k) savings plan whereby eligible employees
    may voluntarily contribute a percentage of their compensation.
    The Company may, at its discretion, match a portion of the
    employees’ eligible contributions. Contributions by the
    Company to the plan during the years ended September 30,
    2006, 2005, and 2004 were approximately $1.3 million,
    $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
    Contributions made by the Company vest over four years.

Geographic
    Sales and Significant Customers

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
    for which separate financial information is available and
    evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or
    decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and
    in assessing performance. The Company is organized as, and
    operates in, one reportable segment: the development, marketing
    and selling of a comprehensive suite of application networking
    solutions that helps customers efficiently and securely manage
    application traffic on their Internet-based networks. We manage
    our business based on four geographic regions: the Americas
    (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and
    Africa (EMEA); Japan; and Asia Pacific. Our chief operating
    decision-making group reviews financial information presented on
    a consolidated basis accompanied by information about revenues
    by geographic region. Our foreign offices conduct sales,
    marketing and support activities. The Company’s management
    evaluates performance based primarily on revenues in the
    geographic locations in which the Company operates. Revenues are
    attributed by geographic location based on the location of the
    customer. The Company’s assets are primarily located in the
    United States and not allocated to any specific region.
    Therefore, geographic information is presented only for net
    product revenue.

    September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Another
    domestic distributor accounted for 11.6% of net revenue for the
    year ended September 30, 2006.

Subsequent
    Events

On October 31, 2006, the Company entered into an office
    lease agreement to lease a total of approximately
    137,000 square feet of office space in the building known
    as 333 Elliott West, which is next to the three buildings that
    currently serve as the Company’s corporate headquarters.
    The lease term is 10 years with an option for renewal. The
    Company plans to occupy this new building during the second
    quarter of fiscal 2008 after construction is completed.

    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to
    ensure that required information is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the required timeframe, as
    specified in the rules set forth by the Securities Exchange
    Commission. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is
    accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosures.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, evaluated the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
    September 30, 2006 and, based on this evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer have concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
    September 30, 2006.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
    absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
    because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over
    financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence
    and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and
    breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over
    financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or
    improper management override. Because of such limitations, there
    is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or
    detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
    reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known
    features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is
    possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
    not eliminate, this risk.

Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    September 30, 2006. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on the
    results of this assessment and on those criteria, management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of September 30, 2006.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    September 30, 2006 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing herein.

Remediation
    of Material Weakness

As previously disclosed in our amended Annual Report on

Form 10-K/A

No. 2 for the year ended September 30, 2005, which we
    filed on December 12, 2006, our management concluded that,
    as of September 30, 2005, a material weakness existed over
    our granting and modification of stock options and the related
    accounting for and disclosure of stock-based compensation
    expense. Subsequent to the initiation of our investigation into
    our stock-option granting practices in May 2006, we considered
    the effectiveness of both the design and operation of our
    internal control over financial reporting, as they relate to the
    granting and modification of stock-based compensation. We
    implemented a number of significant improvements in our



internal control over financial reporting during the fourth
    quarter of 2006. In particular, we developed and implemented the
    following policies, processes, procedures and controls over the
    granting and modification of stock-based compensation:

•

Review and approval of all stock-based compensation awards by
    the accounting and finance function.

•

Enhanced and standardized documentation required to be
    maintained for the granting of all such stock-based compensation
    awards.

•

Enhanced and standardized documentation required to be
    maintained for the exercise and/or cancellation of all such
    stock-based compensation awards.

•

A quarterly review and reconciliation of all such stock-based
    compensation awards by the accounting and finance function.

•

Formal communication to all relevant personnel involved in the
    stock-based compensation process regarding the importance of the
    accounting and legal implications of the Company’s
    stock-based compensation process.

As of September 30, 2006, management has implemented these
    additional policies, procedures and controls. Additionally, we
    have evaluated the design of these new controls, which have been
    placed into operation for a sufficient period of time, and
    tested their operating effectiveness. The Company considers that
    the steps identified and implemented above have improved the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting and, as of September 30, 2006, have
    remediated the material weakness described above.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

As described above in the “Remediation of Material
    Weakness” section, there were changes to our internal
    control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely
    to materially affect, our internal control over financial
    reporting.
