Item 1.

Business

General

F5 Networks, Inc. is a leading provider of application delivery
networking products that improve the performance, availability
and security of applications running on networks that use the
Internet Protocol (IP). IP traffic between servers running
applications and clients using those applications passes through
our products where the content is inspected to ensure that it is
delivered securely and in a way that optimizes the performance
and availability of both the network and the applications.

Our BIG-IP products help manage IP traffic between network
servers, clients and other devices in a way that maximizes the
availability, scalability and throughput of those network
components and the applications that run on them. Our
complementary FirePass SSL VPN products let enterprises provide
anyone connected to the Internet with secure remote access to
their corporate networks and applications by leveraging standard
Web browser technology. Our TrafficShield application firewall,
which is available as a stand-alone appliance and as a software
module on BIG-IP, provides content-based, application-level
security against malicious attacks that network firewalls and
other security devices can’t prevent. Our BIG-IP products
share a common full-proxy operating system, TMOS, or Traffic
Management Operating System, that enables them to inspect and
modify traffic flows to and from servers and has built-in
functionality to secure, optimize and ensure the availability of
application traffic. Our application delivery networking
products that are integrated on the TMOS platform also share a
common software interface called iControl, which enables them to
communicate with one another and allows them to be integrated
with third party products, including custom and commercial
enterprise applications.

The flexibility of our software-based technology, the breadth of
functionality available on our products and the integration of
that functionality through iControl and TMOS are characteristics
that we believe differentiate our products from other
application delivery networking products. These characteristics
enable us to provide comprehensive solutions that address many
elements required for IP-based networks and business
applications, including high availability, high performance,
intelligent traffic management, streamlined manageability,
bandwidth optimization, remote access to corporate networks, and
network and application security. In connection with our
products, we offer a broad range of services including
consulting, training, installation, maintenance and other
technical support services.

On October 4, 2005, we acquired Swan Labs, Inc., or Swan
Labs, for $43 million in cash. As a result of the
transaction, we acquired all the assets of Swan Labs, including
its principal products, WANJet and WebAccelerator. WANJet
devices are deployed in data centers and branch offices to speed
up file transfers, email, and the performance of any IP-based
application that runs over a Wide Area Network (WAN).
WebAccelerator works in concert with WANJet to speed up the
performance of IP-based enterprise applications running over
WANs. The acquisition of Swan Labs expands our product line and
gives us broader access to the WAN optimization and web
acceleration markets.



We were incorporated on February 26, 1996 in the State of
Washington. Our headquarters is in Seattle, Washington and our
mailing address is 401 Elliott Avenue West, Seattle, Washington
98119. The telephone number at our executive offices is
(206) 272-5555. We have subsidiaries or branch offices in
Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel,
Japan, Malaysia, Northern Ireland, Russia, Singapore, South

Industry Background

Internet Protocol (IP) is a communications language used to
transmit data over the Internet. Since the late 1990’s,
businesses have responded to the power, flexibility and economy
of the Internet by deploying new IP-based applications,
upgrading their client-server applications to new IP-enabled
versions, and enabling existing or legacy applications for use
over the Internet. Over the next several years, we believe this
process will accelerate as more and more organizations discover
the benefits of deploying IP-enabled applications and new
technologies continue to enhance the performance, reliability
and security of both applications and IP networks. In addition,
we believe the growth of Internet usage will continue to be
driven by new applications such as Web Services, Voice over IP,
increased penetration of broadband Internet access enabling the
remote use of more applications, and the increasing popularity
of mobile Internet access through wireless devices such as
cellular telephones, PDAs and notebook computers.

Internet Architecture

IP requires all data transmitted across the Internet to be
divided into packets at the source and reassembled at the
destination. The Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) Reference
Model is the framework that divides network functions into seven
layers and specifies how the layers should interact to enable
all of a network’s different hardware and software
components to work together to accomplish this process. Prior to
transmission, each packet of data is automatically given a
header that identifies the source and destination of the packet.
This header information is used in the OSI Model for the
purposes of identifying, routing and sequencing data packets,
and is stripped from the data upon arrival at its destination.
Layers 2-4 of the OSI Model perform standardized, repetitive
tasks such as ensuring that packets of information sent over the
Internet arrive at the destination to which they are addressed
and are reassembled in the correct sequence. Consequently, most
Layer 2-4 switches are hardware-based devices that use
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and are
optimized for speed. Unlike Layers 2-4, Layer 7, which in
practice includes the functions ascribed to Layers 5 and 6 in
the OSI model, is complex and variable and must support end-user
applications and processes on a wide variety of platforms and
devices. While most Layer 4 switches rely on hardware-based
architectures to maximize throughput, the demands of processing
data at Layer 7 increasingly require flexibility and
adaptability that can be achieved only through a software-based
solution. The challenge in building highly flexible,
function-rich, software-based switches for application delivery
networking is to deliver these capabilities at speeds that do
not slow the speed of network traffic.

Application Delivery Networking

As more applications are IP-enabled, there is growing demand for
Layer 7 technology that can read the entire contents or flow of
data in a packetized transmission and make intelligent decisions
based on a dynamic set of business rules about how to handle the
transmission to make the applications, network, and



servers always secure, fast, and available. Basic Layer 7
functions include load-balancing (distributing traffic across
multiple servers while making them appear to be a single
server), and health-checking (monitoring the performance of
servers and applications to ensure that they are working
properly before routing traffic to them). In addition, Layer 7
processing encompasses a growing number of functions that have
typically been performed by the server or the application
itself, or by point solutions running on separate devices.
Functions in this category include: SSL Acceleration —
using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to secure
traffic between the server and the browser on an end user’s
client device; Rate Shaping — prioritizing
transmissions according to preset rules that give precedence to
different types of traffic; Compression — reducing the
volume of data transmitted to take maximum advantage of
available bandwidth; TCP Optimization — improving
server efficiency by maintaining an open connection with a
server during interactive sessions; IPv6 Translation —
enabling communication and interoperability between networked
devices using IPv6, the newest version of the Internet Protocol,
and those using the older version IPv4; and modifying the
content of a transaction to improve security.

In addition to optimizing the performance and availability of
their networks and applications, enterprises face the
increasingly complex challenge of providing security for
applications and data that are accessible over their IP
networks. Layer 7 or application level security includes three
basic components: providing employees, partners and customers
with secure access to corporate applications; ensuring that
access is limited to those applications for which a user is
specifically authorized; and protecting the integrity of
applications and data.

Currently, the most widespread solution for secure remote access
is technology that uses the IP Security (IPSec) Protocol to
establish a secure virtual private network (VPN) between a
remote device, such as a user’s home PC or a laptop, and
the corporate network. Although an IPSec VPN tunnel is very
secure, it has a number of drawbacks. One is that IPSec requires
the remote device to have special software installed on it, and
maintaining the most current version of this software on all
user devices is time consuming and costly. A more serious issue
is that once IPSec establishes a connection between a user and
the corporate network, the user has full access to any
application in the network and the only way to prevent
unauthorized use is to secure each application or physically
segment the network. As an alternative to using IPSec VPNs for
remote access, technology that employs SSL encryption to
establish a secure VPN has emerged and is making rapid inroads
in the market. Because this technology relies on the SSL
capabilities resident in any standard Web browser, it is not
necessary to install additional software on the remote device.
This makes it possible to access the network from a cell phone,
PDA, kiosk, laptop, PC, or any other device with a standard
browser. In addition, SSL VPN technology supports the creation
of separate VPN tunnels to each application for which a user is
authorized. This allows enterprises to exercise more control
over who can gain access to various parts of the network and to
specific applications.

Along with the need to provide secure connectivity between users
and applications, enterprises face an immediate and growing need
to protect applications and other data center resources from
application-level security threats that pass through
conventional firewalls and slip past intrusion detection and
prevention (IDS and IPS) devices. SQL Slammer Worm, a virus that
infected millions of servers in a matter of minutes and nearly
shut down the Internet in January 2003, is a prime example of
how attacks are now focused at the application level. By
exploiting characteristics of the User Datagram Protocol
(UDP) which allows direct transmission of data to a server,
SQL Slammer Worm slipped past network security devices disguised
as a simple data request. Once inside the application, the code
rewrote the server’s own instructions, replicating and
sending copies of itself to thousands of other servers. Because
it was a “day-zero” attack — i.e., a brand
new threat with no prior history — intrusion detection
and prevention devices were not equipped with a signature to
identify the SQL Slammer Worm and were unable to prevent it.

In the wake of the SQL Slammer Worm and plagued by other
malicious attacks, enterprises have begun to look beyond
traditional security measures for solutions that can detect and
shut down day-zero, application-level attacks. Under the general
category of application security, F5’s solutions apply a
“positive” security model that contrasts with the
“negative” security model used by IDS and IPS devices.
In a negative security model, incoming traffic is checked
against a list of signatures for known worms, viruses and other
security threats, and if no match is found the traffic is
allowed to pass. In a positive



security model, incoming traffic is checked against a set of
rules that define what specific elements are permissible in
traffic headed for a particular application and rejects traffic
containing anything that does not conform to the rules. In the
case of SQL Slammer Worm, a positive security device would have
recognized that the UDP packet carrying the SQL Slammer Worm was
not a simple data request and blocked the transmission.

Although products that incorporate a positive security model
have been around for many years, they have been inherently slow
and this has limited their use to enterprises that have
historically placed a high priority on security. Now that
application-level attacks threaten to paralyze global business,
there is growing demand among enterprises for application
security that can ward off these attacks. The challenge is to
deliver products that apply a positive security model to
application traffic without slowing network performance.

Since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not
thousands — of servers and applications, it is not
practical to build functions that optimize the performance,
availability and security of applications into the applications
themselves. Even if it were, maintenance costs would be
prohibitive and the net result would be a negative impact on the
overall performance of servers and applications. Deploying point
solutions in the network eliminates those problems but creates a
new set of challenges. Using point solutions from multiple
vendors can create interoperability issues, and problems that do
occur can be difficult to troubleshoot. From a security
standpoint, it is also much more difficult to audit traffic
passing through multiple devices. As a result, enterprise
customers are demanding products that integrate the growing
number of Layer 7 application traffic management and security
functions on a single platform. In the past, we have referred to
these functions collectively as “application traffic
management.” However, as the scope and complexity of
functions performed at Layer 7 has increased, we believe the
term “application delivery networking” is more apt to
describe the components of our addressable market, which include
application security, application optimization and application
availability.

The F5 Solution

We are a leading provider of application delivery networking
products that ensure the security, optimization and availability
of applications for any user, anywhere. We believe our products
offer the most intelligent architecture and advanced
functionality in the marketplace along with performance,
flexibility and usability features that help organizations
improve the way they serve their employees, customers, and
partners while lowering operational costs.

Software Based Products.

From inception, we have been
committed to the belief that the complexity of Layer 7
application delivery networking requires a software-based rather
than a hardware-based solution. We believe our modular software
architecture enables us to deliver the broadest range of
integrated functionality in the market and facilitates the
addition and integration of new functionality. We also believe
that integrating our software with commodity hardware components
enables us to build products that deliver superior performance,
functionality and flexibility at competitive prices.

Full Proxy Architecture.

The core of our software
technology is the Traffic Management Operating System
(TMOS) introduced in September 2004 as part of BIG-IP
version 9. We believe this is a major enhancement of our
previous technology that enables BIG-IP version 9 to deliver
functionality that is superior on many levels to any other
application delivery networking product in the market. With
TMOS, BIG-IP version 9 employs a full proxy architecture that
enables it to inspect, modify and direct both inbound and
outbound traffic flows across multiple packets. This ability to
manage application traffic to and from servers enables BIG-IP
version 9 to direct, optimize and secure that traffic in ways
that are not possible with other application delivery networking
solutions.

Modular Functionality.

In addition to its full proxy
architecture, TMOS is specifically designed to facilitate the
development and integration of application delivery networking
functions as modules that can be added to BIG-IP’s core
functionality to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer needs.
Add-on modules currently available with BIG-IP version 9
include: Intelligent Compression; SSL Acceleration; Layer 7 Rate
Shaping; Advanced Client Authentication; IPv6 Gateway; Caching;
and others. Recently, we



also began shipping TrafficShield, our application firewall, as
a software module on BIG-IP, and we are currently beta-testing
Global Traffic Manager (GTM) and Link Controller modules on
BIG-IP systems at customer sites.

Application Awareness.

The open architecture of TMOS
includes an application programming interface (API) called
iControl that allows our products to communicate with one
another and with third-party software and devices. Through this
unique feature, third-party applications and network devices can
take an active role in shaping IP network traffic, directing
traffic based on exact business requirements defined by our
customers and solutions partners and tailored to specific
applications. This “application awareness” capability
is one of the most important features of our software-based
products and further differentiates our solutions from those of
our competitors.

Adaptive Intelligence.

The full-proxy capabilities of
TMOS enable it to inspect or “read” the entire
contents of a transmission across multiple packets and identify
specific elements of that transmission, including items such as
names, dates, and any type of number or label. Using our
industry standard Tool Command Language (TCL) scripting
capability, customers can use those elements as variables to
create iRules that modify the content and direct the flow of
traffic in ways tailored to the dynamic needs of their
applications.

Integrated Layer 7 Solutions.

The combination of our full
proxy architecture and enhanced iRules enables BIG-IP to
intercept, inspect and act on the contents of traffic from
virtually every type of IP-enabled application. In addition, the
modularity of the TMOS architecture allows us to deliver tightly
integrated solutions that secure, optimize and ensure the
availability of applications and the networks they run on.

Our TrafficShield Application Firewall, which we acquired in
2004, was originally designed to run on a full proxy
architecture and has recently been ported to TMOS. Using the
full proxy capabilities of TMOS, TrafficShield inspects the
contents of a transmission and applies a positive security model
to identify and neutralize embedded security threats by
comparing the contents with rules that define permissible
content for specific applications. This has enabled us to
integrate the application security functions of TrafficShield
with the security and networking features built into TMOS and
with the application optimization and availability functions
that run on top of TMOS. As a result of this integration,
TrafficShield can run as a stand-alone product or as a software
module on BIG-IP.

Like TrafficShield, our FirePass SSL-VPN products incorporate a
full proxy architecture to provide secure remote access to
corporate networks. Incoming requests for access to the network
are terminated at the device where the user is authenticated and
authorized to access specific applications before the traffic is
sent on to the servers that host those applications. Once the
connection is established, access is only permitted to those
applications for which a user is authorized, and all traffic
between the user and the applications is encrypted and audited.
We plan to port the FirePass software to TMOS following the
release of our next-generation hardware platform. FirePass is
currently integrated with our other products primarily through
iControl.

During the next 12 months, we also plan to port the
application acceleration and WAN optimization technology we
recently acquired from Swan Labs to TMOS and integrate it with
our other products.

Strategy

Our objective is to lead the industry in delivering the enabling
architecture that integrates the network with the applications.
This allows organizations to significantly improve costly and
time consuming business processes and provide new sources of
revenue through highly differentiated offerings. Key components
of our strategy include:

Offering a complete application security solution and product
set.

We plan to utilize the core technologies from our
BIG-IP, FirePass and TrafficShield products to deliver
standalone and integrated systems that protect applications from
hostile and inadvertent threats, including user-to-system
application security and system-to-system application security
problems. We believe these solutions will differentiate



our products in the security market and provide a unique
solution to the problem of vulnerability of mission-critical
applications.

Investing in technology to continue to meet customer
needs.

We will continue to invest in research and
development to provide our customers with comprehensive,
integrated application traffic management and security
solutions. Our product development efforts will continue to
leverage the unique attributes of our software-based platforms
to deliver new features and functions that address the complex
and changing needs of our customers. We will continue to use
commodity hardware in order to ensure performance and cost
competitiveness.

Enhancing the existing channel model.

We are investing
significant resources in order to further develop our indirect
sales channels. We plan to expand our indirect sales channels
through leading industry resellers, systems integrators,
Internet service providers and other channel partners. We are
also recruiting new channel partners and leveraging our existing
channels to sell our new security products.

Continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic
iControl partners.

We plan to capitalize on our strategic
relationships with enterprise software vendors who have created
interfaces to our products through our iControl application
programming interface. These vendors provide us significant
leverage in the selling process, because they recommend our
products to their customers. In order to differentiate ourselves
further from our competitors we plan to explore opportunities to
further embed iControl into existing and new third party
products and to jointly market and sell our solutions to
enterprise customers with these key partners.

Enhancing our brand.

We plan to continue building brand
awareness that positions us as one of the leading providers of
application delivery networking solutions. Our goal is to make
the F5 brand to be synonymous with superior technology,
high-quality customer service and ease of use.

Products

Our core technology is software for application delivery
networking, including application security and secure remote
access. Our products are systems that integrate our software
with hardware that is built using a combination of commodity
components and our own custom ASIC for Layer 4 processing. Our
current offerings include three product families: BIG-IP,
FirePass and TrafficShield. In addition, we recently acquired
two new application optimization products–WANJet and
WebAccelerator-with the purchase of Swan Labs.

BIG-IP

Our family of BIG-IP Local Traffic Managers includes both IP
application switches and server appliances. Members of the
BIG-IP family differ primarily in the hardware configurations
that make up each system. Our current product family includes
four application switches: high-end (BIG-IP 6800 and 6400),
mid-range (BIG-IP 3400), and an entry-level (BIG-IP 1500). In
addition to CPUs for Layer 7 processing, all but the entry-level
systems come equipped with our own proprietary ASIC for
high-performance Layer 4 processing, a commodity Layer 2-3
switch for connectivity, and commodity ASICs for SSL encryption
and decryption and compression. The BIG-IP 520 and 540 server
appliances are equipped with CPUs for high-speed Layer 4-7
processing and are designed to accommodate easily-installed
upgrade cards that provide fast, integrated SSL encryption and
decryption.

Other products in our BIG-IP systems family include BIG-IP
Global Traffic Manager, formerly called 3-DNS Controller; BIG-IP
ISP Traffic Manager, formerly called Link Controller; and
Application Accelerator, introduced in FY05. BIG-IP Global
Traffic Manager allows enterprises with geographically dispersed
data centers to direct traffic to a particular data center in
accordance with customized business rules, or to redirect
traffic to an available data center if one of their sites
becomes overloaded or is shut down for any reason. BIG-IP ISP
Traffic Manager allows enterprises with more than one Internet
service provider to manage the use of their available bandwidth
to minimize costs while ensuring the highest quality of service.
Application Accelerator speeds up the performance and improves
the bandwidth



utilization of IP-based applications running over wide area
networks. All three products can be purchased separately as
stand-alone systems or bundled with BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager
on a single system.

FirePass

Our FirePass systems provide SSL VPN access for remote users of
IP networks and any applications connected to those networks
from any standard Web browser on any device. The components of
FirePass include a dynamic policy engine, which manages user
authentication and authorization privileges, and special
components that enable corporations to give remote users
controlled access to the full array of applications and
resources within the network.

Our FirePass line of SSL VPN servers currently includes the
FirePass 1000 and the FirePass 4100, which support 100 and 2000
concurrent users, respectively. Both support the complete range
of FirePass software features and offer a comprehensive solution
for secure remote access to corporate applications. FirePass
1000 and 4100 are designed to support medium to large businesses.

TrafficShield

TrafficShield is a Web application firewall that provides
comprehensive, proactive, application-layer protection against
both generalized and targeted attacks. TrafficShield employs a
positive security model (‘deny all unless allowed’) to
permit only valid and authorized application transactions. As a
result, TrafficShield can prevent “day-zero” attacks
and other types of security threats that pass through
traditional firewalls and signature-based devices such as
intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems.
TrafficShield is available as both a stand-alone system and as
an add-on software module for our BIG-IP product family.

WANJet

WANJet, acquired with the purchase of Swan Labs on
October 4, 2005, combines WAN optimization and traffic
shaping in a single device to accelerate file transfers, email,
data replication, and other applications over IP networks. It
provides LAN-like performance on any WAN, ensuring predictable
application performance for all users, and encrypts and secures
all transfers without performance penalties. WANJet is deployed
as dual-sided (symmetric) solution that optimizes
application traffic to and from data centers and branch offices.

WebAccelerator

WebAccelerator, also acquired through our purchase of Swan Labs,
speeds web transactions end-to-end by optimizing individual
network object requests, connections, and end-to-end
transactions from the browser through to databases. Installed
single-sided (asymmetric) in the data center, or dual-sided
(symmetric) in the data center and in branch locations,
WebAccelerator enhances web application performance from any
location, speeding up interactive performance, improving
download times, utilizing bandwidth more efficiently, and
dramatically reducing the cost and improving the response time
of delivering Web-enabled applications to the distributed users.

Currently both WANJet and WebAccelerator run on Swan Labs’
SL400 hardware platform in the data center and SL 200 platforms
in branch locations. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we plan
to port both WANJet and WebAccelerator software to run on TMOS
and our standard F5 hardware platforms and to integrate their
technology with our other products.

Enabling Technologies

Our application delivery networking products come equipped with
iControl and iControl Services Manager functions, which are
designed to facilitate the broader use of our products. iControl
allows customers and independent software vendors to modify
their programs to communicate with our products, eliminating the
need for human involvement, lowering the cost of performing
basic network functions and



reducing the likelihood of error. Although we do not derive
revenue from iControl itself, the sale of iControl-enabled
applications by independent software vendors such as Microsoft
and Oracle helps promote and often leads directly to the sale of
our other products.

iControl Services Manager takes advantage of iControl to provide
a single, centralized management and operational interface for
our devices. This feature allows customers with dozens or
hundreds of our products to upgrade or modify the software on
those products simultaneously from a single console. This lowers
the cost and simplifies the task of deploying, managing and
maintaining our products and reduces the likelihood of error
when blanket changes are implemented.

Product Development

We believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain
technology leadership by constantly improving our products and
by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our
customers. Our product development group employs a standard
process for the development, documentation and quality control
of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals.
This process includes working with management, product
marketing, customers and partners to identify new or improved
solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable
markets.

Our principal software engineering group is located in our
headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Our core FirePass product
development team is located in San Jose, California. Our
core TrafficShield product development team is located in Tel
Aviv, Israel. Our hardware engineering group is located in
Spokane, Washington. The primary product development facility
for WANJet and WebAccelerator is in San Jose, California.
There is also a smaller development facility for these products
in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Members of these teams collaborate
closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and
performance of our hardware and software systems. In fiscal
2006, we plan to relocate our San Jose development teams to
a single facility.

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and
2003, we had research and product development expenses of
$31.3 million, $24.4 million and $19.2 million,
respectively.

Customers

Our customers include a wide variety of enterprise customers
(Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global 1000 companies)
including those in telecommunications, financial services,
technology, manufacturing, transportation and government. In
fiscal year 2005, international sales represented 40.5% of our
net revenues. Refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial
statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for
additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area.

Consistent with our goal of building a strong channel sales
model, the majority of our revenue is generated by sales through
our distributors and value-added resellers. For fiscal year
2005, sales to Ingram Micro Inc., one of our distributors,
represented 18.6% of our revenues. Our agreement with Ingram
Micro is a standard, non-exclusive distribution agreement that
renews automatically on an annual basis and is terminable by
either party with 30 days’ prior written notice. The
agreement grants Ingram Micro the right to distribute our
products to resellers in North America and certain other
territories internationally, with no minimum purchase
requirements.

Sales and Marketing

Sales

We sell our products and services to large enterprise customers
through a variety of channels, including distributors,
value-added resellers and systems integrators. A substantial
amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2005 was derived from
these channel sales. We also sell our products and services to
major accounts through our own direct sales force. Our
agreements with our channel partners are not exclusive and do
not prevent them from selling competitive products. These
agreements typically have terms of one



year with no obligation to renew, and typically do not provide
for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements.

Direct sales.

Our field sales personnel are located in
major cities throughout the Americas; Europe, the Middle East,
and Africa (EMEA); Japan and the Asia Pacific region. The inside
sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales
managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison
between the field and internal corporate resources. We sell our
products directly to a limited group of customers, primarily
large enterprise end-users whose accounts are managed by our
major account services team. Field systems engineers also
support our regional sales managers and channel partners by
participating in joint sales calls and providing pre-sale
technical resources as needed.

Distributor and value-added reseller relationships.

We
have established relationships with large national and
international distributors, local and specialized distributors
and value-added resellers from which we derive the majority of
our sales. The distributors sell our products, and the
value-added resellers not only sell our products, but also
assist their customers in network design, installation and
testing. Our field sales personnel will work closely with our
channel partners to assist them, if necessary, in the selling of
our products to their customers.

Systems integrators.

We also market our products through
strategic relationships we have with systems integrators.
Systems integrators leverage products like ours as a core
component of application or network-based solutions that they
deploy for their customers. In most cases, systems integrators
do not directly purchase our products for resell to their
customers. Instead they typically recommend our products as part
of a broader solution. An example of this approach would be
packaged enterprise resource platform, ERP, or customer
relationship management, CRM, solutions delivered by systems
integrators where our traffic management products provide high
availability and increased performance for the ERP or CRM
applications.

Marketing

There are two primary aspects to our marketing strategy. First,
we believe our future success depends on our ability to
understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable
markets and that we develop valuable solutions to address those
needs. Our marketing organization works directly with customers,
partners and our product development teams to identify and
create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership
position. The second aspect is to continue to build upon our
iControl strategy. We have established relationships with
various independent software vendors who have adapted their
applications to interact with our products via the iControl
interface. iControl enhances the functionality of third party
applications by enabling them to control the network in an
automated way, based on business policies and rules associated
with the application. As a result, customers who purchase
iControl-enabled applications have an incentive to purchase our
products in order to take advantage of the enhanced
functionality made possible through our technical cooperation.
We also offer an on-line community website called DevCentral
that provides technical resources to customers, prospects and
partners wanting to extend and optimize F5 solutions using
iControl to meet their specific needs.

We also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives
aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of
our technology and products. These include actively
participating in industry trade shows and briefing industry
analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products,
and on new business and technology partnerships. In addition, we
market our products to chief information officers and other
information technology professionals through targeted
advertising, direct mail and high-profile Web events.

Backlog

At the end of fiscal years 2005 and 2004, we had product backlog
of approximately $11.7 million and $10.6 million,
respectively. Backlog represents orders confirmed with a
purchase order for products to be shipped generally within
90 days to customers with approved credit status. Orders
are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers or
product specification changes by the customers. Although we



believe that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be
cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant
penalty. For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at
any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues.

Customer Service and Technical Support

We believe that our ability to provide consistent, high-quality
customer service and technical support is a key factor in
attracting and retaining large enterprise customers. Accordingly
we offer a broad range of support services that include
installation, phone support, hardware repair and replacement,
software updates, consulting and training services. We deliver
these services directly to end users and also utilize a
multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our
channel partners when applicable. Our technical support staff is
strategically located in regional service centers to support our
global customer base.

Prior to the installation of our products, our services
personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and
determine the best way to deploy our products and configure
product features and functions to meet those needs. Our services
personnel also provide on-site installation and training
services to help customers make optimal use of product features
and functions.

Our customers typically purchase a one-year maintenance contract
which entitles them to an array of services provided by our
technical support team. Maintenance services provided under the
contract include online updates, software error correction
releases, hardware repair and replacement, and remote support
through a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week help desk,
although not all service contracts entitle a customer to
round-the-clock call center support. Updates to our software are
only available to customers with a current maintenance contract.
Our technical support team also offers seminars and training
classes for customers on the configuration and use of products,
including local and wide area network system administration and
management. In addition, we have a professional services team
able to provide a full range of fee-based consulting services,
including comprehensive network management, documentation and
performance analysis, and capacity planning to assist in
predicting future network requirements.

We also offer, as part of our maintenance service, an online,
automated, self-help customer support function called Ask F5
that allows customers to answer many commonly asked questions
without having to call our support desk. This allows the
customer to rapidly address issues and questions, while
significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk.
This enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while
keeping our support-related expenses at a manageable, consistent
level.

Manufacturing

We outsource the manufacturing of our pre-configured hardware
platforms to contract manufacturers, primarily Solectron
Corporation, for assembly according to our specifications. The
contract manufacturers install our software onto the hardware
platforms and conduct functionality testing, quality assurance
and documentation control prior to shipping our products. Our
agreement with Solectron allows them to procure component
inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production
forecast. Subcontractors supply Solectron with standard parts
and components for our products based on our production
forecast. We are contractually obligated to purchase component
inventory that our contract manufacturer procures in accordance
with the forecast, unless we give notice of order cancellation
in advance of applicable lead times. As protection against
component shortages and to provide replacement parts for our
service teams, we also stock limited supplies of certain key
components for our products.

Hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of
commodity parts and certain custom components designed and
approved by our hardware engineering group. Most of our
components are purchased from sources which we believe are
readily available from other suppliers. However, several
components used in the assembly of our products are purchased
from single or limited sources such as our proprietary Layer 4
ASIC that is manufactured for us by a third party contract
semiconductor foundry.



Competition

As the increasing breadth of our product offerings has enabled
us to address a broader array of opportunities within the
overall Application Delivery Networking market, our competition
has become more numerous and more diverse. Our principal
competitor in the traffic management market is
Cisco Systems, Inc. Other competitors in this market
include Nortel Networks Corporation, Juniper Networks, Inc.
(which acquired Redline Networks, Inc.), Citrix Systems, Inc.
(which acquired Netscaler), Foundry Networks, Inc. and Radware
Ltd. In the adjacent WAN optimization and application
acceleration markets, we compete mainly with Juniper (which
recently acquired Peribit Systems), Cisco (which recently
acquired FineGround), and increasingly Packeteer, Inc.

In the SSL VPN market, we compete with Juniper, Citrix, Aventail
Corporation, Nokia, Nortel, and Symantec and a number of smaller
players. Because SSL VPNs are a potential replacement for
IPSec VPNs, the most widely deployed solution for secure
remote access today, we also compete with Check Point Software
Technologies, Ltd. which along with Juniper are the market
leaders in IPSec VPNs.

Application firewalls represent an emerging market opportunity
that is populated mainly by private, early-development-stage
companies. One of these companies, Teros, Inc., was recently
acquired by Citrix Systems. As we enter this market with
our TrafficShield products, we anticipate that we will also
encounter competition from vendors of traditional firewalls and
other types of security devices, many of which are larger and
better-known vendors than we are.

Some of our competitors have a longer operating history and
greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than
we do. These larger competitors also have a more extensive
customer base and broader customer relationships, including
relationships with many of our current and potential customers.
In addition, many have large, well-established, worldwide
customer support and professional services organizations and a
more extensive direct sales force and sales channels. Because of
our relatively smaller size, market presence and resources, our
larger competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we
can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
requirements. There is also the possibility that these companies
may adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share. As a
result, our competitors could undermine our ability to win new
customers and maintain our existing customer base.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our
intellectual property rights. We have obtained three patents in
the United States and have applications pending for various
aspects of our technology. Our future success depends in part on
our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the
technologies used in our principal products. Despite our efforts
to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may
attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use
trade secrets or other information that we regard as
proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do
not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of
the United States. We cannot assure you that any issued patent
will preserve our proprietary position, or that competitors or
others will not develop technologies similar to or superior to
our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect our
intellectual property rights could harm our business, operating
results and financial condition.

In addition to our own proprietary software, we incorporate
software licensed from several third-party sources into our
products. These licenses generally renew automatically on an
annual basis. We believe that alternative technologies for this
licensed software are available both domestically and
internationally.

Employees

As of September 30, 2005, we employed 792 full-time
persons, including 217 in product development, 331 in sales and
marketing, 147 in professional services and technical support
and 97 in finance, administration and operations. None of our
employees are represented by a labor union. We have experienced
no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are
good.

Item 2.

Properties

Our principal administrative, sales, marketing, research and
development facilities are located in Seattle, Washington and
consist of approximately 195,000 square feet. In April
2000, we amended and restated the lease agreement on two
buildings for our corporate headquarters. The lease commenced in
July 2000 on the first building; and the lease on the second
building commenced in September 2000. The lease for both
buildings expires in 2012 with an option for renewal. The lease
for the second building has been fully subleased through 2012.
We believe that our existing properties are in good condition
and suitable for the conduct of our business. We also lease
office space for our product development personnel in Spokane,
Washington, San Jose, California, Israel, Northern Ireland,
and Russia and for our sales and support personnel in Washington
D.C., New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, Taiwan, Malaysia,
South Korea, Japan, Australia, Germany, France, and the United
Kingdom. We believe that our future growth can be accommodated
by current facilities or by leasing additional space if
necessary.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

In July and August 2001, a series of putative securities class
action lawsuits were filed in United States District Court,
Southern District of New York against certain investment banking
firms that underwrote the Company’s initial and secondary
public offerings, the Company and some of the Company’s
officers and directors. These cases, which have been
consolidated under In re F5 Networks, Inc. Initial Public
Offering Securities Litigation, No. 01 CV 7055, assert that
the registration statements for the Company’s June 4,
1999 initial public offering and September 30, 1999
secondary offering failed to disclose certain alleged improper
actions by the underwriters for the offerings. The consolidated,
amended complaint alleges claims against the Company and those
of our officers and directors named in the complaint under
Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, and under
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Other lawsuits have been filed making similar allegations
regarding the public offerings of more than 300 other companies.
All of these various consolidated cases have been coordinated
for pretrial purposes as In re Initial Public Offering
Securities Litigation, Civil Action No. 21-MC-92. In
October 2002, the directors and officers were dismissed without
prejudice. The issuer defendants filed a coordinated motion to



dismiss these lawsuits in July 2002, which the Court granted in
part and denied in part in an order dated February 19,
2003. The Court declined to dismiss the Section 11 and
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims against the
Company. In June 2004, a stipulation of settlement for the
claims against the issuer defendants, including the Company, was
submitted to the Court. On August 31, 2005, the Court
granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement
is subject to a number of conditions, including final approval
by the Court. If the settlement does not occur, and litigation
against us continues, we believe we have meritorious defenses
and intend to defend the case vigorously. Securities class
action litigation could result in substantial costs and divert
our management’s attention and resources. Due to the
inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately
predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation, and any
unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and operating results.

We are not aware of any additional pending legal proceedings
that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating
results, or financial condition. We may in the future be party
to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business,
including claims that we allegedly infringe upon third-party
trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Such claims,
even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of
significant financial and managerial resources.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and
related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a global provider of software and hardware products and
services that help companies efficiently and securely manage
their Internet traffic. Our products enhance the delivery,
optimization and security of application traffic on
Internet-based networks. We market and sell our products
primarily through indirect sales channels in the Americas
(primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and
Africa (EMEA); Japan and the Asia Pacific region. Enterprise
customers (Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global
1000 companies) in financial services, transportation,
government and telecommunications industries continue to make up
the largest percentage of our customer base.

During the fiscal year 2005, we announced plans to acquire all
of the common stock of Swan Labs, Inc. for cash of
$43.0 million. The merger closed on October 4, 2005,
subsequent to our year end. As a result of the transaction, we
acquired all the assets of Swan Labs, including its principal
products, WANJet and WebAccelerator. WANJet devices are deployed
in data centers and branch offices to speed up file transfers,
email, and the performance of any IP-based application that runs
over a Wide Area Network, or WAN. WebAccelerator works in
concert with WANJet to speed up the performance of IP-based
enterprise applications running over WANs. The acquisition of
Swan Labs expands our product line and gives us broader access
to the WAN optimization and web acceleration markets.

Our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance
indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our
financial and operating performance. Those indicators include:

•

Revenues.

The majority of our revenues are derived from
    sales of our core products; BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager; BIG-IP
    Global Traffic Manager; BIG-IP ISP Traffic Manager;
    TrafficShield Application Firewall, and FirePass SSL VPN
    servers. We also derive revenues from the sales of services
    including annual maintenance contracts, installation, training
    and consulting services. We carefully monitor the sales mix of
    our revenues within each reporting period. We believe customer
    acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements
    are key indicators



Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the
more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation
of our financial statements.

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue in accordance
with the guidance provided under Statement of Position
(SOP) No. 97-2, “Software Revenue
Recognition,” and SOP No. 98-9 “Modification of
SOP No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to
Certain Transactions,” Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 48, “Revenue Recognition
When Right of Return Exists,” and SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements,” and SAB No. 104,
“Revenue Recognition.”

We sell products through distributors, resellers, and directly
to end users. We recognize product revenue upon shipment, net of
estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be
probable and no significant obligations remain. In certain
regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate
returns, revenue is recognized upon sale to the end user. In
this situation, we receive a sales



report from the channel partner to determine when the sales
transaction to the end user has occurred. Payment terms to
domestic customers are generally net 30 days. Payment terms
to international customers range from net 30 to 90 days
based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual
markets. We have offered extended payment terms ranging from
three to six months to certain customers, in which case, revenue
is recognized when payments are made.

Whenever a software license, hardware, installation and
post-contract customer support (PCS) elements are combined
into a package with a single “bundled” price, a
portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the
bundled package based on their respective fair values as
determined when the individual elements are sold separately.
Revenues from the license of software are recognized when the
software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay
for the software. When rights of return are present and we
cannot estimate returns, we recognize revenue when such rights
of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the service contract term. PCS includes
rights to upgrades, when and if available, a limited period of
telephone support, updates, and bug fixes. Installation revenue
is recognized when the product has been installed at the
customer’s site. Consulting services are customarily billed
at fixed rates, plus out-of-pocket expenses, and revenues are
recognized when the consulting has been completed. Training
revenue is recognized when the training has been completed.

Reserve for Doubtful Accounts.

Estimates are used in
determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based
upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of
our remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In
determining these percentages, we evaluate historical
write-offs, current trends in the credit quality of our customer
base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We perform
ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial
condition and do not require any collateral. If there is
deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or
actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our
allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient.

Reserve for Product Returns.

In some instances, product
revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing
rights of return. Product returns are estimated based on
historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are
recognized. Accordingly, we reduce recognized revenue for
estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded. When
rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns,
revenue is recognized when such rights lapse. The estimates for
returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in
historical rates of returns, inventory in the distribution
channel and other related factors. It is possible that these
estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts
could vary from our estimates.

Reserve for Warranties.

A warranty reserve is established
based on our historical experience and an estimate of the
amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on
products sold as of the balance sheet date. While we believe
that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment
applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and
payable could differ materially from what will actually
transpire in the future.

Accounting for Income Taxes.

We utilize the liability
method of accounting for income taxes as set forth by Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes,” or SFAS 109. Accordingly, we are
required to estimate our income taxes in each of the
jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of
preparing our consolidated financial statements. This process
involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including
assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with
assessing temporary differences resulting from the different
treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These
differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due
to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with
the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is
possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in
the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and
adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows.

Stock-based compensation.

We adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Statement No. 123(R),

Share-Based
Payment

, (“FAS 123R”) on July 1, 2005,
and as a result recognized $4.6 million of expense related
to stock-based compensation charges included in operating
expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Prior to
July 1, 2005, we accounted for



share-based payments under the recognition and measurement
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”), and related
Interpretations, as permitted by FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“FAS 123”). In accordance with APB 25
no compensation cost was required to be recognized for options
granted that had an exercise price equal to the market value of
the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

We adopted FAS 123R using the
modified-prospective-transition method. Under that transition
method, compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year 2005
includes: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments
granted prior to, but not yet vested as of July 1, 2005,
based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
the original provisions of FAS 123, and
b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted
subsequent to July 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair
value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
FAS 123R. The results for the prior periods have not been
restated.

Effective July 1, 2005 we adopted the straight-line
attribution method for recognizing compensation expense.
Previously under the disclosure-only provisions of
SFAS 123, the Company used the accelerated method of
expense recognition pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 28,

Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable
Stock Option or Award Plans

(“FIN 28”). For
all unvested options outstanding as of July 1, 2005, the
previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense, based
on the fair value at the original grant date, will be recognized
on an accelerated basis over the remaining vesting period. For
share-based payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005,
compensation expense, based on the fair value on the date of
grant, will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period. As of September 30, 2005, there was
$32.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, the
majority of which will be recognized ratably over the next two
years. Going forward, stock compensation expenses may increase
as we issue additional equity-based awards to continue to
attract and retain key employees.

In addition, the Company recently modified the method in which
it issues incentive awards to its employees through stock-based
compensation. In prior years, stock-based compensation consisted
only of stock options. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2005, the Company began to grant restricted stock unit awards
instead of stock options. The value of restricted stock units is
determined using the intrinsic value method, which in this case,
is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of
our common stock on the date of grant. Alternatively, in
determining the fair value of stock options, we use the
Black-Scholes option pricing model that employs the following
key assumptions. Expected volatility is based on the annualized
daily historical volatility of our stock price, over the
expected life of the option. Expected term of the option is
based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior, the
vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of
ten years. Our stock price volatility and option lives involve
management’s best estimates at that time, both of which
impact the fair value of the option calculated under the
Black-Scholes methodology and, ultimately, the expense that will
be recognized over the life of the option.

SFAS 123R also requires that we recognize compensation
expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are
expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates
that are derived from historical employee termination behavior.
Our estimated forfeiture rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2005 is 5%. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from
those estimated by management, additional adjustments to
compensation expense may be required in future periods.



Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and
related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Net Revenues.

Total net revenues increased 64.4% in
fiscal year 2005 from fiscal year 2004, compared to an increase
of 47.7% in fiscal year 2004 from fiscal year 2003. The
improvement was due to increased demand for our application
delivery networking products and higher services revenues
resulting from our increased installed base of products. During
fiscal year 2005, each of our primary geographic regions
reported higher revenues compared to the prior year period.
International revenues represented 40.5%, 39.4% and 34.9% of net
revenues in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We
expect international sales will continue to represent a
significant portion of net revenues, although we cannot provide
assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net
revenues will remain at current levels.

Net product revenues increased 74.1% in fiscal year 2005 and
49.8% in fiscal year 2004 as compared to the previous fiscal
year, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2005 was primarily
due to absolute growth in the volume of product sales of our
BIG-IP product line as well as incremental revenues derived from
sales of our FirePass and TrafficShield product lines. Sales of
our BIG-IP family of application delivery networking products
represented 89.1%, 90.3%, and 99.3% of total product revenues in
fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease as
a percentage of total sales was due to an improvement in sales
of our other products, such as our FirePass products which
represented 9.7% of product revenues in fiscal year 2005.

Net service revenues increased 37.3% in fiscal year 2005
compared to a 42.0% increase for fiscal year 2004 from the prior
year, respectively. The decrease in the growth rate was due to
an increase in the amount of support services provided by our
channel partners. The increase of services revenues in absolute
dollars was the result of a growing customer base and continued
growth in service renewals from existing customers.



Ingram Micro Inc., one of our domestic distributors, accounted
for 18.6%, 19.1%, and 12.6% of our total net revenues in fiscal
years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Ingram Micro accounted
for 26.2%, 26.9% and 17.8% of our accounts receivable as of
September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Cost of Net Product Revenues.

Cost of net product
revenues consist of finished products purchased from our
contract manufacturers, manufacturing overhead, freight,
warranty, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, and
amortization expenses in connection with developed technology
from acquisitions. Cost of net product revenues as a percentage
of net product revenues remained relatively consistent at 22.3%
in fiscal year 2005 as compared to 22.5% and 21.2% in fiscal
years 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in absolute
dollars is consistent with the increase in product revenues for
the corresponding period. Higher indirect product costs
including amortization charges of our acquired technology and
warranty costs associated with the growth in overall product
installation base contributed to the percentage increase as
compared to fiscal year 2003.

Cost of Net Service Revenues.

Cost of net service
revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our
professional services staff, travel, facilities, and
depreciation expenses. Cost of net service revenues as a
percentage of net service revenues increased to 26.2% in fiscal
year 2005 as compared to 24.4% and 28.6% in fiscal years 2004
and 2003, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2005 is
primarily due to increased salary and benefits attributed to
growth in headcount. Professional services headcount at the end
of fiscal year 2005 increased to 147 from 124 at the end of
fiscal year 2004. Going forward, we expect to continue to
increase our cost of service revenues to support our expanded
product lines and growing customer base.



Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing expenses consist
of salaries, commissions and related benefits of our sales and
marketing staff, the costs of our marketing programs, including
public relations, advertising and trade shows, travel,
facilities and depreciation expenses. Stock-based compensation
charges for awards to our sales and marketing personnel are
included beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005.
The decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of
total net revenues is the result of leveraging our existing
sales and distribution infrastructure to support the increased
net revenues. In absolute dollars, sales and marketing expenses
increased 36.5% in fiscal year 2005 and 22.3% in fiscal year
2004 as compared to the previous fiscal year, respectively. The
increases were primarily due to higher commission and personnel
costs, consistent with the increased revenue and headcount for
the corresponding period. Sales and marketing headcount at the
end of fiscal 2005 increased to 331 from 229 at the end of
fiscal 2004 and 211 at the end of fiscal 2003. Stock-based
compensation charges of $1.8 million contributed to the
overall increase in fiscal year 2005. We expect to continue to
increase sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in
order to grow revenues and increase our market share.

Research and Development.

Research and development
expenses consist of the salaries and related benefits for our
product development personnel, prototype materials and expenses
related to the development of new and improved products,
facilities and depreciation expenses. In absolute dollars,
research and development expenses increased 28.7% in fiscal year
2005 and 26.6% in fiscal year 2004 as compared to the previous
fiscal year, respectively. The increases in fiscal years 2005
and 2004 were primarily due to higher salary and benefits costs
attributed to an increase in headcount to 217 in fiscal year
2005 from 185 in fiscal year 2004 and 145 in fiscal 2003. The
growth in employee headcount was primarily related to
enhancement of our current products and our ability to develop
new, technologically advanced products that meet the changing
needs of our customers. Stock-based compensation charges of
$1.3 million contributed to the overall increase in fiscal
year 2005. We expect to continue to increase research and
development expenses as our future success is dependent on the
continued development of our products.

General and Administrative.

General and administrative
expenses consist of the salaries, benefits and related costs of
our executive, finance, information technology, human resource
and legal personnel, third-party professional service fees, bad
debt charges, facilities, and depreciation expenses. The
decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage
of total net revenues is the result of leveraging our existing
corporate infrastructure to support the increased net revenues.
In absolute dollars, general and administrative expenses
increased 51.0% in fiscal year 2005 and increased 31.0% in
fiscal year 2004 as compared to the previous fiscal year,
respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2005 is due to
increased salary and benefit expenses of $2.6 million and
higher professional service fees of $1.9 million. The
increase in personnel costs is consistent with the growth in
headcount. General and administrative headcount at the end of
fiscal 2005 increased to 97 from 75 at the end of fiscal 2004.
Stock-based compensation charges of $1.1 million
contributed to the overall increase in fiscal year 2005. The
increase



in general and administrative expenses is expected to remain at
these increased levels as the Company continues to build its
infrastructure to support the worldwide growth of our business.

Other Income, Net.

Other income, net, consists of
interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and
losses. Other income, net, increased 195.7% in fiscal year 2005
and increased 263.6% in fiscal year 2004 as compared to the
previous fiscal year, respectively. The significant increase was
due to a combination of higher yields and increased investment
balances. The increased investment balances are the result of
cash provided from operating and financing activities during the
fiscal years 2005 and fiscal year 2004. Net proceeds of
$113.6 million received from the sale of common stock in a
public offering completed in November of 2003 was the most
significant addition to our investment balances.

Provision for Income Taxes.

We recorded a 35% provision
for income taxes for the fiscal year 2005. As of fiscal year-end
2005 we do not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred
tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate
because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to
be realized. In making this determination we have considered
projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible
tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a
valuation allowance. Our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal
year end 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $40.1 million,
$31.4 million and $0 million, respectively. Our world
wide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of
factors including variations in projected taxable income in our
geographic locations, changes in the valuation of our net
deferred tax assets, resolution of potential exposures,
introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws
or interpretations thereof. We have recorded liabilities to
address potential exposures related to business and income tax
positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing
authorities. The ultimate resolution of these potential
exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded
which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense.

In fiscal year 2004, the primary difference between the
statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate was due to
previously unrecognized deferred tax assets which were
recognized. SFAS 109, provides for the recognition of
deferred tax assets if realization is more likely than not.
Based on available evidence, which includes our historical
operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in
all prior years, we had provided for a full valuation allowance
against our deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal year 2003.
Based upon our operating performance in fiscal year 2004 and
projected future taxable income, we determined that our
U.S. deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be
realizable. Therefore, the valuation allowance was reversed and
as a result we realized an income tax benefit of
$7.3 million. The credit from the release of the valuation
allowance was partially offset by actual U.S. and international
tax



expenses resulting in a net benefit for income taxes of
$3.9 million in fiscal year 2004. The provision for income
taxes in fiscal year 2003 consisted primarily of taxes payable
in foreign jurisdictions.

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term
investments totaled $365.0 million as of September 30,
2005 compared to $222.3 million as of September 30,
2004, representing an increase of $142.7 million. The
increase was due to the cash flow from operations and cash from
employee stock option exercises. In fiscal year 2004, overall
cash and investments increased $143.3 million compared to
the fiscal year 2003. The increase was primarily due to the net
proceeds of $113.6 million from the sale of
5,175,000 shares of common stock in a public offering
completed in November 2003.

Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2005
was $85.0 million compared to $40.6 million in fiscal
year 2004 and $14.6 million in fiscal year 2003. Cash
provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash
generated from net income, after adjusting for non-cash charges,
changes in operating assets and liabilities and an increase in
advance payments from customers.

Cash used in investing activities was $126.8 million for
the fiscal year 2005, $164.7 million for fiscal year 2004
and $38.1 million for fiscal year 2003. The cash used in
the fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the purchase of
investments and property and equipment partially offset by the
sale of investments. The cash used in fiscal year 2004 was due
to the purchase of investments, primarily made possible by the
proceeds of our public offering, and the purchase of property
and equipment and the acquisition of MagniFire, partially offset
by the sale of investments. The cash used in fiscal year 2003
was primarily the result of the cash used to acquire
substantially all the assets of uRoam and the purchase of
investments and property and equipment partially offset by the
sale of investments.

Cash provided by financing activities was $68.9 million for
fiscal year 2005 compared to $138.5 million for fiscal year
2004 and $12.8 million for the fiscal year 2003. In fiscal
years 2005 and 2003, our financing activities consisted of cash
proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and
purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. During the
fiscal year 2004, our financing activities included
$113.6 million of net proceeds received from a public stock
offering as well as cash received from the exercise of employee
stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase
plan.

We expect that our existing cash and investment balances and
cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated
working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable
future.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-1,
“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments.” EITF 03-1
provides guidance on other-than-temporary impairment models for
marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under
SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities,” and SFAS No. 124,
“Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit
Organizations,” and non-marketable equity securities
accounted for under the cost method. The EITF developed a basic
three-step model to evaluate whether an investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired. On September 30, 2004, the
FASB approved the issuance of FASB Staff Position
(FSP) EITF 03-1-1, which delays the effective date
until additional guidance is issued for the application of the
recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1 to
investments in securities that are impaired. In November 2005,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application
to Certain Investments.” This FSP addresses the
determination as to when an investment is considered impaired,
whether the impairment is other than temporary and the
measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically
nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10-18 of
EITF 03-1 and references existing other-than-temporary
impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective
for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and
the Company continued to apply relevant
“other-than-temporary” guidance as provided for in FSP
EITF 03-1-1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not expect
the adoption of FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 to have a
material effect on the Company’s results of operations or
financial condition.

In May of 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections — A
Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement
No. 3,” which changes the requirements for the
accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle.
The Statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting
principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement
in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include
specific transition provisions. This Statement requires
retrospective application to prior periods’ financial
statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is
impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or
the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is
effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made
in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The
Company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a
material impact on the Company’s financial condition or
results of operations.



Risk Factors

In addition to the other information in this report, the
following risk factors should be carefully considered in
evaluating our company and its business.

Our success depends on our timely development of new products
and features, market acceptance of new product offerings and
proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our
products

We expect the application delivery networking market to be
characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new
product introductions, changes in customer requirements and
evolving industry standards. Our continued success depends on
our ability to identify and develop new products and new
features for our existing products to meet the demands of these
changes, and for those products and features to be accepted by
our existing and target customers. If we are unable to identify,
develop and deploy new products and new product features on a
timely basis, our business and results of operations may be
harmed.

In September 2004, we announced the release of our
next-generation BIG-IP product featuring the Traffic Management
Operating System, or TMOS. This major new version of BIG-IP
represented the culmination of over two years of research and
development efforts. TMOS is specifically designed to facilitate
the development and integration of application delivery
functions as modules that can be added to BIG-IP’s core
functionality to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer needs.
We currently offer software modules as add-ons for this product
and our continued success depends significantly on our ability
to integrate new modules and functionality onto this platform
and the acceptance of the new hardware and software platforms
associated with this release by our existing and target
customers.

The current life cycle of our products is typically 12 to
24 months. The introduction of new products or product
enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing
products, or replace sales of some of our current products,
thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product
introduction, and may cause customers to defer purchasing our
existing products in anticipation of the new products. This
could harm our operating results by decreasing sales, increasing
our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to
greater risk of product obsolescence. We have also experienced,
and may in the future experience, delays in developing and
releasing new products and product enhancements. This has led
to, and may in the future lead to, delayed sales, increased
expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated. Also, in
the development of our products, we have experienced delays in
the prototyping of our products, which in turn has led to delays
in product introductions. In addition, complexity and
difficulties in managing product transitions at the end-of-life
stage of a product can create excess inventory of components
associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased
expenses. Any or all of the above problems could materially harm
our business and operating results.

Our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our
BIG-IP product lines

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, we derived
89.1% of our product revenues from sales of our BIG-IP family of
application delivery networking product lines. We expect to
derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of
our BIG-IP products in the future. Implementation of our
strategy depends upon BIG-IP being able to solve critical
network availability and performance problems of our customers.
If BIG-IP is unable to solve these problems for our customers or
if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in
BIG-IP’s product feature set needed to maintain leadership
in what will continue to be a competitive market environment,
our business and results of operations will be harmed.

We may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging
application delivery networking market

The markets we serve are new, rapidly evolving and highly
competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify
in the future. Our principal competitors in the application
delivery networking market include Cisco Systems, Inc., Nortel
Networks Corporation, Foundry Networks, Inc., Citrix Systems,
Inc., Radware Ltd. and Juniper Networks, Inc. We expect to
continue to face additional competition as new



participants enter our market. In addition, larger companies
with significant resources, brand recognition and sales channels
may form alliances with or acquire competing application
delivery networking solutions and emerge as significant
competitors. Potential competitors may bundle their products or
incorporate an Internet traffic management or security component
into existing products in a manner that discourages users from
purchasing our products.

Our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and
may cause our stock price to fluctuate

Our quarterly and annual operating results have varied
significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the
future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future
operating results. In particular, we anticipate that the size of
customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger
business accounts. A delay in the recognition of revenue, even
from just one account, may have a significant negative impact on
our results of operations for a given period. In the past, a
majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a
quarter. Accordingly, a delay in an anticipated sale past the
end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of
operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that year.
Additionally, we have exposure to the credit risks of some of
our customers and sub-tenants. Although we have programs in
place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated
risk, there can be no assurance that such programs will be
effective in reducing our credit risks adequately. We monitor
individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements,
seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our
customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate
to cover exposure for potential losses. If there is a
deterioration of a sub-tenant’s or major customer’s
creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected
future resulting losses, if incurred, could harm our business
and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Further, our operating results may be below the expectations of
securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years.
Our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the
market price of our common stock.

The average selling price of our products may decrease and
our costs may increase, which may negatively impact gross
profits

It is possible that the average selling prices of our products
will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing
pressures, increased sales discounts, new product introductions
by us or our competitors or other factors. Therefore, in order
to maintain our gross profits, we must develop and introduce new
products and product enhancements on a timely basis and
continually reduce our product costs. Our failure to do so will
cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline, which will
harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we may
experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future
operating results due to the erosion of our average selling
prices.

It is difficult to predict our future operating results
because we have an unpredictable sales cycle

Our products have a lengthy sales cycle, which is difficult to
predict. Historically, our sales cycle has ranged from
approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as
we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise
market. Also, as our distribution strategy has evolved into more
of a channel model, utilizing value-added resellers,
distributors and systems integrators, the level of variability
in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased
and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our
sales transactions. Sales of our products require us to educate
potential customers in their use and benefits. Sales of our
products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal
budgeting, approval and competitive evaluation processes that
large corporations and governmental entities may require. For
example, customers frequently begin by evaluating our products
on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our
products before they decide whether or not to purchase.
Customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated
releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or
us. As a result, our products have an unpredictable sales cycle
that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating
results.



Our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are
not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or
if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired

We rely on third party contract manufacturers to assemble our
products. We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware
platforms to contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware
platforms to our specifications. We have experienced minor
delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past.
However, if we experience major delays in the future or other
problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of
product, any one or a combination of these factors may harm our
business and results of operations. The inability of our
contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of
our products or the loss of our contract manufacturer may cause
a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a
replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results
of operations. In particular, because we subcontract
substantially all of our manufacturing to a single contract
manufacturer, with whom we do not have a long-term contract, any
termination, loss or impairment in our arrangement with this
single source of hardware assembly, or any impairment of their
facilities or operations, would harm our business, financial
condition and results of operation.

If the demand for our products grows, we will need to increase
our raw material and component purchases, contract manufacturing
capacity and internal test and quality control functions. Any
disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue, may harm our
competitive position and may result in additional costs or
cancellation of orders by our customers.

Our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or
delays in the supply of hardware components from our third-party
sources

We currently purchase several hardware components used in the
assembly of our products from a number of single or limited
sources. Lead times for these components vary significantly. The
unavailability of suitable components, any interruption or delay
in the supply of any of these hardware components, or the
inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources
at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, may delay
assembly and sales of our products and, hence, our revenues, and
may harm our business and results of operations.

We may not adequately protect our intellectual property and
our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of
third parties

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential
and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property
rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and
use our products or technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of
our products is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the
steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our
technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may
not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United
States.

Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number
of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding
patent and other intellectual property rights. In the ordinary
course of our business, we are involved in disputes and
licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed
proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always
successfully defend ourselves against such claims. If we are
found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, or if we
otherwise settle such claims, we could be compelled to pay
damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those
intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they
no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights. Any license
could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at
all. Similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid
infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical. In
addition, we have initiated, and may in the future initiate,
claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of
our proprietary rights, to determine the scope and validity of
our proprietary rights or those of our competitors. Any of these
claims, whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary
rights of others, or vice versa, with or without merit, may be
time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of
technical and management personnel or require us to cease using
infringing technology, develop non-infringing



technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
Further, our license agreements typically require us to
indemnify our customers, distributors and resellers for
infringement actions related to our technology, which could
cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against
our customers, distributors or resellers. Any of the
above-described circumstances relating to intellectual property
rights disputes could result in our business and results of
operations being harmed.

Many of our products include intellectual property licensed from
third parties. In the future, it may be necessary to renew
licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new
licenses for other technology. These third party licenses may
not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. The
inability to obtain certain licenses, or litigation regarding
the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related
intellectual property issues, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition. Furthermore, we license some third party intellectual
property on a non-exclusive basis and this may limit our ability
to protect our intellectual property rights in our products.

We may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution
relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to a significant
distribution partner could hurt our business

Our sales strategy requires that we establish and maintain
multiple distribution channels in the United States and
internationally through leading industry resellers, systems
integrators, Internet service providers and other channel
partners. We have a limited number of agreements with companies
in these channels, and we may not be able to increase our number
of distribution relationships or maintain our existing
relationships. If we are unable to establish or maintain our
indirect sales channels, our business and results of operations
will be harmed. In addition, one domestic distributor of our
products accounted for 18.6% and 19.1% of our total net revenue
for the fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. A substantial
reduction or delay in sales of our products to this or any other
key distribution partner could harm our business, operating
results and financial condition.

Undetected software errors may harm our business and results
of operations

Software products frequently contain undetected errors when
first introduced or as new versions are released. We have
experienced these errors in the past in connection with new
products and product upgrades. We expect that these errors will
be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after
commencement of commercial shipments. These problems may cause
us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the
attention of our engineering personnel from our product
development efforts and cause significant customer relations
problems. We may also be subject to liability claims for damages
related to product errors. While we carry insurance policies
covering this type of liability, these policies may not provide
sufficient protection should a claim be asserted. A material
product liability claim may harm our business and results of
operations.

Our products must successfully operate with products from other
vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may
be difficult to identify the source of the problem. The
occurrence of software errors, whether caused by our products or
another vendor’s products, may result in the delay or loss
of market acceptance of our products. The occurrence of any of
these problems may harm our business and results of operations.

Our operating results are exposed to risks associated with
international commerce

As our international sales increase, our operating results
become more exposed to international operating risks. These
risks include risks related to potential recessions in economies
outside the United States, foreign currency exchange rates,
managing foreign sales offices, regulatory, political, or
economic conditions in specific countries, military conflict or
terrorist activities, changes in laws and tariffs, inadequate
protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries,
foreign regulatory requirements, and natural disasters. All of
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our
business. We intend to continue expanding into international
markets. International sales represented 40.5% and 39.4% of our
net revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005
and 2004, respectively. In particular, in fiscal



year 2005, we derived 13.7% of our total revenue from the
Japanese market. This revenue is dependent on a number of
factors outside our control, including the viability and success
of our resellers and the strength of the Japanese economy.

Changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect
our revenues

Our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by
the United States and various foreign governments including, but
not limited to, environmental regulations and regulations
implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the
import or export of some technologies, especially encryption
technology. Changes in governmental regulation and our inability
or failure to obtain required approvals, permits or
registrations could harm our international and domestic sales
and adversely affect our revenues, business and operations.

Acquisitions, including our recent acquisition of Swan Labs,
present many risks and we may not realize the financial and
strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the
transaction

With respect to our acquisitions, as well as any other future
acquisitions we may undertake, we may find that the acquired
assets do not further our business strategy as expected, or that
we paid more than what the assets are later worth, or that
economic conditions change, all of which may generate future
impairment charges. There may be difficulty integrating the
operations and personnel of the acquired business, and we may
have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired
business. We may have difficulty in incorporating the acquired
technologies or products with our existing product lines. Our
ongoing business and management’s attention may be
disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and
the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse
locations. We may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards,
controls, procedures and policies across locations. We may
experience significant problems or liabilities associated with
the product quality, technology and other matters.

Our inability to successfully operate and integrate
newly-acquired businesses appropriately, effectively and in a
timely manner, or to retain key personnel of any acquired
business, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated
traffic management and security solutions and other advances in
technology, as well as on our revenues, gross margins and
expenses.

Our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to
attract and retain qualified sales and marketing, operations,
product development and professional services personnel

Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued
contributions of our key management, product development, sales,
marketing and finance personnel, many of whom may be difficult
to replace. The complexity of our application delivery
networking products and their integration into existing networks
and ongoing support, as well as the sophistication of our sales
and marketing effort, requires us to retain highly trained
professional services, customer support and sales personnel.
Competition for qualified professional services, customer
support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because
of the limited number of people available with the necessary
technical skills and understanding of our products. Our ability
to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by
volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock, since
these employees are generally granted stock options. The loss of
services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain
and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in
hiring qualified personnel, may harm our business and results of
operations.

We face litigation risks

We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business.
Litigation in general, and intellectual property and securities
litigation in particular, can be expensive, lengthy and
disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results
of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
Responding to the



allegations has been, and will likely continue to be, expensive
and time-consuming for us. An unfavorable resolution of the
lawsuits could adversely affect our business, results of
operations, or financial condition.

Anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a
third party to acquire us

Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the
price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions,
including voting rights, of those shares without any further
vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of
common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected
by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be
issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have
the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of
control of our company without further action by our
stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other
rights of the holders of common stock. Further, certain
provisions of our bylaws, including a provision limiting the
ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of
stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect
of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of
our company, which could have an adverse effect on the market
price of our common stock. In addition, our articles of
incorporation provide for a staggered board, which may make it
more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of
directors. Similarly, state anti-takeover laws in the State of
Washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a
change of control of our company.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk.

Our cash equivalents consist of
high-quality securities, as specified in our investment policy
guidelines. The policy limits the amount of credit exposure to
any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5% of the total
portfolio with the exception of U.S. treasury securities,
commercial paper and money market funds, which are exempt from
size limitation. The policy requires investments in securities
that mature in three years or less, with the average maturity
being no greater than one and a half years. These securities are
subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if
interest rates increase. A decrease of one percent in the
average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of
approximately $2.6 million in our interest income for the
fiscal year 2005.

Foreign Currency Risk.

The majority of our sales and
expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result,
we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction
gains and losses to date. While we have conducted some
transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2005 and expect to continue to do so, we do
not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses
will be significant at our current level of operations. However,
as we continue to expand our operations internationally,
transaction gains or losses may become significant in the
future. We have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date.
However, we may do so in the future.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

F5 NETWORKS, INC.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of F5 Networks, Inc.

We have completed an integrated audit of F5 Networks,
Inc.’s 2005 consolidated financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2005 and audits of its 2004 and 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of F5 Networks, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (the Company) at September 30, 2005 and 2004,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended September 30,
2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2005
based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the



assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The Company

F5 Networks, Inc., (“the Company”) provides products
and services to help companies efficiently and securely manage
their Internet traffic. The Company’s products improve the
performance, availability and security of applications running
on Internet-based networks. Internet traffic between servers
running applications and clients using these applications passes
through the Company’s products where the content is
inspected to ensure that it is safe and modified as necessary to
ensure that it is delivered securely and in a way that optimizes
the performance of both the network and the applications. The
Company also offers a broad range of services such as
consulting, training, installation, maintenance, and other
technical support services.

Certain Risks and Uncertainties

The Company’s products and services are concentrated in
highly competitive markets characterized by rapid technological
advances, frequent changes in customer requirements and evolving
regulatory requirements and industry standards. Failure to
anticipate or respond adequately to technological advances,
changes in customer requirements and changes in regulatory
requirements or industry standards could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s business and operating results.
Additionally, certain other factors could affect the
Company’s future operating results and cause actual results
to differ materially from expectations, including but not
limited to, the timely development, introduction and acceptance
of additional new products and features by the Company or its
competitors; competitive pricing pressures, increased sales
discounts; the Company’s ability to sustain, develop and
effectively utilize distribution relationships; the
Company’s ability to attract, train and retain qualified
personnel; the Company’s ability to expand in international
markets, and the unpredictability of the Company’s sales
cycle.

Accounting Principles

The Company’s consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes are prepared on the accrual basis of
accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances
to conform to the current period presentation. The
reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net
income or shareholders’ equity.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date
of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are
used in accounting for revenue recognition, reserves for
doubtful accounts, product returns, obsolete and excess
inventory, warranties, valuation allowance on deferred tax
assets and purchase price allocations. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. The Company invests its cash and cash equivalents
in deposits with three major financial institutions, which, at
times, exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not
experienced any losses on its cash and cash equivalents.

Investments

The Company classifies its investment securities as available
for sale. Investment securities, consisting of corporate and
municipal bonds and notes and United States government
securities, are reported at fair value with the related
unrealized gains and losses included as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
shareholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and
declines in value of securities judged to be other than
temporary are included in other income (expense). The cost of
investments for purposes of computing realized and unrealized
gains and losses is based on the specific identification method.
Investments in securities with maturities of less than one year
or where management’s intent is to use the investments to
fund current operations are classified as short-term
investments. Investments with maturities of greater than one
year are classified as long-term investments.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company extends credit to customers and is therefore subject
to credit risk. The Company performs initial and ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and does
not require collateral. An allowance for doubtful accounts is
recorded to account for potential bad debts. Estimates are used
in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based
upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of
remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In determining
these percentages, the Company evaluates historical write-offs,
and current trends in customer credit quality, as well as
changes in credit policies.

The Company maintains its cash and investment balances with high
credit quality financial institutions.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Short-term and long-term investments are recorded at fair value
as the underlying securities are classified as available for
sale and marked-to-market at each reporting period. The fair
value is determined using quoted market prices for the
securities held.

Inventories

The Company outsources the manufacturing of its pre-configured
hardware platforms to contract manufacturers, who assemble each
product to the Company’s specifications. As protection
against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for
its service teams, the Company also stocks limited supplies of
certain key product components. The Company reduces inventory to
net realizable value based on excess and obsolete inventories
determined primarily by historical usage and forecasted demand.
Inventories consist of hardware and related component parts and
are recorded at the lower of cost or market (as determined by
the first-in, first-out method).

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated
fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date.
The Company has adopted the requirements of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS No. 142).
SFAS No. 142 requires goodwill to be tested for
impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in
certain circumstances, and written down when impaired. Goodwill
of $24.2 million was recorded in connection with the
acquisition of uRoam, Inc. in fiscal year 2003 and goodwill of
$25.5 million was recorded in connection



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

with the acquisition of MagniFire Websystems Inc., in fiscal
year 2004. The Company completed its annual impairment test in
the second quarter of each fiscal year and concluded that there
was no impairment of goodwill in either fiscal year 2005 or 2004.

Other Assets

Other assets primarily consist of software development costs and
acquired technology.

Software development costs are charged to research and
development expense until technological feasibility is
established. The Company accounts for internally-generated
software development costs in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86,
“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased or Otherwise Marketed.” Thereafter, until the
product is released for sale, software development costs are
capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net
realizable value of each product. The establishment of
technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of
recoverability of costs require considerable judgment by the
Company with respect to certain internal and external factors,
including, but not limited to, anticipated future gross product
revenues, estimated economic life and changes in hardware and
software technology. The Company did not capitalize any software
development costs in fiscal year 2005. During the fiscal year
2004, the Company capitalized $424,000 of software development
costs. Related amortization costs of $272,000, $328,000, and
$298,000 were recorded during the fiscal years 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively.

Acquired technology is recorded at cost and amortized over its
estimated useful life of five years. Acquired technology of
$5.0 million in fiscal year 2004 and $3.0 million in
fiscal year 2003 was recorded in connection with the
acquisitions of MagniFire and uRoam, respectively. Related
amortization expense, which is charged to cost of product
revenues, totaled $1.6 million, $1.0 million and
$100,000 during the fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets
whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
When such events occur, management determines whether there has
been an impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted net
future cash flows to the related asset’s carrying value. If
an impairment exists, the asset is written down to its estimated
fair value.

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s products are integrated with software that is
essential to the functionality of the equipment. Accordingly,
the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the guidance
provided under Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2,
“Software Revenue Recognition,” and SOP No. 98-9
“Modification of SOP No. 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions,”
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 48, “Revenue Recognition When Right of
Return Exists,” and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
(SAB) No. 104, “Revenue Recognition.”

The Company sells products through distributors, resellers, and
directly to end users. The Company recognizes product revenue
upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that
collection is determined to be probable and no significant
obligations remain. In certain regions where the Company does
not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns, the Company
defers revenue on sales to its distributors until the Company
has received information from the channel partner indicating
that the distributor has sold the product to its customer.
Payment terms to domestic customers are generally net
30 days. Payment terms to international customers range
from net 30 to 90 days based on normal and customary trade
practices in



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the individual markets. The Company has offered extended payment
terms ranging from three to six months to certain customers, in
which case, revenue is recognized when payments are received.

Whenever a software license, hardware, installation and
post-contract customer support (“PCS”), elements are
sold together, a portion of the sales price is allocated to each
element based on their respective fair values as determined when
the individual elements are sold separately. Revenues from the
license of software are recognized when the software has been
shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software.
When rights of return are present and the Company cannot
estimate returns, the Company recognizes revenue when such
rights of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the service contract term. PCS includes
rights to upgrades, when and if available, a limited period of
telephone support, updates, and bug fixes. Installation revenue
is recognized when the product has been installed at the
customer’s site. Consulting services are customarily billed
at fixed rates, plus out-of-pocket expenses, and revenues are
recognized when the consulting has been completed. Training
revenue is recognized when the training has been completed.

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling fees charged to our customers are
recognized as product revenue in the period shipped and the
related costs for providing these services are recorded as a
cost of sale.

Guarantees and Product Warranties

In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its
products, the Company indemnifies other parties, including
customers, resellers, lessors, and parties to other transactions
with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company
has agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses
arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of
intellectual property infringement or other claims made against
certain parties. These agreements may limit the time within
which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the
claim. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements
with its officers and directors, and the Company’s bylaws
contain similar indemnification obligations to the
Company’s agents. It is not possible to determine the
maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements
due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and
the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
agreement.

The Company offers warranties of one year for hardware, with the
option of purchasing additional warranty coverage in yearly
increments. The Company accrues for warranty costs as part of
its cost of sales based on associated material product costs and
technical support labor costs. During the years ended
September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 warranty expense was
$2.2 million, $0.9 million and $0.3 million,
respectively.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses consist of salaries and
related benefits of product development personnel, prototype
materials and expenses related to the development of new and
improved products, and an allocation of facilities and
depreciation expense. Research and development expenses are
reflected in the statements of income as incurred.

Advertising

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred
$1.7 million, $1.7 million and $1.0 million in
advertising costs during the fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for
income taxes as set forth by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
or SFAS 109. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
determined based upon differences between the financial
statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
differences are expected to reverse. The realization of deferred
tax assets is based on historical tax positions and estimates of
future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded when it
is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries is the local currency in which the respective
entity is located, with the exception of F5 Networks, Ltd., in
the United Kingdom that uses the U.S. dollar as its
functional currency. An entity’s functional currency is
determined by the currency of the economic environment in which
the majority of cash is generated and expended by the entity.
The financial statements of all majority-owned subsidiaries and
related entities, with a functional currency other than the
U.S. dollar, have been translated into U.S. dollars in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 52 “Foreign Currency Translation.” All assets
and liabilities of the respective entities are translated at
year-end exchange rates and all revenues and expenses are
translated at average rates during the respective period.
Translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders
equity.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of
the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated
in currencies other than the functional currency, including
U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on those foreign currency
transactions are included in determining net income or loss for
the period of exchange. The net effect of foreign currency gains
and losses were not significant during the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2005. Net transaction losses of $466,000 and
$544,000 were charged to operations for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Segments

The Company complies with the requirements of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131,
“Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,” which establishes annual and interim
reporting standards for an enterprise’s operating segments
and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic
areas and major customers. Management has determined that the
Company operates in one segment.

Stock-Based Compensation

On July 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Statement No. 123(R),

Share-Based
Payment

, (“FAS 123R”). Prior to July 1,
2005, the Company accounted for share-based payments under the
recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion
No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”), and related Interpretations, as
permitted by FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

(“FAS 123”). In
accordance with APB 25 no compensation cost was required to
be recognized for options granted that had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant.

The Company adopted FAS 123R using the
modified-prospective-transition method. Under that transition
method, compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year 2005
includes: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments
granted prior to, but not yet vested as of July 1, 2005,
based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
the original provisions of FAS 123, and
b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted
subsequent to July 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair
value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
FAS 123R. The results for the prior periods have not been
restated.

Effective July 1, 2005 the Company adopted the
straight-line attribution method for recognizing compensation
expense. Previously under the disclosure-only provisions of
SFAS 123, the Company used the accelerated method of
expense recognition pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 28,

Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable
Stock Option or Award Plans

(“FIN 28”). For
all unvested options outstanding as of July 1, 2005, the
previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense, based
on the fair value at the original grant date, will be recognized
on an accelerated basis over the remaining vesting period. For
share-based payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005,
compensation expense, based on the fair value on the date of
grant, will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period.

The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the price
of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. However, in
determining the fair value of stock options, we use the
Black-Scholes option pricing model that employs the following
key assumptions.

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company does not
anticipate declaring dividends in the foreseeable future.
Expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical
volatility of our stock price commensurate with the expected
life of the option. Expected term of the option is based on an
evaluation of the historical employee stock option exercise
behavior, the vesting terms of the respective option and a
contractual life of ten years. Our stock price volatility and
option lives involve management’s best estimates at that
time, both of which impact the fair value of the option
calculated under the Black-Scholes methodology and, ultimately,
the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option.
SFAS 123R also requires that we recognize compensation
expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are
expected to vest. Therefore, the Company applies estimated
forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee
termination behavior. The estimated forfeiture rate in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 is 5%. If the actual number of



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

forfeitures differs from those estimated by management,
additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required
in future periods.

The weighted-average fair value of options granted in the fiscal
years 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $18.68, $8.32 and $7.46,
respectively.

The following table shows the pro forma effect on the
Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share
for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, had
compensation expense been determined based upon the fair value
at the grant date for awards consistent with the methodology
prescribed by SFAS 123. The Company adopted SFAS 123R
on July 1, 2005 the beginning of its fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005; therefore, stock-based compensation expense shown
in the pro forma table relates to expense through June 30,
2005 while the Company was still under the disclosure only
provisions of SFAS 123. Stock-based compensation expense
for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 has been included in
results of operations. These pro forma effects may not be
representative of expense in future periods since the estimated
fair value of stock options on the date of grant is amortized to
expense over the vesting period, and additional options may be
granted or options may be cancelled in future years:

Earnings Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of common and dilutive
common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period.



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted net income per share (in thousands, except per share
data).

Approximately 0.4 million, 1.4 million, and
2.6 million of common shares potentially issuable from
stock options for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004
and 2003 are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings
per share because the exercise price was greater than the market
price.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-1,
“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments.” EITF 03-1
provides guidance on other-than-temporary impairment models for
marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under
SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities,” and SFAS No. 124,
“Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit
Organizations,” and non-marketable equity securities
accounted for under the cost method. The EITF developed a
basic three-step model to evaluate whether an investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired. On September 30, 2004, the
FASB approved the issuance of FASB Staff Position
(FSP) EITF 03-1-1, which delays the effective date
until additional guidance is issued for the application of the
recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1 to
investments in securities that are impaired. In November 2005,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application
to Certain Investments.” This FSP addresses the
determination as to when an investment is considered impaired,
whether the impairment is other than temporary and the
measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically
nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10-18 of
EITF 03-1 and references existing other-than-temporary
impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective
for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005.
The Company does not expect the adoption of FSP FAS 115-1
and FAS 124-1 to have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

In May of 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections — A
Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement
No. 3,” which changes the requirements for the
accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle.
The Statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting
principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement
in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include
specific transition provisions. This Statement requires
retrospective application to prior periods’ financial
statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is
impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or
the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is
effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made
in fiscal years beginning



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

after December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the
adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the

Business Combinations

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business
Combinations.” The total purchase price is allocated to the
tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the
purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill.
The fair value assigned to the tangible and intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed are based on estimates and
assumptions provided by management, and other information
compiled by management, including independent valuations,
prepared by valuation specialists that utilize established
valuation techniques appropriate for the technology industry. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, “Goodwill and other Intangible Assets,”
goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment
at least annually.

2004 Acquisition of MagniFire Websystems, Inc.

On May 31, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of
MagniFire Websystems, Inc. a provider of web application
firewall products. As a result of the merger, the Company
acquired all the assets of MagniFire, including MagniFire’s
web application firewall product line (TrafficShield), all
property, equipment and other assets that MagniFire used in its
business and assumed certain of the liabilities of MagniFire.
The purchase price was $30.5 million including
$1.5 million of transactions costs. The results of
operations of MagniFire have been included in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements since June 1, 2004.



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands):

Of the total estimated purchase price, $5.0 million was
allocated to developed technology. To determine the value of the
developed technology, a combination of cost and market
approaches were used. The cost approach required an estimation
of the costs required to reproduce the acquired technology. The
market approach measures the fair value of the technology
through an analysis of recent comparable transactions. The
$5.0 million allocated to developed technology is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life
of five years.

At the time of the acquisition, the estimated purchase price was
allocated to goodwill in the amount of $24.8 million,
including the Company’s full valuation allowance on
deferred taxes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004,
the Company reversed the valuation allowance and therefore
increased the amount allocated to goodwill by an additional
$1.1 million due to the deferred tax liability that was
assumed as a result of the acquisition. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company adjusted the fair value
of certain other assets and as a result decreased the amount
allocated to goodwill by $0.4 million.

2003 Acquisition of uRoam, Inc.

On July 23, 2003, the Company acquired substantially all of
the assets of uRoam, Inc. (uRoam), including uRoam’s
FirePass product line, and assumed certain liabilities for cash
of $25.0 million. The Company also incurred
$2.4 million of direct transaction costs for a total
purchase price of $27.4 million. uRoam’s FirePass
server is a comprehensive remote access product that enables
users to access applications in a secure fashion using industry
standard Secured Socket Layer technology. The acquired
technology is currently being amortized over its estimated
useful life of five years using the straight-line method. The
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired of
$24.2 million was recorded as goodwill. The results of
operations of uRoam have been included in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

initially recognized during fiscal 2002 as part of the
Company’s decision to discontinue its cache appliance
business and exit its support facility in Washington D.C. The
remaining liability approximates the full amount owed through
the remainder of the lease term, expiring in 2007, and actual

The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal
statutory rate as follows (in thousands):



F5 NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The tax effects of the temporary differences that give rise to
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in
thousands):

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 the Company
determined, based on an evaluation of current operating results
and projected future taxable income that the valuation allowance
of $2.6 million pertaining to net operating loss
carry-forwards in the United Kingdom was no longer needed and as
a result the related valuation allowance was reversed. In the
prior year, the Company determined that the U.S. deferred
tax assets were more likely than not to be realizable and
reversed the related valuation allowance during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company had provided for a full
valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets at the end
of fiscal year 2003. If the estimates and assumptions used in
our determination change in the future, we could be required to
revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our
deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional
income taxes.

At September 30, 2005, the Company had approximately
$64.3 million of U.S. net operating loss
carry-forwards resulting from tax benefits associated with
employee stock option plans, a portion of which begins to expire
in 2011. The Company also had net operating loss carry-forwards
of approximately $7.4 million related to operations in the
United Kingdom that carry-forward indefinitely. At
September 30, 2005, the Company also has federal research
credit carry-forwards of approximately $7.2 million which,
if not utilized, will begin to expire in fiscal year 2011 and
state research credit carry-forwards of $349,000 which will
begin to expire in fiscal year 2025.

United States income and foreign withholding taxes have not been
provided on approximately $1.8 million of undistributed
earnings from the Company’s international subsidiaries. The
Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability for the
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because the
Company currently does not expect to remit those earnings in the
foreseeable future. Determination of the amount of unrecognized
deferred tax liability related to undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries is not practicable because such liability,
if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when
remittance occurs.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA provides for a
temporary 85% dividends received deduction on certain earnings
repatriated during either fiscal year 2005 or fiscal year 2006.
The deduction would result in an approximate 5.25% federal tax
rate on the repatriated earnings. To qualify for the deduction,
the earnings must be reinvested in the

U.S. pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established
by a company’s chief executive officer and approved by the
company’s board of directors. Additionally, certain other
significant criteria, as outlined in the AJCA, must also be met.
F5 Networks did not elect this provision in fiscal year 2005,
and does not intend to make an election in fiscal year 2006.

Shareholders’ Equity

Common Stock

In November 2003, the Company sold 5,175,000 shares,
including 675,000 shares sold upon the exercise of the
underwriters’ over-allotment option, of its common stock in
a public offering at a price of $23.25 per share. The
proceeds to the Company were $113.6 million, net of
offering costs of $6.7 million.

Equity Incentive Plans

In fiscal 2005, the Company modified the method in which it
issues incentive awards to its employees through stock-based
compensation. In prior years, stock-based compensation consisted
only of stock options. In 2005, the majority of awards consisted
of restricted stock unit awards and to a lesser degree stock
options. Employees vest in restricted stock units and stock
options ratably over the corresponding service term, generally
one to four years. The Company’s stock options expire
10 years from the date of grant. Restricted stock units are
payable in shares of the Company’s common stock as the
periodic vesting requirements are satisfied. The value of a
restricted stock unit is based upon the fair market value of the
Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The value of
restricted stock units is determined using the intrinsic value
method and is based on the number of shares granted and the
quoted price of the Company’s common stock on the date of
grant. Alternatively, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option
pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options.
Compensation expense related to restricted stock units and stock
options is recognized over the vesting period. The Company has
adopted a number of stock-based compensation plans as discussed
below.

1998 Equity Incentive Plan.

In November 1998, the Company
adopted the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 1998 Plan, which
provides for discretionary grants of non-qualified and incentive
stock options, stock purchase awards and stock bonuses for
employees and other service providers. Upon certain changes in
control of the Company, all outstanding and unvested options or
stock awards under the 1998 Plan will vest at the rate of 50%,
unless assumed or substituted by the acquiring entity. As of
September 30, 2005, there were options to
purchase 1,663,983 shares outstanding and
58,934 shares available for awards under the 1998 Plan.

1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

In May 1999, the board
of directors approved the adoption of the 1999 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, or the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. A total of
2,000,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Employee
Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to acquire shares
of the Company’s common stock through periodic payroll
deductions of up to 15% of base compensation. No employee may
purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock, determined at the
fair market value of the shares at the time such option is
granted, in one calendar year. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan
has been implemented in a series of offering periods, each
6 months in duration. The price at which the common stock
may be purchased is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value
of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the
applicable offering period or on the last day of the respective
purchase period. As of September 30, 2005 there were
1,012,549 shares available for awards under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan.

2000 Equity Incentive Plan.

In July 2000, the Company
adopted the 2000 Employee Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2000
Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of non-qualified
stock options, stock purchase awards and stock bonuses for

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of 3,500,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance under the 2000 Plan. Upon certain changes in control of
the Company, all outstanding and unvested options or stock
awards under the 2000 Plan will vest at the rate of 50%,
unless assumed or substituted by the acquiring entity. As of
September 30, 2005, there were options to
purchase 1,144,991 shares outstanding and
55,853 shares available for awards under the 2000 Plan.

New Hire Incentive Plans.

In October 2000, the Company
adopted a non-qualified stock option plan, or the Pancottine
Plan, in connection with the hiring of Jeff Pancottine, the
Company’s Senior Vice President and General Manager,
Security Business Unit. The Pancottine Plan provided for a grant
of 200,000 non-qualified stock options for Mr. Pancottine.
As of September 30, 2005, there were no options outstanding
and no shares available for awards under the Pancottine Plan. In
May 2001, the Company adopted a non-qualified stock option plan,
or the Coburn Plan, in connection with the hiring of Steve
Coburn, the Company’s former Senior Vice President of

for a grant of 200,000 non-qualified stock options for
Mr. Coburn. As of September 30, 2005, there were no
options outstanding and no shares available for awards under the
Coburn Plan. In October 2003, the company adopted a
non-qualified stock option plan, or the Hull Plan, in connection
with the hiring of Thomas Hull, the Company’s Senior Vice
President of Worldwide Sales. The Hull plan provided for a grant
of 225,000 non-qualified stock options for Mr. Hull. As of
September 30, 2005, there were options to
purchase 170,000 shares outstanding and no shares
available for awards under the Hull Plan. In August 2004, the
Company adopted a non-qualified stock option plan, or the
Triebes Plan, in connection with the hiring of Karl Triebes, the
Company’s Senior Vice President of Product Development and
Chief Technology Officer. The Triebes Plan provided for a grant
of 300,000 non-qualified stock options for Mr. Triebes. As
of September 30, 2005, there were options to
purchase 250,000 shares outstanding and no shares
available for awards under the Triebes Plan. Upon certain
changes in control of the Company, 100% of all outstanding and
unvested options remaining under the Hull Plan and the Triebes
Plan will vest and become immediately exercisable.

Acquisition Incentive Plans.

In July 2003, the Company
adopted the uRoam Acquisition Equity Incentive Plan, or the
uRoam Plan, in connection with the hiring of the former
employees of uRoam, Inc. A total of 250,000 shares of
common stock were reserved for issuance under the uRoam Plan.
The plan provided for discretionary grants of non-qualified and
incentive stock options, stock purchase awards and stock
bonuses. The Company has not granted any stock purchase awards
or stock bonuses under this plan. As of September 30, 2005
there were options to purchase 38,044 shares
outstanding and no shares available for awards under the uRoam

Litigation

In July and August 2001, a series of putative securities class
action lawsuits were filed in United States District Court,
Southern District of New York against certain investment banking
firms that underwrote the Company’s initial and secondary
public offerings, the Company and some of the Company’s
officers and directors. These cases, which have been
consolidated under In re F5 Networks, Inc. Initial Public
Offering Securities Litigation, No. 01 CV 7055, assert that
the registration statements for the Company’s June 4,
1999 initial public offering and September 30, 1999
secondary offering failed to disclose certain alleged improper
actions by the underwriters for the offerings. The consolidated,
amended complaint alleges claims against the Company and those
of our officers and directors named in the complaint under
Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, and under
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Other lawsuits have been filed making similar allegations
regarding the public offerings of more than 300 other companies.
All of these various consolidated cases have been coordinated
for pretrial purposes as In re Initial Public Offering
Securities Litigation, Civil Action No. 21-MC-92. In
October 2002, the directors and officers were dismissed without
prejudice. The issuer defendants filed a coordinated motion to
dismiss these lawsuits in July 2002, which the Court granted in
part and denied in part in an order dated February 19,
2003. The Court declined to dismiss the Section 11 and
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims against the
Company. In June 2004, a stipulation of settlement for the
claims against the issuer defendants, including the Company, was
submitted to the Court. On August 31, 2005, the Court
granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement
is subject to a number of conditions, including final approval
by the Court. If the settlement does not occur, and litigation
against us continues, we believe we have meritorious defenses
and intend to defend the case vigorously. Securities class
action litigation could result in substantial costs and divert
our management’s attention and resources. Due to the
inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately
predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation, and any
unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and operating results.

We are not aware of any additional pending legal proceedings
that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating
results, or financial condition. We may in the future be party
to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business,
including claims that allegedly infringe upon third-party
trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Such claims,
even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of
significant financial and managerial resources.

Geographic Sales and Significant Customers

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
for which separate financial information is available and
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or
decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and
in assessing performance. The Company is organized as, and
operates in, one reportable segment: the development, marketing
and selling of a comprehensive suite of application networking
solutions that helps customers efficiently and securely manage
application traffic on their Internet-based networks. We manage
our business based on four geographic regions: the Americas
(primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and
Africa (EMEA); Japan; and Asia Pacific. Our chief operating
decision-making group reviews financial information presented on
a consolidated basis accompanied by information about revenues
by geographic region. Our foreign offices conduct sales,
marketing and support activities. The Company’s management
evaluates performance based primarily on revenues in the
geographic locations in which the Company operates. Revenues are
attributed by geographic location based on the location of the
customer. The Company’s assets are primarily located in the
United States and not allocated to any specific region.
Therefore, geographic information is presented only for net
product revenue.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
required information is properly recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the required timeframe, as specified in the
rules set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our
disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. We have reviewed our
disclosure controls and procedures prior to the filing of this
annual report and based on that review, we have concluded that
the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective in design and operation as of September 30, 2005.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

During the fourth fiscal quarter, there were no changes to our
internal control over financial reporting that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal controls over financial reporting.

Limitations of internal control over financial reporting.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence
and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and
breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over
financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion of
improper management override. Because of such limitations, there
is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known
features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is
possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
not eliminate, this risk.

Management’s report on internal control over financial
reporting.

We have assessed the effectiveness of our
company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2005. In making this assessment, we used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our
assessment using those criteria, we concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of
September 30, 2005. Our management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2005 has been
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
herein.
