Item 1.

Business

General

F5 Networks is a leading provider of technology that optimizes
    the delivery of network-based applications and the security,
    performance and availability of servers, data storage devices
    and other network resources. As strategic points of control
    within a network, our products collectively function as a
    dynamic control plane that simplifies the management of data
    center operations and delivery of services across diverse data
    center resources.

Founded in 1996, F5 Networks pioneered load-balancing technology
    that distributes internet traffic evenly across multiple
    servers, making them look like a single device. Today, our
    BIG-IP application delivery controllers sit in front of web and
    application servers, balancing traffic and performing
    compute-intensive functions such as encrypting and un-encrypting
    transmissions, screening traffic for security threats,
    maintaining open connections with servers, speeding the flow of
    traffic, managing access to applications and data and a variety
    of other functions that improve the performance, availability
    and security of applications. By offloading functions from
    servers, BIG-IP application delivery controllers make servers
    more efficient, reduce the number of servers needed to run
    specific applications and reduce operating costs by simplifying
    the management of servers and applications. In virtual
    environments, this allows customers to increase the density of
    virtual servers running on physical servers and reduces the
    added complexity of managing a dynamic environment. BIG-IP
    application delivery controllers also support software modules
    that manage the flow of traffic between



multiple data centers and across multiple service provider
    connections, ensuring that this traffic is always routed to the
    most available resource and enabling on-demand access to
    resources within and outside customer data centers. In addition,
    we offer complementary products that provide secure remote
    access to corporate networks and optimize the delivery of
    applications and data over wide-area networks.

The core of our application delivery controllers and related
    products is our full-proxy Traffic Management Operating System
    (TMOS) that enables these products to inspect and modify traffic
    flows to and from servers at network speed and supports a broad
    and growing array of functions that enhance the speed,
    performance and availability of applications. iRules, a
    scripting language based on TCL (Tool Command Language), is a
    unique feature of TMOS that enables customers and third parties
    to write customized rules to inspect and modify traffic. TMOS
    also supports a common software interface called iControl, which
    enables our products to communicate with one another and with
    third-party products, including custom and commercial enterprise
    applications. TMOS is designed to support the addition of new
    functionality as software modules and to exploit the
    performance-enhancing features of our purpose-built hardware
    platforms. Correspondingly, our hardware architecture integrates
    industry standard components with the unique features and
    characteristics of TMOS to deliver performance that is, we
    believe, demonstrably superior to competing products.

Just as our application delivery controllers make many servers
    look like one, ARX storage virtualization products sit in front
    of network attached storage (NAS), making multiple storage
    devices from different vendors look like a single device to the
    individual clients, servers and applications that use them. This
    frees users and storage administrators from the time-consuming
    task of mapping individual drives to specific clients and
    applications. In addition, ARX products simplify the migration
    of data between storage devices, the addition of new storage
    devices, and the distribution of data across tiers of storage
    that reflect the relative importance or immediacy of the data.

In connection with our products, we offer a broad range of
    services including consulting, training, installation,
    maintenance and other technical support services.

F5 Networks was incorporated on February 26, 1996 in the
    State of Washington. Our headquarters is in Seattle, Washington

Industry
    Background

Growth
    and Evolution of

IP-Based

Infrastructures

Internet Protocol (IP) is a communications language used to
    transmit data over the Internet. Since the late 1990s,
    businesses have responded to the power, flexibility and
    efficiency of the Internet by replacing older data center
    architectures with

IP-based

infrastructures, deploying new

IP-based

applications and replacing or upgrading legacy applications with
    new

IP-enabled

versions. At the same time, organizations have become more
    geographically dispersed, and increasingly mobile workforces
    depend on access to corporate applications and data from remote
    locations and a variety of client devices such as mobile
    telephones, personal digital assistants and notebook computers.

More recently, companies and other large enterprises have
    responded to the global economic downturn by using technologies
    such as virtualization and the growing availability and
    sophistication of cloud computing to overhaul their computing
    infrastructures and make them more flexible and efficient. In
    the wake of reduced headcounts, many companies are also adding
    more intelligence in their networks to enable them to compete
    more effectively in an environment of reduced consumer spending.
    These efforts are reflected in the



widespread trend toward data center consolidation that includes
    both a reduction in the number and size of data centers.

Meanwhile, the evolution and proliferation of mobile devices and
    applications, coupled with the global embrace of social media
    sites such as Facebook and Twitter, have challenged the
    abilities of content and service providers to keep up with
    growing demand.

Over the near term, we believe data center consolidation will
    continue to drive demand for intelligent technologies that
    enable companies and other organizations to be more efficient
    and competitive. Longer term, we believe that the growth of
    Internet usage, driven by new applications, the proliferation of
    social media sites, the growth of mobile data traffic and the
    adoption of on-demand usage and infrastructure models such as
    cloud computing, will continue to drive demand for more
    intelligent and dynamic IP networks.

In conjunction with the growth of Internet traffic, the
    proliferation of data, particularly unstructured data such as
    voice, video, images, email, spreadsheets and formatted text
    files, presents an enormous and increasing challenge to IT
    organizations. Along with the growing volume of unstructured
    data that is business-critical and must be retained and readily
    accessible to individuals and applications, new regulations
    mandate that company email, web pages and other files must be
    retained for extended periods of time. In response to this
    challenge, IT organizations spend an increasing amount of their
    budget on NAS and other types of storage systems.

Trend
    Towards Virtualization

From a broad perspective, the goal of IT organizations is to
    optimize the secure delivery of applications and data to users
    wherever they are and whenever they need them. To achieve this
    goal, organizations are embracing virtualization technologies
    that enable them to group or partition data center resources to
    meet user demand and reconfigure these virtual resources easily
    and quickly as demand changes. Server virtualization, which
    allows organizations to improve utilization of physical servers
    by partitioning them into multiple virtual servers, is well
    known and widely deployed. Application delivery controllers free
    up both physical and virtual server processing power by
    offloading common functions, such as encryption and compression
    from multiple physical or virtual servers, and dynamically
    manage the flow of traffic between users and both virtual and
    physical servers, making them look like a single resource to the
    user. Server virtualization puts additional pressure on storage
    resources by increasing the demand for storage capacity and the
    complexity of storing and retrieving files. Sitting in front of
    storage systems, file virtualization devices perform functions
    similar to application delivery controllers, presenting the
    appearance of a single resource to users and applications and
    dynamically managing the transfer of files between users,
    applications and multiple storage devices.

Application
    Delivery Networking

Internet traffic passing between client devices and servers is
    divided into discrete packets which travel by multiple routes to
    their destination where they are reassembled. The disassembly,
    routing, and reassembly of transmissions are relatively
    straightforward and require little intelligence. By contrast,
    application delivery networking — managing,
    inspecting, modifying, redirecting and securing application
    traffic going to and from servers — requires
    intelligent systems capable of performing a broad array of
    functions.

Basic application delivery networking (ADN) functions include
    load-balancing (distributing traffic across multiple servers
    while making them appear to be a single server) and
    health-checking (monitoring the performance of servers and
    applications to ensure that they are working properly before
    routing traffic to them). In addition, ADN encompasses a growing
    number of functions that have typically been performed by the
    server or the application itself, or by point solutions running
    on separate devices. These include:

•

SSL Acceleration — using Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
    encryption to secure traffic between the server and the browser
    on an end user’s client device;

•

Rate Shaping — prioritizing transmissions according to
    preset rules that give precedence to different types of traffic;



•

Compression — reducing the volume of data transmitted
    to take maximum advantage of available bandwidth;

•

TCP Optimization — improving server efficiency by
    maintaining an open connection with a server during interactive
    sessions;

•

IPv6 Translation — enabling communication and
    interoperability between networked devices using IPv6, the
    newest version of the Internet Protocol, and those using the
    older version IPv4;

•

Application Security — protecting critical web
    applications from attacks such as Google hacking, cross-site
    scripting, and parameter tampering;

•

Message Security — filtering out spam and other
    unwanted email messages;

•

Remote Access — providing remote users with secure,
    context-aware, policy controlled access to applications;

•

Access Policy Management — managing access to
    web-based applications through a central, policy-based point of
    control;

•

Web Acceleration — enhancing the performance of web
    applications over wide area networks by reducing latency,
    eliminating errors, and resolving other issues that slow
    delivery;

•

WAN Optimization — improving the performance of
    applications accessed over wide area network links by reducing
    the number of round trips required and ensuring maximum use of
    available bandwidth;

•

Global Traffic Management — ensuring high
    availability, maximum performance and global management for
    applications running across multiple, globally-dispersed data
    centers; and

•

Link Load Balancing — monitoring availability and
    performance of multiple WAN connections and intelligently
    managing bi-directional traffic flows to ensure uninterrupted,
    optimized Internet access.

Since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not
    thousands — of servers and applications, it is not
    practical to replicate these functions on each server or build
    them into the applications themselves. Even if it were,
    maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the net result would
    be a negative impact on the overall performance of servers and
    applications. Deploying point solutions in the network
    eliminates those problems but creates a new set of challenges.
    Using point solutions from multiple vendors can create
    interoperability issues, and problems that do occur can be
    difficult to troubleshoot. From a security standpoint, it is
    also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through
    multiple devices. As a result, enterprise customers are
    increasingly demanding products that integrate ADN functions on
    a single platform.

File
    Virtualization

Along with other types of IP traffic, the volume of file-based
    information created and accessed by Internet users and network
    applications is growing rapidly. According to some estimates,
    the volume of unstructured files is expected to triple annually
    over the next several years. The challenge of storing and
    managing unstructured files is becoming increasingly costly and
    complex, and reducing the cost and complexity is quickly moving
    up the list of data center priorities.

In many large organizations whose employees are geographically
    dispersed, unstructured data is stored on local file servers,
    which are difficult to manage, costly to maintain and generally
    underutilized. Information on these devices is easy for local
    users to access but often inaccessible to others in the
    organization. To reduce the cost, complexity, and redundancy of
    dispersed file systems, many IT organizations are consolidating
    file storage on centralized NAS devices and other types of
    storage systems. Migrating and consolidating files is difficult
    and time-consuming, however, and centralized storage systems
    pose a different set of problems.

Centralized storage of files can slow access for remote users
    and applications, spurring interest in technology that can speed
    the transfer of files across wide area networks (WANs). In
    addition, only users and applications that are physically mapped
    to a specific drive can store and access data on that drive. As
    the drive



fills up, files must be moved manually to a new drive and
    affected users and applications must be remapped to that drive.
    In large organizations, this often constitutes a

round-the-clock

chore for many highly-skilled employees.

Another major storage problem stems from the fact that all files
    are not created equal. Many businesses and other organizations
    have policies or other obligations to retain email and other
    files, increasing the volume of data to archive and, in some
    cases, keep indefinitely. Since it is unlikely that these files
    will be accessed frequently, if at all, in the course of normal
    business, it makes little sense to store them on expensive,
    high-performance systems designed to provide immediate access to
    business-critical information. As a result, IT organizations are
    beginning to deploy tiers of storage systems that match cost,
    capacity, and performance to the type of information being
    stored, how frequently it is accessed, and its relative
    importance to the business. Often, the most cost-effective
    solution is a combination of storage systems from different
    vendors, an approach that typically entails migrating huge
    amounts of data between incompatible devices. Once that is
    completed, organizations face the challenge of automating the
    tiering process and the management of aging files.

Whether or not they deploy tiered file systems, many
    organizations are beginning to address the mounting cost in time
    and resources of backing up data stored on employee desktops,
    local file servers, and other devices. According to some
    estimates, approximately 80% of the files organizations back up
    have not changed since the previous

back-up.

Worse yet, a large and growing percentage are music and video
    files, family photographs, and other personal files.

Responding to increasing demand from IT organizations, a number
    of storage vendors and a handful of other companies offer
    solutions that address some or all of these issues and can be
    loosely grouped under the heading of file virtualization.
    Collectively, these solutions encompass a variety of
    technological approaches designed to optimize and simplify the
    storage of unstructured data.

F5
    Solutions

Application
    Delivery Networking

F5 Networks is a leading provider of application delivery
    networking products that ensure the security, optimization and
    availability of applications for any user, anywhere. We believe
    our products offer the most intelligent architecture and
    advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance
    and flexibility that enable organizations to simplify management
    of their data center operations and integrate disparate
    resources to reduce operating costs and improve service to
    employees, customers and partners.

Software Based Products.

From inception, we
    have been committed to the belief that the complexity of
    application-level processing requires the flexibility of a
    software-based solution. We believe our modular software
    architecture enables us to deliver the broadest range of
    integrated functionality in the market and facilitates the
    addition and integration of new functionality. We also believe
    that integrating our software with hardware components enables
    us to build products that deliver superior performance,
    functionality and flexibility at competitive prices. We have
    introduced virtual (software only) versions of BIG-IP LTM and
    FirePass to provide our customers with versions that complement
    our hardware based platforms.

Full Proxy Architecture.

The core of our
    software technology is TMOS introduced in September 2004. We
    believe TMOS is a major enhancement of our previous technology
    that enables our products to deliver functionality that is
    superior on many levels to any other application delivery
    networking product in the market. With TMOS, our products can
    inspect, modify and direct both inbound and outbound traffic
    flows across multiple packets. This ability to manage
    application traffic to and from servers adds value to
    applications that pass through our devices in ways that are not
    possible with other application delivery networking solutions.
    In April 2009, we introduced a major upgrade (Version 10.0) of
    TMOS that includes more than 130 new features, more than 90
    application-ready solution templates, and a number of
    performance enhancements, all designed to leverage the advanced
    features and performance of our recently upgraded family of
    BIG-IP hardware platforms. Since then, we have introduced TMOS
    versions 10.1 and 10.2, which include support for clustered
    multiprocessing and many new features and functions specifically
    designed to optimize virtual data centers and enable on-demand
    access to internal and external resources.



Modular Functionality.

In addition to its full
    proxy architecture, TMOS is designed to facilitate the
    development and integration of application delivery networking
    functions as modules that can be added to BIG-IP’s core
    functionality to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer needs.
    Feature modules that are available as add ons to TMOS Version
    10.0 include: Advanced Client Authentication, Advanced Routing,
    Fast Cache, Intelligent Compression, IPv6 Gateway, L7 Rate
    Shaping, Message Security Module, Protocol Security Module and
    SSL Acceleration. Product modules include: Local Traffic
    Manager, Application Security Manager (ASM), Global Traffic
    Manager (GTM), Link Controller, WebAccelerator, Edge Gateway,
    WAN Optimization Module and Access Policy Manager.

Application Awareness.

The open architecture
    of TMOS includes an application programming interface (API)
    called iControl that allows our products to communicate with one
    another and with third-party software and devices. Through this
    unique feature, third-party applications and network devices can
    take an active role in shaping IP network traffic, directing
    traffic based on exact business requirements defined by our
    customers and solutions partners and tailored to specific
    applications. This “application awareness” capability
    is a key feature of our software-based products and further
    differentiates our solutions from those of our competitors.

Application-Specific Configurations.

Developed
    and tested in collaboration with our solutions partners,
    Application Ready Solutions are configurations designed to
    optimize BIG-IP deployments for specific applications such as
    those provided by Oracle, Microsoft, Siebel, and SAP, as well as
    generic applications delivered via HTTP. With TMOS Version 10.0,
    we introduced templates that reduce the time and effort
    necessary to configure BIG-IP for a specific application. The
    configuration created is optimal for BIG-IP devices and the
    specific application for which the template was created and can
    be further customized for the specific conditions of an
    organization’s unique infrastructure and environment. Like
    other configuration details of BIG-IP devices, these templates
    can easily be shared across multiple BIG-IP deployments.

Adaptive Intelligence.

The full-proxy
    capabilities of TMOS enable it to inspect or “read”
    the entire contents of a transmission across multiple packets
    and identify specific elements of that transmission, including
    items such as names, dates, and any type of number or label. By
    taking advantage of our unique scripting capability, based on
    TCL, customers can use those elements as variables to create
    iRules that modify the content and direct the flow of traffic in
    ways tailored to the dynamic needs of their applications. iRules
    is a unique feature of TMOS that gives our products flexibility
    we believe is unmatched by competing products.

Integrated Application Layer Solutions.

The
    combination of our full proxy architecture and enhanced iRules
    enables BIG-IP to intercept, inspect and act on the contents of
    traffic from virtually every type of

IP-enabled

application. In addition, the modularity of the TMOS
    architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions
    that secure, optimize and ensure the availability of
    applications and the networks they run on.

Data
    Solutions

F5’s data solutions products address many of the problems
    associated with managing today’s rapidly expanding file
    storage infrastructure. Our ARX product family of intelligent
    file virtualization solutions represents a unique set of
    capabilities that optimize the performance and utilization of
    NAS systems.

Non-disruptive Data Migration.

ARX products
    automate the movement of files between heterogeneous storage
    devices without affecting access and without requiring client
    reconfiguration. Enterprises can perform seamless
    hardware & software upgrades on file storage
    platforms, server consolidation, even vendor switches, all
    during business hours.

Automated Storage Tiering.

ARX products
    automate the movement of data between tiers of storage, and the
    placement of data on appropriate tiers of storage, irrespective
    of platform or vendor. Organizations can lower the cost of
    storage and shrink backup and recovery windows by automatically
    placing data on appropriate storage devices without affecting
    access to the data.

Dynamic Load Balancing.

ARX products
    dynamically distribute files across multiple file storage
    devices, eliminating “hotspots” or bottlenecks.
    Companies can improve application performance and increase
    productivity using the storage infrastructure that is already in
    place.



Efficient Data Replication.

ARX products
    provide the ability to replicate files between heterogeneous
    storage platforms for efficient and cost effective disaster
    recovery and centralized backup applications.

Centralized Data Management.

Introduced in
    October 2008, Data Manager simplifies file virtualization
    deployments and helps organizations monitor multiple file
    storage resources through a centralized and extensible storage
    management platform. Data Manager can quickly identify areas
    within an organization’s file storage resources that could
    be improved by file virtualization and gives customers the tools
    to create a more efficient and cost-effective storage
    infrastructure.

Strategy

Our objective is to lead the industry in delivering network
    architectures that integrate IP networks with applications and
    data, enabling the delivery of dynamic services in the data
    center. Those services can include orchestration of data center
    operations and resources, security, and optimization, as well as
    coordination of services spanning multiple data centers. Our
    products provide strategic points of control in the IT
    infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented
    where information is exchanged. This enables organizations to
    respond quickly to changing business needs, improve costly and
    time consuming business processes and develop new sources of
    revenue through highly differentiated offerings. Key components
    of our strategy include:

Offering
    a complete, integrated application delivery product
    suite.

Since the introduction of our TMOS architecture for application
    delivery networking, we have developed TMOS-based versions of
    our own legacy products, such as GTM and Link Controller, and
    acquired technology, including ASM, WebAccelerator, WAN
    Optimization Module (WOM), Edge Gateway and Application Policy
    Manager (APM). All of these products are currently available as
    software modules on our BIG-IP family of application delivery
    controllers. We believe this approach sharply differentiates our
    products from our competitors’ offerings and provides
    customers with an expanding array of integrated application
    delivery networking solutions that can be customized to meet
    their specific needs.

Investing
    in technology to meet evolving customer needs.

We continue to invest in research and development to provide our
    customers with comprehensive, integrated solutions. In
    application delivery networking, our product development efforts
    leverage the unique attributes of our software-based platforms
    to deliver new features and functions that address the complex,
    changing needs of our customers. Our ongoing investments in ARX
    are aimed at providing data solutions for the complex challenge
    of efficiently storing and managing the huge and growing volume
    of unstructured files created by network users and applications.
    Although the bulk of our investment in application delivery and
    file virtualization technologies is software development,
    concurrent development of tightly integrated, high-performance
    hardware is a key part of our investment strategy. To ensure
    performance and cost competitiveness, we incorporate commodity
    components in all of our hardware products.

Enhancing
    channel sales and distribution model.

We continue to invest significant resources in developing and
    expanding our indirect sales and distribution channels by
    cultivating our relationships with our existing partners and
    actively developing new relationships. Our efforts to recruit
    new partners are aimed primarily at large value-added resellers,
    systems integrators, and industry-leading systems manufacturers.

Continuing
    to build and expand relationships with strategic technology
    partners.

To compete successfully against Cisco Systems, Inc. and other
    large competitors who have an established presence in our target
    accounts, we have developed strategic technology partnerships
    with enterprise software vendors, such as Microsoft, Oracle and
    SAP, who often have an established presence in those accounts.
    By taking advantage of our open application programming
    interface, called iControl, these vendors can equip their
    applications to control our products in the network, enhancing
    overall application performance. In return, they



provide us significant leverage in the selling process by
    recommending our products to their customers. We have also
    worked closely with several of these vendors to develop
    configurations of our products, called Application Ready
    Solutions, that are specifically tuned to simplify deployment
    and optimize the performance of their applications. These
    solutions are available as templates which allow quick and easy
    configuration of our products for specific applications. We plan
    to continue building on our existing relationships and to extend
    our competitive edge by developing new relationships with other
    strategic partners.

Leveraging
    DevCentral, our online community of network architects and
    developers.

Customization of our products using iRules enhances their
    “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems
    in both their applications and their networks that would be
    difficult if not impossible to solve by other means. To promote
    the use of iRules, we host an online community where network
    architects and developers can discuss and share the ways in
    which they use iRules to solve problems and enhance the
    security, performance and availability of applications. A
    corollary benefit is that many of the iRules solutions posted by
    DevCentral participants have become standard features in new
    releases of TMOS.

Enhancing
    our brand.

We believe F5 has achieved industry-wide recognition as the
    leading provider of application delivery networking products
    that optimize the security, performance and availability of
    network applications, servers and storage systems. We plan to
    continue investing in programs to promote the F5 brand and make
    it synonymous with superior technology, high quality customer
    service, trusted advice and definitive business value.

Products

Our core technology is hardware and software for application
    delivery networking, including application security, secure
    remote access, policy management, WAN optimization and file
    virtualization.

Our principal products are systems that integrate our software
    with purpose-built hardware that incorporates commodity
    components. In addition, we recently introduced a virtual
    (software only) version of BIG-IP called BIG-IP LTM (VE) that is
    designed to run on servers and work in conjunction with our
    systems to provide more granular management of virtual servers
    and applications. Our BIG-IP product family, which represents
    the bulk of our sales, supports a growing number of features and
    functions available as software modules, standalone appliances,
    or both. GTM, Link Controller, ASM and WebAccelerator are
    available as both software modules and appliances. WOM and APM
    are available only as software modules, and Edge Gateway is sold
    only as a separate, stand-alone appliance.

BIG-IP
    Application Delivery Controllers

Products in our family of BIG-IP application delivery
    controllers all run TMOS and differ primarily in the hardware
    configurations that make up each system. Our current family of
    hardware platforms, designed to exploit the advanced features,
    functionality and performance of TMOS Version 10, includes
    BIG-IP 1600, BIG-IP 3600, BIG-IP 3900, BIG-IP 6900, BIG-IP 8900,
    BIG-IP 8950, BIG-IP 11050 and VIPRION, our chassis-based
    application delivery controller. In addition to local area
    traffic management, which is standard on every system, BIG-IP
    supports a growing number of add-on software products and
    features. Software products currently available for BIG-IP
    platforms include GTM, Link Controller, ASM, WebAccelerator, WOM
    and APM. Software features available on TMOS include Advanced
    Client Authentication, Advanced Routing, Fast Cache, Intelligent
    Compression, IPv6 Gateway, L7 Rate Shaping, Message Security
    Module, Protocol Security Module and SSL Acceleration.

VIPRION

Introduced in January 2008, VIPRION is our chassis-based
    application delivery controller that scales from one to four
    blades, each equipped with two dual-core processors. In January
    2010 we introduced the PB 200 blade, equivalent in
    performance to a BIG-IP 8950 and double the performance of the
    previous blade.



Using clustered multiprocessing, custom disaggregation ASICs and
    advanced software, VIPRION allows customers to add or remove
    blades without disrupting traffic and distributes traffic across
    all available processors, effectively creating a single virtual
    processor. VIPRION helps customers simplify their networks by
    offloading servers and consolidating devices, saving management
    costs as well as power, space, and cooling in the datacenter and
    by reducing the number of application delivery controllers they
    need to deliver even the most demanding applications. By
    offloading computationally intense processes, VIPRION can also
    significantly reduce the number of application servers needed.

FirePass

FirePass appliances provide SSL VPN access for remote users of
    IP networks and any applications connected to those networks
    from any standard Web browser on any device. The components of
    FirePass include a dynamic policy engine, which manages user
    authentication and authorization privileges, and special
    components that enable corporations to give remote users
    controlled access to the full array of applications and
    resources within the network. FirePass also supports Application
    Ready Access, providing full reverse-proxy services for
    market-leading application portals including those of SAP,
    Oracle, Microsoft, and others.

Currently, we sell three FirePass products: The FirePass 1200
    appliance is designed for small to medium enterprises and branch
    offices and supports from 10 to 100 concurrent users. The
    FirePass 4100 controller is designed for medium size enterprises
    and, from a price/performance standpoint, is recommended for up
    to 500 concurrent users. The FirePass 4300 appliance is
    designed for medium to large enterprises and service providers
    and supports up to 2,000 concurrent users. In addition, we
    recently introduced FirePass Virtual Edition, which runs in a
    VMware ESXi 4.0 virtual environment and is designed for medium
    to large enterprises and service providers. It supports up to
    2,000 concurrent users and offers a comprehensive virtual
    solution for secure, web-based remote access to corporate
    applications and desktops.

Application
    Security Manager (ASM)

ASM is a Web application firewall that provides comprehensive,
    proactive, application-layer protection against both generalized
    and targeted attacks. Available as a software module on BIG-IP
    LTM, ASM employs a positive security model (“deny all
    unless allowed’’) combined with signature-based
    detection. As a result, ASM can prevent “day-zero”
    attacks in addition to known security threats. ASM is also
    available as a module or a stand-alone hardware platform.

WebAccelerator

WebAccelerator speeds web transactions by optimizing individual
    network object requests, connections, and

end-to-end

transactions from the browser through to databases.
    WebAccelerator enhances web application performance from any
    location, speeding up interactive performance, improving
    download times, utilizing bandwidth more efficiently, and
    dramatically reducing the cost and response time of delivering
    Web-enabled applications to distributed users where it is not
    possible to deploy an end point device. WebAccelerator devices
    can also be placed at key remote locations to provide
    acceleration to end-users above and beyond TCP optimizations and
    HTTP compression.

WebAccelerator is available as a software module on BIG-IP LTM
    or as a stand-alone appliance.

WAN
    Optimization Module (WOM)

BIG-IP’s WAN Optimization Module integrates application
    delivery with WAN optimization technologies, enabling
    traditional acceleration functionality, such as SSL offloading,
    compression, caching, and traffic prioritization to combine with
    optimization technologies like symmetric adaptive compression
    and application quality of service. As the foundation for

site-to-site

communication, iSessions, a basic feature of TMOS, allows any
    two BIG-IP devices to be deployed symmetrically, creating a
    secure

site-to-site

connection, improving transfer rates and bandwidth usage, and
    offloading applications for more efficient data center to data
    center WAN communication.



WOM is available only as a software module on BIG-IP LTM.

Access
    Policy Manager (APM)

BIG-IP APM provides secure, granular, context-aware control of
    access to web applications while simplifying authentication,
    authorization, and accounting (AAA) management. An optional
    endpoint security service validates devices to protect
    organizations from viruses or malware infections, accidental
    data loss, and rogue device access.

With AAA control directly on the BIG-IP system, users can apply
    repeatable access policies across many applications and servers
    while gaining centralized visibility of your authorization
    infrastructure. APM’s Visual Policy Editor makes it easy to
    create individual and group access policies for many different
    identities, locations, and web authentication environments. APM
    also provides dynamic access control by creating L4 and L7
    access control lists based on user identity, IP address, and
    attributes such as group membership pulled from the standard
    directory services.

Edge
    Gateway

BIG-IP Edge Gateway is an advanced remote access product that
    provides context-aware, policy controlled, secure remote access
    to applications at LAN speed. Edge Gateway integrates SSL VPN
    remote access with application acceleration and optimization
    services at the edge of the network, combining remote access,
    access control,

site-to-site

security, and application acceleration all on one efficient,
    scalable, and cost-effective platform. An optional endpoint
    security service validates devices with policy to protect
    organizations from viruses or malware infections, accidental
    data loss, and rogue device access.

Edge Gateway is available only as a standalone solution on the
    BIG-IP 1600, 3600, 3900, 6900 and 8900 platforms.

Enterprise
    Manager

Enterprise Manager takes advantage of our iControl interface to
    provide a single, centralized management console for our ADN
    products. Enterprise Manager allows customers with dozens or
    hundreds of our products to discover and view those products in
    a single window, and to upgrade or modify the software on those
    products simultaneously. This lowers the cost and simplifies the
    task of deploying, managing and maintaining our products and
    reduces the likelihood of error when blanket changes are
    implemented.

Enterprise Manager 4000 is an appliance-based device, shipped on
    a dedicated, enterprise-grade platform.

ARX

The ARX product family is a series of high performance,
    enterprise-class intelligent file virtualization devices that
    dramatically simplify the management of file storage
    environments and lower total storage costs by automating data
    management tasks and eliminating the disruption associated with
    storage management operations. ARX can:

•

reduce storage costs by matching the business value of data to
    the cost of storage;

•

optimize backups by minimizing the backup of redundant data to
    reduce backup and recovery times, media consumption, and costs;

•

maximize value of existing storage by improve utilization,
    reclaiming stranded capacity, and deferring additional storage
    purchases;

•

simplify management by performing storage provisioning and
    decommissioning without disrupting users; improve flexibility
    and choice by moving data easily to any storage device or
    location.

Currently, the ARX series includes three products. ARX 500 and
    ARX 2000 are stand-alone devices that can support up to 600 and
    6,000 users, respectively. ARX 4000 is a fixed form-factor
    device supporting 10 gigabit Ethernet, capable of managing
    more than 2 billion files, and able to support up to 12,000
    users.



Data
    Manager

Data Manager is a software product that interfaces directly with
    most file storage devices, including ARX file virtualization
    platforms. Data Manager gathers valuable file storage statistics
    and provides graphical reporting and trending functions to give
    users visibility into their constantly changing data storage
    environments, helping them respond to business needs and better
    plan for future growth. With Data Manager users can quickly
    identify areas within their file storage resources that could be
    improved by file virtualization and monitor multiple resources
    with a centralized, extensible storage management platform.

Enabling
    Technologies

iControl is an application programming interface that allows
    customers and independent software vendors to modify their
    programs to communicate with our products, eliminating the need
    for human involvement, lowering the cost of performing basic
    network functions and reducing the likelihood of error. Although
    we do not derive revenue from iControl itself, the sale of
    iControl-enabled applications by independent software vendors
    such as Microsoft and Oracle helps promote and often leads
    directly to sales of our other products.

iRules is a programming language embedded in our TMOS
    architecture that allows customers to customize the way BIG-IP
    application delivery controllers manipulate and manage any IP
    application traffic. iRules has an

easy-to-learn

scripting syntax that enables users to program BIG-IP
    application delivery controllers to intercept, inspect,
    transform, and direct inbound or outbound application traffic
    according to their specific needs.

Product
    Development

We believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain
    technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and
    by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our
    customers. Our product development group employs a standard
    process for the development, documentation and quality control
    of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals.
    This process includes working with our business development and
    marketing teams, product managers, customers and partners to
    identify new or improved solutions that meet the evolving needs
    of our addressable markets.

Our principal software engineering group is located in our
    headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Our core product
    development teams for FirePass, WOM and WebAccelerator are
    located in San Jose, California. Our core ASM product
    development team is located in Tel Aviv, Israel. Our ARX product
    development team is located in Lowell, Massachusetts. Our
    hardware engineering group is located in Spokane, Washington. In
    addition, we maintain a dedicated facility for product testing
    and quality control in Tomsk, Russia. Members of all these teams
    collaborate closely with one another to ensure the
    interoperability and performance of our hardware and software
    systems.

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and
    2008, we had research and product development expenses of
    $118.3 million, $103.7 million, and
    $103.4 million, respectively.

Customers

Our customers include a wide variety of enterprise customers and
    service providers among Fortune 1000 and Business Week
    Global 1000 companies, including those in technology,
    telecommunications, financial services, transportation,
    education, manufacturing and healthcare, along with government
    customers. In fiscal year 2010, international sales represented
    41.4% of our net revenues. Refer to Note 12 of our
    consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic
    area.



Sales and
    Marketing

Sales

We sell our products and services to large enterprise customers
    and service providers through a variety of channels, including
    distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”) and
    systems integrators. A substantial amount of our revenue for
    fiscal year 2010 was derived from these channel sales. Our sales
    teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our
    products and services directly to a limited number of major
    accounts.

F5 sales teams.

Our inside sales team
    generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and
    helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field
    and internal corporate resources. Our field sales personnel are
    located in major cities in four sales regions: the Americas
    (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and
    Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia Pacific region (APAC). Field
    sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist
    them, as necessary, in the sale of our products and services to
    their customers. We also sell our products and services directly
    to a limited group of customers, primarily large enterprises,
    whose accounts are managed by our major account services team.
    Field systems engineers support our regional sales managers and
    channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and
    providing pre-sale technical resources as needed.

Distributors and VARs.

Consistent with our
    goal of building a strong channel sales model, we have
    established relationships with a number of large national and
    international distributors, local and specialized distributors
    and VARs. We derive a majority of our product sales from these
    distributors and VARs.

Our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and
    do not prevent them from selling competitive products. These
    agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation
    to renew, and typically do not provide for exclusive sales
    territories or minimum purchase requirements.

For fiscal year 2010, sales to two of our distributors, Avnet
    Technology Solutions and Tech Data, represented 14.5% and 10.2%
    of our total revenues, respectively. Our agreements with these
    distributors are standard, non-exclusive distribution agreements
    that renew automatically on an annual basis and can be
    terminated by either party with 30 days prior written
    notice. The agreements grant Avnet Technology Solutions and Tech
    Data the right to distribute our products to resellers in North
    America and certain other territories internationally, with no
    minimum purchase requirements.

Systems integrators.

We also market our
    products through strategic relationships with systems
    integrators, including Dell Services, HP Enterprise Services and
    IBM Global Services, who include our products as core components
    of application or network-based solutions they deploy for their
    customers. In most cases, systems integrators do not directly
    purchase our products for resale to their customers. Instead
    they typically recommend our products as part of broader
    solutions, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or
    customer relationship management (CRM) solutions that
    incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced
    performance.

Marketing

Our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our
    continued success depends on our ability to understand and
    anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to
    develop valuable solutions that meet those needs. In line with
    this belief, our marketing organization works directly with
    customers, partners and our product development teams to
    identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our
    leadership position. In addition, our business development team,
    which is a component of our marketing organization, closely
    monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary
    markets for opportunities to acquire or partner with those whose
    solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to
    expand our addressable market.

Another key component of our marketing strategy is to develop
    and expand our iControl partnerships. Working closely with our
    partners, we have developed solution sets called Application
    Ready Solutions that help ensure the successful deployment and
    delivery of their applications over the network. These Solutions
    have been integrated into TMOS Version 10.0 as templates that
    allow customers to configure our products



quickly and easily to optimize the performance of specific
    applications from major software vendors such as Microsoft,
    Oracle and SAP.

To support the growing number of developers using our products,
    including network and application architects, we continue to
    promote and expand DevCentral, our on-line community website
    that provides technical resources to customers, prospects and
    partners wanting to extend and optimize F5 solutions using
    iRules. A key aspect of DevCentral is an on-line forum where
    developers as well as application and network architects discuss
    and share solutions they have written with iRules. At the end of
    fiscal year 2010, DevCentral had more than 70,000 registered
    members.

We also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives
    aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of
    our technology and products. These include actively
    participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events
    with channel and technology partners, and briefing industry
    analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products,
    business relationships and technology partnerships. In addition,
    we market our products to chief information officers and other
    information technology professionals through targeted
    advertising, direct mail and high-profile Web events.

Backlog

At the end of fiscal years 2010 and 2009, we had product backlog
    of approximately $50.3 million and $35.5 million,
    respectively. Backlog represents orders confirmed with a
    purchase order for products to be shipped generally within
    90 days to customers with approved credit status. Orders
    are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers or
    product specification changes by customers. Although we believe
    that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be
    cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant
    penalty. For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at
    any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues.

Customer
    Service and Technical Support

We believe that our ability to provide consistent, high-quality
    customer service and technical support is a key factor in
    attracting and retaining large enterprise customers.
    Accordingly, we offer a broad range of support services that
    include installation, phone support, hardware repair and
    replacement, software updates, consulting and training services.
    We deliver these services directly to end users and also utilize
    a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our
    channel partners when applicable. Our technical support staff is
    strategically located in regional service centers to support our
    global customer base.

Prior to the installation of our products, our services
    personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and
    determine the best way to deploy our products and configure
    product features and functions to meet those needs. Our services
    personnel also provide

on-site

installation and training services to help customers make
    optimal use of product features and functions.

Our customers typically purchase a one-year maintenance contract
    which entitles them to an array of services provided by our
    technical support team. Maintenance services provided under the
    contract include online updates, software error correction
    releases, hardware repair and replacement, and, in the majority
    of cases,

round-the-clock

call center support. Updates to our software are only available
    to customers with a current maintenance contract. Our technical
    support team also offers seminars and training classes for
    customers on the configuration and use of products, including
    local and wide area network system administration and
    management. In addition, we have a professional services team
    able to provide a full range of fee-based consulting services,
    including comprehensive network management, documentation and
    performance analysis, and capacity planning to assist in
    predicting future network requirements.

We also offer, as part of our maintenance service, an online,
    automated, self-help customer support function called “Ask
    F5” that allows customers to answer many commonly asked
    questions without having to call our support desk. This allows
    the customer to rapidly address issues and questions, while
    significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk.
    This enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while
    keeping our support-related expenses at a manageable, consistent
    level.



Manufacturing

We outsource the manufacturing of our pre-configured hardware
    platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly
    according to our specifications.

We outsource the majority of our manufacturing to Tier 1
    Electronic Manufacturing Services providers. Flextronics
    manufactures our ADC product line and Sanmina-SCI manufactures
    our ARX product line. The subcontracting activity at Flextronics
    and Sanmina-SCI encompasses prototype builds, full production
    and direct fulfillment. Our contract manufacturers perform the
    following activities on our behalf: material procurement, PCB
    assembly and test, final assembly, system test, quality control,
    direct shipment and warranty repairs. We provide a rolling
    forecast that allows our contract manufacturers to stock
    component parts and other materials, plan capacity and build
    finished goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand.
    Each of the contract manufacturers procures components in
    volumes consistent with our forecast, necessary to assemble the
    products and tests the products according to our specifications.
    Products are then shipped to our distributors, value-added
    resellers, or end users. Generally, we do not own the
    components. Title to the products transfers from the contract
    manufacturers to us and then to our customers upon delivery at a
    designated shipment location. If the components are unused or
    the products are not sold within specified periods of time, we
    may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for
    components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build
    products to meet our forecast or customer orders.

Hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of
    commodity parts and certain custom components designed and
    approved by our hardware engineering group. Most of our
    components are purchased from sources which we believe are
    readily available from other suppliers. However, several
    components used in the assembly of our products are purchased
    from a single or limited source.

During fiscal year 2010, we transitioned certain

sub-assembly

and testing processes of our BIG-IP products from
    Flextronics’s facilities in Milpitas, California, to the
    Flextronics facility in ZhuHai, China. All

sub-assemblies

are configured and final tested at Flextronics’s Milpitas,
    California for distribution to our end users.

Competition

The expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled
    us to address a growing array of opportunities, many of which
    are outside the bounds of the traditional Layer 4-7 market.
    Within what Gartner Group has defined as the Application
    Acceleration market, we compete in the Application Delivery
    Controller (ADC) market, which encompasses the traditional Layer
    4-7 market, and, to a lesser extent, the WAN Optimization
    Controller (WOC) market. Over the next several years, we believe
    these two markets will merge as WAN optimization effectively
    becomes a feature of Application Delivery. Today, we offer
    WebAccelerator and WOM as software modules on most all BIG-IP
    products.

In fiscal year 2010, approximately 95% of our products and
    services were sold into the ADN market where our primary
    competitor is Cisco Systems, Inc. Other competitors in this
    market include Citrix Systems, Inc., Brocade Communications
    Systems, Inc., Radware Ltd, and a number of smaller competitors
    including A10 Networks, Array Networks, Inc., Barracuda
    Networks, Inc., Crescendo Networks, and Zeus Technology Ltd. In
    the adjacent WAN Optimization Controller market, we compete with
    Riverbed Technology, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., Blue Coat
    Systems, Inc., Cisco and Citrix. Currently, we do not compete in
    the branch office segment of the WOC market, which features
    products offered by Riverbed, Blue Coat, Cisco and others.

While file virtualization remains an early-stage market, we
    believe our ARX products are unique in terms of technology and
    functionality and are well positioned within this emerging
    market. Large storage vendors such as EMC Corporation offer
    competing products with overlapping functionality. However, we
    believe there are no competing products that offer all of the
    features, functions and capabilities of our ARX products.

The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we
    compete include: product performance and features; customer
    support; brand recognition; the scope of distribution and sales
    channels; and pricing. Many of our competitors have a longer
    operating history and greater financial, technical, marketing
    and other resources than we do. These larger competitors also
    have a more extensive customer base and broader



customer relationships, including relationships with many of our
    current and potential customers. In addition, many have large,
    well-established, worldwide customer support and professional
    services organizations and more extensive direct sales force and
    sales channels. Because of our relatively smaller size, market
    presence and resources, our larger competitors may be able to
    respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies
    and changes in customer requirements. These companies may also
    adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share.

Intellectual
    Property

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
    trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our
    intellectual property rights. We have obtained 69 patents in the
    United States, 8 foreign patents and have applications
    pending for various aspects of our technology. Our future
    success depends in part on our ability to protect our
    proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal
    products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,
    unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products
    or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we
    regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign
    countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do
    the laws of the United States. Any issued patent may not
    preserve our proprietary position, and competitors or others may
    develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology.
    Our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property
    rights could harm our business, operating results and financial
    condition.

In addition to our own proprietary software, we incorporate
    software licensed from several third-party sources into our
    products. These licenses generally renew automatically on an
    annual basis. We believe that alternative technologies for these
    licenses are available both domestically and internationally.

Employees

As of September 30, 2010, we had 2,012 full-time
    employees, including 509 in product development, 856 in
    sales and marketing, 421 in professional services and technical
    support and 226 in finance, administration and operations. None
    of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have
    experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee
    relations are good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

In addition to the other information in this report, the
    following risk factors should be carefully considered in
    evaluating our company and its business.

Our
    quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future
    periods, which may cause our stock price to
    fluctuate

Our quarterly and annual operating results have varied
    significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the
    future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future
    operating results. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a
    variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control,
    including the changing and recently volatile U.S. and
    global economic environment, and any of which may cause our
    stock price to fluctuate. In particular, we anticipate that the
    size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on
    larger business accounts. A delay in the recognition of revenue,
    even from just one account, may have a significant negative
    impact on our results of operations for a given period. In the
    past, a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of
    a quarter. Accordingly, a delay in an anticipated sale past the
    end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of
    operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that fiscal year.
    Additionally, we have exposure to the credit risks of some of
    our customers and

sub-tenants.

Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor
    and mitigate the associated risk, there can be no assurance that
    such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks
    adequately. We monitor individual payment capability in granting
    credit arrangements, seek to limit the total credit to amounts
    we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we
    believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses. If
    there is a deterioration of a

sub-tenant’s

or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults
    are higher than expected, future losses, if incurred, could harm
    our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating
    results. Further, our operating results may be below the
    expectations of securities analysts and investors in future
    quarters or years. Our failure to meet these expectations will
    likely harm the market price of our common stock. Such a decline
    could occur, and has occurred in the past, even when we have met
    our publicly stated revenue

and/or

earnings guidance.

In addition to other risks listed in this “Risk
    Factors” section, factors that may affect our operating
    results include, but are not limited to:

•

fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to
    changing market conditions, pricing conditions, technology
    evolution, seasonality, or other changes in the global economic
    environment;

•

changes or fluctuations in sales and implementation cycles for
    our products and services;

•

reduced visibility into our customers’ spending and
    implementation plans

•

reductions in customers’ budgets for data center and other
    IT purchases or delays in these purchases;

•

fluctuations in our gross margins, including the factors
    described herein which may contribute to such fluctuations;

•

our ability to control costs, including operating expenses, the
    costs of hardware and software components, and other
    manufacturing costs;

•

our ability to develop, introduce and gain market acceptance of
    new products, technologies and services, and our success in new
    and evolving markets;

•

any significant changes in the competitive environment,
    including the entry of new competitors or the substantial
    discounting of products or services;

•

the timing and execution of product transitions or new product
    introductions, and related inventory costs;



•

variations in sales channels, product costs, or mix of products
    sold;

•

our ability to establish and manage our distribution channels,
    and the effectiveness of any changes we make to our distribution
    model;

•

the ability of our contract manufacturers and suppliers to
    provide component parts, hardware platforms and other products
    in a timely manner;

•

benefits anticipated from our investments in sales, marketing,
    product development, manufacturing or other activities; and

•

changes in tax laws or regulations, or other accounting rules.

Our
    success depends on our timely development of new products and
    features, market acceptance of new product offerings and proper
    management of the timing of the life cycle of our
    products

The application delivery networking and file virtualization
    markets are characterized by rapid technological change,
    frequent new product introductions, changes in customer
    requirements and evolving industry standards. Our continued
    success depends on our ability to identify and develop new
    products and new features for our existing products to meet the
    demands of these changes, and the acceptance of those products
    and features by our existing and target customers. If we are
    unable to identify, develop and deploy new products and new
    product features on a timely basis, our business and results of
    operations may be harmed.

The current development cycle for our products is on average

12-24 months.

The introduction of new products or product enhancements may
    shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace
    sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the
    benefit of even a successful product introduction, and may cause
    customers to defer purchasing our existing products in
    anticipation of the new products. This could harm our operating
    results by decreasing sales, increasing our inventory levels of
    older products and exposing us to greater risk of product
    obsolescence. We have also experienced, and may in the future
    experience, delays in developing and releasing new products and
    product enhancements. This has led to, and may in the future
    lead to, delayed sales, increased expenses and lower quarterly
    revenue than anticipated. Also, in the development of our
    products, we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our
    products, which in turn has led to delays in product
    introductions. In addition, complexity and difficulties in
    managing product transitions at the

end-of-life

stage of a product can create excess inventory of components
    associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased
    expenses. Any or all of the above problems could materially harm
    our business and results of operations.

Our
    success depends on sales and continued innovation of our
    Application Delivery Networking product lines

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we derived
    approximately 95.4% of our net product revenues, or
    approximately 60.7% of our total net revenues, from sales of our
    Application Delivery Networking (“ADN”) product lines.
    We expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net
    revenues from sales of our ADN products in the future.
    Implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being
    able to solve critical network availability and performance
    problems for our customers. If our ADN products are unable to
    solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to
    sustain the high levels of innovation in our ADN product feature
    set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a
    competitive market environment, our business and results of
    operations will be harmed.

We may
    not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application
    delivery networking and file virtualization
    markets

The markets we serve are new, rapidly evolving and highly
    competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify
    in the future. Our principal competitors in the application
    delivery networking market include Cisco Systems, Inc., Citrix
    Systems, Inc., Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. and Radware
    Ltd. In the adjacent WAN Optimization Controller market, we
    compete with Riverbed Technology, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc.,
    Blue Coat Systems, Inc., Cisco and Citrix. In the file
    virtualization market, we compete with



EMC Corporation. We expect to continue to face additional
    competition as new participants enter our markets. As we
    continue to expand globally, we may see new competitors in
    different geographic regions. In addition, larger companies with
    significant resources, brand recognition, and sales channels may
    form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery
    networking solutions from other companies and emerge as
    significant competitors. Potential competitors may bundle their
    products or incorporate an Internet traffic management or
    security component into existing products in a manner that
    discourages users from purchasing our products. Any of these
    circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and
    negatively impact our financial performance.

The
    average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs
    may increase, which may negatively impact gross
    profits

It is possible that the average selling prices of our products
    will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing
    pressures, increased sales discounts, new product introductions
    by us or our competitors or other factors. Therefore, in order
    to maintain our gross profits, we must develop and introduce new
    products and product enhancements on a timely basis and
    continually reduce our product costs. Our failure to do so will
    cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline, which will
    harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we may
    experience substantial

period-to-period

fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of
    our average selling prices.

It is
    difficult to predict our future operating results because we
    have an unpredictable sales cycle

Our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our
    revenue is difficult to predict. Historically, our sales cycle
    has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended
    to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on
    the enterprise market. Also, as our distribution strategy has
    evolved into more of a channel model, utilizing value-added
    resellers, distributors and systems integrators, the level of
    variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has
    increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of
    many of our sales transactions. Sales of our products require us
    to educate potential customers in their use and benefits. Sales
    of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal
    budgeting, approval and competitive evaluation processes that
    large corporations and governmental entities may require. For
    example, customers frequently begin by evaluating our products
    on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our
    products before they decide whether or not to purchase.
    Customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated
    releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or
    us. As a result, our products have an unpredictable sales cycle
    that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating
    results.

Our
    business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not
    able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if
    a single source of hardware assembly is lost or
    impaired

We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to
    third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware
    platforms to our specifications. We have experienced minor
    delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past.
    However, if we experience major delays in the future or other
    problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of
    product, any one or a combination of these factors may harm our
    business and results of operations. The inability of our
    contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of
    our products or the loss of one or more of our contract
    manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders
    while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our
    business and results of operations. In particular, we currently
    subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking
    products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not
    have a long-term contract. If our arrangement with this single
    source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise
    impaired, and we were not able to engage another contract
    manufacturer in a timely manner, our business, financial
    condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.

If the demand for our products grows, we will need to increase
    our raw material and component purchases, contract manufacturing
    capacity and internal test and quality control functions. Any
    disruptions in



product flow may limit our revenue, may harm our competitive
    position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of
    orders by our customers.

Our
    business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays
    in the supply of hardware components from our third-party
    sources

We currently purchase several hardware components used in the
    assembly of our products from a number of single or limited
    sources. Lead times for these components vary significantly. The
    unavailability of suitable components, any interruption or delay
    in the supply of any of these hardware components or the
    inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources
    at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, may delay
    assembly and sales of our products and, hence, our revenues, and
    may harm our business and results of operations.

We are
    subject to governmental export and import controls that could
    subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in
    international markets

Our products are subject to U.S. export controls and may be
    exported outside the U.S. only with the required level of
    export license or through an export license exception because we
    incorporate encryption technology into our products. In
    addition, various countries regulate the import of certain
    encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our
    ability to distribute our products or our customers’
    ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in
    our products or changes in export and import regulations may
    create delays in the introduction of our products in
    international markets, prevent our customers with international
    operations from deploying our products throughout their global
    systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our
    products to certain countries altogether. Any change in export
    or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach
    to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in
    the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such
    regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by,
    or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to,
    existing or potential customers with international operations.
    For example, we will need to comply with Waste Electrical and
    Electronic Equipment Directive laws, which are being adopted by
    certain European Economic Area countries on a

country-by-country

basis. Failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely
    basis, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, operating results and financial condition. Any
    decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to
    export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our
    business, operating results and financial condition.

We may
    not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and
    our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of
    third parties

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
    trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure of
    confidential and proprietary information to protect our
    intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our
    proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or
    otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring
    unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be
    certain that the steps we have taken will prevent
    misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign
    countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights
    as fully as in the United States.

Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number
    of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding
    patent and other intellectual property rights. In the ordinary
    course of our business, we are involved in disputes and
    licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed
    proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always
    successfully defend ourselves against such claims. We expect
    that infringement claims may increase as the number of products
    and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur.
    Also, as we have gained greater visibility, market exposure and
    competitive success, we face a higher risk of being the subject
    of intellectual property infringement claims. If we are found to
    infringe the proprietary rights of others, or if we otherwise
    settle such claims, we could be compelled to pay damages or
    royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual
    property rights or alter our products so that they no longer
    infringe upon such proprietary rights. Any license could be very
    expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly,
    changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the
    rights of others



may be costly or impractical. In addition, we have initiated,
    and may in the future initiate, claims or litigation against
    third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights, or to
    determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or
    those of our competitors. Any of these claims, whether claims
    that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others, or vice
    versa, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in
    costly litigation and diversion of technical and management
    personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology,
    develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or
    licensing agreements. Further, our license agreements typically
    require us to indemnify our customers, distributors and
    resellers for infringement actions related to our technology,
    which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims
    made against our customers, distributors or resellers. Any of
    the above-described circumstances relating to intellectual
    property rights disputes could result in our business and
    results of operations being harmed.

Many of our products include intellectual property licensed from
    third parties. In the future, it may be necessary to renew
    licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new
    licenses for other technology. These third party licenses may
    not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. The
    inability to obtain certain licenses, or litigation regarding
    the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related
    intellectual property issues, could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, operating results and financial
    condition. Furthermore, we license some third party intellectual
    property on a non-exclusive basis and this may limit our ability
    to protect our intellectual property rights in our products.

We may
    not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships
    and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution
    partners could hurt our business

We sell our products and services through multiple distribution
    channels in the United States and internationally, including
    leading industry distributors, value-added resellers, systems
    integrators, service providers and other indirect channel
    partners. We have a limited number of agreements with companies
    in these channels, and we may not be able to increase our number
    of distribution relationships or maintain our existing
    relationships. Recruiting and retaining qualified channel
    partners and training them in our technologies requires
    significant time and resources. If we are unable to establish or
    maintain our indirect sales channels, our business and results
    of operations will be harmed. In addition, two worldwide
    distributors of our products accounted for 24.7% of our total
    net revenue for fiscal year 2010. One worldwide distributor of
    our products accounted for 15.4% of our total net revenue for
    fiscal year 2009. A substantial reduction or delay in sales of
    our products to these distribution partners, if not replaced by
    sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors, could
    harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

Undetected
    software or hardware errors may harm our business and results of
    operations

Our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first
    introduced or as new versions are released. We have experienced
    these errors or defects in the past in connection with new
    products and product upgrades. We expect that these errors or
    defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced
    products after commencement of commercial shipments. These
    problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair
    costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from
    our product development efforts and cause significant customer
    relations problems. We may also be subject to liability claims
    for damages related to product errors or defects. While we carry
    insurance policies covering this type of liability, these
    policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be
    asserted. A material product liability claim may harm our
    business and results of operations.

Our products must successfully operate with products from other
    vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may
    be difficult to identify the source of the problem. The
    occurrence of software or hardware problems, whether caused by
    our products or another vendor’s products, may result in
    the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products. The
    occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and
    results of operations.



Adverse
    general economic conditions or reduced information technology
    spending may adversely impact our business

A substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for
    information technology by large enterprise customers and service
    providers, the overall economic health of our current and
    prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of
    the Internet. International, national, regional and local
    economic conditions, such as recessionary economic cycles,
    protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the
    economy could adversely impact demand for our products. The
    purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve
    a significant commitment of capital and other resources.
    Continued weak economic conditions or a reduction in information
    technology spending even if economic conditions improve would
    likely result in longer sales cycles and reduced product sales,
    each of which would adversely impact our business, results of
    operations and financial condition.

Our
    investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that
    may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these
    investments

At September 30, 2010, the fair value of our AAA/A- (or
    equivalent) rated municipal auction rate securities
    (“ARS”) was approximately $16.0 million. We may
    not be able to liquidate these ARS and realize their full
    carrying value unless the issuer calls the security, a
    successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the
    auction process, or the security otherwise matures. While we do
    not believe the decline in the carrying values of these
    municipal ARS is permanent, if the issuers of these securities
    are unable to successfully close future auctions and their
    credit ratings are lowered, we may be required to record future
    impairment charges related to these investments, which would
    harm our results of operations. We believe certain of these

available-for-sale

investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months
    and as a result, we have classified these investments as
    long-term as of September 30, 2010.

Our
    operating results are exposed to risks associated with
    international commerce

As our international sales increase, our operating results
    become more exposed to international operating risks. These
    risks include risks related to recessionary economic cycles or
    protracted slowdowns in economies outside the United States,
    foreign currency exchange rates, managing foreign sales offices,
    regulatory, political or economic conditions in specific
    countries, military conflict or terrorist activities, changes in
    laws and tariffs, inadequate protection of intellectual property
    rights in foreign countries, foreign regulatory requirements and
    natural disasters. All of these factors could have a material
    adverse effect on our business. We intend to continue expanding
    into international markets. International sales represented
    41.4% and 44.7% of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended
    September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Changes
    in governmental regulations could negatively affect our
    revenues

Our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by
    the United States and various foreign governments including, but
    not limited to, environmental regulations and regulations
    implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the
    import or export of some technologies, especially encryption
    technology. Changes in governmental regulation and our inability
    or failure to obtain required approvals, permits or
    registrations could harm our international and domestic sales
    and adversely affect our revenues, business and operations.

Changes
    in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected
    revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of
    operations

A change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on
    our reported results and may even affect our reporting of
    transactions completed before the change is effective. New
    pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing
    pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the
    future. Changes to existing rules, or changes to the
    interpretations of existing rules, could lead to changes in our
    accounting practices, and such changes could adversely affect
    our reported financial results or the way we conduct our
    business.



Acquisitions
    present many risks and we may not realize the financial and
    strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the
    transaction

With respect to our past acquisitions, as well as any other
    future acquisitions we may undertake, we may find that the
    acquired businesses, products or technologies do not further our
    business strategy as expected, that we paid more than what the
    assets are later worth or that economic conditions change, all
    of which may generate future impairment charges. Our
    acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers, financial
    markets or investors. There may be difficulty integrating the
    operations and personnel of the acquired business, and we may
    have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired
    business. We may have difficulty in integrating the acquired
    technologies or products with our existing product lines. Our
    ongoing business and management’s attention may be
    disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and
    the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse
    locations. We may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards,
    controls, procedures and policies across locations. We may
    experience significant problems or liabilities associated with
    product quality, technology and other matters.

Our inability to successfully operate and integrate
    newly-acquired businesses appropriately, effectively and in a
    timely manner, or to retain key personnel of any acquired
    business, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
    take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated
    traffic management and security solutions and other advances in
    technology, as well as on our revenues, gross margins and
    expenses.

Our
    success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract
    and retain qualified sales and marketing, operations, product
    development and professional services personnel

Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued
    contributions of our key management, product development, sales,
    marketing and finance personnel, many of whom may be difficult
    to replace. The complexity of our application delivery
    networking products and their integration into existing networks
    and ongoing support, as well as the sophistication of our sales
    and marketing effort, requires us to retain highly trained
    professional services, customer support and sales personnel.
    Competition for qualified professional services, customer
    support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because
    of the limited number of people available with the necessary
    technical skills and understanding of our products. Our ability
    to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by
    volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock, since
    these employees are generally granted restricted stock units.
    The loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability
    to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or
    delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and
    results of operations.

We
    face litigation risks

We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business.
    Litigation in general, and intellectual property and securities
    litigation in particular, can be expensive, lengthy and
    disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results
    of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
    Responding to lawsuits has been, and will likely continue to be,
    expensive and time-consuming for us. An unfavorable resolution
    of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business, results
    of operations or financial condition.

Our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our
    prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks
    associated with litigation. Beginning in May 2006 several
    derivative actions were filed against certain current and former
    directors and officers (as discussed further in Part II,
    Item 8, Note 8, “Commitments and
    Contingencies — Litigation”) based on allegations
    relating to our historical stock option practices. We cannot
    assure you that this current litigation will result in the same
    conclusions reached by the special committee of outside
    directors formed by our Board of Directors to conduct a review
    of our stock option practices (the “Special
    Committee”). Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse
    findings in any of these matters, we could be required to pay
    damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us
    which could adversely affect our business, results of operations
    or financial condition.



Anti-takeover
    provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to
    acquire us

Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the
    price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions,
    including voting rights, of those shares without any further
    vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of
    common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected
    by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be
    issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have
    the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of
    control of our company without further action by our
    shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other
    rights of the holders of common stock. Further, certain
    provisions of our bylaws, including a provision limiting the
    ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of
    shareholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect
    of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of
    our company, which could have an adverse effect on the market
    price of our common stock. In addition, our articles of
    incorporation provide for a staggered board, which may make it
    more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of
    Directors. Similarly, state anti-takeover laws in the State of
    Washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a
    change of control of our company.

Properties

We lease our principal administrative, sales, marketing,
    research and development facilities, which are located in
    Seattle, Washington and consist of approximately
    190,000 square feet. In April 2010, we amended and restated
    the lease agreement for the three buildings that serve as our
    corporate headquarters. The lease commenced in April, July and
    August of 2010 for various sections of the first building; and
    August 2010 for the second and third buildings. The lease for
    all three buildings will expire in 2022 with an option for
    renewal. In October 2006, we entered into an agreement to lease
    a building adjacent to the three buildings that serve as our
    corporate headquarters. This lease will expire in 2018. During
    2008, we entered into two separate sublease agreements to
    sublease approximately 112,500 square feet of this
    building. One sublease will expire in 2013. In March 2010, we
    amended the second sublease, which expanded the subleased space
    by approximately 11,700 square feet and extended the term
    of the sublease to 2018.

We believe that our existing properties are in good condition
    and suitable for the conduct of our business. We also lease
    office space for our product development personnel in Spokane,
    Washington, San Jose, California, Lowell, Massachusetts,
    Israel, and Russia and for our sales and support personnel in
    Illinois, Washington D.C., New York, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    China, Taiwan, Thailand, India, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia,
    Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Germany,
    France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Netherlands and the United
    Kingdom. We believe that our future growth can be accommodated
    by our current facilities or by leasing additional space if
    necessary.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

Derivative Suits.

Beginning on or about
    May 24, 2006, several derivative actions were filed against
    certain of our current and former directors and officers. These
    derivative lawsuits were filed in: (1) the Superior Court
    of King County, Washington, as In re F5 Networks, Inc. State
    Court Derivative Litigation (Case

No. 06-2-17195-1

SEA), which consolidates Adams v. Amdahl, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-17195-1

SEA), Wright v. Amdahl, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-19159-5

SEA), and Sommer v. McAdam, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-26248-4

SEA) (the “State Court Derivative Litigation”); and
    (2) in the U.S. District Court for the Western
    District of Washington, as In re F5 Networks, Inc. Derivative
    Litigation, Master File

No. C06-0794RSL,

which consolidates Hutton v. McAdam, et al. (Case

No. 06-794RSL),

Locals 302 and 612 of the International Union of Operating
    Engineers-Employers Construction Industry Retirement
    Trust v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1057RSL),

and Easton v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1145RSL)

(the “Federal Court Derivative Litigation”). On
    August 2, 2007, another derivative lawsuit, Barone v.
    McAdam et al. (Case

No. C07-1200P)

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
    District of Washington. The Barone lawsuit was designated a
    related case to the Federal Court Derivative



Litigation on September 4, 2007. The complaints generally
    allege that certain of our current and former directors and
    officers, including, in general, each of our current outside
    directors (other than Deborah L. Bevier, Scott Thompson and John
    Chapple who joined the Board of Directors in July 2006, January
    2008 and September 2010, respectively) breached their fiduciary
    duties to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful conduct
    concerning the manipulation of certain stock option grant dates.
    We are named solely as a nominal defendant against whom the
    plaintiffs seek no recovery.

On September 24, 2010, the Company entered into a
    Stipulation of Settlement (the “Stipulation”) in
    connection with the Federal Court Derivative Litigation. On
    October 21, 2010, the United States District Court for the
    Western District of Washington issued an order granting
    preliminary approval of the settlement resolving the claims
    asserted by the plaintiffs against the individual defendants. A
    hearing to determine whether the Court should issue an order
    finally approving the proposed settlement has been scheduled for
    January 6, 2011. Effectiveness of the settlement of the
    Federal Court Derivative Litigation is conditioned on dismissal
    of the State Court Derivative Litigation. A copy of the
    Stipulation may be found under the “About F5-Investor
    Relations-Corporate Governance” section of our website,

SEC and Department of Justice Inquiries.

We
    previously received notice from both the SEC and the Department
    of Justice that they were conducting informal inquiries into our
    historical stock option practices, and we have fully cooperated
    with both agencies. In January 2010, we received notice from the
    SEC that the investigation concerning our historical stock
    option practices has been completed and that no enforcement
    action has been recommended. We currently believe that the
    Department of Justice will take no further action in connection
    with its inquiry into our historical stock option practices.

We are not aware of any additional pending legal proceedings
    that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material
    adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial
    condition. We may in the future be party to litigation arising
    in the ordinary course of business, including claims that we
    allegedly infringe upon third-party intellectual property
    rights. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in
    the expenditure of significant financial and managerial
    resources.

Our policy has been to retain cash to fund future growth.
    Accordingly, we have not paid dividends and do not anticipate
    declaring dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable
    future.

Unregistered
    Securities Sold in 2010

We did not sell any unregistered shares of our common stock
    during the fiscal year 2010.

Issuer
    Purchases of Equity Securities

On October 22, 2008, we announced that our Board of
    Directors approved a program to repurchase up to an additional
    $200 million of our outstanding common stock. Acquisitions
    for the share repurchase program will be made from time to time
    in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by
    securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be
    discontinued at any time. As of November 18, 2010 we had
    repurchased and retired 4,605,827 shares at an average
    price of $37.15 per share under the program.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results
    of operations contains forward-looking statements within the
    meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. These
    statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our
    plans, objectives, expectations, strategies, intentions or other
    characterizations of future events or circumstances and are
    generally identified by the words “expects,”
    “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,”
    “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,”
    and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are
    based on current information and expectations and are subject to
    a number of risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could
    differ materially from those expressed or implied by these
    forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or
    contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to,
    those discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”
    herein and in other documents we file from time to time with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission. We assume no obligation to
    revise or update any such forward-looking statements.

Overview

We are a global provider of appliances consisting of software
    and hardware and services that help companies efficiently and
    securely manage the delivery, optimization and security of
    application and data traffic on Internet-based networks, and to
    optimize the performance and utilization of data storage
    infrastructure and other network resources. We market and sell
    our products primarily through multiple indirect sales channels
    in the Americas (primarily the United States); Europe, the
    Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia Pacific
    region (APAC). Enterprise customers (Fortune 1000 or Business
    Week Global 1000 companies) in the technology,
    telecommunications, financial services, transportation,
    education, manufacturing and health care industries, along with
    government customers, continue to make up the largest percentage
    of our customer base.

Our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key
    performance indicators in order to manage our business and
    evaluate our financial and operating performance. Those
    indicators include:

•

Revenues.

The majority of our revenues are
    derived from sales of our Application Delivery Networking
    (“ADN”) products and related software modules; BIG-IP
    Local Traffic Manager, BIG-IP Global Traffic Manager, BIG-IP
    Link Controller, BIG-IP Application Security Manager, BIG-IP
    Edge Gateway, BIG-IP WAN Optimization module, BIG-IP Access
    Policy Manager, and WebAccelerator; FirePass SSL VPN appliance;
    and our ARX file virtualization products. We also derive
    revenues from the sales of



services including annual maintenance contracts, training and
    consulting services. We carefully monitor the sales mix of our
    revenues within each reporting period. We believe customer
    acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements
    are indicators of future trends. We also consider overall
    revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as
    additional indicators of current and future trends.

•

Cost of revenues and gross margins.

We strive
    to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross
    margins. Significant items impacting cost of revenues are
    hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third-party
    software license fees, amortization of developed technology and
    personnel and overhead expenses. Our margins have remained
    relatively stable; however, factors such as sales price, product
    mix, inventory obsolescence, returns, component price increases
    and warranty costs could significantly impact our gross margins
    from quarter to quarter and represent significant indicators we
    monitor on a regular basis.

•

Operating expenses.

Operating expenses are
    substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses.
    Existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant
    factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense
    trends. Other significant operating expenses that we monitor
    include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees,
    computer costs related to the development of new products,
    facilities and depreciation expenses.

•

Liquidity and cash flows.

Our financial
    condition remains strong with significant cash and investments
    and no long term debt. The increase in cash and investments for
    fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to cash provided by operating
    activities of $313.6 million. This increase was partially
    offset by $75.0 million of cash used to repurchase
    outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in
    fiscal year 2010. Going forward, we believe the primary driver
    of cash flows will be net income from operations. Capital
    expenditures for fiscal year 2010 were comprised primarily of
    information technology infrastructure and equipment to support
    the growth of our core business activities. We will continue to
    evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in businesses,
    products, or technologies that we believe are strategic, which
    may require the use of cash.

•

Balance sheet.

We view cash, short-term and
    long-term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable
    balances and day’s sales outstanding as important
    indicators of our financial health. Deferred revenues continued
    to increase in fiscal 2010 due to growth in the amount of annual
    maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance
    renewal contracts related to our existing product installation
    base. Our day’s sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of
    fiscal year 2010 was 40.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. The preparation of these financial
    statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and
    on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
    estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the
    more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation
    of our financial statements.

Revenue Recognition.

We sell products through
    distributors, resellers, and directly to end users. We recognize
    product revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns,
    provided that collection is determined to be reasonably assured
    and no significant performance obligations remain. In certain
    regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate
    returns, we defer revenue on sales to our distributors until
    they have received information from the channel partner
    indicating that the distributor has sold the product to its
    customer. Payment terms to domestic customers are generally net
    30 days to net 45 days. Payment terms to international
    customers range from net 30 days to net 120 days based
    on normal and customary trade practices



in the individual markets. We offer extended payment terms to
    certain customers, in which case, revenue is recognized when
    payments are due.

Whenever product, training services and post-contract customer
    support (“PCS”) elements are sold together, a portion
    of the sales price is allocated to each element based on their
    respective fair values as determined when the individual
    elements are sold separately. Where fair value of certain
    elements is not available, we recognize revenue on the
    “residual method” based on the fair value of
    undelivered elements. Revenues from the sale of product are
    recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is
    obligated to pay for the product. When rights of return are
    present and we cannot estimate returns, we recognize revenue
    when such rights of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the service contract
    term. PCS includes a limited period of telephone support
    updates, repair or replacement of any failed product or
    component that fails during the term of the agreement, bug fixes
    and rights to upgrades, when and if available. Consulting
    services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates, plus

out-of-pocket

expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has
    been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training
    has been completed.

FASB ASC Topic

985-605-25,

Software, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element
    Arrangements

, (“ASC

985-605-25”),

as amended, requires revenue earned on software arrangements
    involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element
    based on the relative fair values of those elements. The fair
    value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective
    evidence (“VSOE”). We establish VSOE for our products,
    training services, PCS and consulting services based on the
    sales price charged for each element when sold separately. The
    sales price is discounted from the applicable list price based
    on various factors including the type of customer, volume of
    sales, geographic region and program level. Our list prices are
    generally not fair value as discounts may be given based on the
    factors enumerated above. We believe that the fair value of our
    consulting services is represented by the billable consulting
    rate per hour, based on the rates we charge customers when they
    purchase standalone consulting services. The price of consulting
    services is not based on the type of customer, volume of sales,
    geographic region or program level.

We use historical sales transactions to determine whether VSOE
    can be established for each of the elements. In most instances,
    VSOE of fair value is the sales price of actual standalone
    (unbundled) transactions within the past 12 month period
    that are priced within a reasonable range, which we have
    determined to be plus or minus 15% of the median sales price of
    each respective price list.

VSOE of PCS is based on standalone sales since we do not provide
    stated renewal rates to our customers. In accordance with our
    PCS pricing practice (supported by standalone renewal sales),
    renewal contracts are priced as a percentage of the undiscounted
    product list price. The PCS renewal percentages may vary,
    depending on the type and length of PCS purchased. We offer
    standard and premium PCS, and the term generally ranges from one
    to three years. We employ a bell-shaped-curve approach in
    evaluating VSOE of fair value of PCS. Under this approach, we
    consider VSOE of the fair value of PCS to exist when a
    substantial majority of our standalone PCS sales fall within a
    narrow range of pricing.

We have established and regularly validate the VSOE of fair
    value for elements in our multiple element arrangements. We
    account for taxes collected from customers and remitted to
    governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded from
    revenues.

Reserve for Doubtful Accounts.

Estimates are
    used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are
    based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a
    percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging
    category. In determining these percentages, we evaluate
    historical write-offs, current trends in the credit quality of
    our customer base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We
    perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’
    financial condition and do not require any collateral. If there
    is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or
    actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our
    allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient.

Reserve for Product Returns.

In some
    instances, product revenue from distributors is subject to
    agreements allowing rights of return. Product returns are
    estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the
    time revenues are recognized. Accordingly, we reduce recognized
    revenue for estimated future



returns at the time revenue is recorded. When rights of return
    are present and we cannot estimate returns, revenue is
    recognized when such rights lapse. The estimates for returns are
    adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of
    returns and other related factors. It is possible that these
    estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts
    could vary from our estimates.

Accounting for Income Taxes.

We utilize the
    liability method of accounting for income taxes. Accordingly, we
    are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the
    jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of
    preparing our consolidated financial statements. This process
    involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including
    assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with
    assessing temporary differences resulting from the different
    treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These
    differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due
    to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with
    the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is
    possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in
    the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and
    adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition
    and cash flows.

Stock-Based Compensation.

We account for
    stock-based compensation using the straight-line attribution
    method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite
    service period of the related award. We recognized
    $70.8 million and $56.1 million of stock-based
    compensation expense for the years ended September 30, 2010
    and 2009, respectively. As of September 30, 2010, there was
    $98.4 million of total unrecognized stock-based
    compensation cost, the majority of which will be recognized over
    the next two years. Going forward, stock-based compensation
    expenses may increase as we issue additional equity-based awards
    to continue to attract and retain key employees.

We issue incentive awards to our employees through stock-based
    compensation consisting of restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”). The value of RSUs is determined using the
    fair value method, which in this case, is based on the number of
    shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the
    date of grant. No stock options were granted in fiscal years
    2010, 2009 and 2008.

We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of RSUs
    that are expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated
    forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee
    termination behavior. Based on historical differences with
    forfeitures of stock-based awards granted to our executive
    officers and Board of Directors versus grants awarded to all
    other employees, we developed separate forfeiture expectations
    for these two groups. In fiscal year 2010, the estimated
    forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and
    Board of Directors was approximately 3% and the estimated
    forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other employees was
    approximately 10%. If the actual number of forfeitures differs
    from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to
    stock-based compensation expense may be required in future
    periods.

We recognize compensation costs for awards with performance
    conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance
    condition will be achieved. We reassess the probability of
    vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs
    based on our probability assessment.

Common stock repurchase.

On October 22,
    2008, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a
    program to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of
    our outstanding common stock. On October 26, 2010, we
    announced that our Board of Directors approved a new program to
    repurchase up to an additional $200 million of our
    outstanding common stock. As of November 18, 2010, we had
    repurchased and retired 4,605,827 shares at an average
    price of $37.15 per share.

Goodwill and intangible assets.

We have
    goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to
    acquisitions. Intangible assets are carried and reported at
    acquisition cost, net of accumulated amortization subsequent to
    acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized over the estimated
    useful lives, which generally range from three to five years.
    Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
    circumstances indicate impairment might exist. Projected
    undiscounted net cash flows expected to be derived from the use
    of those assets are compared to the respective net carrying
    amounts to determine whether any impairment exists. Impairment,
    if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the
    fair value of those assets.

The determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and
    intangible assets and the extent to which, if any, there is
    impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on
    our part, including the useful



life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized, and
    the estimates of the value of future net cash flows, which are
    based upon further estimates of future revenues, expenses and
    operating margins. We review our goodwill annually for
    impairment in the second fiscal quarter, or whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    goodwill may not be recoverable. The first step of the test
    identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred, while
    the second step of the test measures the amount of the
    impairment, if any. Impairment is recognized when the carrying
    amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. In March 2010, we
    completed our annual impairment test and concluded that there
    was no impairment of goodwill. We have considered the
    assumptions used in the test and noted that no reasonably
    possible changes would reduce the fair value of the reporting
    unit to such a level that would cause an impairment charge.
    Additionally, we considered potential impairment indicators at
    September 30, 2010 and noted no indicators of impairment.

Investments.

Our investments are diversified
    among high-credit quality debt securities in accordance with our
    investment policy. We classify our investments as

available-for-sale,

which are reported at fair market value with the related
    unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity.
    Realized gains and losses and declines in value of these
    investments judged to be other than temporary are included in
    other income (expense). To date, we have not deemed it necessary
    to record any charges related to

other-than-temporary

declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt
    securities. However, the fair value of our investments is
    subject to volatility. Declines in the fair value of our
    investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely
    affect our future operating results.

Our investments also include auction rate securities
    (“ARS”) that are classified as

available-for-sale.

ARS are reported at fair market value with the related
    unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity. We
    believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than
    twelve months and as a result, we have classified these
    investments as long-term as of September 30, 2010. We used
    the income approach to determine the fair value of our ARS using
    a discounted cash flow analysis. The assumptions we used in
    preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for
    interest rates; estimates for discount rates using yields of
    comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other
    risk factors, amount of cash flows and expected holding periods
    for the ARS.

Net Revenues.

Total net revenues increased
    35.0% in fiscal year 2010 from the prior year, compared to only
    a slight increase in fiscal year 2009 from fiscal year 2008.
    Overall revenue growth for the year ended September 30,
    2010 was primarily due to increased product and service revenues
    as a result of our increased installed base of products and
    increased demand for our core ADN products, including
    application security and WAN optimization products.
    International revenues represented 41.4%, 44.7% and 42.5% of net
    revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We
    expect international sales will continue to represent a



significant portion of net revenues, although we cannot provide
    assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net
    revenues will remain at current levels.

Net product revenues increased 38.0% in fiscal year 2010 from
    fiscal year 2009 and decreased 10.2% in fiscal year 2009 as
    compared to fiscal year 2008. The increase of
    $154.6 million in net product sales for fiscal year 2010
    was primarily due to growth in the volume of product sales of
    our ADN products of $154.8, partially offset by a decrease in
    sales of our FirePass products of $2.6 million. In
    addition, net product revenue from our ARX file virtualization
    products increased $2.3 million in fiscal year 2010. The
    decrease of $46.4 million in net product sales for fiscal
    year 2009 was primarily due to a $36.1 million reduction in
    the volume of sales of our ADN products, a $5.4 million
    reduction in the sales of our ARX file virtualization products,
    and a $4.9 million reduction in the volume of sales of our
    FirePass products, as compared to the prior year. Sales of our
    ADN products represented 95.4%, 93.7% and 92.0% of total product
    revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Net service revenues increased 30.1% in fiscal year 2010 from
    fiscal year 2009 and increased 25.0% in fiscal year 2009 as
    compared to fiscal year 2008. The increases in service revenue
    were the result of increased purchases or renewals of
    maintenance contracts driven by additions to our installed base
    of products.

Avnet Technology Solutions, one of our worldwide distributors,
    accounted for 14.5%, 15.4% and 14.0% of our total net revenues
    in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Tech Data,
    another worldwide distributor, accounted for 10.2% of our total
    net revenues in fiscal year 2010. Ingram Micro, Inc., another
    worldwide distributor, accounted for 10.5% of our total net
    revenues in fiscal year 2008. Avnet Technology Solutions, Tech
    Data and Ingram Micro, Inc. accounted for 13.2%, 11.8% and 13.2%
    of our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2010,
    respectively. Avnet Technology Solutions and Ingram Micro, Inc.
    accounted for 11.6% and 10.7% of our accounts receivable as of
    September 30, 2009, respectively. Avnet Technology
    Solutions accounted for 10.5% of our accounts receivable as of
    September 30, 2008. No other distributors accounted for
    more than 10% of total net revenue or receivables for fiscal
    years 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Cost of Net Product Revenues.

Cost of net
    product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our
    contract manufacturers, manufacturing overhead, freight,
    warranty, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and
    amortization expenses in connection with developed technology
    from acquisitions. Product cost increased to $113.8 million
    in fiscal year 2010 from $95.2 million in fiscal year 2009.
    The year over year increase was primarily due to the higher
    volume of units shipped and an increase in warranty expense,
    partially offset by a decrease in expense related to obsolete
    inventory. Product cost as a percentage of related net revenue
    decreased to 20.3% in fiscal year 2010 from 23.4% in fiscal year
    2009 primarily due to reduced manufacturing costs and decreased
    indirect product costs. In fiscal year 2009, the year over year
    decrease from $102.4 million in fiscal year 2008 was
    primarily due to a reduction in the volume of units shipped.



Cost of Net Service Revenues.

Cost of net
    service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of
    our professional services staff, travel, facilities and
    depreciation expenses. Cost of net service revenues as a
    percentage of net service revenues decreased to 18.1% in fiscal
    year 2010 from 19.3% in fiscal year 2009 and 23.6% in fiscal
    year 2008 primarily due to the scalability of our existing
    customer support infrastructure and increased revenue from
    maintenance contracts. Professional services headcount at the
    end of fiscal year 2010 increased to 421 from 330 at the end of
    fiscal year 2009 and 323 at the end of fiscal year 2008. In
    addition, cost of net service revenues included stock-based
    compensation expense of $6.0 million, $4.8 million and
    $4.0 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing
    expenses consist of salaries, commissions and related benefits
    of our sales and marketing staff, the costs of our marketing
    programs, including public relations, advertising and trade
    shows, travel, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Sales and
    marketing expense increased 30.2% in fiscal year 2010 as
    compared to a year over year decrease of 5.1% in fiscal year
    2009 and a year over year increase of 35.1% in fiscal year 2008.
    The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal year 2010
    was primarily due to an increase in commissions and personnel
    costs of $43.9 million, compared to the prior year. The
    increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal year 2010 was
    also due to an increase of $9.2 million in marketing
    promotions and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and
    creating market awareness of our technology and our products.
    The fiscal year 2009 decrease over the prior year was primarily
    due to cost reduction initiatives we implemented in response to
    the slowing economic environment and a $6.9 million
    decrease in commissions expense corresponding to the decrease in
    product revenue for fiscal year 2009, compared to the prior
    year. Sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2010
    increased to 856 from 696 at the end of fiscal 2009 and 716 at
    the end of fiscal 2008. Sales and marketing expense included
    stock-based compensation charges of $27.3 million,
    $22.6 million and $24.1 million for fiscal years 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Research and Development.

Research and
    development expenses consist of the salaries and related
    benefits for our product development personnel, prototype
    materials and other expenses related to the development of new
    and improved products, facilities and depreciation expenses.
    Research and development expense increased 14.1% in fiscal year
    2010, compared to the prior year. The increase in research and
    development expense for fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to
    increased personnel costs of $7.1 million, which is
    consistent with the increase in revenue for the corresponding
    period. In addition, research and development expense included a
    year over year increase in computer equipment and software costs
    of $3.8 million to support the development of new and
    improved products. In fiscal year 2009, research and



development expenses remained relatively consistent with the
    prior year as compared to a year over year increase of 49.8% in
    fiscal year 2008. The increase in research and development
    expense for fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to increased
    personnel costs of $19.7 million, which is consistent with
    the increased revenue for the corresponding period. Research and
    development headcount at the end of fiscal 2010 increased to 509
    from 430 at the end of fiscal 2009 and 460 at the end of fiscal
    2008. Research and development expense included stock-based
    compensation charges of $19.4 million, $16.7 million
    and $16.3 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. We expect research and development expenses to
    remain consistent as a percentage of net revenue in the
    foreseeable future.

General and Administrative.

General and
    administrative expenses consist of the salaries, benefits and
    related costs of our executive, finance, information technology,
    human resource and legal personnel, third-party professional
    service fees, bad debt charges, facilities and depreciation
    expenses. General and administrative expense increased 24.0% in
    fiscal year 2010, compared to the prior year. The increase in
    general and administrative expense was primarily due to an
    increase of $4.1 million in personnel costs for the year
    ended September 30, 2010, compared to the prior year.
    General and administrative expenses remained relatively
    consistent in fiscal year 2009 as compared with a year over year
    increase of 13.7% in fiscal year 2008. The increase in fiscal
    year 2008 of $6.7 million was due primarily to an increase
    of $3.2 million in stock-based compensation charges and an
    increase of $3.5 million in salary and benefit expenses.
    General and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2010
    increased to 226 from 190 at the end of fiscal 2009 and 195 at
    the end of fiscal 2008. General and administrative expense
    included stock-based compensation charges of $17.0 million,
    $11.6 million and $15.9 million for fiscal years 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Loss on Facility Exit and Sublease.

During
    2008, we exited a research and development facility in Bellevue,
    Washington for which there was remaining operating lease
    obligations through 2014. In addition, during this period we
    consolidated our corporate headquarters, partially subleasing
    the building located at 333 Elliott Avenue West in Seattle,
    Washington for which there were remaining operating lease
    obligations through 2018. As a result of the expected loss on
    the facility exit and sublease agreements, we recorded a charge
    of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.

Restructuring.

Beginning in the second quarter
    of fiscal 2009 we implemented a comprehensive restructuring
    program as part of an overall initiative to reduce certain
    operating expenses. Restructuring actions included the
    consolidation of facilities, accelerated depreciation on tenant
    improvements and a reduction in workforce. In the second quarter
    of fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring expenses of
    $4.3 million, which included a $2.1 million charge for
    severance and related costs and a $2.2 million charge for
    the exit of certain offices worldwide. All accrued restructuring
    costs had been incurred as of September 30, 2010.

Other Income, Net.

Other income, net, consists
    primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction
    gains and losses. Other income, net decreased 21.6% in fiscal
    year 2010, as compared to fiscal year 2009 and decreased 48.7%
    in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008. Interest
    income was $8.1 million, $9.9 million and
    $17.5 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The decrease in other income, net for fiscal year
    2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to
    decreased interest income of $1.8 million, partially offset
    by increased foreign currency transaction gains of
    $1.0 million. The decrease in interest income for fiscal
    year 2010 was primarily due to a decline in interest rates for
    the year. The decrease in other income, net for fiscal year 2009
    as compared to fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to a decline
    in interest rates for the year which decreased interest income
    by $7.6 million and decreased foreign currency transaction
    gains of $1.5 million.

Provision for Income Taxes.

We recorded a
    36.4% provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2010 compared
    to 30.5% in fiscal year 2009 and 37.1% in fiscal year 2008. The
    increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2009 to
    fiscal year 2010 is largely attributable to the expiration of
    the federal research and development credit at December 31,
    2009 and a favorable adjustment related to equity awards in a
    major foreign tax jurisdiction which was reflected in the
    effective tax rate for fiscal year 2009.

At September 30, 2010, we did not have a valuation
    allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the
    jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the
    assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making this
    determination we have considered projected future taxable income
    and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in
    assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance. Our net
    deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2010, 2009 and 2008
    were $46.6 million, $57.0 million and
    $52.8 million, respectively. Our worldwide effective tax
    rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including
    variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic
    locations in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our
    net deferred tax assets, resolution of potential exposures, tax
    positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic
    locations in which we operate, and the introduction of new
    accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations
    thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate.
    The federal credit for increasing research activities expired at
    December 31, 2009. If the credit is reinstated in fiscal
    year 2011, the reinstatement may have a material impact on our
    worldwide effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011. We have
    recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related
    to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be
    challenged by taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution of
    these potential exposures may be greater or less than the
    liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our
    future tax expense.

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term
    investments totaled $862.1 million as of September 30,
    2010 compared to $574.4 million as of September 30,
    2009, representing an increase of $287.6 million. The
    increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating
    activities of $313.6 million for fiscal year 2010, compared
    to $202.0 million for fiscal year 2009, which was partially
    offset by $75.0 million of additional cash required for the
    repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share
    repurchase program in fiscal 2010. In fiscal year 2009, the
    increase over the previous year was primarily due to cash
    provided by operating activities of $202.0 million,
    compared to $193.7 million for fiscal year 2008, which was



partially offset by $87.4 million of additional cash
    required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under
    our share repurchase program in fiscal 2009.

At September 30, 2010, we held $16.0 million in fair
    value of tax-exempt ARS, which are variable-rate debt securities
    and have a long-term maturity with the interest rates being
    reset through Dutch auctions that are typically held every 7, 28
    or 35 days. The securities have historically traded at par
    and are callable at par at the option of the issuer. Interest is
    typically paid at the end of each auction period or
    semi-annually. We limit our investments in ARS to securities
    that carry a AAA/A- (or equivalent) rating from recognized
    rating agencies and limit the amount of credit exposure to any
    one issuer. At the time of initial investment and at the date of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

all of our ARS were in compliance with our investment policy.

Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately
    $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS we held because
    sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these auctions failed to
    clear, higher interest rates for those securities went into
    effect. However, the funds associated with these failed auctions
    will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a
    successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the
    auction process or the security matures.

We have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers
    of our ARS are presently at risk of default. The underlying
    assets of the municipal ARS we hold, including the securities
    for which auctions have failed, are generally student loans
    which are guaranteed by the U.S. government. Through
    September 30, 2010, we have continued to receive interest
    payments on the ARS in accordance with their terms. We believe
    we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant
    loss primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying
    securities. However, due to uncertainty in the ARS market, we
    believe certain of these

available-for-sale

investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months
    and as a result, we have classified $19.0 million (par
    value) of our ARS as long-term as of September 30, 2010.

In October 2008, we entered into an agreement (“the
    Agreement”) with UBS whereby UBS would purchase eligible
    ARS it sold to us prior to February 13, 2008. Under the
    terms of the Agreement, and at our discretion, UBS will purchase
    eligible ARS from us at par value (“put option”)
    during the period of June 30, 2010 through July 2,
    2012. Prior to September 30, 2010, UBS purchased all of the
    eligible ARS we held for their par value of $34.4 million.

Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2010
    was $313.6 million compared to $202.0 million in
    fiscal year 2009 and $193.7 million in fiscal year 2008.
    Cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from
    cash generated from net income, after adjusting for non-cash
    charges such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and
    amortization charges and changes in operating assets and
    liabilities.

Cash used in investing activities was $238.2 million for
    fiscal year 2010, compared to cash used in investing activities
    of $99.1 million for fiscal year 2009 and cash provided by
    investing activities of $13.7 million for fiscal year 2008.
    The cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2010 was
    primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital
    expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide
    partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments. The
    cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2009 was
    primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital
    expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide
    partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments. The
    cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2008 was
    primarily the result of the sale and maturity of investments
    partially offset by the purchase of investments.

Cash used in financing activities was $16.8 million for
    fiscal year 2010, compared to cash used in financing activities
    of $70.7 million for fiscal year 2009 and cash used in
    financing activities of $181.7 million for fiscal year
    2008. Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2010 included
    $75.0 million to repurchase common stock under our share
    repurchase program, which was partially offset by cash received
    from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases
    under our employee stock purchase plan of $31.7 million and
    tax benefits related to share-based compensation of
    $26.5 million. Cash used in financing activities for fiscal
    2009 included $87.4 million to repurchase common stock
    under our share repurchase program, which was partially offset
    by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under
    our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing
    activities for fiscal 2008 included $200 million to



repurchase common stock under a previous share repurchase
    program, which was partially offset by the exercise of employee
    stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase
    plan.

Based on our current operating and capital expenditure
    forecasts, we believe that our existing cash and investment
    balances, excluding ARS, together with cash generated from
    operations should be sufficient to meet our operating
    requirements for the foreseeable future. Our future capital
    requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of
    revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing
    activities, the timing and extent of expansion into new
    territories, the timing of introductions of new products and
    enhancements of existing products, and the continuing market
    acceptance of our products.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued

ASC 810-10,

Consolidation — Overall

(“ASC

810-10”),

which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. We adopted

ASC 810-10

in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. The adoption of this
    statement did not have any impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

2009-13,

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements,

(amendments to
    FASB ASC Topic 605,

Revenue Recognition

) (“ASU

2009-13”)

and ASU

2009-14,

Certain Arrangements That Include Software Elements

,
    (amendments to FASB ASC Topic 985,

Software

) (“ASU

2009-14”).

ASU

2009-13

requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using
    estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services
    based on a selling price hierarchy. The amendments eliminate the
    residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be
    allocated using the relative selling price method. ASU

2009-14

removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue
    guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software
    deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product
    are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance. ASU

2009-13

and
    ASU

2009-14

should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue
    arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years
    beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption
    permitted. We adopted ASU

2009-13

and
    ASU

2009-14

in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. The adoption of these
    statements did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-06,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic
    820) — Improving Disclosures about Fair Value
    Measurements

(“ASU

2010-06”).

ASU

2010-06

increases disclosures to include transfers in and out of
    Levels 1 and 2 and clarifies inputs, valuation techniques
    and level of disaggregation to be disclosed. We adopted ASU

2010-06

in
    the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. The



adoption of this statement did not have any impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk.

Our cash equivalents
    consist of high-quality securities, as specified in our
    investment policy guidelines. The policy limits the amount of
    credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5% of
    the total portfolio with the exception of U.S. treasury
    securities, commercial paper and money market funds, which are
    exempt from size limitation. The policy requires investments in
    securities that mature in three years or less, with the average
    maturity being no greater than one and a half years. These
    securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease
    in value if interest rates increase. A decrease of one percent
    in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease
    of approximately $4.8 million in our interest income for
    the fiscal year 2010.

At September 30, 2010, the fair value of our AAA/A- (or
    equivalent) rated municipal ARS was approximately
    $16.0 million. ARS are collateralized long-term debt
    instruments that provide liquidity through a Dutch auction
    process that resets the applicable interest rate at
    pre-determined intervals, typically every 7, 28 or 35 days.
    Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately
    $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS we held because
    sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these auctions failed to
    clear, higher interest rates for those securities went into
    effect. However, the funds associated with these failed auctions
    will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a
    successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the
    auction process, or the security matures. The underlying assets
    of the municipal ARS we hold, including the securities for which
    auctions have failed, are generally student loans which are
    guaranteed by the U.S. government. Based on our expected
    operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not
    believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal ARS
    will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our



liquidity needs. We have no intent to sell, won’t be
    required to sell, and believe we will hold these securities
    until recovery. We believe certain of these

available-for-sale

investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months
    and as a result, we have classified $19.0 million (par
    value) of securities as long-term as of September 30, 2010.

Foreign Currency Risk.

The majority of our
    sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a
    result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency
    transaction gains and losses to date. While we have conducted
    some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2010 and expect to continue to do so,
    we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or
    losses will be significant at our current level of operations.
    However, as we continue to expand our operations
    internationally, transaction gains or losses may become
    significant in the future. We have not engaged in foreign
    currency hedging to date. However, we may do so in the future.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of F5 Networks, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of F5 Networks, Inc. and its subsidiaries
    at September 30, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended September 30, 2010 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
    all material respects, the information set forth therein when
    read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of September 30, 2010, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

The
    Company

F5 Networks, Inc. (the “Company”) provides products
    and services to help companies manage their Internet Protocol
    (IP) traffic and file storage infrastructure efficiently and
    securely. The Company’s application delivery networking
    products improve the performance, availability and security of
    applications on Internet-based networks. Internet traffic
    between network-based applications and clients passes through
    these devices where the content is inspected to ensure that it
    is safe and modified as necessary to ensure that it is delivered
    securely and in a way that optimizes the performance of both the
    network and the applications. The Company’s storage
    virtualization products simplify and reduce the cost of managing
    files and file storage devices, and ensure fast, secure, easy
    access to files for users and applications. The Company also
    offers a broad range of services that include consulting,
    training, maintenance and other technical support services.

Accounting
    Principles

The Company’s consolidated financial statements and
    accompanying notes are prepared on the accrual basis of
    accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date
    of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are
    used in accounting for revenue recognition, reserves for
    doubtful accounts, product returns, obsolete and excess
    inventory, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and
    purchase price allocations. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
    original maturities of three months or less to be cash
    equivalents. The Company invests its cash and cash equivalents
    in deposits with four major financial institutions, which, at
    times, exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not
    experienced any losses on its cash and cash equivalents.

Investments

The Company classifies the majority of its investment securities
    as

available-for-sale.

Investment securities, consisting of corporate and municipal
    bonds and notes and United States government securities, are
    reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and
    losses included as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.
    Realized gains and losses and declines in value of securities
    judged to be other than temporary are included in other income
    (expense). The cost of investments for purposes of computing
    realized and unrealized gains and losses is based on the
    specific identification method. Investments in securities with
    maturities of less than one year or where management’s
    intent is to use the investments to fund current operations are
    classified as short-term investments. Investments with
    maturities of greater than one year, as well as certain auction
    rate securities (“ARS”) that the Company believes it
    will not be able to liquidate in the next twelve months, are
    classified as long-term investments.

The Company has ARS that are classified as

available-for-sale

securities and are reported as long-term. The Company has no
    intent to sell, won’t be required to sell, and believes it
    will hold these securities until recovery. The Company uses the
    income approach to estimate the fair value of ARS. The
    assumptions the Company used in preparing the discounted cash
    flow model include estimates for interest rates; estimates for
    discount rates using yields of comparable traded instruments
    adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors, amount of
    anticipated future cash flows and expected holding periods for
    the ARS.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company extends credit to customers and is therefore subject
    to credit risk. The Company performs initial and ongoing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and does
    not require collateral. An allowance for doubtful accounts is
    recorded to account for potential bad debts. Estimates are used
    in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based
    upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of
    remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In determining
    these percentages, the Company evaluates historical write-offs,
    and current trends in customer credit quality, as well as
    changes in credit policies. At September 30, 2010, Avnet
    Technology Solutions, Ingram Micro, Inc. and Tech Data accounted
    for 13.2%, 13.2% and 11.8% of the Company’s accounts
    receivable, respectively. At September 30, 2009, Avnet
    Technology Solutions and Ingram Micro, Inc. accounted for 11.6%
    and 10.7% of the Company’s accounts receivable,
    respectively.

The Company maintains its cash and investment balances with high
    credit quality financial institutions. Included within the
    Company’s investment portfolio are investments in ARS. The
    Company’s ARS investments are currently not liquid as a
    result of continued auction failures. If the issuers are not
    able to meet their payment obligations or if the Company sells
    its ARS investments before they recover, the Company may lose
    some or all of its principal invested or may be required to
    further reduce the carrying value.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

Short-term and long-term investments are recorded at fair value
    as the underlying securities are classified as

available-for-sale

with any unrealized gain or loss being recorded to other
    comprehensive income. The fair value for securities held is
    determined using quoted market prices, broker or dealer
    quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable
    levels of price transparency with the exception of ARS, which
    fair market value is estimated using a discounted cash flow
    model.

Inventories

The Company outsources the manufacturing of its pre-configured
    hardware platforms to contract manufacturers, who assemble each
    product to the Company’s specifications. As protection
    against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for
    its service teams, the Company also stocks limited supplies of
    certain key product components. The Company reduces inventory to
    net realizable value based on excess and obsolete inventories
    determined primarily by historical usage and forecasted demand.
    Inventories consist of hardware and related component parts and
    are recorded at the lower of cost or market (as determined by
    the

first-in,

first-out method).

Restricted
    Cash

For fiscal year 2009, restricted cash primarily represented
    escrow accounts established in connection with lease agreements
    for the Company’s corporate headquarters and, to a lesser
    extent, the Company’s international facilities. Under the
    terms of the lease for the Company’s corporate
    headquarters, the amount required to be held in escrow was
    reduced and eventually eliminated at various dates throughout
    the duration of the lease term. As of September 30, 2010,
    the Company was no longer subject to escrow requirements in
    connection with its corporate headquarters.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation of
    property and equipment are provided using the straight-line
    method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging
    from two to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized
    over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life
    of the improvements. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs
    is charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for major
    improvements are capitalized at cost. Gains or losses on the
    disposition of assets are reflected in the income statements at
    the time of disposal.

    2008, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated
    fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date.
    The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and
    between annual tests when impairment indicators are identified,
    and goodwill is written down when impaired. Goodwill was
    recorded in connection with the acquisition of Acopia Networks,
    Inc. in fiscal year 2007, Swan Labs, Inc. in fiscal year 2006,
    MagniFire Websystems, Inc. in fiscal year 2004 and uRoam, Inc.
    in fiscal year 2003.

The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test during
    the second fiscal quarter, or whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may
    not be recoverable. The first step of the test identifies
    whether potential impairment may have occurred, while the second
    step of the test measures the amount of the impairment, if any.
    Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill
    exceeds its fair value. For its annual goodwill impairment
    analysis, the Company operates under one reporting unit. The
    Company determined the fair value of its reporting unit based on
    the Company’s enterprise value. In March 2010, the Company
    completed its annual impairment test and concluded there was no
    impairment of goodwill. The Company also considered potential
    impairment indicators at September 30, 2010 and noted no
    indicators of impairment.

Other
    Assets

Other assets primarily consist of software development costs,
    acquired and developed technology and customer relationships.

Software development costs are charged to research and
    development expense in the period incurred until technological
    feasibility is established. Thereafter, until the product is
    released for sale, software development costs are capitalized
    and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable
    value of each product. Capitalized software development costs
    are amortized over the remaining estimated economic life of the
    product. The establishment of technological feasibility and the
    ongoing assessment of recoverability of costs require
    considerable judgment by the Company with respect to certain
    internal and external factors, including, but not limited to,
    anticipated future gross product revenues, estimated economic
    life and changes in hardware and software technology. The
    Company did not capitalize any software development costs in
    fiscal years 2010 and 2009. During fiscal year 2008, the Company
    capitalized $1.7 million of software development costs.
    Amortization expense related to capitalized software development
    was $421,000, $421,000, and $202,000 for fiscal years 2010,
    2009, and 2008, respectively and has been recorded as additional
    cost of product revenues.

Acquired and developed technology and customer relationship
    assets are recorded at cost and amortized over their estimated
    useful lives of five years. The estimated useful life of these
    assets is assessed and evaluated for reasonableness
    periodically. Acquired technology of $15.0 million in
    fiscal 2007 and $8.0 million in fiscal 2006 was recorded in
    connection with the acquisitions of Acopia and Swan Labs,
    respectively. Amortization expense related to acquired
    technology, which is charged to cost of product revenues,
    totaled $4.6 million, $5.3 million and
    $6.1 million during the fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Amortization expense of all other intangible assets, including
    customer relationships, patents and trademarks was approximately
    $1.0 million during each of the fiscal years 2010, 2009 and
    2008.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets
    whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
    When such events occur, management determines whether there has
    been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted net
    future cash flows to the related asset’s carrying value. If
    impairment exists, the asset is written down to its estimated
    fair value. No impairment of long-lived assets was noted as of
    and for the year ended September 30, 2010.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s products are integrated with software that is
    essential to the functionality of the equipment. Accordingly,
    the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the accounting
    guidance for software products.

The Company sells products through distributors, resellers, and
    directly to end users. The Company recognizes product revenue
    upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that
    collection is determined to be reasonably assured and no
    significant performance obligations remain. In certain regions
    where the Company does not have the ability to reasonably
    estimate returns, the Company defers revenue on sales to its
    distributors until they have received information from the
    channel partner indicating that the distributor has sold the
    product to its customer. Payment terms to domestic customers are
    generally net 30 days to net 45 days. Payment terms to
    international customers range from net 30 days to net
    120 days based on normal and customary trade practices in
    the individual markets. The Company offers extended payment
    terms to certain customers, in which case, revenue is recognized
    when payments are due.

Whenever product, training services and post-contract customer
    support (“PCS”) elements are sold together, a portion
    of the sales price is allocated to each element based on their
    respective fair values as determined when the individual
    elements are sold separately. Where fair value of certain
    elements is not available, the Company recognizes revenue on the
    “residual method” based on the fair value of
    undelivered elements. Revenues from the sale of product are
    recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is
    obligated to pay for the product. When rights of return are
    present and the Company cannot estimate returns, it recognizes
    revenue when such rights of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the service contract
    term. PCS includes a limited period of telephone support
    updates, repair or replacement of any failed product or
    component that fails during the term of the agreement, bug fixes
    and rights to upgrades, when and if available. Consulting
    services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates, plus

out-of-pocket

expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has
    been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training
    has been completed.

as amended, requires revenue earned on software arrangements
    involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element
    based on the relative fair values of those elements. The fair
    value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective
    evidence (“VSOE”). The Company establishes VSOE for
    its products, training services, PCS and consulting services
    based on the sales price charged for each element when sold
    separately. The sales price is discounted from the applicable
    list price based on various factors including the type of
    customer, volume of sales, geographic region and program level.
    The Company’s list prices are generally not fair value as
    discounts may be given based on the factors enumerated above.
    The Company believes that the fair value of its consulting
    services is represented by the billable consulting rate per
    hour, based on the rates they charge customers when they
    purchase standalone consulting services. The price of consulting
    services is not based on the type of customer, volume of sales,
    geographic region or program level.

The Company uses historical sales transactions to determine
    whether VSOE can be established for each of the elements. In
    most instances, VSOE of fair value is the sales price of actual
    standalone (unbundled) transactions within the past
    12 month period that are priced within a reasonable range,
    which the Company has determined to be plus or minus 15% of the
    median sales price of each respective price list.

VSOE of PCS is based on standalone sales since the Company does
    not provide stated renewal rates to its customers. In accordance
    with the Company’s PCS pricing practice (supported by
    standalone renewal sales), renewal contracts are priced as a
    percentage of the undiscounted product list price. The PCS
    renewal percentages may vary, depending on the type and length
    of PCS purchased. The Company offers standard and premium PCS,
    and the term generally ranges from one to three years. The
    Company employs a bell-shaped-curve approach in evaluating VSOE
    of fair value of PCS. Under this approach, the Company considers
    VSOE of the fair value of PCS to exist when a substantial
    majority of its standalone PCS sales fall within a narrow range
    of pricing.

The Company has established and regularly validates the VSOE of
    fair value for elements in its multiple element arrangements.
    The Company accounts for taxes collected from customers and
    remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded
    from revenues.

Shipping
    and Handling

Shipping and handling fees charged to the Company’s
    customers are recognized as product revenue in the period
    shipped and the related costs for providing these services are
    recorded as a cost of sale.

Guarantees
    and Product Warranties

In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its
    products, the Company indemnifies other parties, including
    customers, resellers, lessors, and parties to other transactions
    with the Company, with respect to



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

certain matters. The Company has agreed to hold the other party
    harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations
    or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or
    other claims made against certain parties. These agreements may
    limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made
    and the amount of the claim. The Company has entered into
    indemnification agreements with its officers and directors, and
    the Company’s bylaws contain similar indemnification
    obligations to the Company’s agents. It is not possible to
    determine the maximum potential amount under these
    indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior
    indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
    involved in each particular agreement.

The Company offers warranties of one year for hardware for those
    customers without service contracts, with the option of
    purchasing additional warranty coverage in yearly increments.
    The Company accrues for warranty costs as part of its cost of
    sales based on associated material product costs and technical
    support labor costs. Accrued warranty costs as of
    September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were not considered
    material.

Research
    and Development

Research and development expenses consist of salaries and
    related benefits of product development personnel, prototype
    materials and expenses related to the development of new and
    improved products, and an allocation of facilities and
    depreciation expense. Research and development expenses are
    reflected in the statements of income as incurred.

Advertising

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred
    $2.1 million, $1.3 million and $1.5 million in
    advertising costs during the fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for
    income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
    determined based upon differences between the financial
    statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using
    enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
    differences are expected to reverse. The realization of deferred
    tax assets is based on historical tax positions and estimates of
    future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded when it
    is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets
    will not be realized.

In fiscal year 2008, the Company began assessing whether tax
    benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return
    should be recorded in the financial statements. The Company may
    recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if
    it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, including
    resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based
    on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits to be
    recognized in the financial statements from such a position is
    measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater
    than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement. The new guidance also provides guidance on
    de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income
    taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased
    disclosures.

Foreign
    Currency

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign
    subsidiaries is the local currency in which the respective
    entity is located, with the exception of F5 Networks, Ltd., in
    the United Kingdom that uses the U.S. dollar as its
    functional currency. An entity’s functional currency is
    determined by the currency of the economic environment in which
    the majority of cash is generated and expended by the entity.
    The financial statements of all majority-owned subsidiaries and
    related entities, with a functional currency other than the
    U.S. dollar, have been translated into U.S. dollars.
    All assets and liabilities of the respective entities are

translated at year-end exchange rates and all revenues and
    expenses are translated at average rates during the respective
    period. Translation adjustments are reported as a separate
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
    shareholders’ equity.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of
    the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated
    in currencies other than the functional currency, including
    U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on those foreign currency
    transactions are included in determining net income or loss for
    the period of exchange. The net effect of foreign currency gains
    and losses was not significant during the fiscal years ended
    September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Segments

Management has determined that the Company was organized as, and
    operated in, one reportable operating segment for fiscal year
    2010 and prior years: the development, marketing and sale of
    application delivery networking products that optimize the
    security, performance and availability of network applications,
    servers and storage systems.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the
    straight-line attribution method for recognizing compensation
    expense. The Company recognized $70.8 million,
    $56.1 million and $60.6 million of stock-based
    compensation expense for the fiscal years ended
    September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of
    September 30, 2010, there was $98.4 million of total
    unrecognized stock-based compensation cost, the majority of
    which will be recognized over the next two years. Going forward,
    stock-based compensation expenses may increase as the Company
    issues additional equity-based awards to continue to attract and
    retain key employees.

The Company issues incentive awards to its employees through
    stock-based compensation consisting of restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”). On August 2, 2010, the Company awarded
    approximately 910,000 RSUs to employees and executive officers
    pursuant to the Company’s annual equity and retention
    awards programs. The value of RSUs is determined using the fair
    value method, which in this case, is based on the number of
    shares granted and the quoted price of the Company’s common
    stock on the date of grant. No stock options were granted in
    fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008. In determining the fair value
    of shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
    (“ESPP”), the Company uses the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model that employs the following key assumptions.

    Expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical
    volatility of the Company’s stock price commensurate with
    the expected life of the ESPP option. Expected term of the ESPP
    option is based on an offering period of six months. The
    assumptions above are based on management’s best estimates
    at that time, which impact the fair value of the ESPP option
    calculated under the Black-Scholes methodology and, ultimately,
    the expense that will be recognized over the life of the ESPP
    option.

The Company recognizes compensation expense for only the portion
    of restricted stock units that are expected to vest. Therefore,
    the Company applies estimated forfeiture rates that are derived
    from historical employee termination behavior. Based on
    historical differences with forfeitures of stock-based awards
    granted to the Company’s executive officers and Board of
    Directors versus grants awarded to all other employees, the
    Company has developed separate forfeiture expectations for these
    two groups. The estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to
    the Company’s executive officers and Board of Directors was
    approximately 3% and the estimated forfeiture rate for grants
    awarded to all other employees was approximately 10% in fiscal
    2010. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those
    estimated by management, additional adjustments to compensation
    expense may be required in future periods.

In August 2010, the Company granted 181,334 and 83,000 RSUs to
    certain current executive officers as part of the annual equity
    and retention awards programs, respectively. Fifty percent of
    the aggregate number of RSUs granted as part of the annual
    equity awards program vest in equal quarterly increments over
    three years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested on
    August 1, 2013.

One-sixth of the annual equity awards RSU grant, or a portion
    thereof, is subject to the Company achieving specified quarterly
    revenue and EBITDA goals during the period beginning in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 through the third quarter of
    fiscal year 2011. In each case, 50% of the quarterly performance
    stock grant is based on achieving at least 80% of the quarterly
    revenue goal and the other 50% is based on achieving at least
    80% of the quarterly EBITDA goal. The quarterly performance
    stock grant is paid linearly above 80% of the targeted goals. At
    least 100% of both goals must be attained in order for the
    quarterly performance stock grant to be awarded over 100%. Each
    goal is evaluated individually and subject to the 80%
    achievement threshold and 100% over-achievement threshold. The
    remaining 33.33% of this annual equity awards RSU grant shall be
    subject to performance based vesting for each of the four
    quarter periods beginning with the third quarters of fiscal
    years 2011 and 2012 (16.66% in each period). The Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors will set applicable
    performance targets and vesting formulas for each of these
    periods. All RSUs granted as part of the retention awards
    program fully vest on August 1, 2013.

In August 2009, the Company granted 420,000 RSUs to certain
    current executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate
    number of RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly
    increments over two years, until such portion of the grant is
    fully vested on August 1, 2011. Twenty-five percent of the
    RSU grant, or a portion thereof, was subject to the Company
    achieving specified quarterly revenue and EBITDA goals during
    the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009
    through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 and the remaining
    twenty-five percent is subject to the Company achieving
    specified quarterly revenue and EBITDA goals during the period
    beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 through the
    third quarter of fiscal year 2011. In each case, 50% of the
    quarterly performance stock grant is based on achieving at least
    80% of the quarterly revenue goal and the other 50% is based on
    achieving at least 80% of the quarterly EBITDA goal. The
    quarterly performance stock grant is paid linearly above 80% of
    the targeted goals. At least 100% of both goals must be attained
    in order for the quarterly performance stock grant to be awarded
    over 100%. Each goal is evaluated individually and subject to
    the 80% achievement threshold and 100% over-achievement
    threshold.

In August 2008, the Company granted 383,400 RSUs to certain
    current executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate
    number of RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly
    increments over two years, until such portion of the grant was
    fully vested on August 1, 2010. Twenty-five percent of the
    RSU grant, or a portion thereof, was subject to the Company
    achieving specified percentage increases in total revenue during

through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, as set by the
    Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
    This twenty-five percent was fully earned in fiscal year 2010.

The Company recognizes compensation costs for awards with
    performance conditions when it concludes it is probable that the
    performance condition will be achieved. The Company reassesses
    the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and
    adjusts compensation costs based on the probability assessment.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
    the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing
    net income by the weighted average number of common and dilutive
    common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
    diluted net income per share (in thousands, except per share
    data):

Fair
    Value Measurements

In accordance with the authoritative guidance on fair value
    measurements and disclosure under GAAP, the Company determines
    fair value using a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes
    between market participant assumptions developed based on market
    data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity,
    and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market
    participant assumptions developed based on the best information
    available in the circumstances and expands disclosure about fair
    value measurements.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most
    advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date,
    essentially the exit price.

The levels of fair value hierarchy are:

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets and liabilities at the measurement date.

Level 2:

Observable inputs other than
    quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices
    for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted
    prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in
    markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable
    or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs for which
    there is little or no market data available. These inputs
    reflect management’s assumptions of what market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Level 1 investments are valued based on quoted market
    prices in active markets and include the Company’s cash
    equivalent investments. Level 2 investments, which include
    investments that are valued based on quoted prices in markets
    that are not active, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative
    pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency,
    include the Company’s certificates of deposit, corporate
    bonds and notes, municipal bonds and notes and
    U.S. government securities. Fair values for the
    Company’s level 2 investments are based on similar
    assets without applying significant judgments. In addition, all
    of the Company’s level 2 investments have a sufficient
    level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used
    are appropriate for these investments.

A financial instrument’s level within the fair value
    hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of any input that is
    significant to the fair value measurement. However, the
    determination of what constitutes “observable”
    requires significant judgment by the Company. The Company
    considers observable data to be market data which is readily
    available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and
    verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources
    that are actively involved in the relevant market.

Due to the auction failures of the Company’s auction rate
    securities (“ARS”) that began in the second quarter of
    fiscal year 2008, there are still no quoted prices in active
    markets for similar assets as of September 30, 2010.
    Therefore, the Company has classified its ARS as level 3
    financial assets. The following table provides a reconciliation
    between the beginning and ending balances of items measured at
    fair value on a recurring basis in the tables above that used
    significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands):

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair
    values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow
    methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant
    model assumption or input is unobservable or there is limited
    market activity such that the determination of fair value
    requires significant judgment or estimation. Level 3
    investment securities primarily include certain ARS for which
    there was a decrease in the observation of market pricing. At
    September 30, 2010, the values of these securities were
    estimated primarily using discounted cash flow analysis that
    incorporated transaction details such as contractual terms,
    maturity, timing and amount of future cash flows, as well as
    assumptions about liquidity and credit valuation adjustments of
    marketplace participants at September 30, 2010.

The Company adopted the fair value hierarchy for financial
    assets and liabilities on October 1, 2008, the first day of
    fiscal year 2009. On October 1, 2009, the first day of
    fiscal year 2010, the Company applied the fair value hierarchy
    to all non-financial assets and liabilities. The adoption did
    not have a material effect on the consolidated financial
    statements. The Company’s non-financial assets and
    liabilities, which include goodwill, intangible assets, and
    long-lived assets, are not required to be carried at fair value
    on a recurring basis. These non-financial assets and liabilities
    are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when there
    is an indicator of impairment, and they are recorded at fair
    value only when impairment is recognized. The Company reviews
    goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually, during
    the second quarter of each fiscal year, or as circumstances
    indicate the possibility of impairment. The Company monitors the
    carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying amount
    may not be recoverable. During the year ended September 30,
    2010, the Company did not recognize any impairment charges
    related to goodwill, intangible assets, or long-lived assets.

The Company invests in securities that are rated investment
    grade or better. The unrealized losses on investments for fiscal
    year 2010 were primarily caused by reductions in the values of
    the ARS due to the illiquid markets and were partially offset by
    unrealized gains related to interest rate decreases.

ARS are variable-rate debt securities. The Company limits its
    investments in ARS to securities that carry an AAA/A- (or
    equivalent) rating from recognized rating agencies and limits
    the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. At the time of
    the Company’s initial investment and at the date of this
    report, all ARS were in compliance with the Company’s
    investment policy. In the past, the auction process allowed
    investors to obtain immediate liquidity if so desired by selling
    the securities at their face amounts. Liquidity for these
    securities has historically been provided by an auction process
    that resets interest rates on these investments on average every
    7-35 days. However, as has been reported in the financial
    press, the disruptions in the credit markets adversely affected
    the auction market for these types of securities.

Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately
    $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS the Company
    held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. The funds
    associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until the
    issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer
    is found outside the auction process or the security otherwise
    matures.

In October 2008, the Company entered into an agreement
    (“the Agreement”) with UBS whereby UBS would purchase
    eligible ARS it sold to the Company prior to February 13,
    2008. Under the terms of the Agreement, and at the
    Company’s discretion, UBS will purchase eligible ARS from
    the Company at par value (“put option”) during the
    period of June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. As of
    September 30, 2010, UBS has purchased all of the eligible
    ARS the Company held for par value of $34.4 million.

4.

Business
    Combinations

The Company’s previous acquisitions were accounted for
    under the purchase method of accounting. The total purchase
    price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets
    acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated
    fair values. The excess of the purchase price over those fair
    values was recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to the
    tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    was based on estimates and assumptions provided by management,
    and other information compiled by management, including
    independent valuations, prepared by valuation specialists that
    utilized established valuation techniques appropriate for the
    technology industry. Goodwill was not amortized but instead is
    tested for impairment at least annually.

At September 30, 2010, the Company had U.S. net
    operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
    $16.1 million. All U.S. net operating loss
    carry-forwards relate to entities acquired by the Company and
    are limited in use by I.R.C. Sec. 382. At September 30,
    2010, the Company had federal research and development credit
    carry-forwards of approximately $2.4 million which, if not
    utilized, will begin to expire in 2022. The aforementioned
    credit carry-forwards relate to entities acquired by the Company
    and are limited in use under I.R.C. Sec. 383. The Company also
    had state research and development and investment credit
    carry-forwards of approximately $2.9 million, some of which
    if not utilized, may begin to expire in fiscal year 2024. The
    deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carry-forwards
    at September 30, 2010 decreased significantly compared to
    September 30, 2009 as a result of the Company’s
    increased utilization of federal net operating losses for fiscal
    year 2010 and prior years.

United States income and foreign withholding taxes have not been
    provided on approximately $13.4 million of undistributed
    earnings from the Company’s international subsidiaries. The
    Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability for the
    undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because the
    Company currently does not expect to remit those earnings in the
    foreseeable future. Determination of the amount of unrecognized
    deferred tax liability related to undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries is not practicable because such liability,
    if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when
    remittance occurs.

The increase in effective tax rate in fiscal year 2010 over
    fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to the expiration of the
    federal research and development credit at December 31,
    2009 and a favorable adjustment related to equity awards in a
    major foreign tax jurisdiction which was reflected in the
    effective tax rate for fiscal year 2009.

The Company recognizes the financial statement impact of a tax
    position only after determining that the relevant tax authority
    would more likely than not sustain the position following an
    audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not
    threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is
    the largest impact that has a greater than fifty percent
    likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the
    relevant tax authority.

The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties
    (not included in the “unrecognized tax benefits” table
    above) for any uncertain tax positions. This interest and
    penalty expense will be a component of income tax expense. In
    the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 the
    Company accrued approximately $390,000, $193,000 and $146,000,
    respectively, of interest expense related to its liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits. No penalties were recognized in
    fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 or accrued for at
    September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

All unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the
    effective tax rate. The Company does not anticipate that total
    unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the
    next twelve months.

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to
    U.S. federal income tax as well as the income tax of
    multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has
    concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters for fiscal
    years through September 30, 2006. Major jurisdictions where
    there are wholly owned subsidiaries of F5 Networks, Inc. which
    require income tax filings include the United Kingdom, Japan,
    Australia and Germany. Periods open for review by local taxing
    authorities are fiscal years 2008, 2009, 2006 and 2005 for the
    United Kingdom, Japan, Australia and Germany, respectively.
    Within the next four fiscal quarters, the statute of limitations
    will begin to close on the fiscal years ended 2006 and 2007 tax
    returns filed in various states and the fiscal year ended 2007
    federal income tax return.

Shareholders’

Equity
    Incentive Plans

The majority of awards consist of restricted stock units and to
    a lesser degree, stock options. Employees vest in restricted
    stock units and stock options ratably over the corresponding
    service term, generally one to four years. The Company’s
    stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant.
    Restricted stock units are payable in shares of the
    Company’s common stock as the periodic vesting requirements
    are satisfied. The value of a restricted stock unit is based
    upon the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on
    the date of grant. The value of restricted stock units is
    determined using the intrinsic value method and is based on the
    number of shares granted and the quoted price of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Alternatively,
    the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to
    determine the fair value of its stock options. Compensation
    expense related to restricted stock units and stock options is
    recognized over the vesting period. The Company has adopted a
    number of stock-based compensation plans as discussed below.

1998 Equity Incentive Plan.

In November 1998,
    the Company adopted the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 1998
    Plan, which provided for discretionary grants of non-qualified
    and incentive stock options, stock purchase awards and stock
    bonuses for employees and other service providers. The 1998 Plan
    expired on November 11, 2008 and no shares remain available
    for awards under the 1998 Plan. Upon certain changes in control
    of the Company, all outstanding and unvested options or stock
    awards under the 1998 Plan will vest at the rate of 50%, unless
    assumed or substituted by the acquiring entity. During the
    fiscal years 2010 and 2009,



F5
    NETWORKS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Company issued no stock options, stock purchase awards or
    stock bonuses under this plan. As of September 30, 2010,
    there were options to purchase 182,065 shares outstanding
    under the 1998 Plan.

1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

In May
    1999, the board of directors approved the adoption of the 1999
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan. A total of 6,000,000 shares of common stock have been
    reserved for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
    The Employee Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to
    acquire shares of the Company’s common stock through
    periodic payroll deductions of up to 15% of base compensation.
    No employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock,
    determined at the fair market value of the shares at the time
    such option is granted, in one calendar year. The Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan has been implemented in a series of offering
    periods, each 6 months in duration. The price at which the
    common stock may be purchased is 85% of the lesser of the fair
    market value of the Company’s common stock on the first day
    of the applicable offering period or on the last day of the
    respective purchase period. As of September 30, 2010 there
    were 1,974,462 shares available for awards under the
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

2000 Equity Incentive Plan.

In July 2000, the
    Company adopted the 2000 Employee Equity Incentive Plan, or the
    2000 Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of
    non-qualified stock options, stock purchase awards and stock
    bonuses for non-executive employees and other service providers.
    A total of 7,000,000 shares of common stock were reserved
    for issuance under the 2000 Plan. Upon certain changes in
    control of the Company, all outstanding and unvested options or
    stock awards under the 2000 Plan will vest at the rate of 50%,
    unless assumed or substituted by the acquiring entity. As of
    September 30, 2010, there were options to purchase
    214,442 shares outstanding and no shares available for
    awards under the 2000 Plan. The Company terminated the 2000 Plan
    effective November 1, 2008 and no additional shares may be
    issued from the 2000 Plan.

Acquisition Incentive Plans.

In connection
    with the Company’s acquisition of Acopia, the Company
    assumed the Acopia 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, or the Acopia
    Plan. Unvested options to acquire Acopia’s common stock
    were converted into options to acquire the Company’s common
    stock in connection with the acquisition. A total of
    2,230,703 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance
    under the Acopia Plan. The plan provides for discretionary
    grants of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted
    stock awards and other stock-based awards to persons who were
    employees, officers, directors, consultants or advisors to
    Acopia on or prior to September 12, 2007. During the fiscal
    year 2010, the Company issued no stock options or restricted
    stock units under the Acopia Plan. As of September 30,
    2010, there were options to purchase 46,829 shares
    outstanding and no shares available for awards under the Acopia
    Plan. The Company terminated the Acopia Plan effective
    November 1, 2008 and no additional shares may be issued
    from the Acopia Plan.

2005 Equity Incentive Plan.

In December 2004,
    the Company adopted the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2005
    Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of non-statutory
    stock options and stock units for employees, including officers,
    and other service providers. A total of 12,400,000 shares
    of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2005
    Plan. Upon certain changes in control of the Company, all
    outstanding and unvested options or stock awards under the 2005
    Plan will vest at the rate of 50%, unless assumed or substituted
    by the acquiring entity. During the fiscal year 2010, the
    Company issued no stock options and 994,439 restricted stock
    units under the 2005 Plan. As of September 30, 2010, there
    were options to purchase 30,000 shares outstanding and
    4,289,200 shares available for new awards under the 2005
    Plan.

A majority of the restricted stock units granted in fiscal years
    2010, 2009 and 2008 vest quarterly over a two-year period. The
    restricted stock units were granted during fiscal years 2010,
    2009 and 2008 with a per-share weighted average fair value of
    $86.32, $36.31 and $30.47, respectively. The fair value of
    restricted stock vested during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008
    was $116.4 million, $41.0 million and
    $36.5 million, respectively.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Operating
    Leases

The majority of the Company’s operating lease payments
    relate to the Company’s three building corporate
    headquarters in Seattle, Washington. The lease for all three
    buildings was amended and restated in April of 2010. This lease
    will now expire in 2022 with an option for renewal. One of the
    buildings has been partially subleased through 2012. The Company
    also leases additional office space for product development and
    sales and support personnel in the United States and
    internationally.

In October 2006, the Company entered into an agreement to lease
    a total of approximately 137,000 square feet of office
    space in a building known as 333 Elliott West, which is adjacent
    to the three buildings that serve as the Company’s
    corporate headquarters. The lease expires in 2018. During 2008,
    the Company entered into two separate sublease agreements to
    sublease approximately 112,500 square feet of building 333
    Elliott West. One sublease will expire in 2013. In March 2010,
    the Company amended the second sublease, which expanded the
    subleased space by approximately 11,700 square feet and
    extended the term of the sublease to 2018.

Purchase
    Obligations

Purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with
    the Company’s contract manufacturers. The agreement with
    the Company’s primary contract manufacturer allows them to
    procure component inventory on the Company’s behalf based
    on the Company’s production forecast. The Company is
    obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract
    manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast, unless

    were $14.3 million.

Litigation

Derivative Suits.

Beginning on or about
    May 24, 2006, several derivative actions were filed against
    certain of the Company’s current and former directors and
    officers. These derivative lawsuits were filed in: (1) the
    Superior Court of King County, Washington, as In re F5 Networks,
    Inc. State Court Derivative Litigation (Case

No. 06-2-17195-1

SEA), which consolidates Adams v. Amdahl, et al. (Case

No. 06-2-26248-4

SEA) (the “State Court Derivative Litigation”); and
    (2) in the U.S. District Court for the Western
    District of Washington, as In re F5 Networks, Inc. Derivative
    Litigation, Master File

No. C06-0794RSL,

which consolidates Hutton v. McAdam, et al. (Case

No. 06-794RSL),

Locals 302 and 612 of the International Union of Operating
    Engineers-Employers Construction Industry Retirement
    Trust v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1057RSL),

and Easton v. McAdam et al. (Case

No. C06-1145RSL)

(the “Federal Court Derivative Litigation”). On
    August 2, 2007, another derivative lawsuit, Barone v.
    McAdam et al. (Case

No. C07-1200P)

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
    District of Washington. The Barone lawsuit was designated a
    related case to the Federal Court Derivative Litigation on
    September 4, 2007. The complaints generally allege that
    certain of the Company’s current and former directors and
    officers, including, in general, each of the Company’s
    current outside directors (other than Deborah L. Bevier, Scott
    Thompson, and John Chapple who joined the Board of Directors in
    July 2006, January 2008, and September 2010, respectively)
    breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by engaging in
    alleged wrongful conduct concerning the manipulation of certain
    stock option grant dates.

On September 24, 2010, the Company entered into a
    Stipulation of Settlement (the “Stipulation”) in
    connection with the Federal Court Derivative Litigation. On
    October 21, 2010, the United States District Court for the
    Western District of Washington issued an order granting
    preliminary approval of the settlement resolving the claims
    asserted by the plaintiffs against the individual defendants. A
    hearing to determine whether the Court should issue an order
    finally approving the proposed settlement has been scheduled for
    January 6, 2011. Effectiveness of the settlement of the
    Federal Court Derivative Litigation is conditioned on dismissal
    of the State Court Derivative Litigation. A copy of the
    Stipulation may be found under the “About F5-Investor
    Relations-Corporate Governance” section of the
    Company’s website, www.f5.com.

SEC and Department of Justice Inquiries.

The
    Company previously received notice from both the SEC and the
    Department of Justice that they were conducting informal
    inquiries into the Company’s historical stock option
    practices, and has fully cooperated with both agencies. In
    January 2010, the Company received notice from the SEC that the
    investigation concerning the Company’s historical stock
    option practices has been completed and that no enforcement
    action has been recommended. The Company currently believes that
    the Department of Justice will take no further action in
    connection with its inquiry into the Company’s historical
    stock option practices.

The Company is not aware of any additional pending legal
    proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
    operating results, or financial condition. The Company may in
    the future be party to litigation arising in the ordinary course
    of business, including claims that we allegedly infringe upon
    third-party intellectual property rights. Such claims, even if
    not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant
    financial and managerial resources.

Restructuring
    Charges

In January 2009, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to
    reduce its operating expenses which included the consolidation
    of facilities, accelerated depreciation on tenant improvements
    and a reduction in workforce. These initiatives are intended to
    conserve or generate cash in response to the uncertainties



F5

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

associated with the recent deterioration in the global economy.
    As a result of these initiatives, the Company recorded a
    restructuring charge of $4.3 million in the second quarter
    of fiscal 2009. All accrued restructuring costs had been
    incurred as of September 30, 2010.

Facility
    Exit and Sublease Agreements

During fiscal year 2008, the Company exited a research and
    development facility in Bellevue, Washington for which it has
    remaining operating lease obligations through 2014. In addition,
    the Company consolidated its corporate headquarters, partially
    subleasing the building located at 333 Elliott Avenue West in
    Seattle, Washington for which it has remaining operating lease
    obligations through 2018. As a result of the expected loss on
    the facility exit and sublease agreements, the Company recorded
    a charge of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2008.

Geographic
    Sales and Significant Customers

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
    for which separate financial information is available and
    evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or
    decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and
    in assessing performance. The Company does business in four main
    geographic regions: the Americas (primarily the United States);
    Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia
    Pacific region (APAC). The Company’s chief operating
    decision-making group reviews financial information presented on
    a consolidated basis accompanied by information about revenues
    by geographic region. The Company’s foreign offices conduct
    sales, marketing and support activities. Revenues are attributed
    by geographic location based on the location of the customer.
    The Company’s assets are primarily located in the United
    States and not allocated to any specific region. Therefore,
    geographic information is presented only for net revenue.

The following presents revenues by geographic region (in
    thousands):

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that
    required information is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the required timeframe, as specified in the
    rules set forth by the Securities Exchange Commission. Our
    disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
    that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and
    communicated to management, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosures.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, evaluated the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
    September 30, 2010 and, based on this evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer have concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
    September 30, 2010.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
    absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
    because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over
    financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence
    and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and
    breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over
    financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or
    improper management override. Because of such limitations, there
    is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or
    detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
    reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known
    features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is
    possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
    not eliminate, this risk.

Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    September 30, 2010. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control
    — Integrated Framework

. Based on the results of
    this assessment and on those criteria, management concluded that
    our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
    of September 30, 2010.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial
    Statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and, as part of their audit, has issued its attestation report,
    included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control
    over financial reporting.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During the fourth fiscal quarter, there were no changes to our
    internal control over financial reporting that materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal controls over financial reporting.
