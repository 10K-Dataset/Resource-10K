REPORT ON FORM 10-K


Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such
statements include, without limitation, our expectations regarding sales,
earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, product
introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information systems
initiatives, new methods of sale and future operations or operating
results.  Although we believe that our
expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our
knowledge of our business and operations, we cannot assure that actual results
will not differ materially from our expectations.  Factors that could cause actual results to
differ from expectations are described herein; in particular, see “Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward-Looking Information.”  In addition, there is a discussion of risks
associated with an investment in our securities.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

PART I

Item 1.

Business.

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., founded in 1946 by Estée and Joseph
Lauder, is one of the world’s leading manufacturers and marketers of quality
skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.  Our products are sold in over 140 countries
and territories under the following brand names: Estée Lauder, Aramis,
Clinique, Prescriptives, Lab Series, Origins, M

ž

A

ž

C,
Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone, Bumble and bumble, Darphin, American
Beauty, Flirt!, Good Skin™, Grassroots, Ojon and Eyes by Design.  We are also the global licensee for
fragrances and/or cosmetics sold under the Tommy Hilfiger, Kiton, Donna Karan,
Michael Kors, Sean John, Missoni, Daisy Fuentes, Tom Ford and Mustang brand
names.  Each brand is distinctly
positioned within the market for beauty products.

We are a pioneer in the cosmetics industry and believe we are a leader
in the industry due to the global recognition of our brand names, our
leadership in product innovation, our strong market position in key geographic
markets and the consistently high quality of our products.  We sell our prestige products principally
through limited distribution channels to complement the images associated with
our brands.  These channels, encompassing
over 25,000 points of sale, consist primarily of upscale department stores,
specialty retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and
spas.  In addition, our products are sold
in freestanding company-owned stores and spas, our own and authorized retailer
websites, stores on cruise ships, direct response television (“DRTV”),
in-flight and duty-free shops and certain fragrances are sold in self-select
outlets.  We believe that our strategy of
pursuing limited distribution strengthens our relationships with retailers,
enables our brands to be among the best selling product lines at the stores and
heightens the aspirational quality of our brands.

For a discussion of recent developments, see “

Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

– Results of Operations – Overview.”

We have been controlled by the Lauder family since the founding of our
company.  Members of the Lauder family,
some of whom are directors, executive officers and/or employees, beneficially
own, directly or indirectly, as of August 15, 2008, shares of Class A
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock having approximately 87.8% of the
outstanding voting power of the Common Stock.

Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our”
and the “Company” refer to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its
subsidiaries.

and men.  These products include

care products accounted for approximately 6% of our net sales.

Given the personal nature of our products and the wide array of
consumer preferences and tastes, as well as competition for the attention of
consumers, our strategy has been to market and promote our products through
distinctive brands seeking to address broad preferences and tastes.  Each brand has a single global image that is
promoted with consistent logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance
its image and differentiate it from other brands.

packaging.

Michael Kors boutiques and over the Internet.

played an active role in creating the signature scent, “Unforgivable.”  The Unforgivable fragrance and ancillary
products are primarily available at select department and specialty stores as
well as travel retail outlets around the world.

Missoni

- In 2006, we launched fragrance and ancillary

fashion house, Missoni.  Missoni products
are sold in select distribution channels worldwide.

In addition to the foregoing brands, we market and sell Mustang and
Kiton products as a licensee.

introduced in 1968, Clinique skin care and makeup products are all allergy
tested and 100% fragrance free and have been designed to address individual
skin types and needs.  The products are

marketed as part of the 3-Step System: Cleanse, Exfoliate, Moisturize.  Clinique also offers fragrances and a line of
hair care products.

-
Introduced in 1979 and sold in five countries, Prescriptives focuses on
delivering flawless-looking skin—for all skins, from lightest to darkest.  Signature services include the
ultra-personalized artistry of Custom Blend Makeup and complimentary
Colorprinting, which leads the customer to her exact match foundation and
customizable color cosmetics. 
Prescriptives also features a personalized skin care regime for all
skins.  The products are visually
compelling and of minimalist design with a modern, innovative image.

Origins

- Origins
was introduced in 1990.  It is positioned
as a plant-based line of skin care, makeup and aromatherapy products that
combine time-tested botanical ingredients with modern science to promote total
well-being.  Origins sells its products

designed to replicate the Origins store environment within a department store),
at traditional retail counters, in perfumeries and directly to consumers over
the Internet.  Origins Organics™ is the
first full line of prestige skin, body and hair care products to be certified

stores and directly to consumers over the Internet.  We acquired the companies behind M

ž

A

ž

C
in three stages: in December 1994, March 1997 and February 1998.

Bobbi Brown

- In October 1995,
we acquired the Bobbi Brown line of color cosmetics, professional makeup
brushes and skin care products.  Bobbi
Brown products are manufactured to our specifications, primarily by third
parties, and sold through a limited number of department and specialty stores
and directly to consumers over the Internet.

La Mer

- La Mer
products primarily consist of moisturizing creams, lotions, cleansers, toners
and other skin care products.  The line,
which is available in very limited distribution in the United States and
certain other countries, is an extension of the initial Crème de la Mer product
that we acquired in 1995.

Aveda

- We acquired
the Aveda business in December 1997 and have since acquired selected Aveda
distributors and retail stores.  Aveda, a
prestige hair care leader, is a manufacturer and marketer of plant-based hair
care, skin care, makeup and fragrance products. 
We sell Aveda products to third-party distributors and prestige salons
and spas, cosmetology schools, certain non-U.S. department stores and specialty
retailers and directly to consumers at our own freestanding Aveda Experience
Centers and certain Aveda Institutes.

Jo Malone

acquired London-based Jo Malone Limited in October 1999.  Jo Malone is known for its prestige skin

London.  Products are also available
through a company catalogue, at freestanding stores and at a very limited group
of specialty stores, primarily in the United States, Canada and the United
Kingdom.

Bumble and bumble

-
In September 2006, we acquired the remaining minority equity interest in
Bumble and bumble.  We acquired a
controlling majority equity interest in June 2000.  Bumble and bumble is a New York-based hair
care and education company with two salons that creates high-quality hair care
and styling products distributed through other top-tier salons and select
prestige retailers.  We also provide
business and design education to the Bumble and bumble network of independent
salons.

development, manufacture and marketing of prestige skin care and makeup
products which are distributed primarily through high-end independent
pharmacies and specialty stores.

BeautyBank is our entrepreneurial think tank division whose mission is to
develop brands and products for consumers shopping outside of the traditional
department store channel on a worldwide basis. 
Brands developed under the BeautyBank umbrella include:

·

makeup and advanced skin care line celebrates the beauty of American

Distribution

We sell our products principally through limited distribution channels
to complement the images associated with our brands.  These channels include more than 25,000
points of sale in over 140 countries and territories and consist primarily of
upscale department stores, specialty retailers, upscale perfumeries and
pharmacies and prestige salons and spas. 
In addition, our products are sold in freestanding company-owned stores
and spas, our own and authorized retailer websites, stores on cruise ships,
DRTV, in-flight and duty-free shops and certain fragrances are sold in
self-select outlets.

We maintain a dedicated sales force which sells to our retail accounts
in North America and in the major overseas markets, such as Western Europe and
Japan.  We have wholly-owned operations
in over 40 countries, and controlling interests in joint ventures that operate
in four other countries, through which we market, sell and distribute our
products.  In certain countries, we sell
our products through selected local distributors under contractual arrangements
designed to protect the image and position of the brands.  In addition, we sell certain products in
select domestic and international military locations.  For
information regarding our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region,
see Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

We sell Aveda products principally to independent salons and spas,
cosmetology schools, third-party distributors and specialty retailers and
directly to consumers at our own freestanding Aveda Experience Centers and
certain Aveda Institutes.  There are
currently about 7,200 points of sale, primarily in the United States, that sell
Aveda products.  Bumble and bumble
products are principally sold to about 2,500 independent salons, primarily in
the United States.  Darphin products are
principally sold through high-end independent pharmacies, principally in
Europe, representing approximately 3,700 points of sale.

As part of our strategy to diversify our distribution, we have been
selectively expanding the number of single-brand, freestanding stores that we
operate.  The Origins, Aveda and M

ž

A

ž

C
brands are the primary focus for this method of distribution.  At this time, we operate 577 single-brand,
freestanding stores worldwide, the majority of which are in the United States,
and expect that number to increase moderately over the next several years.  We also operate 90 multi-brand stores.

We sell American Beauty, Flirt!, Good Skin™, Grassroots and Dianoche, by
Daisy Fuentes in approximately 1,000 Kohl’s Department Stores in the United
States.

We currently sell products from 16 of our brands directly to consumers
over the Internet through our own e-commerce sites.  Some or all of these brands are sold in the following
countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Korea and
Canada.

As is customary in the cosmetics industry, our practice is to accept
returns of our products from retailers if properly requested, authorized and
approved.  In accepting returns, we
typically provide a credit to the retailer against sales and accounts
receivable from that retailer on a dollar-for-dollar basis.  In recognition of this practice, and in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we report
revenues on a net sales basis, which reflects the amount of actual returns
received and an amount established for anticipated returns.  As a percentage of gross sales, returns were
4.4%, 4.2% and 5.0% in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Customers

Our strategy is to build strong strategic relationships with selected
retailers globally.  Senior management
works with executives of our major retail accounts on a regular basis and we
believe we are viewed as an important supplier to these customers.  During fiscal 2006, Federated Department
Stores, Inc. acquired The May Department Stores Company, resulting in
the merger of our previous two largest customers (collectively “Macy’s, Inc.”).  As of and for the fiscal years ended June 30,
2008, 2007 and 2006, Macy’s, Inc. accounted for 11%, 12% and 14%,
respectively, of our accounts receivable and 12%, 14% and 16%, respectively, of
our consolidated net sales.

Marketing

Our marketing strategy is built around our vision statement: “Bringing
the Best to Everyone We Touch.”  Mrs. Estée
Lauder formulated this marketing philosophy to provide high-quality service and
products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base.

- 5 -


Our marketing efforts focus principally on promoting the quality and
benefits of our products.  Each of our
brands is distinctively positioned, has a single global image, and is promoted
with consistent logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image
and differentiate it from other brands. 
We regularly advertise our products on television and radio, in upscale
magazines and newspapers and through direct mail and photo displays at
international airports.  In addition, our
products receive extensive editorial coverage in prestige publications and
other media worldwide.  Promotional
activities and in-store displays are designed to introduce existing consumers
to different products in the line and to attract new consumers.  Our marketing efforts also benefit from
cooperative advertising programs with retailers, some of which are supported by
coordinated promotions, such as purchase with purchase and gift with
purchase.  Our marketing and sales
executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers and key
retailers and consulting with sales representatives at the points of sale.  These include Estée Lauder Beauty Advisors,
Clinique Consultants, Aramis Selling Specialists, Prescriptives Analysts,
Origins Guides and M

ž

A

ž

C
Makeup Artists.  At in-store counters,
sales representatives offer personal demonstrations to market individual
products as well as to provide education on basic skin care and makeup
application.  We conduct extensive
sampling programs and we pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling
program.  We believe that the quality and
perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to
purchases by new and existing consumers.

Starting with the launch of the Clinique website in 1996, we have used
the Internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands.  Currently, 19 of our brands have marketing
sites, 16 of which have e-commerce capabilities.

Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house creative
teams.  The creative staff designs and
produces the sales materials, advertisements and packaging for all products in
each brand.

Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling and
promotion were $2,034.6 million, $1,841.9 million and $1,721.1 million in
fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
These amounts include activities relating to purchase with purchase and
gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of
sales.

Information Systems

Information systems support business processes including product
development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution and
finance.  Of the many systems currently
being utilized, the most significant to our business needs are: (i) a
centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we
offer, or plan to offer, which enables us to globally manufacture and market
products of consistent quality; (ii) a sales analysis system to track
weekly sales at the stock keeping unit (SKU) level at most significant retail
sales locations (i.e., sell-through data), increasing our understanding of
consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product
development, manufacturing and marketing strategies; (iii) an automated
replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers, allowing us to
replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically, with minimal
paperwork; and (iv) an inventory management system to provide us with a
global view of finished goods availability relative to actual requirements.

We expect that these systems will continue to provide pertinent
inventory and sales data in the short term. 
However, as part of our long-term effort to enhance these systems and
increase productivity, we are implementing our Strategic Modernization
Initiative (“SMI”), which includes an enterprise-wide global program that we
expect will deliver a single set of integrated data, processes and
technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize business
processes across brands, operating units and sales affiliates.  The initial implementation of SMI at our
Aveda operating unit occurred in May 2007 and we believe it is operating
effectively.  We anticipate SMI implementation
will continue at additional primary locations in fiscal 2009, with the majority
of our business to be implemented through fiscal 2012.

Research and Development

We believe that we are an industry leader in
the development of new products.  Marketing, product development and
packaging groups work with our research and development group to identify
shifts in consumer preferences, develop new products and improve, redesign or
reformulate existing products.  In addition, research and development personnel
work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide
basis to provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how, to ensure
consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products with
attributes that fulfill consumer expectations. 
The research and development group has long-standing working
relationships with several U.S. and international medical and educational
facilities, which supplement internal capabilities.  Members of the group
are also responsible for regulatory compliance matters.

We do not conduct animal testing on our
products or ingredients, nor ask others to test on our behalf, except when
required by law.  We evaluate our
finished products in clinical tests on volunteer panels.

We maintain ongoing research and development
programs at our facilities in Melville, New York; Oevel, Belgium; Petersfield,
U.K.; Tokyo, Japan; Markham, Ontario; Blaine, Minnesota; Shanghai, China; and
Colombes, France.  As of June 30, 2008, we had approximately 450
employees engaged in research and development.  Research and development
expenditures totaled $80.9 million, $74.4 million and $72.0 million in
fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Manufacturing, Warehousing and Raw Materials

We manufacture skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products
primarily in the United States, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Canada
and France.  We continue to streamline
our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve
innovation, increase efficiencies and reduce costs.  Our major manufacturing facilities operate as
“focus” plants that primarily manufacture one type of product (e.g., lipsticks)
for all of the principal brands.  Our
plants are modern and our manufacturing processes are substantially
automated.  While we believe that our
manufacturing facilities are sufficient to meet current and reasonably
anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to identify opportunities
to make significant improvements in capacity and productivity.  To capitalize on innovation and other supply
benefits, we continue to utilize third parties on a global basis for finished
goods production, including an increased volume in Asia/Pacific to support our
international growth.

We have established a global distribution network designed to meet the
changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels.  We are continuously evaluating and
restructuring this physical distribution network.  We have begun to establish regional inventory
centers strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate
timely delivery of our products to our customers.

The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are
essential oils, alcohol and specialty chemicals.  We also purchase packaging components that
are manufactured to our design specifications. 
Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally
made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations department.  In recent years, we made a concentrated
effort in supplier rationalization with the specific objective of reducing
costs, increasing innovation and improving quality.  In addition, we continue to focus on supply
sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain
efficiencies.  As a result of sourcing
initiatives, there is increased dependency on certain suppliers, but we believe
that these suppliers have adequate resources and facilities to overcome any
unforeseen interruption of supply.  We
are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will add
or delete suppliers based upon the changing needs of the business.  In the past, we have been able to obtain an
adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have
adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.  As we integrate acquired brands, we
continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities
to improve manufacturing performance.

Competition

The skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair
care businesses are characterized by vigorous competition throughout the
world.  Brand recognition, quality, performance
and price have a significant impact on consumers’ choices among competing
products and brands.  Advertising,
promotion, merchandising, the pace and timing of new product introductions,
line extensions and the quality of in-store sales staff also have a significant
impact on consumers’ buying decisions. 
With our numerous brands, sold in various channels, we are one of the
world’s leading manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and
hair care products.  We compete against a
number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we
do.

Our principal competitors among manufacturers and marketers of skin
care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products include:

·

Alticor,

which
markets Artistry, NAO and Laura Mercier Cosmetics and Skincare;

·

AmorePacific Corporation;

·

Avon Products Inc.

,
a direct marketer of Avon Color, Anew, Avon Naturals, Advance Techniques,
Skin-so-soft, mark, and other products;

where such products are sold.  We are the
exclusive worldwide licensee for fragrances, cosmetics and/or related products

Employees

At June 30, 2008, we had approximately 32,000 full-time employees
worldwide (including sales representatives at points of sale who are employed
by us), of whom approximately 13,400 are employed in the United States and
Canada.  None of our employees in the
United States is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  In certain other countries, a limited number
of employees are covered by a works council agreement or other syndicate
arrangements.  We believe that relations
with our employees are good.  We have
never encountered a material strike or work stoppage in the United States
or in any other country where we have a significant number of employees.

Government Regulation

We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug
Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well
as by various other Federal, state, local and international regulatory
authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our
products are produced or sold.  Such
regulations principally relate to the ingredients, labeling, packaging and
marketing of our products.  We believe
that we are in substantial compliance with such regulations, as well as with
applicable Federal, state, local and international and other countries’ rules and
regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the
environment.  There are no significant
capital expenditures for environmental control matters either planned in the
current year or expected in the near future. 
Along with other unrelated parties, we have been named as a potentially
responsible party by the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New
York with regard to a landfill in Long Island, New York.  See “

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

.”

Seasonality

Our results of operations in total, by region and by product category,
are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the
fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the
fiscal year.  The higher net sales in the
first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of
purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season and for fall fashion
makeup introductions.  Many of our
customers that are retailers follow a 4-4-5 retail calendar which may influence
the amount and timing of their order placement and receipt of goods in any
fiscal quarter.  In a traditional 4-4-5
retail calendar, each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4-week periods and one
5-week period, with one extra week in one quarter every seven years.  As a result, the retail quarter-end and the
fiscal quarter-end may be different by up to six days.  Fluctuations in net sales and operating
income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal
quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product
introductions.  Additionally, gross
margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by
variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including
purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.

Please consider the following risks and all of the other information in
this annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). 
Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties
not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial.  If any of the events contemplated by the
following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, our
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, as well as
the trading prices of our securities, may be adversely affected.

The beauty business
is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results
will suffer.

We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world,
including multinational consumer product companies.  Some of these
competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to
changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us. 
Competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products, innovation,
perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising,
special events, new product introductions, electronic commerce initiatives and
other activities.  It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale
of our competitors’ actions in these areas.  In particular, the fragrance
category in the United States is influenced by the high volume of new product
introductions by diverse companies across several different distribution
channels.  Also, the trend toward
consolidation in the retail trade, particularly in developed markets such as
the United States and Western Europe, has resulted in us becoming increasingly
dependent on key retailers, including large-format retailers, who have
increased their bargaining strength. 
This trend has also resulted in an increased risk related to the
concentration of our customers.  A severe
adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material
adverse effect on us.  Our ability to compete also depends on the
continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent
and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and
distribution network, and our ability to protect our intellectual
property.  Our inability to continue to compete effectively in countries
around the world could have an adverse impact on our business.

Our inability to
anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences
could adversely affect our financial results.

Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and
react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for
skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products as well as to where and how
consumers shop for those products.  We must continually work to develop, produce
and market new products, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands,
achieve a favorable mix of products, and refine our approach as to how and
where we market and sell our products.  While we devote considerable
effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, we
recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can
change rapidly.  If we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in
the market for our products and changing consumer demands, our financial
results will suffer.

Our future success depends on our ability to
achieve our long-term strategy.

Our long-term strategy is based on five strategic imperatives:

1.

Optimize
brand portfolio

2.

Strengthen
product categories

3.

Strengthen
and expand geographic presence

4.

Diversify
and strengthen distribution channels

5.

Achieve
operational and cost excellence

Achieving our long-term objectives may require investment in new
brands, categories, distribution channels, technologies and geographic
markets.  These investments may result in
short-term costs without any current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive
to our earnings, at least in the short term. 
In addition, we may dispose of select brands or streamline operations
and incur costs or one-time charges in doing so.  Although we believe that our strategic
imperatives will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, we may
not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits.  The failure to realize benefits, which may be
due to our ability to execute plans or other risks described herein, could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating
results.

- 12 -


Any future acquisitions may expose us to
additional risks.

We continuously review acquisition
opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our distribution
channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise
offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities.  If required, the financing for any of these
acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the
interests of our stockholders or both. 
Acquisitions may entail numerous risks, including:

·

difficulties in assimilating acquired
operations or products, including the loss of key employees from or customers
of acquired businesses;

·

diversion of management’s attention from our
core businesses;

·

adverse effects on existing business
relationships with suppliers and customers; and

·

risks of entering distribution channels,
categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.

Our failure to successfully complete the
integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and operating results.  In addition, there can be no assurance that
we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate
acquisitions on favorable terms.

A general economic
downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer
purchases of discretionary items and/or the financial strength of our customers
that are retailers, which could adversely affect our financial results.

The general level
of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general
economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer
confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control.  Consumer
purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods,
when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products.  A
decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our
customers that are retailers.  We
generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial
condition, usually without requiring collateral.  However, the financial difficulties of a
retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.  We may also assume more credit risk relating
to the receivables from that retailer. 
Our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest
customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on
our business and our financial condition. 
If a retailer was to liquidate, we may incur additional costs if we
choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand
equity.

In addition, sudden disruptions in business
conditions, for example, as a consequence of events such as the outbreak of
SARs in 2003 or those that are currently taking place in the Middle East, or as
a result of a terrorist attack, retaliation and the threat of further attacks
or retaliation, or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate
changes, can have a short and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer
spending.

Events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability
to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling may impact our travel
retail business, which is a significant contributor to our overall results.

A downturn in the economies in which we sell our products or a sudden
disruption of business conditions in those economies could adversely affect our
sales and profitability.

Changes in laws,
regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our
financial results.

Our business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and
policies.  Changes in the laws, regulations and policies, including the
interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect, or will affect, our
business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations,
trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal
or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result could
adversely affect our financial results.

Our success depends, in part, on the
quality and safety of our products.

Our success depends, in part, on the quality and
safety of our products.  If our products
are found to be defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet our
consumers’ standards, our relationships with customers or consumers could
suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we
could lose sales and/or become subject to liability claims, any of which could
result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

- 13 -


Our success depends, in part, on
our key personnel.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain
our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management
team.  The unexpected loss of one or more
of our key employees could adversely affect our business.  Our success also depends, in part, on our
continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified
personnel.  Competition for these
employees can be intense.  We may not be
able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and
our failure to do so could adversely affect our business.  This risk may be exacerbated by the stresses
associated with the implementation of SMI (as defined below) and other
initiatives.

We are subject to risks related
to our international operations.

We operate on a global basis, with approximately 59% of our fiscal 2008
net sales generated outside the United States.  We maintain offices in
over 40 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the
United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout
the world.  Foreign operations are subject to many risks and
uncertainties, including:

·

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates, which can affect our results of operations, the value of our foreign
assets, the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products
in the same markets and the cost of certain inventory and non-inventory items
required in our operations;

·

changes in foreign laws, regulations and
policies, including restrictions on trade, import and export license
requirements, and tariffs and taxes, as well as changes in United States laws
and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment; and

·

adverse weather conditions, social, economic
and geopolitical conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action.

These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business,
prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

A disruption in
operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.

As a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global
scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including
industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes,
disruptions in logistics or information systems, loss or impairment of key
manufacturing sites, product quality control, safety, licensing requirements
and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external
factors over which we have no control.  If such an event were to occur, it
could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results.

Our information systems and websites may be
susceptible to outages and other risks.

We have information systems that support our business processes,
including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production,
distribution, finance and intracompany communications throughout the world.  We have e-commerce and other Internet
websites in the United States and many other countries.  These systems may be susceptible to outages
due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and
similar events.  Despite the implementation
of network security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to computer
viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering.  The occurrence of these or other events could
disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and
results of operations.

We are subject to risks associated with
implementing global information systems.

As part of a program that we call our “Strategic Modernization
Initiative,” or “SMI,” we are implementing enterprise-wide global programs
intended to deliver a single set of integrated data, processes and
technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize business
processes across brands, operating units and sales affiliates.  The initial implementation of SMI at our
Aveda operating unit occurred in May 2007. 
We anticipate SMI implementation will continue at additional primary
locations in fiscal 2009, with the majority of our business to be implemented
through fiscal 2012.  Like most
entity-wide changes to software systems, the implementation of SMI involves
risks and uncertainties.  Failure to
implement SMI as planned, in terms of timing, specifications and/or costs,
could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

The trading prices of our securities
periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our
earnings or other financial performance.

Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term
strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any
particular fiscal quarter.  We believe
that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our
stockholders.  At the same time, however,
we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to
our forecast of net sales and earnings. 
Accordingly, when we announced our year-end financial results for fiscal
2008, we provided guidance as to our expected net sales and earnings for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 and the quarter ending September 30,
2008.  While we generally expect to
provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter,
we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at
such times or otherwise.  In addition,
the longer-term guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the
time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance
over a number of years.  Such targets are
more speculative than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations.

In all of our public statements when we make, or update, a
forward-looking statement about our sales and/or earnings expectations, we
accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with
a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from
those we expect.  Such a list is included,
among other places, in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K
and Form 10-Q).  These and other
factors may make it difficult for outside observers, such as research analysts,
to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.

Outside analysts, like all investors, have the right to make their own
predictions of our financial results for any future period.  Outside analysts, however, have access to no
more material information about our plans than any other public investor, and
we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance.  Nor do we assume any responsibility to
correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our
own internal expectations.  If and when
we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or
others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be
affected.  Investors who rely on the
predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with
respect to our securities do so at their own risk.  We take no responsibility for any losses
suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.

We own, lease and occupy numerous offices, assembly and distribution
facilities and warehouses in the United States and abroad.  We consider our properties to be generally in
good condition and believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations
and provide sufficient capacity to meet anticipated requirements.  We lease approximately 286,000 square feet of
rentable space for our principal offices in New York, New York and own an
office building of approximately 57,000 square feet in Melville, New York.  As of August 15, 2008, we operated 667

Legal Proceedings

.

We are involved, from time to time, in litigation and other legal
proceedings incidental to our business. 
Management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal
proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of
operations or financial condition. 
However, management’s assessment of our current litigation and other
legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect
to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to
us or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not
in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of
such litigation or proceedings.

In 1999, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York
(the “State”) notified the Company and ten other entities that they had been
identified as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) with respect to the
Blydenburgh landfill in Islip, New York. 
Each PRP may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of
investigation and cleanup, which the State estimated in 2006 to be
approximately $19.7 million for all PRPs. 
In 2001, the State sued other PRPs (including Hickey’s Carting, Inc.,
Dennis C. Hickey and Maria Hickey, collectively the “Hickey Parties”), in the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York to recover such costs
in connection with the site, and in September 2002, the Hickey Parties
brought contribution actions against the Company and other Blydenburgh
PRPs.  These contribution actions seek to
recover, among other things, any damages for which the Hickey Parties are found
liable in the State’s lawsuit against them, and related costs and expenses,
including attorneys’ fees.  In June 2004,
the State added the Company and other PRPs as defendants in its pending case
against the Hickey Parties.  In April 2006,
the Company and other defendants added numerous other parties to the case as
third-party defendants.  The Company and
certain other PRPs have engaged in settlement discussions which to date have
been unsuccessful.  Settlement
negotiations with the new third-party defendants, the State, the Company and
other defendants began in July 2006. 
We have accrued an amount which we believe would be necessary to resolve
our share of this matter.  If settlement
discussions are not successful, we intend to vigorously defend the pending
claims.  While no assurance can be given
as to the ultimate outcome, management believes that the resolution of the
Blydenburgh matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial condition.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters

Our Class A Common Stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol “EL.”  The
following table shows the high and low sales prices as reported on the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Tape and the cash dividends per share declared in
fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007:

We expect to continue the payment of cash dividends in the future, but
there can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will continue to declare
them.  In November 2007 and October 2006,
the Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $.55 and $.50 per share,
respectively, which was paid in December 2007 and 2006, respectively.

As of August 15, 2008, there were approximately 3,247 record
holders of Class A Common Stock and 20 record holders of Class B
Common Stock.

Share Repurchase Program

We are authorized by the
Board of Directors to repurchase up to 88.0 million shares of Class A
Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions,
depending on market conditions and other factors.  As of June 30, 2008, the cumulative
total of acquired shares pursuant to the authorization was 64.1 million,
reducing the remaining authorized share repurchase balance to 23.9
million.  During fiscal 2008, we
purchased approximately 3.0 million shares pursuant to the authorization for
$129.1 million as outlined in the following table:

(1)

The publicly
  announced repurchase program was last increased by 20.0 million shares in
  November 2007. The initial program covering the repurchase of 8.0
  million shares was announced in September 1998 and increased by 20.0
  million shares in both February 2007 and May 2005 and 10.0 million
  shares in both May 2004 and October 2002.

(2)

Represents
  shares of our common stock received as a price adjustment and final
  settlement related to an accelerated share repurchase program with a
  financial counterparty implemented during fiscal 2007.

(3)

Includes shares
  that were repurchased by the Company in connection with shares withheld to
  satisfy tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock units.

Subsequent to June 30,
2008, we repurchased approximately 0.9 million additional shares of Class A
Common Stock for $38.4 million pursuant to a 10b5-1 stock purchase plan entered
into in February 2008 and completed in August 2008.

Sales of Unregistered Securities

Shares of Class B Common Stock may be converted immediately into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis by the holder and are automatically converted into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis upon transfer to a person or entity that is not a “Permitted Transferee” or soon after a record date for a meeting of stockholders where the outstanding Class B Common Stock constitutes less than 10% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company.  There is no cash or other consideration paid by the holder converting the shares and, accordingly, there is no cash or other consideration received by the Company.  The shares of Class A Common Stock issued by the Company in such conversions are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) thereof.

During the three months ended June 30, 2008, the holder set forth

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

.

The
table below summarizes selected financial information.  For further information, refer to the audited
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto beginning on page F-1
of this report.

(a) Fiscal
2006 results included $93.0 million, after-tax, or $.43 per diluted share in
special charges related to our cost savings initiative and tax-related
matters.  Included in the charges was an
operating expense charge of $92.1 million, equal to $.27 per diluted common
share related to the cost savings initiative. 
The results also included a special tax charge related to a settlement
with the Internal Revenue Service regarding an examination of our consolidated
Federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2001, and represents
the aggregate earnings impact of the settlement through fiscal 2006.  The settlement resulted in an increase to our
fiscal 2006 income tax provision and a corresponding decrease in fiscal 2006
net earnings of approximately $46 million, or approximately $.21 per diluted
common share.  During the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2006, we completed the repatriation of foreign earnings through
intercompany dividends under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004 (the “AJCA”).  In connection with
the repatriation, we updated the computation of the related aggregate tax
impact, resulting in a favorable adjustment of approximately $11 million, or
approximately $.05 per diluted common share, to our initial tax charge of $35
million recorded in fiscal 2005.  The tax
settlement, coupled with the AJCA favorable tax adjustment, resulted in a net
increase to our fiscal 2006 income tax provision and a corresponding decrease
in fiscal 2006 net earnings of approximately $35 million, or approximately $.16
per diluted common share.

(b) In
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we announced plans to repatriate
approximately $690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal year 2006, which
included $500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the
provisions of the AJCA.  This action resulted
in an aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million in our fiscal year
ended June 30, 2005, which included an incremental tax charge of
approximately $28 million, equal to $.12 per diluted share.

(c) In
May 2007, we issued and sold $300.0 million of 5.55% Senior Notes due May 15,
2017 and $300.0 million of 6.00% Senior Notes, due May 15, 2037 in a
public offering.  We used the net
proceeds of this offering to repay long-term commercial paper, which was used
to fund our accelerated stock repurchase program, and to pay transaction fees
and expenses related to this offering.

(d) In
April 2006, we completed the sale of certain assets and operations of the
reporting unit that marketed and sold Stila brand products.  In February 2004, we sold the assets and
operations of our former reporting unit that sold

jane

brand products.  As a result, all
consolidated statements of earnings information in the consolidated financial
statements and footnotes for all periods presented has been restated for
comparative purposes to reflect those reporting units as discontinued
operations.

(e) During
fiscal 2007, we repurchased 22,461,642 shares of our outstanding common stock,
of which 15,960,842 shares were purchased for $750.0 million through an
accelerated stock repurchase program with a financial counterparty.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30,
2008 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30,
2008 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial
statements.  These judgments can be subjective
and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those
estimates.  Our most critical accounting
policies relate to revenue recognition, concentration of credit risk,
inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill and other
intangible assets, income taxes and derivatives.

Management of the Company has discussed the selection of significant
accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the
Company’s Board of Directors.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon transfer of
ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk
of loss related to those goods.  In the
Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is
shipped to the customer and in the Europe, Middle East & Africa and
Asia/Pacific regions sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s
receipt.  In certain circumstances,
transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at our retail
stores.  Sales at our retail stores and
online are recognized in accordance with a traditional 4-4-5 retail calendar,
where each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4-week periods and one 5-week
period, with one extra week in one quarter every seven years.  As a result, the retail quarter-end and the
fiscal quarter-end may be different by up to six days.

Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by
deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts,
incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated
product returns.  Our practice is to
accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized
and approved.  In accepting returns, we
typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from
that retailer.  As a percentage of gross
sales, returns were 4.4%, 4.2% and 5.0% in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Our sales return accrual is a subjective
critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales.

This accrual is calculated
based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information
provided by authorized retailers regarding their inventory levels.  Consideration of these factors results in an
accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases
related to seasonal fluctuations. 
Experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels
and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of
returns due to the seasonal nature of our business.  In addition, as necessary, specific accruals
may be established for significant future known or anticipated events.  The types of known or anticipated events that
we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited
to, the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers,
changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue or support new
and existing products.

Concentration of Credit Risk

An entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk if it is
exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have if it mitigated its risks
through diversification of customers. 
The significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of
the concentration.

During fiscal 2006, Federated Department Stores, Inc. acquired The
May Department Stores Company, resulting in the merger of our previous two
largest customers (collectively “Macy’s, Inc.”).  This customer sells products primarily within
North America and accounted for $951.4 million, or 12%, $958.8 million, or 14%,
and $1,005.8 million, or 16%, of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively.  This
customer accounted for $109.2 million, or 11%, and $105.3 million, or 12%, of
our accounts receivable at June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Although management believes that this
customer and our other major customers are sound and creditworthy, a severe
adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material
adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows and/or financial condition.

In the ordinary course of business, we have established an allowance
for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of $26.3 million
and $23.3 million as of June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Our
allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a
direct impact on reported net earnings. 
The allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by $10.2 million, $18.2
million and $12.0 million for customer deductions and write-offs in fiscal
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and increased by $13.2 million, $14.4
million and $10.2 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively.  This reserve is
based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and
historical trends.

Table
of Contents

Inventory

We state our inventory at the lower of cost
or fair market value, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) method.  We believe FIFO most
closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale.  The reported net value of our inventory
includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry
and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods.  Inventory cost includes raw materials, direct
labor and overhead.

We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the
difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable
value, based on various product sales projections.  This reserve is calculated using an estimated
obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical
trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.  In addition, and as necessary, we may
establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefit
Costs

We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a
domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension
plan  (“U.S. Qualified Plan”) and an
unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide
benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S.
Qualified Plan, the “Domestic Plans”); a domestic contributory defined
contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country,
consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred
compensation arrangements; and certain other post-retirement benefit plans.

The amounts needed to fund future payouts under these plans are subject
to numerous assumptions and variables. 
Certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are
within our control such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of
return on plan assets and future compensation levels.  We evaluate these assumptions with our
actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges, although
an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our
control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings.

The pre-retirement discount rate for each plan used for determining
future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term
bonds.  For fiscal 2008, we used a
pre-retirement discount rate for our Domestic Plans of 6.25% and varying rates
on our international plans of between 2.25% and 8.25%.  The pre-retirement rate for our Domestic
Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an
Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.  We believe the timing and amount of cash
flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the
estimated defined benefit payment streams of our Domestic Plans.  For fiscal 2008, we used an expected return
on plan assets of 7.75% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates of
between 3.00% and 8.25% for our international plans.  In determining the long-term rate of return
for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan’s
investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies.  The U.S. Qualified Plan asset allocation as
of June 30, 2008 was approximately 40% equity investments, 42% debt
securities and 18% other investments. 
The asset allocation of our combined international plans as of June 30,
2008 was approximately 45% equity investments, 38% debt securities and 17%
other investments.  The difference
between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. 
Those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods
will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future
periods.  For fiscal 2008, our pension
plans had actual negative return on assets of $19.3 million as compared with
expected return on assets of $47.0 million, which resulted in a net deferred
loss of $66.3 million, of which approximately $34 million is subject to
amortization over periods ranging from approximately 8 to 16 years.  The actual negative return on assets was
primarily related to the performance of equity markets during the past fiscal
year.

A 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of
return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2008
pension expense:

Our post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could
be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant
effect on the amounts reported.  A
one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal
2008 would have had the following effects:

- 21 -

Table
of Contents

For fiscal 2009, we are using a pre-retirement discount rate for the
Domestic Plans of 6.75% and varying rates for our international plans of
between 2.00% and 9.00%.  We are using an
expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying
rates for our international pension plans of between 3.25% and 9.00%.  The net change in these assumptions from
those used in fiscal 2008 will result in a decrease in pension expense of
approximately $3.6 million in fiscal 2009. 
We will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these
assumptions and adjust them accordingly.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased
businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.  Other intangible assets principally consist
of purchased royalty rights and trademarks. 
Goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are
not amortized.

On an annual basis, or more frequently if certain events or
circumstances warrant, we test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
assets for impairment.  To determine the
fair value of these intangible assets, there are many assumptions and estimates
used that directly impact the results of the testing.  We have the ability to influence the outcome
and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose.  To mitigate undue influence, we use industry
accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by
various levels of management and, in certain instances, we engage third-party
valuation specialists to advise us.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” as
amended.  This statement establishes
financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes
that result from an enterprise’s activities during the current and preceding
years.  It requires an asset and
liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes.

As of June 30, 2008, we have current net deferred tax assets of
$184.6 million and non-current net deferred tax assets of $55.3 million.  The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient
future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of
currently anticipated tax rates.  Included in net deferred tax assets is a
valuation allowance of $5.7 million for deferred tax assets, where management
believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be
realized in the relevant jurisdiction. 
Based on our assessments, no additional valuation allowance is
required.  If we determine that a
deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax
asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 48, “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
(“FIN 48”).  FIN 48 clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s
financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109.  FIN 48 prescribes a two-step evaluation
process for tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return.  The first step is recognition and the second
is measurement.  FIN 48 also provides
guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, disclosures, transition
and accounting for interim periods.  In May 2007,
the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FIN 48-1, “Definition of
Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48, an amendment of FASB Interpretation
(FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FSP No. FIN
48-1”).  FSP No. FIN 48-1 provides
guidance on how to determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for
the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits.

We adopted the provisions of FIN 48, as
amended, effective July 1, 2007.  As
a result, we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax
benefits and interest of $13.1 million (net of tax effect), which, as required,
was accounted for as a reduction to the July 1, 2007 balance of retained
earnings.  We elected to continue our
historical practice of classifying applicable interest and penalties as a
component of the provision for income taxes.

We provide tax reserves for Federal, state, local and international
exposures relating to periods subject to audit. 
The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about
tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.  We assess our tax positions and record tax
benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s
evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the
reporting dates.  For those tax positions
where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have
recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood
of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge
of all relevant information.  For those tax
positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be
sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.  Where applicable, associated interest and
penalties have also been recognized. 
Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in
management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for
estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.  In certain circumstances, the ultimate
outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which render
them inestimable.  If actual outcomes
differ materially from these estimates, including those that cannot be
quantified, they could have a material impact on our results of operations, as
we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 (see “Results of Operations

, Fiscal 2007 as Compared with Fiscal 2006 – Provision for Income Taxes

”).

Derivatives

We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”
as amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. 
This statement also requires the recognition of all derivative
instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they
be measured at fair value.

We currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain
anticipated transactions and interest rates, as well as receivables and
payables denominated in foreign currencies. 
We do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  Hedge effectiveness is documented, assessed
and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and
monitor the instruments.  Variables that
are external to us such as social, political and economic risks may have an
impact on our hedging program and the results thereof.  For a discussion on the quantitative impact
of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments, refer to “

Liquidity and Capital Resources – Market Risk.”

Quantitative Analysis

During the three-year period ended June 30, 2008 there have not
been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting
policies, nor to the related significant estimates.  With the exception of our tax settlement with
the Internal Revenue Service in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, which
finalized the ultimate liability for exposures which were previously
inestimable, the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not
differed significantly from our expectations.

While we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and
the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all
material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would
change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses or
our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated
sales returns, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence reserve
and income taxes.  For fiscal 2008, had
these estimates been changed simultaneously by 2.5% in either direction, our
reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately $5.2
million, operating expenses would have changed by approximately $0.7 million
and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately
$1.7 million.  The collective impact of
these changes on operating income, net earnings and net earnings per diluted
common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately $5.9 million,
$7.6 million and $.04, respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We manufacture, market and sell skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair
care products which are distributed in over 140 countries and territories.  We believe that the best way to increase
stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products
and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and
profitable manner.  With this goal in
mind, we have developed a long-term strategy based on the following five imperatives:

1.

Optimize brand
portfolio

2.

Strengthen product
categories

3.

Strengthen and
expand geographic presence

4.

Diversify and
strengthen distribution channels

5.

Achieve operational
and cost excellence

In fiscal 2008, we continued to find ways to strengthen our core brands
and product categories, maximize high-growth brands, and incubate and develop
next generation brands.  Net sales from
Estée Lauder and Clinique grew on a global basis, fueled by strong demand
outside of the United States where these brands generated approximately two-thirds
of their net sales.  We took measures to
improve our business at the point of sale by investing in new modular display
and tester units for the Estée Lauder brand at all North American department
store locations and increased our focus to improve the service provided by
Estée Lauder Beauty Advisors.  Our
Clinique brand sponsored a program to improve the consumer experience at U.S.
and international department stores.  Our
faster growing M

A

ž

C,
Bobbi Brown, La Mer and Jo Malone brands continued to increase their net sales
in all of our geographic regions.  The
recent launch of Sean John Unforgivable Woman generated significant incremental
net sales to our fragrance product category.

In July 2007, we acquired Ojon Corporation, a privately held hair
care and skin care company based in Canada that sells its products primarily
through direct response television (“DRTV”) and specialty stores.  We also recently announced that we purchased
a minority interest in a privately held company that manufactures, markets and
sells beauty products in India under the Forest Essentials brand.

This past year we continued to build on our strength in research and
development.  For example, we further
improved the Estée Lauder Re-Nutriv product line with the introduction of Re-Nutriv
Ultimate Youth Crème.  Clinique launched
a “dermatologist-certified” line called Redness Solutions to reduce the
appearance of skin redness.  Origins
recently launched Origins Organics, the first full line of skin, body and hair
care products to be certified under the USDA National Organic Program.

Again in fiscal 2008, the majority of our net sales came from outside
the United States.  We generated growth
in sales and profits in our travel retail business, including accelerated
growth from downtown locations in Asian cities, border stores in Latin America
and shops on cruise ships.  We continued
to increase our presence in China and Russia and recently established
affiliates in the Middle East and India. 
In an effort to improve the return on our media investment abroad, we
consolidated the work of several media agencies into one by selecting M2M, a
media company of Omnicom Media Group, to be our media agency in eight European
and four Asian/Pacific countries.  By
doing so, we anticipate integrating traditional media and expanding the use of
Internet and digital advertising in these areas.

In alternative distribution channels, we continued to grow our online
business in the United States, where we sell products from 15 of our brands on
Company-owned websites.  With the recent
expansion of our online business into Korea, we now sell products on our own e-commerce
sites in five foreign countries.  In
fiscal 2008, we also expanded our presence in the DRTV distribution channel,
most significantly with the acquisition of Ojon in July 2007.  In the United States, Clinique debuted on
QVC, where Bobbi Brown, Origins and Ojon currently have regular shows.  BeautyBank created Eyes by Design, a brand
which is currently being sold exclusively on HSN.  Internationally, Ojon debuted on QVC in Germany
while Bobbi Brown and Prescriptives aired on QVC in the United Kingdom.  Origins and Good Skin

TM

have also
had shows on DRTV in Korea.

As part of our international pharmacy channel business initiative,
several distributor markets for Darphin products will now be serviced by our
own affiliates and Origins opened more than 20 new pharmacies in France.  Tri-Aktiline by Good Skin

TM

launched in over 500 Sephora doors throughout Europe and exclusively in Cosmed’s
250 pharmacies in Taiwan, our first entry in Taiwan’s pharmacy channel.  In January 2008, we formed a strategic
collaboration with Allergan, Inc., a global medical aesthetics company, to
develop a Clinique-branded skin care line, Clinique Medical, to be sold
exclusively through physicians’ offices in the United States.

We continued to make progress on our Strategic Modernization Initiative
(“SMI”).  During fiscal 2008, Demand
Planning for select business units began using SAP software, a critical part of
SMI.  We anticipate SMI implementation
will continue at additional primary locations in fiscal 2009, with the majority
of our business to be implemented through fiscal 2012.

Despite the rise in energy and raw material prices in the current year,
we were able to maintain our overall cost of sales margin through other
efficiencies achieved from our ongoing savings initiatives.  We also opened a new distribution center in
Singapore to improve service levels in the fast-growing Asia/Pacific
region.  In December 2007, we
entered into agreements to ensure that the equivalent of all electricity
utilized by our Global Operations division is generated from green
sources.  We now rank 22nd on the EPA’s
list of leading Fortune 500 companies in alternative power usage.

During fiscal 2008, we also faced challenges, many of which we expect
to be ongoing in fiscal 2009.  We believe
that economic uncertainty in the United States has affected our business,
particularly in the department store channel. 
We continue to see softness in the United States, including the impact
of the consolidation and changes taking place among retailers.  In addition, the fragrance category continues
to be highly competitive.  These
challenges have been mitigated through sales in alternative channels, such as
freestanding retail stores, internet distribution, self-select distribution and
DRTV.  Efforts to expand geographically
are complicated by increasing regulatory issues and cultural barriers.

As we continue to implement our strategic imperatives, we expect to
make selective investments, embark on new business endeavors, and pursue
initiatives that we believe will have long-term benefits.  The timing, impact and magnitude of any
particular actions, such as an acquisition to strengthen our product categories
and/or diversify our distribution channels, are subject to numerous factors and
one-time charges that cannot be predicted.

The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a
percentage of net sales:

In order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new
products, support new and established products through advertising, sampling
and merchandising and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs
of our consumers.  The economics of
developing, producing, launching and supporting products influence our sales
and operating performance each period. 
The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on
sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business
planning.

The recent challenges and uncertainties in the economies of certain key
countries, including the United States, may continue to have an adverse impact
on consumer demand, which could affect our net sales and operating results in
the short and long term.

Fiscal 2008 as Compared with Fiscal 2007

NET SALES

Net sales increased 12%,
or $873.3 million, to $7,910.8 million, reflecting net sales growth in all of
our product categories within each geographic region.  Skin care, makeup and fragrance net sales
increases were led by Europe, the Middle East and Africa while most of the net
sales increase in hair care was achieved in the Americas.  The increase in net sales reflected our
efforts to capitalize on growth opportunities internationally.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, net sales increased 8%.

Product Categories

Skin Care

Net sales of skin care products
increased 15%, or $395.8 million, to $2,996.8 million.  This growth reflected the recent launches of
Idealist Pore Minimizing Skin Refinisher, Cyber White EX and Hydra Bright Skin
Tone Perfecting Moisturizers from Estée Lauder. 
Also contributing to the growth were the recent launches of products in
the Acne Solutions Clear Skin System, Redness Solutions and Even Better Skin
Tone Corrector from Clinique as well as The Eye Concentrate and The
Moisturizing Gel Cream from La Mer. 
Collectively, these new products resulted in incremental sales of
approximately $215 million.  Net sales
increases from Re-Nutriv and Resilience Lift Extreme Ultra Firming products
from Estée Lauder, products in Clinique’s 3-Step Skin Care System and
Repairwear line, and Tri-Aktiline

TM

Instant Deep Wrinkle Filler from
Good Skin

TM

totaled approximately $80 million.  These improvements were partially offset by
approximately $55 million of lower sales from certain other existing Idealist
products and Perfectionist products from Estée Lauder.  Net sales of other new and existing products
also significantly contributed to the growth. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net
sales increased 10%.

Makeup

Makeup net sales
increased 11%, or $287.7 million, to $3,000.4 million reflecting growth from
our makeup artist brands of approximately $194 million.  Also contributing to the growth were
incremental sales from the recent launches of Estée Lauder Signature Hydra
Lustre Lipstick, Double Wear Zero Smudge Mascara and Eyeliner from Estée
Lauder, Supermoisture Makeup and Superbalm Moisturizing Gloss from Clinique, as
well as higher sales of Double Wear Stay-In-Place Makeup from Estée Lauder of
approximately $97 million, combined.  Partially offsetting these increases
were lower sales of approximately $30 million of Pure Color Eyeshadow and High
Gloss from Estée Lauder and Colour Surge Lipstick from Clinique.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, makeup net sales increased 7%.

Fragrance

Net sales of fragrance products
increased 9%, or $123.4 million, to $1,432.0 million.  The recent launches of Sean John Unforgivable
Woman, Dreaming Tommy Hilfiger, Estée Lauder Pure White Linen Light Breeze,
Estée Lauder

pleasures delight

and DKNY Delicious
Night collectively contributed approximately $95 million to the growth in the
category.  Higher sales of approximately
$62 million of DKNY Be Delicious, Jo Malone and Tom Ford fragrances also
contributed to the increase.  Lower sales
of approximately $53 million of Tommy Girl by Tommy Hilfiger, DKNY Red
Delicious Women and DKNY Be Delicious Men partially offset the growth in this
product category.  While current year
sales levels compared favorably to the prior year, we anticipate continued
challenges in this product category in the United States.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation,
fragrance net sales increased 5%.

Hair Care

Hair care net sales increased 13%, or $50.0 million,
to $427.1 million, primarily due to the inclusion of the Ojon brand which was
acquired at the end of July 2007, as well as growth from Aveda and Bumble and
bumble.

Aveda net sales increases
benefited from the recent launches of Smooth Infusion and Aveda Men
Pure-Formance products, as well as the recent acquisition of an independent
distributor.

Bumble and bumble
net sales benefited from new points of distribution and increases from its
hotel amenities program, which concluded in the third quarter.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales
increased 11%.

Geographic Regions

Net sales in the Americas increased 4%, or $150.6
million, to $3,711.5 million, primarily reflecting net sales growth in Canada
and Latin America, as well as the addition of the Ojon brand, of approximately
$98 million, combined.

Additional net
sales increases of approximately $65 million were attributable to our designer
fragrances business and our makeup artist and hair care brands in the United
States.  Partially offsetting this growth
was approximately $37 million related to weaknesses in certain of our core
brands in the United States as a result of competitive pressures and challenges
in the department store channel.

We
believe that economic uncertainty in the United States has affected our
business, particularly in the department store channel.  These challenges have been mitigated through
sales in alternative channels, such as freestanding retail stores, internet
distribution, self-select distribution and direct-response television.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, net sales in the Americas increased 3%.

All countries in Europe, the Middle East & Africa
experienced net sales growth, which contributed to the increase in net sales of
21%, or $513.3 million, to $3,006.7 million, although net sales growth rates
slowed in certain key countries.  This
growth was led by our travel retail business and the United Kingdom, as well as
in Russia,

which benefited from our
expansion in this emerging market.

The
results in this region were inclusive of an exchange rate benefit due to the
weakening of the U.S. dollar of approximately $206 million.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased 12%.

Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 21%, or $209.4
million, to $1,192.6 million, reflecting growth from all countries in the region.  This increase reflected higher net sales of
approximately $172 million in China, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and Korea.  The results in this region were inclusive of
an exchange rate benefit due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar of
approximately $66 million.  Excluding the
impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 15%.

We strategically stagger our
new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in
regional sales growth.

COST OF
SALES

Cost of sales as a percentage
of total net sales was 25.2%, which is the same as the prior year.  Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales
reflected a decrease in the level and timing of promotional activities of
approximately 20 basis points and a positive effect of exchange rates of
approximately 10 basis points. 
Offsetting these improvements was an unfavorable change in the mix of
our business, an increase in obsolescence charges, and employee-related charges
designed to streamline certain business activities and achieve future cost
savings of approximately 10 basis points, each.

- 27 -


Despite the rise in energy and raw material prices in the current year,
we were able to maintain our overall cost of goods margin through other
efficiencies achieved from ongoing savings initiatives.  While sustained energy and raw material price
increases could result in higher costs, we believe that this will not have a
material adverse effect on our cost of sales margin in the near future.

Since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost
of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional
calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,
fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage. 
In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion
of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from
those of our existing brands.

OPERATING
EXPENSES

Operating expenses
increased to 64.5% of net sales as compared with 64.1% of net sales in the
prior year.  The increase in operating
expenses and operating expense margin reflected higher costs of global
information technology systems and infrastructure of approximately 30 basis
points.  An additional 20 basis points
resulted from an increase in valuation reserves reflecting the diminishing
likelihood of realizing value from a promissory note and convertible preferred
stock received in connection with the divestiture of Stila in fiscal 2006.  We also recorded an increase in intangible
asset amortization resulting from recent strategic acquisitions, as well as
employee-related charges designed to streamline certain business activities and
achieve future cost savings, of approximately 10 basis points each.  Operating expense margin in the prior year
was adversely impacted by charges related to our pharmacy channel of
approximately 40 basis points.

Changes in advertising,
merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing and level of
activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets
being emphasized.

OPERATING
RESULTS

Operating income
increased 8%, or $60.8 million, to $810.7 million as compared with the prior
year.  Operating margin declined to 10.3%
of net sales as compared with 10.7% in the prior year, reflecting our constant
cost of sales margin and the increase in our operating expense margin, as
previously discussed.

Product Categories

Fragrance operating
income increased 29%, or $8.1 million, to $36.2 million, reflecting profitable
international growth, partially offset by increased spending in support of
designer fragrance products initiatives. 
Skin care operating income increased 19%, or $64.1 million, to $405.6
million, primarily reflecting improved international results from certain of
our core brands and net sales growth from La Mer products and Tri-Aktiline

TM

Instant Deep Wrinkle Filler from Good Skin

TM

.  In addition, the prior year results in this
category reflected organizational costs of approximately $30 million, primarily
related to our pharmacy channel in Europe. 
Makeup operating income increased 6%, or $20.1 million, to $359.4
million, primarily reflecting improved results internationally.  These improvements were partially offset by
lower results in the United States from certain of our core brands, the charge
on the impairment of Stila-related financial instruments, and costs related to
the establishment of new points of distribution for M

ž

A

ž

C.  Hair care operating income declined 73%, or
$31.0 million, to $11.5 million, primarily reflecting costs related to the
acquisition and integration of Ojon to position the brand for future
growth.  The results in this category
also reflected an increase in intangible asset amortization resulting from
recent strategic acquisitions as well as costs related to the establishment of
new points of distribution.

Geographic Regions

Operating income in the
Americas declined 32%, or $108.1 million, to $228.3 million, primarily
reflecting a difficult retail environment in which our core brands faced
challenges in the department store channel. 
We also experienced significant pressure on the profitability of our
hair care business as discussed above. 
At the same time, we continued to invest in our global information
technology systems and infrastructure. 
In addition, we established new points of distribution for existing
brands, incurred costs to streamline certain business activities to generate
future efficiencies and incurred a charge on the impairment of Stila-related
financial instruments, as discussed above.

In Europe, the Middle
East & Africa, operating income increased 35%, or $111.7 million, to
$433.1 million primarily due to higher results of approximately $71 million in
our travel retail business, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Balkans and
Spain.  Partially offsetting these
increases were lower results in Russia and India of approximately $6 million,
reflecting spending to support our expansion in these emerging markets.  The overall operating results in this region
were adversely impacted in the prior year by the pharmacy channel charges
discussed above.

In Asia/Pacific,
operating income increased 61%, or $56.5 million, to $149.7 million.  All of our affiliates in this region
experienced an increase in operating income, primarily resulting from net sales
growth led by Japan, Hong Kong, China, Australia and Korea, which contributed
approximately $43 million, collectively.

- 28 -


INTEREST
EXPENSE, NET

Net interest expense was
$66.8 million as compared with $38.9 million in the prior year.  This change primarily resulted from higher
average debt balances, including an additional $600.0 million of senior notes
issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, partially offset by lower average
interest rates.

PROVISION
FOR INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and
local income taxes.  The effective rate
differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax
rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses.  Our effective tax rate will change from year
to year based on non-recurring and recurring factors including, but not limited
to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local
taxes, tax audit settlements and the interaction of various global tax
strategies.  The effective rate for
income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2008 was 34.9% as compared with
35.9% in the prior year.  The decrease in
the effective income tax rate of 100 basis points resulted primarily from a
decrease in state and local income tax expense (240 basis points) partially
offset by an increase in the tax effect of our foreign operations (140 basis
points).

NET
EARNINGS

Net earnings as compared with fiscal 2007 increased 5%, or $24.6
million, to $473.8 million and diluted net earnings per common share improved
11% from $2.16 to $2.40.

Fiscal 2007 as Compared with Fiscal 2006

NET SALES

Net sales increased 9%, or $573.7 million, to $7,037.5 million,
reflecting net sales growth in all product categories and geographic
regions.  The increases in our skin care, makeup and fragrance product
categories were led by Europe, the Middle East & Africa while the
increase in hair care net sales was predominantly in the Americas. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 7%.

Product Categories

Skin Care

Net sales of skin care products increased 8%, or $200.2 million, to
$2,601.0 million.  Most of this growth was fueled by new product launches
which made their most significant impact in our Europe, the Middle East &
Africa and Asia/Pacific regions.  The fiscal 2007 launches of Advanced
Night Repair Concentrate Recovery Boosting Treatment and Idealist Refinisher
from Estée Lauder, and Repairwear Lift Firming Night Cream, Continuous Rescue
Antioxidant Moisturizer, All About Eyes Rich and Repairwear Contour Firming
Formula from Clinique contributed incremental sales of approximately $95
million, combined.  Net sales increases from our fast-growing La Mer
brand, Resilience Lift Extreme Ultra Firming products and other existing
Advanced Night Repair products from Estée Lauder, along with products in the Clinique
3-Step Skin Care System and Superdefense from Clinique, totaled approximately
$97 million.  These improvements were partially offset by approximately
$35 million of lower sales from certain other Resilience Lift products and
Perfectionist [CP+] from Estée Lauder.  Excluding the impact of foreign
currency translation, skin care net sales increased 6%.

Makeup

Makeup net sales increased 8%, or $208.5 million, to $2,712.7 million,
reflecting growth from our makeup artist brands of approximately $191 million. 
This increase was supported by new points of distribution and new product
launches as well as M·A·C Viva Glam lip products, the proceeds of which are
donated to AIDS-related charities.  Higher sales of Double Wear Foundation
and the fiscal 2007 launch of Resilience Lift Extreme Ultra Firming Makeup SPF
15 by Estée Lauder contributed approximately $56 million to the growth in this
product category.  Lower sales of approximately $35 million of Pure Color
Gloss and Individualist Natural Finish Makeup by Estée Lauder, and Repairwear
Anti-Aging Makeup SPF 15 by Clinique partially offset this growth. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales
increased 6%.

Fragrance

Net sales of fragrance products increased 8%, or $95.3 million, to
$1,308.6 million, primarily driven by incremental international sales from
newer fragrance offerings.  DKNY Red Delicious, Pure White Linen from
Estée Lauder, Sean John Unforgivable, DKNY Red Delicious Men and Donna Karan
Gold collectively contributed approximately $128 million to the category. 
Lower sales of approximately $67 million of True Star and True Star Men by
Tommy Hilfiger, and Estée Lauder

pleasures

partially offset the growth in this product category.  Excluding the
impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales increased 5%.

- 29 -

Table
of Contents

Hair Care

Hair care net sales increased 18%, or $58.4 million, to $377.1 million,
primarily due to sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble products. 
Aveda net sales increases were primarily due to sales of professional color
products, the fiscal 2007 launch of Be Curly shampoo and conditioner and the
acquisition of an independent distributor.  Bumble and bumble sales
benefited from a new hotel amenities program, sales growth in its existing
salon distribution and new points of distribution.  Excluding the impact
of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 17%.

Geographic Regions

Net sales in the Americas increased 3%, or $114.5 million, to $3,560.9
million.  The increase was led by growth in the United States of
approximately $152 million from our makeup artist brands, our hair care business,
our internet distribution and the fiscal 2007 launch of the Unforgivable
fragrance by Sean John.  Partially offsetting this growth was
approximately $90 million related to weaknesses in our core brands as a result
of competitive pressures and retailer consolidations.  Net sales growth in
Canada, Latin America and Mexico contributed an additional $31 million to the
increase.  The fiscal 2006 results reflected an incremental provision of
approximately $16 million for returns that were anticipated at that time as a
result of then-announced store closings from retailer consolidations.

In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 16%,
or $345.7 million, to $2,493.4 million, including an exchange rate benefit due
to the weakening of the U.S. dollar of approximately $122 million.  The
growth in the region reflected higher net sales of approximately $260 million
in the United Kingdom, our travel retail business, Russia, Germany and Spain,
with all benefiting from an improving retail environment, and in Turkey, where
we acquired a distributor.  On a local
currency basis, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa
increased 10%.

Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 13%, or $113.5 million, to $983.2
million.  The growth in this region reflected higher net sales of
approximately $86 million in Korea, China, Hong Kong and Australia.  These markets benefited from an improved
economy across the region while China’s growth in net sales primarily reflected
our continued strategic expansion in this country.  We also experienced modest sales growth in
Japan, our largest market in this region.  Excluding the impact of foreign
currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 11%.

We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market,
which may account for differences in regional sales growth.

COST OF
SALES

Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 25.2% as
compared with 26.1% in fiscal 2006.  Cost of sales as a percentage of net
sales reflected a favorable change in the mix of our business of approximately
40 basis points, a decrease in the level and timing of promotional activities
of approximately 20 basis points, the effect of exchange rate translation of
approximately 20 basis points and a decrease in obsolescence charges of
approximately 10 basis points.  Certain of these items reflect savings
achieved during fiscal 2007 from our cost savings initiative, which commenced
during fiscal 2006.

Since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost
of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional
calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,
fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage.  In addition, future cost of
sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and
product cost structures different from those of our existing brands.

OPERATING
EXPENSES

Operating expenses improved to 64.1% of net sales as compared with
64.3% of net sales in fiscal 2006.  During fiscal 2006, we recorded a
$92.1 million charge to operating expenses related to the implementation of our
cost savings initiative that negatively impacted our operating expense margin
by approximately 140 basis points.  Partially offsetting this improvement
was an increase of approximately 50 basis points in selling, general and
administrative expenses reflecting higher demonstration, field selling and
training costs in support of our business. 
In fiscal 2007, our operating expense margin was negatively impacted by
approximately 40 basis points resulting from expenses related to our pharmacy
channel for organizational costs, costs to streamline the distribution of
goods, and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.  An increase in costs incurred related to the
implementation of SMI and higher stock-based compensation expenses lowered our
operating expense margin by approximately 20 additional basis points, combined.
 Overall operating expenses reflected savings achieved during fiscal 2007
from our cost savings initiative, which commenced during fiscal 2006.

Changes in advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from
the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and
rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized.

Due to the growth in net sales and the decreases in our cost of sales
and operating expense margins as previously discussed, operating income
increased 21%, or $130.3 million, to $749.9 million as compared with fiscal
2006.  Operating margins were 10.7% of net sales as compared with 9.6% in
fiscal 2006, which was negatively impacted by 1.4% of net sales as a result of
the special charge related to our cost savings initiative.

The following discussions of Operating Results by

Product Categories

and

Geographic Regions

exclude the impact of
special charges related to our cost savings initiative of $1.1 million and
$92.1 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.  We believe the following analysis of operating results
better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  See
Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Product Categories

Fragrance operating results increased over 100%, or $20.4 million, to
$28.1 million, as profits from higher international net sales and lower
spending at certain of our core brands in the United States more than offset
spending behind new and developing brands.  Hair care operating results
grew 60%, or $16.0 million, to $42.5 million as the increase in net sales
outpaced increased spending in support of new distribution points and product
launches.  Operating results increased 3%, or $9.9 million, to $339.3
million in makeup, primarily as a result of higher net sales and profits from
our makeup artist brands, which more than offset challenges among certain core
brands.  Skin care operating results decreased 1%, or $4.9 million, to
$341.5 million.  The results in this
product category were negatively impacted in fiscal 2007 by charges related to
our pharmacy channel.  We recorded
approximately $30 million for organizational costs, costs to streamline the
distribution of goods, and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible
assets.  In addition, improvements in
international skin care results were partially offset by challenges in certain
core brands in the United States.

Geographic Regions

Operating income in the Americas decreased 2%, or $7.7 million, to
$336.4 million, reflecting spending behind strategic initiatives at our core
brands, retailer consolidation and costs to develop new brands in the United
States.  Operating income growth from our makeup artist brands, hair care
business and our internet distribution partially offset these results.

In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income
increased 8%, or $23.9 million, to $321.4 million primarily due to higher
results of approximately $49 million from our travel retail business, the
United Kingdom, Russia and Germany.  Lower results from France partially
offset these improvements by approximately $10 million.  The fiscal 2007 operating results in France
reflected the rebalancing of inventory levels at certain retailers as well as
strategic investment spending behind the field sales force.  During fiscal 2007, the region was negatively
impacted by the charges discussed above related to our pharmacy channel,
partially offset by modest combined operating income growth from the remaining
affiliates in this region.

In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 33%, or $23.1 million, to
$93.2 million.  This increase reflected improved results of approximately
$23 million in Hong Kong, China, Australia and Korea.

INTEREST
EXPENSE, NET

Net interest expense was $38.9 million as compared with $23.8 million
in fiscal 2006.  This change primarily resulted from higher average debt
balances, primarily associated with the funding of our accelerated share
repurchase program, and higher average interest rates.  Also contributing
to the increase was reduced interest income generated from lower average
investment balances internationally, partially offset by higher average
investment rates.  These increases were
partially offset by the capitalization of interest expense on internally
developed software in connection with the upgrade of our information systems.

PROVISION
FOR INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and
local income taxes.  The effective rate differs from statutory rates due
to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and
certain nondeductible expenses.  Our effective tax rate will change from
year to year based on non-recurring and recurring factors including, but not
limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state
and local taxes, tax audit settlements and the interaction of various global
tax strategies.  The effective rate for income taxes for the year ended June 30,
2007 was 35.9% as compared with 43.6% in fiscal 2006.  The decrease in the
effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the fiscal 2006 effect
of the IRS tax settlement of approximately 770 basis points.

DISCONTINUED
OPERATIONS

On September 30, 2005, we committed to a plan to sell and on April 10,
2006, we completed the sale of certain assets and operations of our reporting
unit that marketed and sold Stila brand products.  For the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2007, $0.5 million, net of tax, of operating income was
reflected as discontinued operations, reflecting the conclusion of transitional
distribution services provided to the purchaser.  The fiscal 2006 charge
of $80.3 million, net of tax, reflected the then-anticipated loss on the sale
of the business of $69.9 million, net of tax, and the operating loss of $10.4
million, net of tax.

NET EARNINGS

Net earnings as compared with fiscal 2006 increased $205.0 million to
$449.2 million and diluted net earnings per common share improved 93% from
$1.12 to $2.16.  Net earnings from
continuing operations as compared with fiscal 2006 increased by $124.2 million,
or 38%, to $448.7 million and diluted net earnings per common share from
continuing operations increased 45% from $1.49 to $2.16.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from
operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings
from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines
provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad.  At June 30, 2008, we had cash and cash
equivalents of $401.7 million compared with $253.7 million at June 30,
2007.

At June 30, 2008, our outstanding borrowings were as follows:

We have a $750.0 million commercial paper program under which we may
issue commercial paper in the United States. 
Our commercial paper is currently rated A-1 by Standard & Poor’s
and P-1 by Moody’s.  Our long-term credit
ratings are A with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A2 with a
stable outlook by Moody’s.  At June 30,
2008, we had $83.9 million of commercial paper outstanding, which we may
refinance on a periodic basis as it matures at then-prevailing market interest
rates.  We also have $209.9 million in
additional uncommitted credit facilities, of which $28.5 million was used as of
June 30, 2008.

- 32 -

Table

We have an undrawn $750.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit
facility that expires on April 26, 2012. 
This facility may be used primarily to provide credit support for our
commercial paper program, to repurchase shares of our common stock and for
general corporate purposes.  Up to the
equivalent of $250 million of the credit facility is available for
multi-currency loans.  The interest rate
on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of
prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative
agent, or ½% plus the Federal funds rate. 
We incurred costs of approximately $0.3 million to establish the
facility which will be amortized over the term of the facility.  The credit facility has an annual fee of $0.4
million, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings.  As of June 30, 2008, we were in
compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants,
including limitations on indebtedness and liens.

In July 2007, we acquired Ojon Corporation.  As part of the purchase price, we issued (i) a
promissory note due July 31, 2009 with a notional value of $7.0 million
(present value of $7.4 million at June 30, 2008), bearing interest at
10.00% due at maturity and (ii) a promissory note due August 31, 2012
with a notional amount of $13.5 million (present value of $15.7 million at June 30,
2008), bearing interest at 10.00% payable annually on July 31.  The notes due in 2009 and 2012 were recorded
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at present value using effective
rates of 5.11% and 5.42%, respectively.

We have a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial
institution pursuant to which we may borrow up to $150.0 million in the form of
loan participation notes through one of our subsidiaries in Europe.  The interest rate on borrowings under this
agreement is at an all-in fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by
us at the date of each borrowing.  At June 30,
2008, no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement.  Debt issuance costs incurred related to this
agreement were de minimis.

We have an overdraft borrowing agreement with a financial institution
pursuant to which our subsidiary in Turkey may be credited to satisfy
outstanding negative daily balances arising from its business operations.  The total balance outstanding at any time
shall not exceed 20.0 million Turkish lira. 
The interest rate applicable to each such credit shall be 40 basis
points per annum above the spot rate charged by the lender or the lender’s
floating call rate agreed to by us at each borrowing.  There were no debt issuance costs incurred
related to this agreement.  The
outstanding balance at June 30, 2008 ($13.1 million at the exchange rate
at June 30, 2008) is classified as short-term debt in our consolidated
balance sheet.  Subsequent to June 30,
2008, this facility was increased to 30.0 million Turkish lira and the interest
rate spread on borrowings was increased to 55 basis points per annum.

We have a 3.0 billion yen
revolving credit facility that expires on March 24, 2009.  The interest rate on borrowings under the
credit facility is based on TIBOR (Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate) and a 10 basis
point facility fee is incurred on the undrawn balance.  At June 30, 2008, no borrowings were
outstanding under this facility.

Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working
capital needs vary.  From time to time,
we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional
funding.  To the extent that these needs
exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue
commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving
credit facilities.

Total debt as a percent
of total capitalization was 42% at June 30, 2008 and 48% at June 30,
2007.

The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall
operating results in recent years. 
Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling
prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases, which
have been moderate.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that
cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access
to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business
operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, stock
repurchases, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term
and long-term basis.

Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating activities was $690.1
million, $661.6 million and $709.8 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.  The increase in fiscal
2008 as compared with fiscal 2007 primarily reflected a higher level of cash
generated from net earnings before non-cash items such as depreciation,
amortization and stock-based compensation. 
Approximately $91 million of the change in deferred income taxes was
offset by a correlative change in noncurrent accrued income taxes reflecting
the balance sheet presentation of unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 9 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).  These changes were partially offset by the
timing and level of payments on trade payables in North America and higher
accounts receivable levels, primarily reflecting the continuing significant
sales growth from our international operations, which carry longer customer
payment terms.

The net decrease in operating cash flows from fiscal
2006 to fiscal 2007 reflected higher domestic and international inventory
levels primarily driven by growth in new and emerging international markets,
increased regulatory requirements and the building of safety stock for the
implementation of SAP as part of our Strategic Modernization Initiative at our
Aveda manufacturing facility.  In
addition, the decrease in operating cash flows reflected higher accounts
receivable balances, primarily related to significant sales growth from our
international operations.  Cash flows
were also impacted by cash payments made during fiscal 2007 related to our
fiscal 2006 cost savings initiative. 
Partially offsetting the decrease was an improvement in cash generated
from net earnings from continuing operations.

- 33 -


Net cash used for investing activities was $478.5 million, $373.8
million and $303.2 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006.  The increase during fiscal 2008 primarily
reflected cash payments related to the acquisition of Ojon Corporation and the
exclusive rights to sell and distribute Ojon products worldwide, and to a
lesser extent, the acquisition of an Aveda distributor.  Capital expenditures also increased from the
prior year reflecting incremental spending for counters and the higher costs of
technology related to our continuing company-wide initiative to upgrade our
information systems.  The increase in
cash flows used for investing activities from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007
primarily reflected capital expenditures, which reflected our company-wide
initiative to upgrade our information systems, as well as store improvements
and counter construction.  Fiscal 2007
investing activities also reflected the purchase of the remaining equity
interest in Bumble and Bumble Products, LLC and Bumble and Bumble, LLC, as well
as the acquisition of businesses engaged in the wholesale distribution and
retail sale of our products in the United States and other countries.

Cash used for financing activities was $78.1 million,
$411.6 million and $594.6 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.  The fiscal 2008
improvement in cash used for financing activities primarily reflected higher
treasury stock repurchases in the prior year, which were partially funded by
the issuance of long-term debt.  Also
contributing to the change in net cash used for financing activities was an
increase in outstanding commercial paper, partially offset by lower cash
inflows from stock option exercises.  The
improvement in cash flows used for financing activities from fiscal 2006 to
fiscal 2007 reflected a net increase in short-term and long-term borrowings and
an increase in proceeds from employee stock transactions, partially offset by
increases in treasury stock repurchases and an increase in dividends paid to
stockholders.

Dividends

On November 9, 2007, the Board of
Directors declared an annual dividend of $.55 per share on our Class A and
Class B Common Stock, of which an aggregate of $106.6 million was paid on December 27,
2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2007.  The annual common stock dividend declared
during fiscal 2007 was $.50 per share, of which an aggregate of $103.6 million
was paid on December 27, 2006 to stockholders of record at the close of
business on December 8, 2006.

Pension Plan Funding
and Expense

We maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our full-time
employees for our U.S. operations and a majority of our international
operations.  Several plans provide
pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees’ earnings.  In the United States, we maintain a
trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (“U.S.
Qualified Plan”).  Additionally, we have
an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide
benefits in excess of statutory limitations. 
Our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and
defined contribution plans.

Several factors influence our annual funding requirements.  For the U.S. Qualified Plan, our funding
policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan
benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages.  Such contribution is not less than the
minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA”), and subsequent pension legislation, and is not more than the maximum
amount deductible for income tax purposes. 
For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by
local laws and regulations.  In addition,
amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary
depending on estimated assumptions (as detailed in “

Critical
Accounting Polices and Estimates

”). 
The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will
depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the
number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment
performance and funding decisions.

For fiscal 2008 and 2007, there was no minimum contribution to the U.S.
Qualified Plan required by ERISA.  During
the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was
adopted into law in the United States.  Certain provisions of this law
changed the calculation related to the maximum contribution amount deductible
for income tax purposes.  As a result of these provisions, we made
discretionary contributions totaling $25.0 million and $20.0 million to

the
U.S. Qualified Plan

during
fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.  During
fiscal 2009, we expect to make cash contributions totaling approximately $15
million to the U.S. Qualified Plan.

For fiscal 2008 and 2007, we made benefit payments under our
non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of $7.7 million and $5.3
million, respectively.  We expect to make
benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2009 of approximately $7
million.  For fiscal 2008 and 2007, we
made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of
$35.3 million and $24.0 million, respectively. 
We expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2009 of
approximately $46 million.

Commitments and Contingencies

Certain of our business acquisition
agreements include “earn-out” provisions. 
These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers
of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired
business.

Since the size of each payment depends upon
performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will
have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial
condition.

For additional contingencies, refer to

“Item 3.
Legal Proceedings.”

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual
obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of June 30,
2008:

(1)

Includes long-term and short-term debt and the related projected
interest costs, and to a lesser extent, capital lease commitments.  Interest costs on long-term and short-term
debt are projected to be $57.6 million in fiscal 2009, $58.8 million in fiscal
2010, $57.4 million in each of the years from fiscal 2011 through fiscal
2012, $42.5 million in fiscal 2013 and $713.8 million thereafter.  Projected interest costs on variable rate
instruments were calculated using market rates at June 30, 2008.  Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

(2)

Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory
commitments, estimated future earn-out payments, estimated royalty payments
pursuant to license agreements, advertising commitments, capital improvement
commitments, planned funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit
obligations, commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements and
obligations related to our cost savings initiative.  Future earn-out payments and future royalty
and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales
for the term that was in effect at June 30, 2008, without consideration
for potential renewal periods.

(3)

Refer to Note 9 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for
information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we made
a cash payment of $35.0 million to the U.S. Treasury as an advance deposit,
which is not reflected as a reduction to the $75.7 million.  As of
June 30, 2008, the noncurrent portion of our unrecognized tax benefits,
including related accrued interest and penalties was $177.3 million.  At this time, the settlement period for the
noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued
interest and penalties, cannot be determined and therefore was not included.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
Activities

We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of
risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  We primarily enter into foreign currency
forward and option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign
currency exchange rates.  We also enter
into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating
interest rates.  We categorize these
instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.

For each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain
special hedge accounting treatment, we formally document the relationship
between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as well as its risk-management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being
hedged, how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged
risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of
the method of measuring ineffectiveness. 
This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as
fair-value, cash-flow, or foreign-currency hedges to specific assets and
liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted
transactions.  We also formally assess,
both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives
that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting
changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.  If it is determined that a derivative is not
highly effective, then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with
respect to that derivative prospectively.

- 35 -

Table
of Contents

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated
transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign
currencies, for periods consistent with our identified exposures.  The purpose of the hedging activities is to
minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the
cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries.  The majority of foreign currency forward
contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are
with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major
rating agency.  We also enter into foreign
currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a
high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.  The foreign currency forward and option
contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated
as cash-flow hedges.  Hedge effectiveness
of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative
methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the
spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.  Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency
option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.  The ineffective portion of both foreign
currency forward and option contracts is recorded in current-period earnings.  For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed
highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses
accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings when the
underlying forecasted transaction occurs. 
If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur,
then any gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are
reclassified to current-period earnings. 
As of June 30, 2008, these cash-flow hedges were highly effective,
in all material respects.

As a matter of policy, we
only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an “A” (or
equivalent) credit rating.  The
counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.  We do not have significant exposure to any
one counterparty.  Our exposure to credit
loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to
only the recognized, but not realized, gains attributable to the
contracts.  Management believes risk of
default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be
material to the consolidated financial results. 
The contracts have varying maturities through the end of June 2009.  Costs associated with entering into such
contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results.  We do not utilize derivative financial instruments
for trading or speculative purposes.

At June 30, 2008, we had foreign currency forward contracts and
option contracts in the amount of $1,229.0 million and $64.9 million,
respectively.  The foreign currencies
included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S.
dollars) are principally the Euro ($221.6 million), British pound ($220.7
million), Swiss franc ($206.5 million), Canadian dollar ($130.0 million),
Australian dollar ($91.8 million), Russian ruble ($71.9 million) and Japanese
yen ($64.4 million).  The foreign
currencies included in foreign currency option contracts (notional value stated
in U.S. dollars) are principally the Canadian dollar ($36.8 million) and the
South Korean won ($23.1 million).

Interest Rate Risk Management

We enter into interest
rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest
rates on our funded indebtedness and anticipated issuance of debt for periods
consistent with the identified exposures. 
All interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial
institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency.

We have interest rate
swap agreements, with a notional amount totaling $250.0 million, to effectively
convert the fixed rate interest on our 2017 Senior Notes to variable interest
rates based on six-month LIBOR.  The interest rate swaps were designated
as fair-value hedges.  As of June 30,
2008, these fair-value hedges were highly effective, in all material respects.

Market Risk

We use a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of our
derivative financial instruments. 
Value-at-risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or
portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period
and confidence level.  We estimate
value-at-risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model
with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250-day
period.  The measured value-at-risk,
calculated as an average, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008
related to our foreign exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was
$11.3 million and $20.0 million, respectively.

The model estimates were made assuming normal
market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level.  We used a statistical simulation model that
valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly
generated market price paths.

Our calculated value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of
reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of
derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future
market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or
may not occur.  It does not represent the
maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future
gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual
fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and
changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.

We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the
effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for
which the derivative financial instrument was intended.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions,
obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be
expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial
condition or results of operations.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”), to clarify the definition of fair value,
establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand the disclosures on
fair value measurements.  SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date
(an exit price).  SFAS No. 157 also stipulates that, as a
market-based measurement, fair value measurement should be determined based on
the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (a) market
participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs) and (b) the
reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
(unobservable inputs).

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-1, “Application
of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other
Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of
Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13.”  This FSP amends SFAS No. 157 to exclude
certain leasing transactions accounted for under previously existing accounting
guidance.  However, this scope exception
does not apply to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination, regardless of whether those assets and liabilities are related to
leases.

SFAS No. 157 becomes effective for us in the beginning of fiscal
2009.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of SFAS No. 157
on our consolidated financial statements. 
In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-2, “Effective
Date for FASB Statement No. 157.”  This FSP permits the delayed
application of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities, as defined in this FSP, except for those that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements at least annually, until
the beginning of our fiscal 2010.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS No. 159”),
to permit all entities to choose to elect, at specified election dates, to
measure eligible financial instruments at fair value.  An entity shall
report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has
been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date, and recognize upfront
costs and fees related to those items in earnings as incurred and not
deferred.  SFAS No. 159 applies to fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007, with early adoption permitted for an entity that has also elected to
apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157.  An entity is prohibited from
retrospectively applying SFAS No. 159, unless it chooses early
adoption.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of
SFAS No. 159 on our consolidated financial statements, if any, when it
becomes effective in the beginning of fiscal 2009.

In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS
No. 141(R)”).  SFAS No. 141(R) replaces
SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” however, it retains the fundamental
requirements of the former Statement that the acquisition method of accounting
(previously referred to as the purchase method) be used for all business
combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business
combination.  SFAS No. 141(R) defines
the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in
the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that
the acquirer achieves control.  Among
other requirements, SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a
business combination to recognize the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities
assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their
acquisition-date fair values, with limited exceptions; acquisition-related
costs generally will be expensed as incurred. 
SFAS No. 141(R) requires certain financial statement
disclosures to enable users to evaluate and understand the nature and financial
effects of the business combination.  SFAS No. 141(R) must be
applied prospectively to business combinations that are consummated on or after
July 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of
ARB No. 51” (“SFAS No. 160”) to establish accounting and reporting
standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary.  Among
other requirements, SFAS No. 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest
in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is to be
reported as a separate component of equity in the consolidated financial
statements.  SFAS No. 160 also
requires consolidated net income to include the amounts attributable to both
the parent and the noncontrolling interest and to disclose those amounts on the
face of the consolidated statement of income. 
SFAS No. 160 must be applied prospectively for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning in our fiscal 2010, except
for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will be applied
retrospectively for all periods presented.

In December 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus
reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 07-1, “Collaborative
Arrangements,” (“EITF No. 07-1”). 
This EITF addresses accounting for collaborative arrangement activities
that are conducted without the creation of a separate legal entity for the arrangement.  Revenues and costs incurred with third
parties in connection with the collaborative arrangement should be presented
gross or net by the collaborators pursuant to the guidance in EITF 99-19, “Reporting
Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent,” and other applicable
accounting literature.  Payments to or
from collaborators should be presented in the income statement based on the
nature of the arrangement, the nature of the company’s business and whether the
payments are within the scope of other accounting literature.  Other detailed information related to the
collaborative arrangement is also required to be disclosed.  The requirements under this EITF must be applied
to collaborative arrangements in existence at the beginning of our fiscal 2010
using a modified version of retrospective application.  We are currently evaluating the impact the
provisions of EITF No. 07-1 will have on our consolidated financial
statements.

In March 2008,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities – an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“SFAS No. 161”).  SFAS No. 161 requires companies to
provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using
derivative instruments, quantitative disclosures of the fair values and gains
and losses of these derivative instruments in a tabular format, as well as more
information about liquidity by requiring disclosure of a derivative contract’s
credit-risk-related contingent features. 
SFAS No. 161 also requires cross-referencing within footnotes to
enable financial statement users to locate important information about
derivative instruments.  We are currently
evaluating the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 161.  As this is a disclosure-only standard, we do
not anticipate an impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result
of its adoption.  SFAS No. 161
becomes effective for our March 2009 interim consolidated financial
statements.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, “Determination
of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets.” 
This FSP amends the factors that should be considered in developing
renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a
recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”). 
This FSP also adds certain disclosures to those already prescribed in
SFAS No. 142.  FSP No. FAS
142-3 becomes effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
fiscal years, beginning in our fiscal 2010.  The guidance for determining useful lives must
be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective
date.  The disclosure requirements must
be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of the
effective date.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 03-6-1, “Determining
Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are
Participating Securities.”  This FSP
provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are
participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings
per share pursuant to the two-class method. 
This FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those
years.  Upon adoption, a company is
required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data (including any
amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial
data) to conform with the provisions in this FSP.  Early application of this FSP is
prohibited.  We do not issue share-based
payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend
equivalents.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

We and our representatives from time to time make written or oral
forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this and other
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and
in our reports to stockholders.  The
words and phrases “will likely result,” “expect,” “believe,” “planned,” “may,” “should,”
“could,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “forecast” or similar

our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial
performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new geographic
regions, information systems initiatives, new methods of sale and future
operations or operating results. 
Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable
assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations,
actual results may differ materially from our expectations.  Factors that could cause actual results to
differ from expectations include, without limitation:

(1) increased competitive activity from companies in the skin
care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses, some of which have greater
resources than we do;

(2) our ability to develop, produce and market new products on
which future operating results may depend and to successfully address
challenges in our core brands, including gift with purchase, and in our fragrance
business;

(3) consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and
reorganizations in the retail industry causing a decrease in the number of
stores that sell our products, an increase in the ownership concentration
within the retail industry, ownership of retailers by our competitors or
ownership of competitors by our customers that are retailers;

the cost and availability of capital which we may need for new equipment,
facilities or acquisitions, the cost and availability of raw materials and the

costs resulting from disruptions of operations at any of the facilities that
manufacture nearly all of our supply of a particular type of product (i.e., focus
factories) or at our distribution or inventory centers, including disruptions
that may be caused by the implementation of SAP as part of our Strategic
Modernization Initiative;

reporting during this period.

Stock available for issuance under each plan, respectively (subject to the
approval by the Stock Plan Subcommittee of the Company’s Board of Directors of
expected payouts for PSUs vested as of June 30, 2008).  Shares underlying grants cancelled or
forfeited under the 1999 Plan may be used for grants under the 2002 Plan.  Shares underlying grants cancelled or
forfeited under the 1996 Plan may be used for grants under the 1999 Plan or the
2002 Plan.  The Non-Employee Director
Share Incentive Plan provides for an annual grant of options and a grant of
either options or stock units to non-employee directors.  As of June 30, 2008, there were 285,715
shares available for issuance under the Director Plan.

Common Stock as of June 30, 2008, the total shares of Common Stock
outstanding (i.e., Class A plus Class B) would increase 15% to
223,632,232.  Of the outstanding options
to purchase 20,307,221 shares of Class A Common Stock, options in respect
of 14,057,369 shares are exercisable at a price less than $46.45, the closing
price on June 30, 2008.  Assuming

Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

Management
of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (including its subsidiaries) (the “Company”)
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules13a-15(f) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Under
the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company’s management conducted an
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

, issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, the Company’s
management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2008, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

The
Estée Lauder Companies Inc.:

We
have audited The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.’s (the “Company”) internal control
over financial reporting as of June 30, 2008, based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audit also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In
our opinion, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,
2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2008 and
2007, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity
and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended June 30, 2008, and our report dated August 21,
2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

The
Estée Lauder Companies Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Estée Lauder
Companies Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2008 and
2007, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity
and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended June 30, 2008. 
In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements,
we also have audited the financial statement schedule as listed on the index on
page F-1.  These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company’s management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Estée Lauder
Companies Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2008 and 2007, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended June 30, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.  Also in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2008, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and
our report dated August 21, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

As
discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, effective July 1,
2006, the Company changed their method for quantifying errors based on SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements,”  and effective June 30,
2007, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 158,
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).”  Also as discussed in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements, effective July 1, 2007, the Company
adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.”

Kiton, Donna Karan, Michael Kors, Sean John, Missoni, Daisy Fuentes, Tom Ford
and Mustang brand names for fragrances and/or cosmetics.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”)
as continuing operations, with the exception of the operating results of its
reporting unit that marketed and sold Stila brand products, which have been
reflected as discontinued operations for fiscal 2007 and 2006 (see Note
7).  All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of prior years
have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation for comparative
purposes.

Management Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses reported in those financial statements.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates and assumptions.

Currency Translation and Transactions

All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are
translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are
translated at weighted average rates of exchange for the year.  Unrealized translation gains or losses are
reported as cumulative translation adjustments through other comprehensive
income.  Such adjustments amounted to
$98.3 million, $53.1 million and $27.0 million of unrealized translation gains
in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts
to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its

Inventory and Promotional Merchandise

Inventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory
considered saleable or usable in future periods, and is stated at the lower of
cost or fair-market value, with cost being determined on the first-in,
first-out method.  Cost components
include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect
labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and
warehousing) as well as inbound freight. 
Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the
merchandise is shipped to the Company’s customers.  Included in inventory and promotional
merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the
difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable
value, based on various product sales projections.  This reserve is calculated using an estimated
obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical
trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.  In addition, and as necessary, specific
reserves for future known or anticipated events may be established.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” (“SFAS No. 133”) as
amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. 
SFAS No. 133 also requires the recognition of all derivative
instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they
be measured at fair value.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other
improvements that extend an asset’s useful life or productive capabilities, are
carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  The cost of assets related to projects in
progress of $129.0 million and $72.1 million as of June 30, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, is included in their respective asset categories in Note 5.  For financial statement purposes,
depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 40 years.  Leasehold improvements are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or
the expected useful lives of those improvements.

Investments

Under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities” (“SFAS No. 115”), available-for-sale securities are
recorded at market value.  Unrealized
holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on available-for-sale
securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of
stockholders’ equity until realized.  The
Company’s investments subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 115 are
treated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, the applicable investments have
been adjusted to market value with a corresponding adjustment, net of tax, to
net unrealized investment gains in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Accumulated other comprehensive income
includes an unrealized investment gain (net of deferred taxes) of $0.3 million
and $0.8 million at June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141”) and SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”). 
These statements establish financial accounting and reporting standards
for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets.  Specifically, the standards address how
acquired intangible assets should be accounted for both at the time of
acquisition and after they have been recognized in the financial statements.  In accordance with SFAS No. 142,
intangible assets, including purchased goodwill, must be evaluated for
impairment.  Those intangible assets that
will continue to be classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with
indefinite lives are no longer amortized.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the impairment testing is
performed in two steps: (i) the Company determines impairment by comparing
the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if
there is an impairment, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss by
comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that
goodwill.  To determine fair value, the
Company relies on three valuation models: guideline public companies,
acquisition analysis and discounted cash flow. 
For goodwill valuation purposes only, the revised fair value of a
reporting unit is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the business unit
to arrive at an implied fair value of goodwill, based upon known facts and
circumstances, as if the acquisition occurred at that time.

Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of the assets in question may not be recoverable.  An impairment would be recorded in
circumstances where expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual
disposition of an asset are less than the carrying value of that asset.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and distributor of
skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.  Domestic and international sales are made
primarily to department stores, perfumeries and specialty retailers.  The Company grants credit to all qualified
customers and does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue
concentration of credit risk.

During fiscal 2006, Federated Department Stores, Inc. acquired The
May Department Stores Company, resulting in the merger of the Company’s
previous two largest customers (collectively “Macy’s, Inc.”).  This customer sells products primarily within
North America and accounted for $951.4 million, or 12%, $958.8 million, or 14%,
and $1,005.8 million, or 16%, of the Company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  This
customer accounted for $109.2 million, or 11%, and $105.3 million, or 12%, of
the Company’s accounts receivable at June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership,
including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss
related to those goods.  In the Americas
region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to
the customer and in the Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific
regions sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt.  In certain circumstances, transfer of title
takes place at the point of sale, for example, at the Company’s retail
stores.  Sales at the Company’s retail
stores and online are recognized in accordance with a traditional 4-4-5 retail
calendar, where each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4-week periods and one
5-week period, with one extra week in one quarter every seven years.  As a result, the retail quarter-end and the
fiscal quarter-end may be different by up to six days.

Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by
deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received,
discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for
anticipated product returns.  The Company’s
practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly
requested, authorized and approved.  In
accepting returns, the Company typically provides a credit to the retailer against
accounts receivable from that retailer. 
As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 4.4%, 4.2% and 5.0% in
fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Payments
to Customers

The Company is subject to the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) Issue No. 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor
to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products).”  In accordance with this guidance, the Company
has recorded the revenues generated from purchase with purchase promotions as
sales and the costs of its purchase with purchase and gift with purchase
promotions as cost of sales.  Certain
other incentive arrangements require the payment of a fee to customers based on
their attainment of pre-established sales levels.  These fees have been recorded as a reduction
of Net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were
not material to the results of operations in any period presented.

The
Company enters into transactions related to advertising, product promotions and
demonstrations, some of which involve cooperative relationships with
customers.  These activities may be
arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the
customer.  The Company’s share of the
cost of these transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected
in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of earnings and were approximately $1,098 million, $978
million and $912 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Advertising and Promotion

Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling and
promotion were $2,034.6 million, $1,841.9 million and $1,721.1 million in
fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are expensed as incurred.  These amounts include activities relating to
purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in
net sales and cost of sales.  Excluding
the impact of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions,
advertising, merchandising, sampling and promotion expenses included in
operating expenses were $1,836.1 million, $1,640.9 million and $1,514.3 million
in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Research and Development

Research and development costs amounted to $80.9 million, $74.4 million
and $72.0 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Research and development costs are expensed
as incurred.

Operating Leases

The Company recognizes rent expense from operating leases with periods
of free and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the
applicable lease term.  The Company
considers lease renewals in the useful life of its leasehold improvements when
such renewals are reasonably assured. 
From time to time, the Company may receive capital improvement funding
from its lessors.  These amounts are
recorded as deferred liabilities and amortized over the remaining lease term as
a reduction of rent expense.

License Arrangements

The Company’s license agreements provide the Company with worldwide
rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or
particular categories thereof) using the licensors’ trademarks.  The licenses typically have an initial term
of approximately 3 years to 11 years, and are renewable subject to the Company’s
compliance with the license agreement provisions.  The remaining terms, including the potential
renewal periods, range from approximately 2 years to 22 years.  Under each license, the Company is required
to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to
third parties.

Most of the Company’s
licenses were entered into to create new business.  In some cases, the Company acquired, or
entered into, a license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a
pre-existing beauty products business. 
In those cases, intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over
their useful lives based on the terms of the agreement and are subject to
impairment testing if certain events or circumstances indicate a potential
impairment.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with
SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”).  This statement requires that all stock-based
compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that
such cost be measured at the fair value of the award.  SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that
excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises be reflected as financing
cash inflows instead of operating cash inflows.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes,” as amended. 
This statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards
for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise’s activities
during the current and preceding years. 
It requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and
reporting of income taxes.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”).  FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements
in accordance with SFAS No. 109. 
FIN 48 prescribes a two-step evaluation process for tax positions taken,
or expected to be taken, in a tax return. 
The first step is recognition and the second is measurement.  FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
measurement, classification, disclosures, transition and accounting for interim
periods.  In May 2007, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FIN 48-1, “Definition of Settlement
in FASB Interpretation No. 48, an amendment of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FSP No. FIN 48-1”).  FSP No. FIN 48-1 provides guidance on
how to determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose
of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits.  The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48,
as amended, effective July 1, 2007.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”), to clarify the definition of fair value,
establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand the disclosures on
fair value measurements.  SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date
(an exit price).  SFAS No. 157 also stipulates that, as a
market-based measurement, fair value measurement should be determined based on
the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (a) market
participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs) and (b) the
reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
(unobservable inputs).

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-1, “Application
of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other
Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of
Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13.”  This FSP amends SFAS No. 157 to exclude
certain leasing transactions accounted for under previously existing accounting
guidance.  However, this scope exception
does not apply to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination, regardless of whether those assets and liabilities are related to
leases.

SFAS No. 157 becomes effective for the Company in the beginning of
fiscal 2009.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
provisions of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial statements.  In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS
157-2, “Effective Date for FASB Statement No. 157.”  This FSP permits
the delayed application of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities, as defined in this FSP, except for those that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements at least
annually, until the beginning of the Company’s fiscal 2010.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS No. 159”),
to permit all entities to choose to elect, at specified election dates, to
measure eligible financial instruments at fair value.  An entity shall
report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has
been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date, and recognize
upfront costs and fees related to those items in earnings as incurred and not
deferred.  SFAS No. 159 applies to fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007, with early adoption permitted for an entity that has also elected to
apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157.  An entity is prohibited from
retrospectively applying SFAS No. 159, unless it chooses early
adoption.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
provisions of SFAS No. 159 on its consolidated financial statements, if
any, when it becomes effective in the beginning of fiscal 2009.

In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS
No. 141(R)”).  SFAS No. 141(R) replaces
SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” however, it retains the fundamental
requirements of the former Statement that the acquisition method of accounting
(previously referred to as the purchase method) be used for all business
combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business
combination.  SFAS No. 141(R) defines
the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in
the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that
the acquirer achieves control.  Among
other requirements, SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in
a business combination to recognize the identifiable assets acquired,
liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their
acquisition-date fair values, with limited exceptions; acquisition-related
costs generally will be expensed as incurred. 
SFAS No. 141(R) requires certain financial statement
disclosures to enable users to evaluate and understand the nature and financial
effects of the business combination.  SFAS No. 141(R) must be
applied prospectively to business combinations that are consummated on or after
July 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of
ARB No. 51” (“SFAS No. 160”) to establish accounting and reporting
standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary.  Among
other requirements, SFAS No. 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest
in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is to be
reported as a separate component of equity in the consolidated financial
statements.  SFAS No. 160 also
requires consolidated net income to include the amounts attributable to both
the parent and the noncontrolling interest and to disclose those amounts on the
face of the consolidated statement of income. 
SFAS No. 160 must be applied prospectively for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning in the Company’s fiscal
2010, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will be
applied retrospectively for all periods presented.

In December 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus
reached on EITF Issue No. 07-1, “Collaborative Arrangements,” (“EITF No. 07-1”).  This EITF addresses accounting for
collaborative arrangement activities that are conducted without the creation of
a separate legal entity for the arrangement. 
Revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with the
collaborative arrangement should be presented gross or net by the collaborators
pursuant to the guidance in EITF 99-19, “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal
versus Net as an Agent,” and other applicable accounting literature.  Payments to or from collaborators should be
presented in the income statement based on the nature of the arrangement, the
nature of the company’s business and whether the payments are within the scope
of other accounting literature.  Other
detailed information related to the collaborative arrangement is also required
to be disclosed.  The requirements under
this EITF must be applied to collaborative arrangements in existence at the
beginning of the Company’s fiscal 2010 using a modified version of
retrospective application.  The Company
is currently evaluating the impact the provisions of EITF No. 07-1 will
have on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities – an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“SFAS No. 161”).  SFAS No. 161 requires companies to
provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using
derivative instruments, quantitative disclosures of the fair values and gains
and losses of these derivative instruments in a tabular format, as well as more
information about liquidity by requiring disclosure of a derivative contract’s
credit-risk-related contingent features. 
SFAS No. 161 also requires

cross-referencing within
footnotes to enable financial statement users to locate important information
about derivative instruments.  The
Company is currently evaluating the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 161.  As this is a disclosure-only standard, the
Company does not anticipate an impact on the consolidated financial statements
as a result of its adoption.  SFAS No. 161
becomes effective for the March 2009 interim consolidated financial
statements.

In April 2008,
the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of
Intangible Assets.”  This FSP amends the
factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension
assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset
under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”).  This FSP also adds certain disclosures to
those already prescribed in SFAS No. 142. 
FSP No. FAS 142-3 becomes effective for fiscal years, and interim
periods within those fiscal years, beginning in the Company’s fiscal 2010.  The guidance for determining useful lives
must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective
date.  The disclosure requirements must
be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of the effective
date.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 03-6-1, “Determining
Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are
Participating Securities.”  This FSP
provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are
participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings
per share pursuant to the two-class method. 
This FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those
years.  Upon adoption, a company is
required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data (including any
amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected
financial data) to conform with the provisions in this FSP.  Early application of this FSP is
prohibited.  The Company does not issue
share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or
dividend equivalents.

NOTE 3 – STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108, “Considering the Effects
of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements” (“SAB No. 108”), which sets forth the SEC Staff’s
views on the proper methods for quantifying errors when there were uncorrected
errors in a prior year.  Under SAB No. 108, companies should evaluate
a misstatement that existed in prior years based on its impact on the current
year income statement (the “rollover” approach), as well as the cumulative
effect of correcting such misstatements in the current year’s ending balance
sheet (the “iron curtain” approach), or collectively, the “dual” approach.

SAB No. 108 became effective for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30,
2007.  Prior to application of this
guidance, the Company utilized the “rollover” approach to evaluate uncorrected
misstatements and believed the conclusions reached regarding its quantitative
and qualitative assessments of materiality of such items, both individually and
in the aggregate, were appropriate.  In
accordance with the transition guidance set forth in SAB No. 108, the
Company elected to record a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to opening
retained earnings to correct errors in certain balance sheet accounts that
arose in prior years, which previously had been considered immaterial using the
“rollover” approach.

Since the fiscal 1996 acquisition of the Bobbi Brown brand and through
the application of SAB No. 108 on July 1, 2006, the Company made
payments to the sellers based on a percentage of Bobbi Brown sales
internationally, which should have been capitalized as goodwill in accordance
with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” as amended.  These payments were previously recorded as Selling,
general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
earnings.  As such, goodwill increased by
$10.5 million and opening retained earnings increased by $6.7 million, net of
tax, in the accompanying fiscal 2007 consolidated balance sheet.

In connection with the Company’s defined benefit pension obligations,
certain liability amounts were incorrectly reflected on the balance sheet in
years prior to fiscal 2002, the majority of which related to benefit plans for
the Company’s international operations. 
As such, upon initial application of SAB No. 108 on July 1,
2006, other noncurrent liabilities decreased by $8.7 million and opening
retained earnings increased by $5.0 million, net of tax, in the accompanying
fiscal 2007 consolidated balance sheet.

Beginning in years prior to fiscal 2003, inventory valuation was
impacted by the incorrect application of profit in ending inventory partially
offset by the overstatement of inventory obsolescence reserves, culminating in
a fiscal 2007 decrease to inventory of $2.5 million and an opening retained
earnings decrease of $2.0 million, net of tax pursuant to initial application
of SAB No. 108.

In years prior to fiscal 2004 and through the initial application of

NOTE 6 – GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

During fiscal 2008, the Company acquired Ojon Corporation, which
markets and sells Ojon hair care and skin care products primarily through
direct response television and specialty stores.  In conjunction with this acquisition, the
Company purchased, from an unrelated party, the exclusive rights to sell and
distribute Ojon products worldwide.  In
addition, the Company acquired a business engaged in the wholesale distribution
and retail sale of Aveda products and recorded goodwill for earn-out payments
related to the acquisition of the Bobbi Brown brand.  These activities resulted in an increase to
goodwill of $51.9 million and other intangible assets of $85.5 million.

During fiscal 2007, the Company purchased the remaining minority equity
interest in the Bumble and bumble business, recorded additional goodwill related
to payments made in prior years in connection with the acquisition of the Bobbi
Brown brand (see Note 3), and acquired businesses engaged in the wholesale
distribution and retail sale of the Company’s products in the United States and
other countries.  The combined results of
these activities increased goodwill by $20.4 million and other intangible
assets by $47.0 million.  Also during
fiscal 2007, as a result of the Company’s annual impairment testing, the
Company determined that the carrying values of its goodwill and intangible
assets related to the Darphin and Rodan + Fields brands exceeded their
respective fair values.  As such, the
Company reduced its goodwill by $7.3 million and other intangible assets by $4.3
million, which are reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses in
the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

Goodwill

The Company assigns goodwill of a reporting unit to the product
category in which that reporting unit predominantly operates at the time of its
acquisition.  The change in the carrying
amount of goodwill, including the effect of foreign exchange rates is as
follows:

Other Intangible Assets

Other intangible
assets include trademarks and patents, as well as license agreements and other
intangible assets resulting from or related to businesses and assets purchased
by the Company.  Indefinite lived assets
(e.g., trademarks) are not subject to amortization and are evaluated annually
for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances indicate a
potential impairment.  Patents are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the legal term or the
useful life of the patent, approximately 20 years.  Other intangible assets (e.g., non-compete
agreements, customer lists) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
expected period of benefit, approximately 5 years to 14 years.  Intangible assets related to license
agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based
on the term of the respective agreement, currently approximately 10 years to 16
years, and are subject to impairment testing if certain events or circumstances
indicate a potential impairment.

Other intangible assets consist of the following:

NOTE 7 – ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE OF BUSINESSES AND LICENSE
ARRANGEMENTS

During fiscal 2008, the Company acquired Ojon
Corporation.  In conjunction with this
acquisition, the Company purchased, from an unrelated party, the exclusive
rights to sell and distribute Ojon products worldwide.  The initial purchase price, paid at closing,
was funded by cash provided by operations and the issuance of commercial paper
as well as the issuance of two promissory notes, as described in Note 11.  The purchase agreement also provides for an
additional payment, which is expected to be made in fiscal 2013, contingent
upon the attainment of certain net sales targets of Ojon products.

During fiscal 2007, the Company purchased the remaining minority equity
interests in Bumble and Bumble Products, LLC and Bumble and Bumble, LLC, which
have been accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

At various times during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company also
acquired businesses engaged in the wholesale distribution and retail sale of
the Company’s products in the United States and other countries and made
earn-out payments related to the acquisition of the Bobbi Brown brand.

The aggregate cost for these activities, which includes purchase price,
earn-out payments and acquisition costs, was $150.8 million, $61.2 million, and
$51.7 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  The results of operations for each of the
acquired businesses are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements commencing with its date of original acquisition.  Pro forma results of operations have not been
presented, as the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial results would
not have been material.

In
fiscal 2006, the Company completed the sale of certain assets and operations of
the reporting unit that marketed and sold Stila brand products to Stila Corp.
(the “Purchaser”), an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc.  The Company recorded charges of $80.3 million
(net of $43.3 million tax benefit) to discontinued operations, which reflected
the loss on the disposition of the business of $69.9 million, net of tax, and
adjustments to the fair value of assets sold, the costs to dispose of those
assets not acquired by the Purchaser and other costs in connection with the sale.  The charges also included the operating
losses of $10.4 million, net of tax, for fiscal year ended June 30,
2006.  Net sales associated with the
discontinued operations were $45.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2006.

Since fiscal 2007, the Company signed an exclusive agreement to create
fragrances and related products to be sold to Coach Inc., which are available
at Coach retail stores in the United States. 
Also since fiscal 2007, the Company entered into a license agreement
with Ford Motor Company to create a fragrance using the name Mustang.  Since fiscal 2006, the Company developed and
sold fragrance products pursuant to a license agreement with Daisy Fuentes.

Certain license agreements may require minimum royalty
payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending
on advertising and promotional activities. 
Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are earned
while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs
are incurred.

NOTE 8 – COST SAVINGS INITIATIVE

During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded special charges associated with a cost savings initiative that was designed to support its long-term financial objectives.  As part of this multi-faceted initiative, the Company had identified savings opportunities that include streamlined processes and organizational changes.  The principal component of the initiative was a voluntary separation program offered primarily to North America-based employees.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, involuntary separations were communicated to certain employees.  Under this initiative, the Company incurred expenses related to one-time termination benefits for 494 employees, of which 28 were involuntary, which benefits were based principally upon years of service.  Employees designated for separation under the cost savings initiative were separated by June 30, 2007.

In addition, the Company identified other cost savings opportunities to improve efficiencies in the Company’s distribution network and product offerings and to eliminate other nonessential costs.  These charges primarily related to employee severance for facilities that were closed, contract cancellations, counter and door closings and product returns.

For the years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, aggregate expenses of $0.4 million, $1.1 million and $92.1 million, respectively, were recorded as Special charges related to cost savings initiative in the accompanying consolidated
 statements of earnings.  The fiscal 2008 charges were related to employee separation expenses while the 2007 charges were primarily related to facility closings.  At June 30, 2008 and 2007, $4.4 million and $15.4 million, respectively, and $1.8 million and $7.5 million, respectively, related to the cost savings initiative were recorded in Other accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The following table summarizes the cost savings initiative, which impacted the Company’s operating expenses and cost of sales:

NOTE 9 – INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes is comprised of the following:

A
reconciliation between the provision for income taxes computed by applying the
statutory Federal income tax rate to earnings before income taxes and minority
interest and the actual provision for income taxes is as follows:

The
state and local tax benefit of $5.9 million in fiscal 2008 includes the
favorable resolution of several state and local income tax examinations as well
as statute lapses.

On
July 13, 2006, the Company announced a settlement with the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding its examination of the Company’s consolidated
Federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1998
through June 30, 2001.  The
settlement resolved previously disclosed issues raised during the IRS’s
examination, including transfer pricing and foreign tax credit
computations.  The settlement of these
issues resulted in a tax charge of approximately $46 million in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2006 and represents the aggregate earnings impact of the
settlement through fiscal 2006.  In
addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company completed the
repatriation of foreign earnings through intercompany dividends as required
under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “AJCA”).  In connection with the repatriation, the
Company updated the computation of the related aggregate tax impact, resulting
in a favorable adjustment of approximately $11 million.  The tax settlement, coupled with the AJCA
favorable tax adjustment, resulted in a net increase to the Company’s fiscal
2006 income tax provision of approximately $35 million.

Federal
income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately
$813 million of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries at June 30,
2008.  The Company intends to reinvest
these earnings in its foreign operations indefinitely, except where it is able to
repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax
provision.  As of June 30, 2007 and
2006, the Company had not provided federal income and foreign withholding taxes
on approximately $539 million and $336 million, respectively, of undistributed
earnings of international subsidiaries. 
The determination and estimation of the future income tax consequences
in all relevant taxing jurisdictions involves the application of highly complex
tax laws in the countries involved, particularly in the United States, and is
based on the tax profile of the Company in the year of earnings
repatriation.  Accordingly, it is not
practicable to determine the amount of tax associated with such undistributed earnings.

Significant
components of the Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of June 30,
2008 and 2007 were as follows:

As
of June 30, 2008 and 2007, the Company had current net deferred tax assets
of $184.6 million and $124.0 million, respectively, which are included in
Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.  In addition, the Company
had noncurrent net deferred tax assets of $55.3 million as of June 30,
2008 which are included in Other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet and noncurrent net deferred tax liabilities of $16.6 million as
of June 30, 2007 which are included in Other noncurrent liabilities in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

As
of June 30, 2008 and 2007, certain international subsidiaries had tax loss
carryforwards for local tax purposes of approximately $27 million and $11
million, respectively.  With the
exception of $21.6 million of losses with an indefinite carryforward period as
of June 30, 2008, these losses expire at various dates through fiscal
2023.  Deferred tax assets, net of
valuation allowances, in the amount of $4.5 million and $1.2 million as of June 30,
2008 and 2007, respectively, have been recorded to reflect the tax benefits of
the losses not utilized to date.

A
full valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for
which, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Earnings
before income taxes and minority interest include amounts contributed by the
Company’s international operations of approximately $905 million, $696 million
and $603 million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  A portion of these earnings are taxed in the
United States.

The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48, as amended,
effective July 1, 2007.  As a
result, the Company recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized
tax benefits and interest of $13.1 million (after tax), which, as required, was
recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as of July 1, 2007.  The Company elected to continue its
historical practice of classifying applicable interest and penalties as a
component of the provision for income taxes. 
At adoption, the Company had $142.7 million of gross unrecognized tax
benefits.  The Company’s gross accrual
for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was $42.0
million upon adoption of FIN 48.  As of June 30,
2008, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $199.0 million.  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits
that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $119.4 million.  The total gross accrued interest and
penalties during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 in the accompanying
consolidated statement of earnings was $12.0 million and the total gross
accrued interest and penalties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
at June 30, 2008 was $54.0 million. 
As of June 30, 2008, current and noncurrent liabilities have been
increased by $90.8 million, with a correlative increase in current and
noncurrent assets to reflect the Companny’s gross income tax and interest
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as well as related deferred tax
assets.  A reconciliation of the
beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included
in the balance at June 30, 2008 are $31.6 million of tax positions for
which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.  Because of the impact of deferred tax
accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter
deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would
accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.

Earnings
from the Company’s global operations are subject to tax in various
jurisdictions both within and outside the United States.  The Company is routinely audited and examined
in these jurisdictions.  The Company
provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and international
unrecognized tax benefits for periods subject to audit.  The development of reserves for these
exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing,
and is a subjective critical estimate. 
The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all
years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts,
circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.  For those tax positions where it is
more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has
recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood
of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge
of all relevant information.  For those
tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be
sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.  Where applicable, associated interest and
penalties have also been recognized. 
Although the outcome related to these exposures is uncertain, in
management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for
estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.  In certain circumstances, the ultimate
outcome of exposures and risks involve significant uncertainties which render
them inestimable.  If actual outcomes
differ materially from these estimates, including those that cannot be
quantified, they could have a material impact on the Company’s results of
operations.

The Company is currently subject to a U.S. federal tax audit as well as
examinations and controversies in several state, local, and international
jurisdictions.  These matters are in
various stages of completion and involve complex multi-jurisdictional issues
common among multinational enterprises, including transfer pricing, that may
require an extended period of time for resolution.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the
IRS completed the examination phase of fiscal years 2002 through 2005.  The Company has brought disputed adjustments
concerning U.S. foreign tax credit determinations to the Appeals Division of
the IRS for review as well as entered a claim pursuant to an administrative
process of the tax treaty between the U.S. and Belgium (commonly referred to as
the “Competent Authority” process). 
Notwithstanding the matters pending before the Appeals Division and
Competent Authority, the Company has reached a tentative agreement with
the IRS concerning the examination adjustments proposed.  In the fourth quarter, the Company made a
cash payment of $35.0 million to the U.S. Treasury as an advance deposit in
anticipation of a formal resolution to the tentatively agreed-to
adjustments.  Although the advance
deposit limits the accrual of additional interest that would be due to the U.S.
Treasury, there is no impact on the amount of unrecognized tax benefits until a
formal settlement is reached. 
Separately, the IRS has informally advised the Company that it intends
to commence an examination of the fiscal years 2006 and 2007 during the second
quarter of fiscal 2009.

The Company had been notified of a disallowance of tax deductions
claimed by its subsidiary in Spain for the fiscal years 1999 through 2002.  As a result, the subsidiary was reassessed
corporate income tax of $3.3 million for this period, at current exchange
rates.  An appeal against this
reassessment was filed with the Chief Tax Inspector.  On July 18, 2005, the final assessment
made by the Chief Tax Inspector was received, confirming the reassessment made
by the tax auditors.  During fiscal 2006,
an appeal against this final assessment was filed with the Madrid Regional
Economic Administrative Tribunal (“TEAR”). 
In view of the TEAR’s silence, during fiscal 2007 the claim was presumed
to be dismissed and an appeal was filed against it with the Central
Economic-Administrative Tribunal (“TEAC”). 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the TEAC dismissed the claim
and, on June 10, 2008, the Company filed an appeal for judicial review
with the National Appellate Court.  While
no assurance can be given as to the outcome in respect of this assessment and
pending appeal in the Spanish courts, management believes it is
more-likely-than-not that the subsidiary will be successful in its defense
against the assessment and continues to measure the full amount of the tax
benefit.  Accordingly, no tax reserve has
been established for this potential exposure.

During fiscal 2008, the Company concluded various state, local and
foreign income tax audits and examinations while several other matters,
including those noted above, remained pending. 
On the basis of the information available in this regard as of June 30,
2008, it is reasonably possible that a reduction in a range of $30 million to
$60 million of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within 12 months as a result
of projected resolutions of global tax examinations and controversies.

The tax years subject to examination vary depending on the tax

$210.0 million at a weighted average all-in rate of 5.45%.  The forward-starting interest rate swap
agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new debt and the Company
recognized a loss in other comprehensive income of $0.9 million that will be
amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2037 Senior Notes.  As a result of the forward-starting interest
rate swap agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the effective
interest rate on the 2037 Senior Notes will be 6.181% over the life of the
debt.

As of June 30, 2008, the Company had outstanding $197.5 million of
2033 Senior Notes consisting of $200.0 million principal and unamortized debt
discount of $2.5 million.  The 2033

discount of $0.4 million, and a $10.8 million adjustment to reflect the fair
value of outstanding interest rate swaps. The 2017 Senior Notes, when issued in
May 2007, were priced at 99.845% with a yield of 5.570%.  Interest payments are required to be made
semi-annually on May 15 and November 15.  In April 2007, the Company entered into

Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of
$250.0 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its
outstanding 2012 Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on six-month
LIBOR.  In April 2007, the Company
terminated this interest rate swap.  The
instrument, which was classified as a liability, had a fair value of $11.1
million at cash settlement, which included $0.9 million of accrued interest
payable to the counterparty.  Hedge
accounting treatment was discontinued prospectively and the offsetting
adjustment to the carrying amount of the related debt will be amortized to
interest expense over the remaining life of the debt.

In July 2007, the
Company acquired Ojon Corporation.  As
part of the purchase price, the Company issued (i) a promissory note due July 31,
2009 with a notional value of $7.0 million (present value of $7.4 million at June 30,
2008), bearing interest at 10.00% due at maturity and (ii) a promissory
note due August 31, 2012 with a notional amount of $13.5 million (present
value of $15.7 million at June 30, 2008), bearing interest at 10.00%
payable annually on July 31.  The
notes due in 2009 and 2012 were recorded in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet at present value using effective rates of 5.11% and 5.42%,
respectively.

The Company has a $750.0 million commercial paper program under which
it may issue commercial paper in the United States.  The Company’s commercial paper is currently
rated A-1 by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s.  The Company’s long-term credit ratings are A
with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A2 with a stable
outlook by Moody’s.  At June 30,
2008, the Company had $83.9 million of commercial paper outstanding, due at
various dates through July 2008 at an average interest rate of 2.24%,
which may be refinanced on a periodic basis as it matures at then-prevailing
market interest rates.

As of June 30, 2008, the Company had an overdraft borrowing
agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which its subsidiary in
Turkey may be credited to satisfy outstanding negative daily balances arising
from its business operations.  The total
balance outstanding at any time shall not exceed 20.0 million Turkish
lira.  The interest rate applicable to
each such credit shall be 40 basis points per annum above the spot rate charged
by the lender or the lender’s floating call rate agreed to by the Company at
each borrowing.  There were no debt
issuance costs incurred related to this agreement.  The outstanding balance at June 30, 2008
($13.1 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2008) is classified as
short-term debt on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

As of June 30, 2008, the Company had a fixed rate promissory note
agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company may borrow
up to $150.0 million in the form of loan participation notes through one of its
subsidiaries in Europe.  The interest
rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an all-in fixed rate determined
by the lender and agreed to by the Company at the date of each borrowing.  At June 30, 2008, no borrowings were
outstanding under this agreement.  Debt
issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis.

As of June 30, 2008,
the Company had a 3.0 billion yen revolving credit facility that expires on March 24,
2009.  The interest rate on borrowings
under the credit facility is based on TIBOR (Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate) and
a 10 basis point facility fee is incurred on the undrawn balance.  At June 30, 2008, the Company did not
have any borrowings outstanding under this facility.

The Company has an undrawn $750.0 million senior unsecured revolving
credit facility that expires on April 26, 2012.  This facility may be used primarily to
provide credit support for the Company’s commercial paper program, to
repurchase shares of its common stock and for general corporate purposes.  Up to the equivalent of $250 million of the
credit facility is available for multi-currency loans.  The interest rate on borrowings under the
credit facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate
of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or ½% plus the
Federal funds rate.  The Company incurred
costs of approximately $0.3 million to establish the facility which will be amortized
over the term of the facility.  The
credit facility has an annual fee of $0.4 million, payable quarterly, based on
the Company’s current credit ratings. 
The credit facility contains various covenants, including one financial
covenant which requires the Company’s interest expense coverage ratio (as
defined in the facility) at the last day of each fiscal quarter to be greater
than 3.0:1.0.  As of June 30, 2008,
the Company was in compliance with this financial covenant.  There are no other conditions where the
lender’s commitments may be withdrawn, other than certain events of default, as
defined in the facility, which are customary for facilities of this type.

NOTE 12 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled
program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial
instruments.  The Company primarily
enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce the effects
of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. 
The Company, if necessary, enters into interest rate derivatives to
manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company’s aggregate
liability portfolio.  The Company
categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.

All derivatives are recognized at their fair value and are included in
Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other accrued

liabilities
in the accompanying balance sheets.  The
associated gains and losses on these derivatives are recorded in Cost of sales
and Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements
of earnings.  On the date the derivative
contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (i) a
hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an
unrecognized firm commitment (“fair-value” hedge), (ii) a hedge of a
forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or
paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash-flow” hedge), (iii) a
foreign-currency fair-value or cash-flow hedge (“foreign-currency” hedge), (iv) a
hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, or (v) other.  Changes in the fair value of a derivative
that is highly effective as (and that is designated and qualifies as) a
fair-value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability
that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on firm
commitments), are recorded in current-period earnings.  Changes in the fair value of a derivative
that is highly effective as (and that is designated and qualifies as) a
cash-flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are
affected by the variability of cash flows (e.g., when periodic settlements on a
variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).  Changes in the fair value of derivatives that
are highly effective as (and that are designated and qualify as)
foreign-currency hedges are recorded in either current-period earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether the hedge transaction is a
fair-value hedge (e.g., a hedge of a firm commitment that is to be settled in a
foreign currency) or a cash-flow hedge (e.g., a foreign-currency-denominated
forecasted transaction).  If, however, a
derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its
changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income within equity.  Furthermore, changes in the fair value of
other derivative instruments are reported in current-period earnings.

For each derivative contract entered into where the Company looks to
obtain special hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents all
relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction,
the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness
in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively,
and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.  This process includes linking all derivatives
that are designated as fair-value, cash-flow, or foreign-currency hedges to
specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm
commitments or forecasted transactions. 
The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on
an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of
hedged items.  If it is determined that a
derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly
effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting
with respect to that derivative prospectively.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge
anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in
foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company’s identified
exposures.  The purpose of the hedging
activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on
costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign
subsidiaries.  The majority of foreign
currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial
countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment
grade by a major rating agency.  The
Company also enters into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated
transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will
materialize.  The foreign currency
forward and option contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions
have been designated as cash-flow hedges. 
Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a
hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value
attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period
earnings.  Hedge effectiveness of foreign
currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.  The ineffective portion of both foreign
currency forward and option contracts is recorded in current-period
earnings.  For hedge contracts that are
no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains
and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to
earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.  If it is probable that the forecasted
transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses accumulated in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to current-period earnings.  As of June 30, 2008, these cash-flow
hedges were highly effective, in all material respects.

As a matter of policy, the Company only enters into contracts with
counterparties that have at least an “A” (or equivalent) credit rating.  The counterparties to these contracts are
major financial institutions.  The
Company does not have significant exposure to any one counterparty.  Exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized,
but not realized, gains attributable to the contracts.  Management believes risk of loss under these
hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the
Company’s consolidated financial results. 
The contracts have varying maturities through the end of June 2009.  Costs associated with entering into such
contracts have not been material to the Company’s consolidated financial
results.  The Company does not utilize
derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

At June 30, 2008, the Company had foreign currency forward and
option contracts in the amount of $1,229.0 million and $64.9 million,
respectively.  The foreign currencies
included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S.
dollars) are principally the Euro ($221.6 million), British pound ($220.7
million), Swiss franc ($206.5 million), Canadian dollar ($130.0 million),
Australian dollar ($91.8 million), Russian ruble ($71.9 million) and Japanese
yen ($64.4 million).  The foreign
currencies included in the foreign currency option contracts (notional value
stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Canadian dollar ($36.8 million) and
the South Korean won ($23.1 million).

At June 30, 2007, the Company had foreign currency forward
contracts in the amount of $862.0 million. 
The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts
(notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the British pound
($148.1 million), Canadian dollar ($140.3 million), Euro ($124.1 million),
Swiss franc ($113.1 million), Australian dollar ($79.3 million), Japanese yen
($42.6 million) and South Korean won ($33.6 million).

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company enters into
interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of
interest rates on its funded indebtedness and anticipated issuance of debt for
periods consistent with the identified exposures.  All interest rate derivative contracts are
with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major
rating agency.

In April 2007, the Company entered into interest rate swap
agreements with a notional amount totaling $250.0 million to effectively
convert the fixed rate interest on its 2017 Senior Notes to variable interest
rates based on six-month LIBOR.  The
interest rate swaps were designated as fair-value hedges.  As of June 30, 2008, these fair-value
hedges were highly effective in all material respects.

In April 2007, the Company terminated an interest-rate swap agreement
with a notional amount of $250.0 million to effectively convert fixed rate
interest on its 2012 Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on six-month
LIBOR.  This instrument was classified as
a liability and had a termination fair value of $11.1 million at cash
settlement, which included $0.9 million of accrued interest payable to the
counterparty.

Hedge accounting
treatment was discontinued prospectively and the offsetting adjustment to the
carrying amount of the related debt will be amortized to interest expense over
the remaining life of the debt.

presented in the following table:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to
estimate that value:

Cash and cash equivalents:

The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the
short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.

Investment securities:

Investment securities are primarily designated as available-for-sale
securities and are recorded at market value based on quoted market prices.

Note receivable:

The fair value of the note receivable
reflects the creditworthiness of the counterparty, interest rates prevailing in
the market for notes with comparable remaining maturities and an assessment of
the ultimate collectability of the instrument.

Short-term and long-term debt:

The fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated based on the current
rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities.  To a lesser extent, debt also includes
capital lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair
value.

Foreign exchange and interest rate contracts:

The fair value of forwards, swaps and options is the estimated amount
the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements based on quoted
market prices at June 30.

The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as
follows:

(1)

The fiscal 2008
carrying amount and fair value included an increase in valuation reserves
reflecting the diminishing likelihood of realizing value from a promissory note
and convertible preferred stock received in connection with the fiscal 2006
divestiture of the reporting unit that marketed and sold Stila products.

NOTE 13 – PENSION, DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT
PLANS

The Company maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its
full-time employees for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international
operations.  Several plans provide
pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees’
earnings.  In certain instances, the
Company adjusts benefits in connection with international employee transfers.

Retirement Growth Account Plan (U.S.)

The Retirement Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory
qualified defined benefit pension plan. 
The Company’s funding policy consists of an annual contribution at a
rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded
percentages.  Such contribution is not
less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”) and subsequent pension legislation and is not
more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.

Restoration Plan (U.S.)

The Company also has an unfunded, non-qualified domestic
noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to provide benefits in excess of
Internal Revenue Code limitations.

International Pension Plans

The Company maintains International Pension Plans, the most significant
of which are defined benefit pension plans. 
The Company’s funding policies for these plans are determined by local
laws and regulations.  The Company’s most
significant defined benefit pension obligations are included in the plan
summaries below.  Fiscal 2008 plan data
reflects a plan amendment designed to provide certain employees of a particular
affiliate an opportunity to participate in a defined benefit pension plan with
enhanced benefits as compared with their current defined contribution
plan.  In addition, fiscal 2008 plan data
reflects the growth and relative significance of certain other defined benefit
plans.

Post-retirement Benefits

The Company maintains a domestic post-retirement benefit plan which
provides certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees.  Employees hired after January 1, 2002
are not eligible for retiree medical benefits when they retire.  Certain retired employees who are receiving
monthly pension benefits are eligible for participation in the plan.  Contributions required and benefits received
by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on the age of the
retiree.  It is the Company’s practice to
fund these benefits as incurred.

Certain of the Company’s international subsidiaries and affiliates have
post-retirement plans, although most participants are covered by government-sponsored
or administered programs.

Plan Summaries

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 106, and 132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”). 
SFAS No. 158 requires employers to recognize a net liability or asset and
an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income to report
the funded status of defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit
plans.  Previous standards required employers to disclose the complete
funded status of its plans only in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

Changes in the funded status of these plans will be
recognized as they occur through other comprehensive income.  Additional minimum liability adjustments are
no longer recognized upon adoption of SFAS No. 158.

As
of June 30, 2007, the Company prospectively adopted the balance sheet
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158, which resulted in a net
adjustment of $57.3 million (after tax) to reduce accumulated other
comprehensive income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The pre-retirement discount rate for each plan used for determining
future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term
bonds.  The pre-retirement rate for the
Company’s U.S. Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term
bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.  The Company believes the timing and amount of
cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match
the estimated defined benefit payment streams of its U.S. Plans.  In determining the long-term rate of return
for a plan, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the nature of
the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies.

International pension plans with projected benefit obligations in
excess of the plans’ assets had aggregate projected benefit obligations of
$298.6 million and $115.4 million and aggregate fair value of plan assets of
$216.2 million and $53.6 million at June 30, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  International pension
plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the plans’ assets had
aggregate accumulated benefit obligations of $95.2 million and $81.2 million
and aggregate fair value of plan assets of $41.4 million and $35.3 million at June 30,
2008 and 2007, respectively.

The target asset allocation policy was set to maximize returns with
consideration to the long-term nature of the obligations and maintaining a lower
level of overall volatility through the allocation to fixed income.  During the year, the asset allocation is
reviewed for adherence to the target policy and is rebalanced periodically
towards the target weights.

401(k) Savings Plan (U.S.)

The Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”) is a
contributory defined contribution plan covering substantially all regular U.S.
employees who have completed the hours and service requirements, as defined by
the plan document.  Regular full-time
employees are eligible to participate in the Savings Plan thirty days following
their date of hire.  The Savings Plan is
subject to the applicable provisions of ERISA. 
The Company matches a portion of the participant’s contributions after
one year of service under a predetermined formula based on the participant’s
contribution level.  The Company’s
contributions were approximately $18.7 million, $13.7 million and $10.6 million
for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.  Shares of the Company’s Class A
Common Stock are not an investment option in the Savings Plan and the Company
does not use such shares to match participants’ contributions.

In 1999, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York
(the “State”) notified the Company and ten other entities that they had been
identified as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) with respect to the Blydenburgh
landfill in Islip, New York.  Each PRP
may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and cleanup,
which the State estimated in 2006 to be approximately $19.7 million for all
PRPs.  In 2001, the State sued other PRPs
(including Hickey’s Carting, Inc., Dennis C. Hickey and Maria Hickey,
collectively the “Hickey Parties”), in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of New York to recover such costs in connection with the site, and in September 2002,
the Hickey Parties brought contribution actions against the Company and other
Blydenburgh PRPs.  These contribution
actions seek to recover, among other things, any damages for which the Hickey
Parties are found liable in the State’s lawsuit against them, and related costs
and expenses, including attorneys’ fees. 
In June 2004, the State added the Company and other PRPs as
defendants in its pending case against the Hickey Parties.  In April 2006, the Company and other
defendants added numerous other parties to the case as third-party
defendants.  The Company and certain
other PRPs have engaged in settlement discussions which to date have been
unsuccessful.  Settlement negotiations
with the new third-party defendants, the State, the Company and other
defendants began in July 2006.  The
Company has accrued an amount which it believes would be necessary to resolve
its share of this matter.  If settlement
discussions are not successful, the Company intends to vigorously defend the
pending claims.  While no assurance can
be given as to the ultimate outcome, management believes that the resolution of
the Blydenburgh matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition.

NOTE 16 – COMMON STOCK

As of June 30, 2008, the Company’s authorized common stock
consists of 650 million shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per
share, and 240 million shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $.01 per
share.  Class B Common Stock is
convertible into Class A Common Stock, in whole or in part, at any time
and from time to time at the option of the holder, on the basis of one share of
Class A Common Stock for each share of Class B Common Stock
converted.  Holders of the Company’s Class A
Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of the Company’s Class B
Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share.

Information about the Company’s common stock outstanding is as follows:

On September 18, 1998, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
a share repurchase program to repurchase a total of up to 8.0 million shares of
Class A Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated

repurchase of up to 10.0 million additional shares of Class A Common Stock
in both October 2002 and May 2004, and an additional 20.0 million in
each of May 2005, February 2007 and November 2007, increasing

Accelerated Share Repurchase Program

In March 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 15,960,800
shares of its outstanding Class A Common Stock for $750.0 million through
an accelerated share repurchase program with a financial counterparty.  These shares were accounted for as treasury
stock, carried at cost, and reflected as a reduction to stockholders’
equity.  In August 2007, the
financial counterparty informed the Company that it had completed its
obligations under the agreement.  The
per-share price paid by the Company at inception of the program exceeded the
final volume weighted average price per share, as defined by the contract.  Accordingly, the Company received 97,417
shares of its Class A Common Stock from the financial counterparty as a
price adjustment and final settlement, which was recorded as treasury stock and
additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet.

NOTE 17 – STOCK PROGRAMS

As of June 30, 2008, the Company has three active equity
compensation plans which include the Amended and Restated Fiscal 2002 Share
Incentive Plan, the Fiscal 1999 Share Incentive Plan and the Non-Employee
Director Share Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Plans”).  These Plans currently provide for the
issuance of 33,194,400 shares, which consist of shares originally provided for and
shares transferred to the Plans from a previous plan and employment agreement,
to be granted in the form of stock-based awards to key employees, consultants
and non-employee directors of the Company. 
As of June 30, 2008, approximately 7,184,400 shares of Class A
Common Stock were reserved and available to be granted pursuant to these Plans,
subject to the approval by the Stock Plan Subcommittee of the Company’s Board
of Directors of expected payouts for performance share units (“PSU”) vested as
of June 30, 2008.  The Company may
satisfy the obligation of its stock-based compensation awards with either new
or treasury shares.  The Company’s stock
compensation awards outstanding at June 30, 2008 include stock options,
PSUs, restricted stock units (“RSU”) and share units.

Total net stock-based compensation expense is attributable to the
granting of, and the remaining requisite service periods of, stock options,
PSUs, RSUs and share units.  Compensation
expense attributable to net stock-based compensation for fiscal 2008, 2007 and
2006 was $47.2 million ($31.2 million after tax), $43.2 million ($28.3 million
after tax) and $35.7 million ($23.4 million after tax), respectively.  As of June 30, 2008, the total
unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based awards was
$27.6 million and the related weighted-average period over which it is expected
to be recognized is approximately 1.6 years.

The exercise period for all stock options generally may not exceed ten
years from the date of grant.  Stock
option grants to individuals generally become exercisable in three
substantively equal tranches over a service period of up to four years.  The Company attributes the value of option
awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each
separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance,
multiple awards.

The per-share weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options
granted during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $14.36, $13.69 and $11.87,
respectively.  The total intrinsic value
of stock options exercised during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $33.2 million,
$72.3 million and $38.0 million, respectively.

The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

Performance Share Units

During fiscal 2008, the Company issued 119,200 PSUs, which will be
settled in stock subject to the achievement of the Company’s net sales and net
earnings per share goals for the three years ending June 30, 2010 and
subject to the continued employment of the grantees.  Settlement will be made pursuant to a range
of opportunities relative to the net sales and diluted net earnings per common
share targets of the Company and, as such, the compensation cost of the PSU is
subject to adjustment based upon the attainability of these target goals.  No settlement will occur for results below
the applicable minimum threshold and additional shares shall be issued if
performance exceeds the targeted performance goals.  PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent
rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of the PSU.  These awards are subject to the provisions of
the agreement under which the PSUs are granted. 
The PSUs were valued at the closing market value of the Company’s Class A
Common Stock on the date of grant and generally vest at the end of the
performance period.  Approximately 78,400
shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are anticipated to be issued,
relative to the target goals set at the time of issuance, in settlement of the
96,600 PSUs that vested as of June 30, 2008.  These awards will be settled in the first
quarter of fiscal 2009, subject to the approval of the Stock Plan Subcommittee
of the Company’s Board of Directors.

on November 1, 2010, all subject to the continued employment or retirement
of the grantees.  Certain RSUs granted in
fiscal 2008 are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable
in cash upon settlement of the RSU and, as such, were valued at the closing
market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.  Other RSUs granted in fiscal 2008 are not
accompanied by dividend equivalent rights and, as such, were valued at the
closing market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of
grant less the discounted present value of the dividends expected to be paid on

Share Units

The Company
grants share units to certain non-employee directors under the Non-Employee

Cash Units

Certain non-employee directors defer cash compensation in the form of
cash payout share units, which are not subject to the Plans.  These share units are classified as
liabilities and, as such, their fair value is adjusted to reflect the current
market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock.  The Company recorded $0.5 million, $0.8
million and $0.5 million as compensation expense to reflect additional
deferrals and the change in the market value for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

NOTE 18 – NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

For the years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, net earnings per
common share (“basic EPS”) is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares
(which satisfy certain conditions).  Net
earnings per common share assuming dilution (“diluted EPS”) is computed by
reflecting potential dilution from stock-based awards and contingently issuable
shares.

A reconciliation between the numerators and denominators of the basic
and diluted EPS computations is as follows:

As of June 30,
2008, 2007 and 2006, outstanding options to purchase 7.1 million, 6.0 million
and 13.6 million shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock were not
included in the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be
anti-dilutive.  As of June 30, 2008,
2007 and 2006, 0.2 million, 0.2 million and 0.1 million, respectively, of
performance share units have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS
because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on the achievement
of certain performance targets of the Company, as discussed in Note 17.

NOTE 20 – STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

Supplemental cash flow information related to
certain non-cash investing and financing transactions for fiscal 2008, 2007 and
2006 is as follows:

NOTE 21 – SEGMENT DATA AND RELATED INFORMATION

Reportable operating segments, as defined by SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” include components of
an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the “Chief Executive”)
in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  As a result of the similarities in the
manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company’s
products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial
statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by
the Chief Executive.  Although the
Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also
evaluates performance on a product category basis.

While the Company’s results of operations are also reviewed on a
consolidated basis, the Chief Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that
facilitates comparison to industry statistics. 
Accordingly, net sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating
income are available with respect to the manufacture and distribution of skin
care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and other products.  These product categories meet the FASB’s
definition of operating segments and, accordingly, additional financial data
are provided below.  The “other” segment
includes the sales and related results of ancillary products and services that
do not fit the definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care.

The Company evaluates segment performance based upon operating income,
which represents earnings before income taxes, minority interest, net interest
expense and discontinued operations.  The
accounting policies for each of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies, except for
depreciation and amortization charges, which are allocated, primarily, based
upon net sales.  The assets and
liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in
the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional
information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein.
