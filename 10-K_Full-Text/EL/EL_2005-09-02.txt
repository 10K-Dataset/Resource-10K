Forward-Looking Statements and
Risk Factors

This Annual Report on Form 10-K

Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
Such statements include, without limitation, our expectations regarding
sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, product
introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information systems
initiatives, new methods of sale and future operations or operating
results.  Although we believe that our
expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our
knowledge of our business and operations, we cannot assure that actual results
will not differ materially from our expectations.  Factors that could cause actual results to
differ from expectations are described herein; in particular, see “Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward-Looking Information.”  In addition, there is a discussion of risks
associated with an investment in our securities.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

PART I

Item 1.

Business.

The Estée Lauder Companies
Inc., founded in 1946 by Estée and Joseph Lauder, is one of the world’s leading
manufacturers and marketers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair
care products.  Our products are sold in
over 130 countries and territories under the following well-recognized brand
names: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Aramis, Prescriptives, Origins, M

ž

A

ž

C,
Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Stila, Jo Malone, Bumble and bumble, Darphin, Rodan
+ Fields, American Beauty, Flirt!, Good Skin™, Donald Trump The Fragrance and
Grassroots.  We are also the global
licensee for fragrances and cosmetics sold under the Tommy Hilfiger, Donna
Karan and Michael Kors brand names.  Each
brand is distinctly positioned within the market for beauty products.

We are a pioneer in the
cosmetics industry and believe we are a leader in the industry due to the
global recognition of our brand names, our leadership in product innovation,
our strong market position in key geographic markets and the consistently high
quality of our products.  We sell our
prestige products principally through limited distribution channels to
complement the images associated with our brands.  These channels, encompassing over 20,000
points of sale, consist primarily of upscale department stores, specialty
retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies, prestige salons and spas and, to
a lesser extent, freestanding company-owned stores and spas, our own and
authorized retailer web sites, stores on cruise ships, television direct
marketing, in-flight and duty-free shops. 
We believe that our strategy of pursuing limited distribution
strengthens our relationships with retailers, enables our brands to be among
the best selling product lines at the stores and heightens the aspirational
quality of our brands.

Beginning in fiscal 2005, we
began to sell our newly developed brands, American Beauty, Flirt!, Good Skin™
and Grassroots at Kohl’s Department Stores.

In February 2004, we sold the
assets and operations of our reporting unit that sold

jane

brand products.  We acquired the brand in
October 1997.

We have been controlled by the
Lauder family since the founding of our company.  Members of the Lauder family, some of whom
are directors, executive officers and/or employees, beneficially own, directly
or indirectly, as of August 26, 2005, shares of Class A Common Stock and Class
B Common Stock having approximately 87.7% of the outstanding voting power of
the Common Stock.

Unless the context requires
otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to The Estée
Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries.

Products

Skin Care

- Our broad range of skin care
products addresses various skin care needs for women and men.  These products include moisturizers, creams,
lotions, cleansers, sun screens and self-tanning products, a number of which
are developed for use on particular areas of the body, such as the face or the
hands or around the eyes.  Skin care
products accounted for approximately 37% of our net sales in fiscal 2005.

Makeup

- We manufacture, market and sell a
full array of makeup products, including lipsticks, mascaras, foundations,
eyeshadows, nail polishes and powders. 
Many of the products are offered in an extensive array of shades and
colors.  We also sell related items such
as compacts, brushes and other makeup tools. 
Makeup products accounted for approximately 38% of our net sales in
fiscal 2005.

Fragrance

- We offer a variety of fragrance
products for women and men.  The
fragrances are sold in various forms, including eau de parfum sprays and
colognes, as well as lotions, powders, creams and soaps that are based on a
particular fragrance.  Fragrance products
accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2005.


Hair Care

- Hair care products are offered
mainly in salons and in freestanding retail stores and include hair color and
styling products, shampoos, conditioners and finishing sprays.  In fiscal 2005, hair care products accounted
for approximately 4% of our net sales.

Given the personal nature of
our products and the wide array of consumer preferences and tastes, as well as
competition for the attention of consumers, our strategy has been to market and
promote our products through distinctive brands seeking to address broad
preferences and tastes.  Each brand has a
single global image that is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and
advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other
brands.

Estée Lauder

- Estée Lauder brand products,
which have been sold since 1946, are positioned as luxurious, classic and
aspirational.  We believe that Estée
Lauder brand products are technologically advanced and innovative and have a
worldwide reputation for excellence.  The
broad product line principally consists of skin care, makeup and fragrance
products that are presented in high quality packaging.  In April 2005, we announced a creative
collaboration with the fashion designer, Tom Ford, pursuant to which he will
collaborate with the Estée Lauder brand to create a Tom Ford for Estée Lauder
collection to be launched in the 2005 holiday season and expanded for Spring
2006.

Clinique

- First introduced in 1968, Clinique
skin care and makeup products are all allergy tested and 100% fragrance free
and have been designed to address individual skin types and needs.  The products are based on the research and
related expertise of leading dermatologists. 
Clinique skin care products are generally marketed as part of the 3-Step
System: Cleanse, Exfoliate, Moisturize. 
Clinique also offers fragrances for men and women and a line of hair
care products.

Aramis

- We pioneered the marketing of
prestige men’s grooming and skin care products and fragrances with the
introduction of Aramis products in 1964. 
Lab Series for Men, introduced by Aramis 17 years ago, offers the full
range of advanced products for cleansing, shaving, treatment and body that are
especially formulated to answer the unique needs of men’s skin.  Aramis continues to offer one of the broadest
lines of prestige men’s products.

Prescriptives

- We developed and introduced
Prescriptives in 1979.  Prescriptives is
positioned as a color authority with an advanced collection of highly
individualized products primarily addressing the makeup and skin care needs of
contemporary women with active lifestyles. 
The products are characterized by simple concepts, minimalist design and
an innovative image and, through a system of color application and extensive
range of makeup shades, accommodate a diverse group of consumers.

Origins

- Origins was introduced in 1990.  It is positioned as a plant-based line of skin
care, makeup and aromatherapy products that combine time-tested botanical
ingredients with modern science to promote total well-being.  Origins sells its products at our
freestanding Origins stores and through stores-within-stores (which are
designed to replicate the Origins store environment within a department store),
at traditional retail counters, in perfumeries and directly to consumers over
the Internet.

Tommy Hilfiger

- We have an exclusive global
license arrangement to develop and market a line of men’s and women’s
fragrances and cosmetics under the Tommy Hilfiger brand.  We launched the line in 1995 with a men’s
fragrance,

tommy

. 
Today, we manufacture and sell a variety of fragrances and ancillary products
for men and women.

- M

professional makeup tools targeting makeup artists and fashion-conscious
consumers.  The products are sold through
a limited number of department and specialty stores, at freestanding M

C
stores and directly to consumers over the Internet.  We acquired the companies behind M

ž

A

ž

C
in three stages: in December 1994, March 1997 and February 1998.

Bobbi Brown

- In October 1995, we acquired the
Bobbi Brown line of color cosmetics, professional makeup brushes and skin care
products.  Bobbi Brown products are
manufactured to our specifications, primarily by third parties, and sold
through a limited number of department and specialty stores and directly to
consumers over the Internet.

La Mer

- La Mer products primarily consist of
moisturizing creams, lotions, cleansers, toners and other skin care
products.  The line, which is available
in very limited distribution in the United States and certain other countries,
is an extension of the initial Crème de la Mer product that we acquired in
1995.

Donna Karan Cosmetics

-

In
November 1997, we obtained the exclusive global license to develop, market and
distribute a line of fragrances and other cosmetics under the Donna Karan New
York and DKNY trademarks, including certain products that were originally sold
by The Donna Karan Company.  We launched
the first DKNY women’s fragrance in fiscal 2000 and the first DKNY men’s
fragrance in fiscal 2001.  Under this
license, fragrances have been expanded to include extensive lines of companion
bath and body products.


Aveda

- We acquired the Aveda business in
December 1997 and have since acquired selected Aveda distributors and retail
stores.  Aveda, a prestige hair care
leader, is a manufacturer and marketer of plant-based hair care, skin care,
makeup and fragrance products.  We sell
Aveda products to third-party distributors and prestige salons and spas,
cosmetology schools, certain non-U.S. department stores and specialty retailers
and directly to consumers at our own freestanding Aveda Experience Centers and
certain Aveda Institutes.

Stila

- In August 1999, we acquired the
business of Los Angeles-based Stila Cosmetics, Inc.  Stila is known for its stylish, wearable
makeup products and eco-friendly packaging and has developed a following among
young, fashion-forward consumers.  Stila
products are currently available at the brand’s flagship store in Los Angeles,
California, and also in limited distribution in the United States and certain
other countries.

Jo Malone

- We acquired London-based Jo Malone
Limited in October 1999.  Jo Malone is
known for its prestige skin care, fragrance and hair care products showcased at
its flagship store in London.  Products
are also available through a company catalogue, at freestanding stores and at a
very limited group of specialty stores in the United States, Canada and the
United Kingdom.

Bumble and bumble

- In June 2000, we acquired
a controlling majority equity interest in Bumble and Bumble Products, LLC, a
marketer and distributor of quality hair care products, and Bumble and Bumble,
LLC, the operator of a premier hair salon in New York City.  Bumble and bumble styling and other hair care
products are distributed to top-tier salons and select specialty stores.  In fiscal 2004, we opened a second
wholly-owned salon and a training and education center.  The founder and two of his partners own the
remaining equity interests and have continued to manage the domestic
operations.

Darphin

- In April 2003, we acquired
Laboratoires Darphin, the Paris-based company dedicated to the development,
manufacture and marketing of prestige skin care and makeup products which are
distributed through high-end independent pharmacies and specialty stores.

Michael Kors

- In May 2003, we entered into a
license agreement for fragrances and beauty products under the “Michael Kors”
trademarks and purchased certain related rights and inventory from another
party.  All fragrances including MICHAEL
and MICHAEL for Men, as well as ancillary bath and body products, are sold in
department stores, specialty stores, at freestanding Michael Kors boutiques and
over the Internet.

Rodan + Fields

- In July 2003, we acquired the
Rodan + Fields skin care line launched in 2002 by Stanford University-trained
dermatologists Katie Rodan, M.D. and Kathy Fields, M.D.  The line offers solutions for specific skin
problems, targeting them with individually packaged and dedicated regimens.  The line is currently sold in U.S. specialty
stores and over the Internet at www.rodanandfields.com.

American Beauty -

Launched in 2004, the
luxurious makeup and advanced skin care line celebrates the beauty of American
style.  These products, which are sold in
the United States at Kohl’s Department Stores and Kohls.com, have been
developed to meet the needs of the modern American woman, with a
straightforward makeup and skin care appeal. 
We offer over 35 products and more than 150 shades.

2004, the Company announced that it joined forces with Donald Trump in a
multi-year deal.  The agreement
established Mr. Trump as the spokesperson for a new men’s fragrance called
Donald Trump The Fragrance.

Introduced in 2005 and sold

in the United States at Kohl’s Department Stores and
Kohls.com

,

Grassroots offers a range of wholesome,
naturally-sourced products that deliver extraordinary results to help care for
you and your family.  This line’s seven
product categories include face, body, hair, post-pregnancy, babies, kids and
pets.


In addition to the foregoing
brands, we manufacture and sell Kiton and Toni Gard products as a
licensee.  We also have licenses from,
and are developing products for, Sean John (announced in May 2004), Tom Ford
(announced in April 2005) and Missoni (announced in May 2005) and an Origins
license agreement to develop and sell products using the name of Dr. Andrew
Weil (announced in October 2004).

Distribution

We sell our products
principally through limited distribution channels to complement the images associated
with our brands.  These channels include
more than 20,000 points of sale in over 130 countries and territories and
consist primarily of upscale department stores, specialty retailers, upscale
perfumeries and pharmacies, prestige salons and spas and, to a lesser extent,
freestanding company-owned stores and spas, our own and authorized retailer
websites, stores on cruise ships, television direct marketing, in-flight and
duty-free shops.

We maintain a dedicated sales
force which sells to our retail accounts in North America and in the major
overseas markets, such as Western Europe and Japan.  We have wholly-owned operations in over 30
countries, and controlling interests in joint ventures that operate in four other
countries, through which we market, sell and distribute our products.  In certain countries, we sell our products
through selected local distributors under contractual arrangements designed to
protect the image and position of the brands. 
In addition, we sell certain products in select domestic and
international military locations and over the Internet.  For
information regarding our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region,
see Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is
incorporated herein by reference.  Our
net sales in the United States in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $3,123.7
million, $2,928.7 million and $2,752.8 million, respectively.  Our long-lived assets in the United States at
June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $425.5 million, $416.0 million and $420.1
million, respectively.

There are risks inherent in
foreign operations, including changes in social, political and economic
conditions.  We are also exposed to risks
associated with changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment
in countries where we have operations as well as, to a lesser extent, changes
in United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and
investment.  In addition, our results of
operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates.  Changes
in such rates also may affect the relative prices at which we and foreign
competitors sell products in the same markets. 
Similarly, the cost of certain items required in our operations may be
affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies.

We principally sell Aveda
products to third-party distributors and prestige salons and spas, cosmetology
schools and specialty retailers and directly to consumers at our own
freestanding Aveda Experience Centers and certain Aveda Institutes.  There are currently about 7,000 points of
sale, primarily in the United States, that sell Aveda products.  Bumble and bumble products are principally
sold to more than 1,900 independent salons, primarily in the United States.  Darphin products are principally sold through
high-end independent pharmacies, principally in Europe, representing
approximately 3,500 points of sale.

As part of our strategy to
diversify our distribution, we have been selectively expanding the number of
single-brand, freestanding stores that we own and operate.  The Origins, Aveda and M

ž

A

ž

C
brands are the primary focus for this method of distribution.  At this time, we operate 445 single-brand,
freestanding stores worldwide, the majority of which are in the United States,
and expect that number to increase moderately over the next several years.

In fiscal 2005, we began to
sell our newly developed brands, American Beauty, Flirt!, Good Skin™ and
Grassroots.  The new products are
available at about 600 Kohl’s Department Stores in the United States.

We sell some of our products
directly to consumers over the Internet through our own websites (Estée Lauder,
Clinique, Lab Series for Men, Prescriptives, Origins, M

ž

A

ž

C,
Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Stila, Jo Malone and Rodan + Fields), and through
Gloss.com (Estée Lauder, Clinique, Lab Series for Men, Prescriptives, Origins,
M

ž

A

ž

C,
Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Stila, Jo Malone and Rodan + Fields).  Gloss.com is a joint venture in which we own
a controlling majority interest.  Chanel,
Inc. and Clarins (U.S.A.) Inc. became partners in the venture in August 2000
and Chanel and Clarins products are also available on the website.

As is customary in the cosmetics
industry, our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if
properly requested, authorized and approved. 
In accepting returns, we typically provide a credit to the retailer
against sales and accounts receivable from that retailer on a dollar-for-dollar
basis.  In recognition of this practice,
and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we report
sales levels on a net basis, which is computed by deducting the amount of actual
returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns from gross
sales.  As a percentage of gross sales,
returns were 4.7%, 4.6% and 5.1% in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.


Customers

Our strategy has been to build
strong strategic relationships with selected retailers globally.  Senior management works with executives of
our major retail accounts on a regular basis and we believe we are viewed as an
important supplier to these customers.

For the fiscal years ended June
30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our three largest customers accounted for 22%, 22% and
24%, respectively, of our net sales. 
Individually no customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales
during fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003.  Our
two largest customers, Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department
Stores Company, merged on August 30, 2005.

Marketing

Our marketing strategy is built
around our vision statement: “Bringing the Best to Everyone We Touch.”  Mrs. Estée Lauder formulated this marketing philosophy
to provide high-quality service and products as the foundation for a solid and
loyal consumer base.

Our marketing efforts focus
principally on promoting the quality and benefits of our products.  Each of our brands is distinctively
positioned, has a single global image, and is promoted with consistent logos,
packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it
from other brands.  We regularly
advertise our products on television and radio, in upscale magazines and
newspapers and through direct mail and photo displays at international
airports.  In addition, our products
receive extensive editorial coverage in prestige publications and other media
worldwide.  Promotional activities and
in-store displays are designed to introduce existing consumers to different
products in the line and to attract new consumers.  Our marketing efforts also benefit from
cooperative advertising programs with retailers, some of which are supported by
coordinated promotions, such as purchase with purchase and gift with
purchase.  At in-store counters, sales
representatives offer personal demonstrations to market individual products as
well as to provide education on basic skin care and makeup application.  We conduct extensive sampling programs and we
pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling program.  We believe that the quality and perceived
benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new
and existing consumers.

Starting with the launch of the
Clinique website in 1996, we have used the Internet to educate and inform
consumers about certain of our brands. 
Currently, we have eighteen single-brand marketing sites, twelve of
which have e-commerce capabilities, and Gloss.com, our majority-owned,
multi-brand marketing and e-commerce site.

Most of our creative marketing
work is done by in-house creative teams. 
The creative staff designs and produces the sales materials,
advertisements and packaging for all products in each brand.  Total advertising and promotional expenditures
were $1,812.5 million, $1,612.0 million and $1,416.1 million for fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.  These
amounts include expenses relating to purchase with purchase and gift with
purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales.

Our marketing and sales
executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers and key
retailers and consulting with sales representatives at the points of sale.  These include Estée Lauder Beauty Advisors,
Clinique Consultants, Aramis Selling Specialists, Prescriptives Analysts,
Origins Guides and M

Makeup Artists.

Information
Systems

Information systems support
business processes including product development, marketing, sales, order
processing, production, distribution and finance.  Of the many systems currently being utilized,
the most significant to our business needs are: (i) a centralized data
repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer, or plan
to offer, which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of
consistent quality; (ii) a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the
stock keeping unit (SKU) level at most significant retail sales locations
(i.e., sell-through data), increasing our understanding of consumer preferences
and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development,
manufacturing and marketing strategies; (iii) an automated replenishment system
with many of our key domestic customers, allowing us to replenish inventories
for individual points of sale automatically, with minimal paperwork; and (iv)
an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished
goods availability relative to actual requirements, facilitating inventory
control and distribution for both existing product lines and new product
launches.

The efficiencies provided by
these systems have resulted in increased sales, fewer out-of-stocks and reduced
retail inventories.  We expect that these
systems will continue to provide inventory and sales efficiencies in the short
and medium terms.  As part of our long-term
effort to enhance these efficiencies, we are implementing enterprise-wide
global programs that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data,
processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize
business processes across brands, operating units and sales affiliates.


Research
and Development

We believe that we are an
industry leader in the development of new products.  Marketing, product development and packaging
groups work with our research and development group to identify shifts in
consumer preferences, develop new products and redesign or reformulate existing
products.  In addition, research and
development personnel work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing
personnel on a worldwide basis to ensure consistent global standards for our
products and to deliver products with attributes that fulfill consumer
expectations.

We maintain ongoing research
and development programs at our facilities in Melville, New York; Oevel,
Belgium; Petersfield, U.K.; Tokyo, Japan; Markham, Ontario; Blaine, Minnesota;
and Colombes, France.  We are also in the
process of opening a research center in Shanghai, China.  Construction of the Shanghai research and
development center started in June 2005 and we expect to have operations
running by the latter part of 2005.  As
of June 30, 2005, we had approximately 430

employees
engaged in research and development. 
Research and development expenditures totaled $72.3 million, $67.2
million and $60.8 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Our research and development group makes
significant contributions toward improving existing products and developing new
products and provides ongoing technical assistance and know-how to our
manufacturing activities.  The research
and development group has had long-standing working relationships with several
U.S. and international medical and educational facilities, which supplement
internal capabilities.  We do not conduct
animal testing of our products.

Manufacturing,
Warehousing and Raw Materials

We manufacture skin care,
makeup, fragrance and hair care products in the United States, Belgium,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Canada and France.  We continue to streamline our manufacturing
processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase
efficiencies and reduce costs.  Our major
manufacturing facilities operate as “focus” plants that primarily manufacture
one type of product (e.g., lipsticks) for all of the principal brands.  Our plants are modern and our manufacturing
processes are substantially automated. 
While we believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to
meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue
to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity and
productivity.  To capitalize on
innovation and other supply benefits, we continue to utilize third parties on a
global basis for finished goods production.

We have established a global
distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers
while maintaining service levels.  We are
continuously evaluating and restructuring this physical distribution
network.  We intend to establish regional
inventory centers strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate
timely delivery of our products to our customers.

The principal raw materials
used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohol and specialty
chemicals.  We also purchase packaging
components that are manufactured to our design specifications.  Procurement of materials for all
manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our
centralized supplier relations department. 
A concentrated effort in supplier rationalization has been made with the
specific objective of reducing costs, increasing innovation and improving
quality.  As a result of sourcing
initiatives, there is increased dependency on certain suppliers, but we believe
that these suppliers have adequate resources and facilities to overcome any
unforeseen interruption of supply.  We
are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will add
or delete suppliers based upon the changing needs of the business.  We have, in the past, been able to obtain an
adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have
adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.  As we integrate acquired brands, we
continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities
to improve manufacturing performance.


Competition

The skin care, makeup,
fragrance and hair care businesses are characterized by vigorous competition
throughout the world.  Brand recognition,
quality, performance and price have a significant influence on consumers’
choices among competing products and brands. 
Advertising, promotion, merchandising, the pace and timing of new
product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store sales staff
also have a significant impact on consumers’ buying decisions.  We compete against a number of manufacturers
and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, some of
which have substantially greater resources than we do.

Our principal competitors among
manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care
products include:

•

L’Oreal S.A.

We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our
business.

A number of our products
incorporate patented or patent-pending formulations or packaging.  In addition, several products are covered by
design patents, patent applications or copyrights.  While we consider these patents and

Employees

At June 30, 2005, we had
approximately 23,700 full-time employees worldwide (including sales
representatives at points of sale who are employed by us), of whom
approximately 11,300 are employed in the United States and Canada.  None of our employees in the United States is
covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
In certain other countries a limited number of employees are covered by
a works council agreement or other syndicate arrangements.  We believe that relations with our employees
are good.  We have never encountered a
material strike or work stoppage in the United States or in any other country
where we have a significant number of employees.

We and our products are subject
to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade
Commission in the United States, as well as by various other Federal, state,
local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities
in the countries in which our products are produced or sold.  Such regulations principally relate to the
ingredients, labeling, packaging and marketing of our products.  We believe that we are in substantial
compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable Federal, state,
local and international and other countries’ rules and regulations governing
the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment.  There are no significant capital expenditures
for environmental control matters either planned in the current year or
expected in the near future.  Along with
other unrelated parties, we have been named as a potentially responsible party
by the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York with regard to a
landfill in Long Island, New York.  See “

Seasonality

Our results of operations in
total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations,
with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly
higher than in the second half of the fiscal year.  The higher net sales in the first two fiscal
quarters are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers
for the holiday selling season and for fall fashion makeup introductions.  Fluctuations in net sales, operating income
and product category results in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the
level and scope of new product introductions. 
Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a
quarter-by-quarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of
promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

There are risks associated with
an investment in our securities, including:

The beauty business is highly
competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will
suffer.

We face vigorous competition
from companies throughout the world, including multinational consumer product
companies.  Some of these competitors
have greater resources than we do. 
Competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products,
innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities,
advertising, special events, new product introductions, electronic commerce
initiatives and other activities.  It is difficult
for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these
areas.  Also, the trend toward
consolidation in the retail trade, particularly in developed markets such as
the United States and Western Europe, has resulted in us becoming increasingly
dependent on key retailers, including large-format retailers, who have
increased their bargaining strength.  Our
ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our
ability to attract and retain key talent, the efficiency of our manufacturing
facilities and distribution network, and our ability to protect our
intellectual property.  Our failure to
continue to compete effectively in countries around the world could have an
adverse impact on our business.

Our inability to
anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences
could adversely affect our financial results.

Our continued success depends
on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective
manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair
care products as well as to where and how consumers shop for those
products.  We must continually work to
develop, produce and market new products, maintain and enhance the recognition
of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, and refine our approach as
to how and where we market and sell our products.  While we devote considerable effort and
resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, we recognize
that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly.  If we are unable to anticipate and respond to
trends in the market for cosmetics products and changing consumer demands, our
financial results will suffer.

A general economic downturn or
sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of
discretionary items, which could adversely affect our financial results.

The general level of consumer
spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic
conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence
generally, all of which are beyond our control. 
Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during
recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of
our products.  In addition, sudden
disruptions in business conditions, for example, as a consequence of events
such as the outbreak of SARs in 2003 or those that are currently taking place
in the Middle East, or as a result of a terrorist attack similar to the events
of September 11, 2001 in the United States or the July 2005 events in the
United Kingdom, including further attacks, retaliation and the threat of
further attacks or retaliation can have a short and, sometimes, long-term
impact on consumer spending.  Events that
impact consumers’ willingness to travel may impact our travel retail business,
which is a significant contributor to our overall results.  A downturn in the economies in which we sell
our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies
could adversely affect our sales.

Changes in laws, regulations
and polices that affect our business could adversely affect our financial
results.

Our business is subject to
numerous laws, regulations and policies. 
Changes in the laws, regulations and policies that affect, or will
affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and
regulations, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense
of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result
could adversely affect our financial results.


We are subject to risks related to our
international operations.

We operate on a global basis, with
approximately 51% of our fiscal 2005 net sales generated outside the United States.  We maintain offices in over 30 countries and
have key operational facilities located outside the United States that
manufacture goods for sale throughout the world.  Foreign operations are

subject
to many risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to:

•

fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, which can affect our results of operations;
the value of our foreign assets; the relative prices at which we and foreign
competitors sell products in the same markets; and the cost of certain items
required in our operations;

•

changes in
foreign laws, regulations and policies, including restrictions on trade, import
and export license requirements, and tariffs and taxes, as well as changes in
United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment;
and

•

geopolitical
conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action.

These risks could have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and
financial condition.

A disruption in operations
could adversely affect our business and financial results.

As a company engaged in
manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks
inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental
events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in logistics or
information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product
quality control, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as
well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no
control.  If such an event were to occur,
it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results.

Item 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments.

As of the filing of this annual
report on Form 10-K, there were no unresolved comments from the Staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 2.

Properties

.

The following table sets forth
our principal owned and leased manufacturing and research and development
facilities as of August 26, 2005.  The
leases expire at various times through 2020 subject to certain renewal options.


We own, lease and occupy
numerous offices, assembly and distribution facilities and warehouses in the
United States and abroad.  We consider
our properties to be generally in good condition and believe that our
facilities are adequate for our operations and provide sufficient capacity to
meet anticipated requirements.  We lease
approximately 343,000 square feet of rentable space for our principal offices
in New York, New York and own an office building of approximately 57,000 square
feet in Melville, New York.  As of August
26, 2005, we operated 518 freestanding retail stores, including 17 for the
Estée Lauder brand, 19 for Clinique, 131 for Origins, 124 for M

140 for Aveda, 1 for Bobbi Brown, 8 for Jo Malone, 2 for Bumble and bumble, 3 for

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

.

We are involved, from time to
time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business.  Management believes that the outcome of
current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse
effect upon our results of operations or financial condition.  However, management’s assessment of our
current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the
discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending
against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges, juries or
other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of
the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings.

On March 30, 2005, the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California entered into a
Final Judgment approving the settlement agreement we entered into in July 2003,
with the plaintiffs, the other Manufacturer Defendants (as defined below) and
the Department Store Defendants (as defined below) in a consolidated class
action lawsuit that had been pending in the Superior Court of the State of
California in Marin County since 1998.  On
April 29, 2005, notices of appeal were filed by representatives of two members
of the purported class of consumers.  If
the appeal is resolved satisfactorily, the Final Judgment will result in the
plaintiffs’ claims being dismissed, with prejudice, in their entirety in both
the Federal and California actions. 
There has been no finding or admission of any wrongdoing by us in this
lawsuit.  We entered into the settlement
agreement solely to avoid protracted and costly litigation.  In connection with the settlement agreement,
the defendants, including the Company, will provide consumers with certain free
products and pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees.  To meet its obligations under the settlement,
we took a special pre-tax charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million after-tax,
equal to $.06 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003.  At June 30, 2005, the remaining
accrual balance was $17.2 million.  The
charge did not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
condition.  In the Federal action, the
plaintiffs, purporting to represent a class of all U.S. residents who purchased
prestige cosmetics products at retail for personal use from eight department
stores groups that sold such products in the United States (the “Department
Store Defendants”), alleged that the Department Store Defendants, the Company
and eight other manufacturers of cosmetics (the “Manufacturer Defendants”)
conspired to fix and maintain retail prices and to limit the supply of prestige
cosmetics products sold by the Department Store Defendants in violation of
state and Federal laws.  The plaintiffs
sought, among other things, treble damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees,
interest and costs.

In 1998, the Office of the
Attorney General of the State of New York (the “State”) notified the Company
and ten other entities that they are potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”)
with respect to the Blydenburgh landfill in Islip, New York.  Each PRP may be jointly and severally liable
for the costs of investigation and cleanup, which the State estimates to be $16
million for all PRPs.  In 2001, the State
sued other PRPs (including Hickey’s Carting, Inc., Dennis C. Hickey and Maria
Hickey, collectively the “Hickey Parties”), in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of New York to recover such costs in connection with the site,
and in September 2002, the Hickey Parties brought contribution actions against
the Company and other Blydenburgh PRPs. 
These contribution actions seek to recover, among other things, any
damages for which the Hickey Parties are found liable in the State’s lawsuit
against them, and related costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees.  In June 2004, the State added the Company and
other PRPs as defendants in its pending case against the Hickey Parties.  The Company and certain other PRPs have
engaged in settlement discussions which to date have been unsuccessful.  We have accrued an amount which we believe
would be necessary to resolve our share of this matter.  If settlement discussions are not successful,
we intend to vigorously defend the pending claims.  While no assurance can be given as to the
ultimate outcome, management believes that the resolution of the Blydenburgh
matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
condition.


In January 2004, the Portuguese
Tax Administration issued a report alleging that our subsidiary had income
subject to tax in Portugal for the three calendar years ended December 31,
2002.  Our subsidiary has been operating
in the Madeira Free Trade Zone since 1989 under license from the Madeira
Development Corporation and, in accordance with such license and the laws of
Portugal, we believe that our income is not subject to Portuguese income
tax.  In February 2004, the subsidiary
filed an appeal of the finding to the Portuguese Secretary of State for Fiscal
Matters.  The appeal is still
pending.  On December 20, 2004, the
subsidiary received a notice of assessment from the Portuguese Tax
Administration solely in respect of the calendar year ended December 31,
2000.  The assessment, which includes
interest, amounted to 27.7 million Euros. 
At the end of March 2005, the subsidiary filed an opposition to the
assessment.  No action has been taken by
the Portuguese Tax Administration in respect of the opposition, which remains
pending.  In August 2005, the Portuguese Tax Administration notified the subsidiary
that it is beginning executive procedures to collect on the assessment for
2000, and we are in the process of arranging the required financial
guarantee.  On May 17 and 18, 2005, the subsidiary received notices of
assessment from the Portuguese Tax Administration in respect of the calendar
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002. 
The assessments are for 21.6 million Euros and 22.4 million Euros,
respectively, to which the subsidiary has filed oppositions in July 2005.  While no assurance can be given as to the
ultimate outcome in respect of the foregoing assessments or any additional
assessments that may be issued for subsequent periods, management believes that
the likelihood that the assessment or any future assessments ultimately will be
upheld is remote.

In December 2004, a plaintiff
purporting to represent a nationwide class brought an action in the Superior
Court of California for the County of San Diego.  The complaint, as amended, names two of our
subsidiaries and approximately 25 other defendants, including manufacturers and
retailers.  The plaintiff is seeking
injunctive relief, restitution, and general, special and punitive damages for
alleged violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, the California
False Advertising Law, and for negligent and intentional
misrepresentation.  The purported class
includes individuals “who have purchased skin care products from defendants
that have been falsely advertised to have an ‘anti-aging’ or youth inducing
benefit or effect.”  We intend to defend
ourselves vigorously.  While no assurance
can be given as to the ultimate outcome, management believes that the
resolution of this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial condition.

In June 2005, an action was
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida
against one of our subsidiaries.  Two of our department store customers
were added as defendants in an amended complaint filed in August 2005.  The plaintiff, purporting to represent a
nationwide class of individuals “who have purchased skin care products from
Defendant that have been falsely advertised to have an ‘anti-aging’ or
youth-inducing benefit or effect,” seeks injunctive relief as well as
compensatory and punitive damages for alleged breach of express and implied
warranties, negligent misrepresentation, and false advertising and unfair
business practices.  While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome,
management believes that the resolution of this lawsuit will not have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.

Securities.

Market for
Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters

Our Class A Common Stock is
publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “EL.”  The following table shows the high and low
sales prices as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and the
cash dividends per share declared in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004:

We expect to continue the
payment of cash dividends in the future, but there can be no assurance that the
Board of Directors will continue to declare them.  In November 2004, the Board of Directors
declared an annual dividend of $.40 per share which was paid in December
2004.  In November 2003, the Board of
Directors declared an annual dividend of $.30 per share which was paid in
January 2004.

As of August 26, 2005, there
were approximately 4,143 record holders of Class A Common Stock and 21 record
holders of Class B Common Stock.

Share
Repurchase Program

We are authorized by the Board
of Directors to repurchase up to 48.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock in
the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market
conditions and other factors.  As of June
30, 2005, the cumulative total of acquired shares pursuant to the authorization
was 27.4 million, reducing the remaining authorized share repurchase balance to
20.6 million.  During fiscal 2005, we
purchased approximately 10.7 million shares for $438.6 million as outlined in
the following table:

(1)

The
publicly announced repurchase program was last increased by 20.0 million shares
on May 18, 2005.  The initial program
covering the repurchase of 8.0 million shares was announced in September 1998
and increased by 10.0 million shares on both May 11, 2004 and October 30, 2002.


Sales of
Unregistered Securities

Shares of Class B Common Stock may be converted immediately into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis by the holder and are automatically converted into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis upon transfer to a person or entity that is not a “Permitted Transferee” or soon after a record date for a meeting of stockholders where the outstanding Class B Common Stock constitutes less than 10% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company.  There is no cash or other consideration paid by the holder converting the shares and, accordingly, there is no cash or other consideration received by the Company.  The shares of Class A Common Stock issued by the Company in such conversions are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant
 to Section 3(a)(9) thereof.

During fiscal 2005, the holders set forth in
the table converted shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock on
the dates set forth in the table below:


Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

.

The table below summarizes
selected financial information.  For
further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and
the notes thereto beginning on page F-1 of this report.


(a)

Effective January 1,
2002, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 01-9, “Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer.”  Upon adoption of this Issue, we reclassified
revenues generated from our purchase with purchase activities as sales and the
costs of our purchase with purchase and gift with purchase activities as cost
of sales, which were previously reported net as operating expenses.  Operating income has remained unchanged by
this adoption.  For purposes of
comparability, these reclassifications have been reflected retroactively for
all periods presented.

(b)

During fiscal 2004, there
was an increase of approximately $17.4 million in interest expense, net and a
corresponding decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the adoption
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 150, “Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.”  Additionally, in connection
with this pronouncement, redeemable preferred stock has been reclassified as a
component of total debt subsequent to June 30, 2003.  The provisions of SFAS No. 150 did not
provide for retroactive restatement of historical financial data.

(c)

Pursuant to SFAS No.
142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” financial results for periods
subsequent to July 1, 2001 exclude goodwill amortization.  Goodwill amortization included in fiscal 2001
was $20.9 million ($13.4 million after tax). 
Excluding the effect of goodwill amortization in fiscal 2001, diluted
earnings per common share would have been higher by $.06.

(d)

In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005 we announced plans to repatriate approximately $690 million of
foreign earnings in fiscal year 2006, which includes $500 million of
extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “AJCA”).  This
action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million in our
fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, which includes an incremental tax charge of approximately
$28 million, equal to $.12 per diluted share. 
The repatriated funds will be reinvested in the U.S. under a domestic
reinvestment plan in accordance with the provisions of the AJCA.

(e)

In December 2003, we
committed to a plan to sell the assets and operations of our former reporting
unit that sold

jane

brand products and we sold
them in February 2004.  As a result, all
consolidated statements of earnings information in the consolidated financial
statements and footnotes for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 has been restated for
comparative purposes to reflect that reporting unit as discontinued
operations.  Earnings data of the
discontinued operation for fiscal 2001 is not material to the consolidated
results of operations and has not been restated.

(f)

Net earnings, net
earnings attributable to common stock, net earnings per common share from
continuing operations and net earnings per common share for the year ended June
30, 2003 included a special charge related to the proposed settlement of a
legal action of $13.5 million, after-tax, or $.06 per diluted common share.

(g)

Net earnings, net
earnings attributable to common stock, net earnings per common share from
continuing operations and net earnings per common share for the year ended June
30, 2002 included a restructuring charge of $76.9 million (of which $0.5
million was included in discontinued operations), after tax, or $.32 per
diluted common share, and a one-time charge of $20.6 million, or $.08 per
common share, attributable to the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets,” which is attributable to our former reporting
unit that sold

jane

brand products and is
included in discontinued operations.

(h)

Net earnings, net
earnings attributable to common stock, net earnings per common share from
continuing operations and net earnings per common share for the year ended June
30, 2001 included restructuring and other non-recurring charges of $40.3
million, after tax, or $.17 per diluted common share, and a one-time charge of
$2.2 million, after tax, or $.01 per diluted common share, attributable to the
cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

Certain
amounts in the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been
reclassified to conform to current year presentation for comparative purposes.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of
our financial condition at June 30, 2005 and our results of operations for the
three fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 are based upon our consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. 
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  These judgments can be subjective and
complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those
estimates.  Our most critical accounting
policies relate to revenue recognition; concentration of credit risk;
inventory; pension and other postretirement benefit costs; goodwill and other
intangible assets; income taxes; and derivatives.

Management of the Company has
discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of
estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.


Revenue Recognition

Revenues from merchandise sales
are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the
customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.  In the Americas region, sales are generally
recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and, in the
Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally
recognized based upon the customer’s receipt. 
In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of
sale (e.g., at our retail stores).

Sales are reported on a net
sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of
actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with
retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.  Our practice is to accept product returns
from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved.  In accepting returns, we typically provide a
credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.  As a percentage of gross sales, returns were
4.7%, 4.6% and 5.1% in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Our sales
return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on
reported net sales.

This
accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future
returns and information provided by authorized retailers regarding their
inventory levels.  Consideration of these
factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects
increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.  Experience has shown a relationship between
retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well
as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our
business.  In addition, as necessary,
specific accruals may be established for significant future known or
anticipated events.  The types of known
or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider,
include, but are not limited to, the solvency of our customers, store closings
by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue or
support new and existing products.

Concentration of Credit Risk

An entity is vulnerable to
concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it
would have had it mitigated its risks through diversification of
customers.  The significance of such
credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration.

We have three major customers
that owned and operated retail stores that in the aggregate accounted for
$1,403.1 million, or 22%, of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2005 and
$187.9 million, or 24%, of our accounts receivable at June 30, 2005.  These customers sell products primarily
within North America.  Our two largest
customers, Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores
Company, merged on August 30, 2005. 
Although management believes that our major customers are sound and
creditworthy, a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a
corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows and/or
financial condition.

In the ordinary course of
business, we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer
deductions in the amount of $28.9 million and $30.1 million as of June 30, 2005
and 2004, respectively.  Our allowance for doubtful accounts is a
subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net
earnings.  The allowance for doubtful
accounts was reduced by $12.6 million, $25.6 million and $30.3 million for
customer deductions and write-offs in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
and increased by $11.4 million, $23.9 million and $31.5 million for additional
provisions in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  This reserve is based upon the evaluation of
accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends.

Inventory

We state
our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value, with cost being
determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.  We believe FIFO most closely matches the flow
of our products from manufacture through sale. 
The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products,
promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that
will be sold or used in future periods. 
Inventory cost includes raw materials, direct labor and overhead.

We also record an inventory
obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the
inventory and its estimated market value, based on various product sales
projections.  This reserve is calculated
using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on
age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.  In addition, and as necessary, we may
establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.

Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefit Costs

We offer the following benefits
to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified
defined benefit pension plan (“U.S. Qualified Plan”) and an unfunded,
nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in
excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S. Qualified Plan, the
“Domestic Plans”); a contributory defined contribution plan; international
pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and
defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation; and certain other
postretirement benefits.


The amounts necessary to fund
future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and
variables.  Certain significant variables
require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an
anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and future
compensation levels.  We evaluate these
assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted
industry ranges, although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or
economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net
earnings.

The pre-retirement discount
rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is
based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.  For fiscal 2005, we used a pre-retirement
discount rate for our Domestic Plans of 6.00% and varying rates on our
international plans of between 2.25% and 6.00%. 
The pre-retirement rate for our Domestic Plans is based on a bond
portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent,
from a major rating agency.  We believe
the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this
portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of
our Domestic Plans.  For fiscal 2005, we
used an expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and
varying rates of between 3.25% and 7.50% for our international plans.  In determining the long-term rate of return
for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan’s
investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies.  The U.S. Qualified Plan asset allocation as
of June 30, 2005 was approximately 67% equity investments, 26% fixed income
investments and 7% other investments. 
The asset allocation of our combined international plans as of June 30,
2005 was approximately 62% equity investments, 32% fixed income investments and
6% other investments.  The difference
between actual and expected returns on plan assets is accumulated and amortized
over future periods and, therefore, affects our recorded obligations and
recognized expenses in such future periods. 
For fiscal 2005, our pension plans had actual returns on assets of $43.2
million as compared with expected returns on assets of $35.3 million, which
resulted in a net deferred gain of $7.9 million.

A 25 basis-point change in the
discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the
following effect on fiscal 2005 pension expense:

Our postretirement plans are
comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend
rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported.  A one-percentage-point change in assumed
health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2005 would have had the following
effects:

For fiscal 2006, we will use a
pre-retirement discount rate for the Domestic Plans of 5.25% and varying rates
for our international plans of between 1.75% and 5.25%.  We anticipate using an expected return on
plan assets of 7.75% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates for our
international pension plans of between 2.75% and 7.50%.  The net change in these assumptions from those
used in fiscal 2005 will cause approximately a $6.5 million increase in pension
expense in fiscal 2006.  We will continue
to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them
accordingly.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

Goodwill is calculated as the
excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their
underlying net assets.  Other intangible
assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks.  Goodwill and other intangible assets that
have an indefinite life are not amortized.

On an annual basis, or sooner
if certain events or circumstances warrant, we test goodwill and other
intangible assets for impairment.  To
determine the fair value of these intangible assets, there are many assumptions
and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing.  We have the ability to influence the outcome
and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose.  To mitigate undue influence, we use industry
accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by
various levels of management.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes.”  This statement
establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of
income taxes that result from an enterprise’s activities during the current and
preceding years.  It requires an asset
and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes.


As of June 30, 2005, we have
current net deferred tax assets of $85.3 million and non-current net deferred
tax liabilities of $68.1 million.  The
net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization,
as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.  Included
in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately $5.1
million for deferred tax assets, which relates to foreign tax loss
carryforwards not utilized to date, where management believes it is more likely
than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant
jurisdiction.  Based on our assessments,
no additional valuation allowance is required. 
If we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an
adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at
that time.

We provide tax reserves for
Federal, state, local and international exposures relating to audit results,
tax planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities.  The development of these reserves requires
judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective
critical estimate.  Although the outcome
of these tax audits is uncertain, in management’s opinion adequate provisions
for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities emanating from these
reviews.  If actual outcomes differ
materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our
results of operations.

Derivatives

We account for derivative
financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging
activities.  This statement also requires
the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities
on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value.

We currently use derivative
financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest
rates, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign
currencies.  We do not utilize
derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  Hedge effectiveness is documented, assessed
and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and
monitor the instruments.  Variables that
are external to us such as social, political and economic risks may have an impact
on our hedging program and the results thereof. 
For a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to
our derivative financial instruments, refer to “

Liquidity
and Capital Resources –Market Risk.”

Quantitative Analysis

During the three-year period
ended June 30, 2005, there have not been material changes in the assumptions
underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant
estimates, since the results of our business underlying these assumptions have
not differed significantly from our expectations.

While we believe that the
estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations
for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions
could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net
sales, cost of sales, operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as
they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, allowance for
doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.  For fiscal 2005, had these estimates been
changed simultaneously by 2.5% in either direction, our reported gross profit
would have increased or decreased by approximately $4.5 million, operating expenses
would have changed by approximately $0.7 million and the provision for income
taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.8 million.  The collective impact of these changes on operating
income, net earnings and net earnings per diluted common share would be an
increase or decrease of approximately $5.2 million, $6.0 million and $0.03,
respectively.


RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

We manufacture, market and sell
skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in
over 130 countries and territories.  The
following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Note 2 and Note
17 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods
presented.  Products and services that do
not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been
included in the “other” category.

In February 2004, we sold the
assets and operations of our reporting unit that sold

jane

brand products.  Based on an assessment
of the tangible and intangible assets of this business, we determined that the
carrying amount of these assets as then reflected on our consolidated balance
sheets exceeded their estimated fair value. 
Accordingly, we recorded an after-tax charge to discontinued operations
of $33.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.  The charge represented the impairment of
goodwill in the amount of $26.4 million, the reduction in value of other
tangible assets of $2.1 million, net of tax, and the operating loss of $4.8
million, net of tax, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.  Included in that operating loss were
additional costs associated with the sale and discontinuation of the business.  All consolidated statement of earnings
information for fiscal 2003 has been restated for comparative purposes,
including restatement of the makeup product category and the Americas region
data.

* Refer to the following
discussion in

“Fiscal 2004 as Compared with Fiscal 2003 – Operating
Expenses”

for further information regarding these charges.


The following table presents
certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales:

Fiscal 2005 as Compared with
Fiscal 2004

In order to meet the demands of
consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established
products through advertising, sampling and merchandising and phase out existing
products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers.  The economics of developing, producing and launching
these new products influence our sales and operating performance each
period.  The introduction of new products
may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take
into account in our business planning.

Net Sales

Net sales increased 9% or $545.9 million to $6,336.3
million reflecting growth in all major product categories, led by makeup and
skin care, and growth in all geographic regions, led by Europe, the Middle East
& Africa.  Excluding the impact of
foreign currency translation, net sales increased 7%.

Product Categories

Skin Care

Net sales of skin care products
increased 10% or $212.0 million to $2,352.1 million.  Approximately $179 million of this sales
increase was related to the introduction of Future Perfect Anti-Wrinkle
Radiance Creme SPF 15 and launches in the Perfectionist and Re-Nutriv product
lines by Estée Lauder, launches of Superdefense Triple Action Moisturizers SPF
25 and certain Repairwear products by Clinique, the introduction of certain American
Beauty and Good Skin™ products and the recent launch of Modern Friction by
Origins.  On a combined basis, strong
sales of products in Clinique’s 3-Step Skin Care System and The Lifting Face
Serum & The Lifting Intensifier by La Mer contributed approximately $29
million to the sales increase.  Partially
offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately $52 million in sales
of Perfectionist Correcting Serum for Lines/Wrinkles, Idealist Micro-D Deep Thermal
Refinisher, and the White Light and LightSource lines of products by Estée
Lauder.  Excluding the impact of foreign
currency translation, skin care net sales increased 7%.


Makeup

Makeup net sales increased 13% or $274.8 million to
$2,423.1 million.  The growth included
approximately $62 million of net sales from the launches of American Beauty and
Flirt!, and higher sales of Bobbi Brown and Stila products, collectively.  An increase of approximately $105 million was
attributable to the recent launches of Superbalanced Compact Makeup SPF 20 and
Colour Surge Eye Shadow from Clinique and Lash XL Maximum Length Mascara,
Tender Blush, Pure Pops Brush-on Color and AeroMatte Ultralucent Pressed Powder
by Estée Lauder.  Also contributing to
sales growth was approximately $70 million of increased sales from M

ž

A

ž

C’s
Small Eye Shadow, Studio Fix, Lustreglass and Pro Longwear Lipcolour.  Partially offsetting these increases was a
decrease of approximately $38 million in sales of the High Impact Mascara and
High Impact Eye Shadow collections and the Glosswear line of products by
Clinique as well as of Pure Color Lip Vinyl by Estée Lauder.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, makeup net sales increased 11%.

Fragrance

Net sales of fragrance products
increased 3% or $39.5 million to $1,260.6 million.  The increase was due to approximately $188
million in sales generated by the fiscal 2005 launches of DKNY Be Delicious and
DKNY Be Delicious Men, True Star from Tommy Hilfiger, Lauder Beyond Paradise
Men from Estée Lauder, Happy To Be from Clinique and Donald Trump The
Fragrance.  Partially offsetting the new
product sales were decreases in sales of approximately $92 million of Estée
Lauder Beyond Paradise, Aramis Life and Clinique Simply, which were launched in
the prior year, as well as decreases in sales of approximately $49 million of
Tommy Jeans and Tommy from Tommy Hilfiger, certain other Aramis products and
Lauder Intuition Men from Estée Lauder. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net
sales increased slightly.  We expect the
fragrance category to remain challenging in fiscal 2006.

Hair Care

Hair care net sales increased 10% to $273.9
million.  This increase amounting to
$24.5 million was due to sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble
products.  Aveda net sales increased as a
result of sales of new professional color products and the introductions of
Pure Abundance and Damage Remedy hair care products, while Bumble and bumble
benefited from recent launches in its hair and scalp treatment line of products
and the initial shipments of Crème de Coco shampoos and conditioners.  Both of these brands also benefited from new
points of distribution.  Excluding the
impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 9%.

Geographic Regions

Net sales in the Americas increased 7% or $233.4
million to $3,382.2 million.  This region
experienced growth in all major categories which was fueled by the
diversification in our product offerings as new products and brands mitigated
challenges among certain core brands and successful prior year launches.  In the United States, our makeup artist and
hair care brands along with products from our Aramis and Designer Fragrances
Division contributed approximately $147 million to the increase.  In addition, higher net sales in Canada and
the inclusion of BeautyBank products contributed approximately $78 million,
collectively.  The Americas region may be
adversely impacted by the August 2005 merger of Federated Department Stores,
Inc. and The May Department Stores Company.

In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales
increased 13% or $248.4 million to $2,118.6 million primarily due to higher net
sales in the United Kingdom, our travel retail business, Spain, Portugal, South
Africa and Greece of approximately $181 million, collectively.  The increase in net sales included benefits
from the effect of the weaker U.S. dollar as compared to various European
currencies.  Excluding the impact of
foreign currency translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa
increased 7%.

Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 8% or $64.1
million to $835.5 million.  This increase
reflected higher net sales of approximately $51 million in China, Hong Kong,
Australia and Taiwan, partially offset by lower sales in Japan of approximately
$3 million.  Excluding the impact of
foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 4%.

We strategically stagger our
new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in
regional sales growth.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales as a percentage
of total net sales was 25.5% and remained unchanged compared with the prior
year.  Favorable net changes in
production and supply chain efforts of approximately 30 basis points, primarily
driven by favorable material sourcing, were offset by the net change in the mix
of our business within our geographic regions and product categories, as
discussed above, which includes the impact of the BeautyBank brands.  Changes in exchange rates compared with the
prior year had a de minimis net impact on our cost of sales margin.

The higher price of oil is
beginning to impact our cost of raw materials and componentry, however, we
believe this will not have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales
margin in the near future.


Since certain promotional
activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level
of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and
expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales
percentage.  In addition, future cost of
sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and
product cost structures different from those of our existing brands.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales
improved to 63.1% from 63.4% in the prior fiscal year.  Our planned increase in advertising,
merchandising and sampling over the prior year of approximately 50 basis points
was offset in full by our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses
in line with our business needs.  We also
realized a benefit of approximately 30 basis points from the elimination of
royalty payments previously made to Mrs. Estée Lauder.  In fiscal 2006, we will experience an
increase in operating expenses due to the recognition of costs related to employee
stock-based compensation as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payment” (see “

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

”).

Changes in advertising, sampling and merchandising
spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to
product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized.

Operating Results

Based on the growth of net sales, our constant cost of
sales margin and the improvement in our operating expense margin as previously
discussed, operating income increased 12% or $76.6 million to $720.6 million as
compared with the prior fiscal year. 
Operating margins were 11.4% of net sales in the current period as
compared with 11.1% in the prior fiscal year.

Product Categories

Operating income increased 14% or $37.2 million in
makeup and 9% or $29.5 million in skin care reflecting overall sales growth and
sales of recently launched products. 
Operating results also increased 44% or $11.0 million in fragrance
reflecting sales growth from new and recently launched products.  While we experienced improved results in
fiscal 2005 due to these new launches, the fragrance business continues to be
challenging.  Hair care operating results
decreased 3% or $0.8 million reflecting an increase in operating expenses
related to the growth of our business in the United States as well as the
opening of new points of distribution in Korea and Japan, partially offset by
increases in net sales as previously discussed. 
Hair care results were also adversely impacted in fiscal 2005 by the
need to make alternative arrangements due to the bankruptcy of a third-party
supplier.  The situation was rectified
during fiscal 2005.

Geographic Regions

Operating income in the Americas increased 12% or
$38.0 million to $357.2 million, primarily due to higher net sales resulting
from an overall improvement in the retail environment, strong product launches
and growth from our newer brands.  As
noted above, we expect results in the Americas region to be adversely impacted
by the August 2005 merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May
Department Stores Company.

In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating
income increased 12% or $31.7 million to $306.1 million primarily due to
improved results from our travel retail business, Spain, the United Kingdom and
Switzerland of approximately $34 million, collectively.  Partially offsetting this improvement were
lower results in France, which was negatively impacted by the consolidation of
major retailers, and in Russia, where we converted our business from a
distributor to a direct subsidiary, of approximately $5 million on a combined
basis.

In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 14% or
$6.9 million to $57.3 million.  This
increase reflected improved results in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan of
approximately $11 million, collectively, partially offset by a decrease in operating
income in Korea and China of approximately $6 million, combined.  As China is an emerging market for us, we
have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in new brand expansion and
business opportunities.  In addition, the
Asia/Pacific region did not realize the benefits of spending behind new
whitening products, which experienced a delay in launching during fiscal 2005.

Interest Expense, Net

Net interest expense was $13.9 million as compared
with $27.1 million in the prior year. 
The decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a $16.5
million decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the redemption of
$291.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Preferred Stock on June
10, 2004 and the reduction in the dividend rate on the remaining $68.4 million
of the 2015 Preferred Stock.  This
improvement was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result
of higher debt balances and, to a lesser extent, higher interest rates.


Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes
represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.  The effective rate for income taxes for
fiscal 2005 was 41.2% as compared with 37.7% in the prior year.  The effective rate differs from statutory
rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign
jurisdictions, the effect of repatriating foreign earnings and certain
nondeductible expenses.

During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005, we formulated a plan to repatriate approximately $690 million of
foreign earnings in fiscal 2006, which includes $500 million of extraordinary
intercompany dividends under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004 (the “AJCA”).  This action
resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million in fiscal 2005,
which included an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million.

The increase in the effective
income tax rate was attributable to the incremental tax charge resulting from
the repatriation plan of approximately 390 basis points and an increase of
approximately 120 basis points resulting from our foreign operations.  These increases were partially offset by a
reduction in the amount of nondeductible preferred stock dividends of
approximately 100 basis points, a decrease in state and local income taxes of
approximately 40 basis points and an increase in tax credits of approximately
20 basis points.

Net Earnings

Net earnings and diluted net
earnings per common share increased approximately 19% and 20%,
respectively.  Net earnings as compared
with the prior fiscal year improved $64.0 million to $406.1 million and diluted
net earnings per common share improved to $1.78 from $1.48.  Net earnings from continuing operations
increased by $30.7 million or 8% and diluted net earnings per common share from
continuing operations increased 10% to $1.78 from $1.62 in the prior fiscal
year.  The planned repatriation of
foreign earnings in accordance with the AJCA, as discussed above, resulted in
an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million, or $0.12 per diluted
common share.  As noted above, net
earnings in fiscal 2006 are expected to be adversely impacted by the adoption
of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” 
In addition, we expect results in the Americas region to be adversely impacted
by the August 2005 merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May
Department Stores Company.

Fiscal 2004 as Compared with
Fiscal 2003

Net Sales

Net sales increased 14% or
$694.4 million to $5,790.4 million, reflecting growth in all product categories
and all geographic regions led by double-digit growth in Europe, the Middle
East & Africa and Asia/Pacific and the inclusion of a full year of net
sales of the Darphin line of products, which was acquired during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003.  Net sales
results in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific benefited from
the weakening of the U.S. dollar. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales
increased 9%.

Product Categories

Skin Care

Net sales of skin care products
increased 13% or $246.4 million to $2,140.1 million.  Approximately $60 million of this increase
was attributable to the new launches of Hydra Complete Multi-Level Moisture
Cream and Idealist Micro-D Deep Thermal Refinisher by Estée Lauder and Pore
Minimizer by Clinique.  Additionally,
growth of approximately $134 million was due to strong sales of Clinique’s
3-Step Skin Care System and the Repairwear line of products from Clinique,
Re-Nutriv Intensive Lift Serum and Re-Nutriv Intensive Eye Crème by Estée
Lauder and the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the Darphin line of
products, which are primarily skin care. 
Partially offsetting these increases were approximately $34 million of
lower net sales of certain existing products such as Advanced Stop Signs by
Clinique and White Light and LightSource product lines by Estée Lauder.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, skin care net sales increased 8%.

Makeup

Makeup net sales increased 14%
or $260.5 million to $2,148.3 million, in part, due to net sales increases of
our M

ž

A

ž

C
and Bobbi Brown makeup artist lines of approximately $122 million,
collectively.  The increase in net sales
also reflected approximately $79 million from the fiscal 2004 launches of Ideal
Matte Refinishing Makeup SPF 8 and Electric Intense LipCreme by Estée Lauder
and Perfectly Real Makeup and Colour Surge Bare Brilliance by Clinique.  Also contributing to net sales growth were
strong sales of approximately $53 million of High Impact Mascara, High Impact
Eye Shadow and Skin Clarifying Makeup by Clinique, as well as Pure Color Lip
Vinyl and Artist’s Lip and Eye Pencils from Estée Lauder.  Partially offsetting these increases were
approximately $30 million of lower net sales of certain existing products such
as So Ingenious Multi-Dimension Liquid Makeup and Pure Color Lipstick from
Estée Lauder and Moisture Surge Lipstick from Clinique.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, makeup net sales increased 10%.


Fragrance

Net sales of fragrance products
increased 15% or $161.5 million to $1,221.1 million, primarily attributable to
the fiscal 2004 launches of Estée Lauder Beyond
Paradise, Aramis Life, Clinique Simply and the Tommy Jeans collection, which
together contributed approximately $194 million to the growth.  These product launches primarily contributed
to increased fragrance net sales outside the United States and are inclusive of
improved results from our travel retail business.  These net sales increases were partially
offset by lower net sales of Estée Lauder

pleasures

,
Intuition and Beautiful, certain Tommy Hilfiger products and Clinique Happy of
approximately $90 million, collectively. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net
sales increased 10%.

Hair Care

Hair care net sales increased
9% or $20.5 million to $249.4 million. 
This increase resulted from sales growth from Aveda and Bumble and
bumble products due to an increase in sales at existing salons and spas, new salon
and spa openings and the success of new and existing products.  Aveda net sales also increased as a result of
the opening of new Company-owned Aveda Experience Centers.  Partially offsetting the increase were lower
net sales of Clinique’s Simple Hair Care System.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, hair care net sales increased 7%.

The introduction of new
products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products,
which we take into account in our business planning.

Geographic Regions

Net sales in the Americas
increased 7% or $217.0 million to $3,148.8 million, primarily reflecting growth
from our newer brands, the success of newly launched products and increases
from most of our freestanding retail stores, all of which reflected the
strengthening retail environment.

In Europe, the Middle East
& Africa, net sales increased 24% or $363.8 million to $1,870.2 million.  About $272 million was due to higher net
sales from our travel retail business, the United Kingdom, Spain, Greece and
South Africa, as well as the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the
Darphin line of products.  The increase includes
the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S.
dollar.  Excluding the impact of foreign
currency translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa
increased 14%.

Net sales in Asia/Pacific
increased 17% or $113.6 million to $771.4 million, primarily due to higher net
sales of approximately $83 million in Japan, Australia, Taiwan, China and
Thailand.  Excluding the impact of
foreign currency translation, net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 9%.

We strategically stagger our
new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in
regional sales growth.

COST OF
SALES

Cost of sales as a percentage
of total net sales improved to 25.5% from 26.0% reflecting production and
supply chain efficiencies of approximately 70 basis points and lower costs from
promotional activities of approximately 60 basis points.  Partially offsetting these improvements were
changes in exchange rates of approximately 40 basis points and costs related to
inventory obsolescence and reconditioning and re-handling of goods of
approximately 20 basis points.  Also
offsetting these improvements were costs associated with higher travel retail
sales, which contributed approximately 10 basis points.  Travel retail has a higher cost of goods sold
percentage because of its higher mix of fragrance sales coupled with its margin
structure.

Since certain promotional activities
are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of
promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect
to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage.  In addition, future cost of sales mix may be
impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost
structures different than our existing brands.

OPERATING
EXPENSES

Our
fiscal 2003 results, as reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”), included an adjustment for a special pre-tax
charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million after tax, equal to $.06 per diluted
common share, in connection with the proposed settlement of a class action
lawsuit brought against us and a number of other defendants.  The amount of the charge in this case is
significantly larger than similar charges we have incurred individually or in
the aggregate for legal proceedings in any prior year, and, at that time, we did
not expect to take a charge of a similar magnitude for a single matter like it
in the near future.  In the following
discussions, we include the results as reported and the non-GAAP results.  We have presented the non-GAAP results
because of the special nature of the charge, which affects comparability from
period to period.  We believe that such
measures provide investors with a view of our ongoing business trends and
results of continuing operations.  This
is consistent with the approach used by management in its evaluation and
monitoring of such trends and results and provides investors with a base for
evaluating future periods.  There were no
events or transactions subsequent to fiscal 2003 for which we believe such a
discussion would be relevant.


In fiscal
2003, operating expenses and operating income in accordance with GAAP were
$3,267.9 million or 64.1% of net sales and $503.7 million or 9.9% of net sales,
respectively.  Before the charge (non-GAAP results) operating expenses would
have been $3,245.9 million or 63.7% of net sales and operating income would
have been $525.7 million or 10.3% of net sales.

While we
consider the non-GAAP financial measures useful in analyzing our results, it is
not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included
in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP.

Fiscal 2004 operating expenses
decreased to 63.4% of net sales as compared with 64.1% of net sales in fiscal
2003.  Before considering the effect of
the special charge, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased
30 basis points from 63.7% in fiscal 2003. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately
100 basis points primarily due to the higher growth rate in net sales,
particularly in the travel retail business, as well as our ongoing cost
containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs,
partially offset by operating expenses related to BeautyBank, the higher
operating costs associated with newly acquired brands and expenses related to
compliance with new regulatory requirements (such as those arising under the
Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002).  Partially
offsetting the net favorability in fiscal 2004 were higher levels of
advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses incurred to support new and
recently launched products of approximately 70 basis points.

Changes in advertising,
sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing and level of
activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets
being emphasized.

Under agreements covering our
purchase of trademarks for a percentage of related sales, royalty payments
totaling $18.8 million and $20.3 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively,
have been charged to expense.  Such
payments were made to Mrs. Estée Lauder until her death on April 24, 2004,
after which time the final payments ceased to accrue and were made to a
trust.  This event resulted in a
reduction of operating expenses in fiscal 2004 of $3.7 million, or $2.2 million
after tax.  We realized a benefit from
the elimination of these royalty payments in fiscal 2005.

OPERATING
RESULTS

Operating income increased 28%
or $140.3 million to $644.0 million. 
Operating margins were 11.1% of net sales in fiscal 2004 as compared
with 9.9% in fiscal 2003.  Absent the
special charge, operating income increased 23% or $118.3 million and operating
margins increased 80 basis points from fiscal 2003.  These increases in operating income and
operating margin reflect sales growth, improvements in the components of cost
of sales and a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales.

Net earnings and diluted net
earnings per common share increased approximately 7% and 17%,
respectively.  Net earnings improved
$22.3 million to $342.1 million and diluted net earnings per common share
increased by 17% from $1.26 to $1.48. 
Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $49.8 million or
15% and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations
increased 26% to $1.62 from $1.29 in the prior year.  Absent the special charge, net earnings from
continuing operations increased by $36.3 million or 11% and diluted net earnings
per common share from continuing operations increased 21% from $1.35.

The following discussions of
Operating Results by

Product Categories

and

Geographic Regions

exclude the impact of
the fiscal 2003 special charge.  We
believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner
in which we conduct and view our business.

Product Categories

Operating income increased 23%
to $336.3 million in skin care, 25% to $257.7 million in makeup and 59% to
$23.6 million in hair care reflecting overall sales growth and new product
launches.  Operating income decreased 23%
to $24.8 million in fragrance reflecting the softness in that product category
in the United States as well as increased support spending related to new
product launch activities.

Geographic Regions

Operating income in the
Americas increased 25% or $63.9 million to $319.2 million due to sales growth
resulting from an improved retail environment, strong product launches and
growth from newer brands.  In Europe, the
Middle East & Africa, operating income increased 21% or $46.7 million to
$274.4 million primarily due to significantly improved results from our travel
retail business, improved operating results in the United Kingdom and Spain as
well as the addition of a full year of results of the Darphin line of products,
all of which contributed approximately $71 million to the increase.  Partially offsetting these increases were
approximately $26 million of lower gains on foreign exchange transactions and
lower results in Switzerland and Italy due to difficult market conditions,
collectively.  In Asia/Pacific, operating
income increased 18% or $7.7 million to $50.4 million.  This increase reflected improved results in
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand, partially offset by lower results in Korea, of
approximately $7 million, combined.


INTEREST
EXPENSE, NET

Net interest expense was $27.1
million as compared with $8.1 million in fiscal 2003.  The increase in net interest expense was due
to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock of $17.4
million as interest expense in fiscal 2004. 
This change in reporting resulted from a change in accounting standards
which prohibited us from restating fiscal 2003 results.  To a lesser extent, interest expense was also
affected by higher average net borrowings and a marginally higher effective
interest rate on our debt portfolio.

PROVISION
FOR INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes
represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.  The effective rate for income taxes for
fiscal 2004 was 37.7% as compared with 32.9% in fiscal 2003.  These rates differ from statutory rates,
reflecting the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign
jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses.  The
increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the inclusion of
the dividends on redeemable preferred stock as interest expense, which are not
deductible for income tax purposes (approximately 100 basis points), the mix of
global earnings (approximately 150 basis points) and, to a lesser extent, the
timing of certain tax planning initiatives. 
The fiscal 2003 rate included benefits derived from certain favorable
tax negotiations (approximately 230 basis points).

FINANCIAL
CONDITION

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our principal sources of funds
historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under
commercial paper, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed
and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United
States and abroad.  At June 30, 2005, we
had cash and cash equivalents of $553.3 million compared with $611.6 million at
June 30, 2004.

At June 30, 2005, our
outstanding borrowings of $714.7 million included: (i) $246.3 million of 6%
Senior Notes due January 2012 consisting of $250.0 million principal,
unamortized debt discount of $0.8 million and a $2.9 million adjustment to
reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap; (ii) $197.4
million of 5.75% Senior Notes due October 2033 consisting of $200.0 million
principal and unamortized debt discount of $2.6 million; (iii) $68.4 million of
2015 Preferred Stock, which shares have been put to us and we intend to redeem
them on October 26, 2005; (iv) a 3.0 billion yen term loan (approximately $27.2
million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2005), which is due in March 2006; (v)
a 1.8 million Euro note (approximately $2.2 million at the exchange rate at
June 30, 2005) payable semi-annually through February 2008 at a variable
interest rate; (vi) $9.0 million of capital lease obligations; (vii) $148.0
million of outstanding short-term commercial paper payable through July 2005 at
an average interest rate of 3.08%; and (viii) $16.2 million of other short-term
borrowings.

We have a $750.0 million
commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the
United States.  Our commercial paper is
currently rated A-1 by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s.  Our long-term credit ratings are A+ with a
stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A1 with a stable outlook by Moody’s.  At June 30, 2005, we had $148.0 million of
commercial paper outstanding, which is being refinanced on a periodic basis as it
matures at then prevailing market interest rates.  We also have an effective shelf registration
statement covering the potential issuance of up to an additional $300.0 million
in debt securities and $168.5 million in additional uncommitted credit
facilities, of which $16.2 million was used as of June 30, 2005.

Effective May 27, 2005, we
entered into a five-year $600.0 million senior revolving credit facility,
expiring on May 27, 2010.  The new
facility replaced our prior, unused $400.0 million revolving credit facility,
which was effective since June 28, 2001. 
The new revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate
purposes, including financing working capital, and also as credit support for
our commercial paper program.  Up to the
equivalent of $250 million of the facility is available for multi-currency
loans.  The interest rate on borrowings
under the credit facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is
the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or ½% plus
the Federal funds rate.  We incurred debt
issuance costs of $0.3 million which will be amortized over the term of the
facility.  The credit facility has an
annual fee of $0.4 million, payable quarterly, based on our current credit
ratings.  As of June 30, 2005, this
facility was unused, and we were in compliance with all related financial and
other restrictive covenants, including limitations on indebtedness and liens.

On June 28, 2005, we received a
notice of exercise of the put right from the holder of the remaining $68.4
million of the 2015 Preferred Stock, which requires us to purchase the
preferred stock, plus any cumulative and unpaid dividends thereon, on or before
October 26, 2005.  We plan to purchase
the preferred stock on that date and to pay the anticipated dividends from July
1, 2005 through that date of $0.5 million at a rate based on the after-tax
yield on six-month U.S. Treasuries of 2.10%, which was reset on July 1, 2005.


Our business is seasonal in
nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.  From time to time, we may enter into
investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.  To the extent that our needs exceed cash from
operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper,
issue long-term debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility.

Total debt as a percent of
total capitalization was 30% at June 30, 2005 as compared with 24% at June 30,
2004.  This increase primarily reflected
the issuance of short-term commercial paper in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2005.

The effects of inflation have
not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.  Generally, we have been able to introduce new
products at higher selling prices or

increase
selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases, which have been moderate.

We believe that our cash on
hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to
credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business
operations and capital expenditures on both a near-term and long-term basis.

Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating
activities was $479.2 million in fiscal 2005 as compared with $675.4 million in
fiscal 2004 and $558.6 million in fiscal 2003. 
The net decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal 2005 as compared
with fiscal 2004 reflected changes in certain working capital accounts,
partially offset by decreases in net deferred taxes and an increase in net
earnings from continuing operations.  The
change in other accrued liabilities primarily reflected the payment of significant
deferred compensation and supplemental payments made to retired executives in
fiscal 2005.  Accounts receivable
increased as a result of sales growth in the current fiscal year, reflecting
growth in international markets and customers which generally carry longer
payment terms.  The timing of payments
from certain domestic customers as well as shipments that occurred later in the
period also contributed to increased accounts receivable.  The increase in inventory was primarily due
to actual and anticipated sales levels, the building of safety stock in our new
distribution center in Europe, and, to a lesser extent, the inclusion of new
points of distribution such as Kohl’s Department Stores for our BeautyBank brands
and new affiliate activities.  The
shift in cash activities related to accounts payable reflected the timing of
disbursements year-over-year as well as the initiation of a vendor-managed
inventory program.  Net

deferred
taxes decreased primarily as a result of the anticipated repatriation of
foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 as a result of the AJCA and the realization of
the tax benefits related to payments made to retired executives.  The improvement in net operating cash flows
for fiscal 2004 as compared with fiscal 2003 reflected increased net earnings
from continuing operations and an increase in accrued costs.  Changes in operating assets and liabilities
reflected partially offsetting increases in accounts payable and inventory in
anticipation of product launches in fiscal 2005, higher accounts receivable in
line with sales growth, and changes in other assets and accrued liabilities
that reflect receipts and accruals from employee compensation and benefit
related transactions as well as selling, advertising and merchandising
activities.

Net cash used for investing
activities was $237.0 million in fiscal 2005, compared with $213.6 million in
fiscal 2004 and $198.0 million in fiscal 2003. 
Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2005 and 2004 primarily
related to capital expenditures.  Net
cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2003 primarily related to
capital expenditures and the acquisition of Darphin and certain Aveda
distributors.  In fiscal 2006, we expect
to make a payment of approximately $38 million to satisfy an earn-out provision
related to our acquisition of Jo Malone Limited in October 1999, which payment
may be satisfied by the issuance of a note to the seller.

Capital expenditures amounted
to $229.6 million, $212.1 million and $168.6 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.  Incremental spending
in fiscal 2005 primarily reflected the beginning of a company-wide initiative
to upgrade our information systems as well as the investment in leasehold
improvements in our corporate offices. 
We plan to continue to invest in the upgrade of our information systems in
fiscal 2006 and beyond.  Capital
expenditures in fiscal 2004 and 2003 primarily reflected the continued upgrade
of manufacturing equipment, dies and molds, new store openings, store
improvements, counter construction and information technology
enhancements.  The lower level of capital
expenditures in fiscal 2003 reflected tight control on our spending in light of
then-prevailing economic conditions.

Cash used for financing
activities was $300.4 million, $216.0 million and $555.0 million in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The
net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2005 primarily reflected
common stock repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by the
issuance of short-term commercial paper to fund working capital needs and the
receipt of proceeds from employee stock option transactions.  The net cash used for financing activities in
fiscal 2004 primarily related to the redemption of $291.6 million aggregate
principal amount of the 2015 Preferred Stock, common stock repurchases and
dividend payments partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75%
Senior Notes and from employee stock option transactions.  Net cash used for financing during fiscal
2003 primarily related to common stock repurchases, the repayment of long-term
debt and dividend payments.


Dividends

On November 3, 2004, the Board
of Directors declared an annual dividend of $.40 per share on our Class A and
Class B Common Stock, which was paid on December 28, 2004 to stockholders of
record at the close of business on December 10, 2004.  Common stock dividends paid in fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003 were $90.1 million, $68.5 million and $58.3 million, respectively.  Dividends paid on the preferred stock were
$0.9 million, $17.4 million and $23.4 million for the years ended June 30,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The
decrease in preferred stock dividends in fiscal 2005 and 2004 primarily reflected
the redemption of $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of 2015 Preferred
Stock on June 10, 2004 and the reduction in the dividend rate on the remaining
$68.4 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock. 
The cumulative redeemable preferred stock dividends have been
characterized as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements
of earnings for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004.

Pension Plan Funding and Expense

We maintain pension plans
covering substantially all of our full-time employees for our U.S. operations
and a majority of our international operations. 
Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of
service and employees’ earnings.  In the
United States, we maintain a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined
benefit pension plan (“U.S. Qualified Plan”). 
Additionally, we have an unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory
pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations.  Our international pension plans are comprised
of defined benefit and defined contribution plans.

Several factors influence our
annual funding requirements.  For the
U.S. Qualified Plan, our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a
rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages.  Such contribution is not less than the
minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (“ERISA”), and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the
maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.  For each international plan, our funding
policies are determined by local laws and regulations.  In addition, amounts necessary to fund future
obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as
detailed in “

Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates

”).  The effect on operating results in the future
of pension plan funding will depend on economic conditions, employee
demographics, mortality rates, the number of
participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance
and funding decisions.

For fiscal 2005 and 2004, there
was no minimum contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan required by ERISA.  However, at management’s discretion, we made
cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan of $2.0 million and $33.0 million
during fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. 
During fiscal 2006, we do not expect to make any cash contributions to the
U.S. Qualified Plan.

For fiscal 2005 and 2004, we
made benefit payments under our non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension
plan of $5.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively.  We expect to make benefit payments under this
plan during fiscal 2006 of $9.5 million. 
For fiscal 2005 and 2004, we made cash contributions to our
international pension plans of $29.2 million and $22.9 million, respectively.  We expect to make contributions under these
plans during fiscal 2006 of $19.9 million.

In addition, at June 30, 2005
and 2004, we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan
if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the
accumulated benefit obligation and, accordingly, a benefit or a charge was
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’
equity for the change in such liability. 
During fiscal 2005, we recorded a charge, net of deferred tax, of $11.4
million while in fiscal 2004, we recorded a benefit,
net of deferred tax, of $16.0 million to accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss).

Commitments and Contingencies

On June 28, 2005, we received a
notice of exercise of the put right from the holder of the remaining $68.4
million of the 2015 Preferred Stock, which requires us to purchase the
preferred stock, plus any cumulative and unpaid dividends thereon, on or before
October 26, 2005.  We intend to purchase
the preferred stock on that date and pay the anticipated dividends from July 1,
2005 through that date of $0.5 million at a rate based on the after-tax yield
on six-month U.S. Treasuries of 2.10%, which was reset on July 1, 2005.

Certain
of our business acquisition agreements include “earn-out” provisions.  These provisions generally require that we
pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the
performance of the acquired business. 
The payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our
next earn-out payment will be made in fiscal 2006.  Since the size of each payment depends upon
performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will
have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial
condition.

For additional contingencies,
refer to “

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

.”


Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes
scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are
fixed and determinable as of June 30, 2005:

(1)

Includes long-term and
  short-term debt and the related projected interest costs, and to a lesser
  extent, capital lease commitments.

Refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated
  Financial Statements.

(2)

Refer to
  Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3)

Unconditional
  purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments, estimated
  future earn-out payments, estimated royalty payments
  pursuant to license agreements, advertising commitments, capital improvement
  commitments, planned funding of pension and other postretirement benefit
  obligations and commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements.
  Future earn-out payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were
  estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at
  June 30, 2005, without consideration for potential renewal periods.

Derivative Financial
Instruments and Hedging Activities

We address certain financial
exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use
of derivative financial instruments.  We
primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign
currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange
rates.  We also enter into interest rate
derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates.  We categorize these instruments as entered
into for purposes other than trading.

For each derivative contract
entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment, we
formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged
item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the
hedge.  This process includes linking all
derivatives that are designated as fair-value, cash-flow, or foreign-currency
hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific
firm commitments or forecasted transactions. 
We also formally assess, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing
basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged
items.  If it is determined that a derivative
is not highly effective, then we will be required to discontinue hedge
accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.

Foreign Exchange Risk
Management

We enter into forward exchange
contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables
denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified
exposures.  The purpose of the hedging
activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our
costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries.  Almost all foreign currency contracts are
denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large
financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating
agency.  We also enter into foreign
currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high
probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.  The forward exchange contracts and foreign
currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been
designated as cash-flow hedges.  As of
June 30, 2005, these cash-flow hedges were highly effective, in all material
respects.


As a matter of policy, we only
enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an “A” (or equivalent)
credit rating.  The counterparties to
these contracts are major financial institutions.  We do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty. 
Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the
counterparties is limited to only the recognized, but not realized, gains
attributable to the contracts. 
Management believes risk of default under these hedging contracts is
remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial
results.  The contracts have varying
maturities through the end of June 2006. 
Costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been
material to our consolidated financial results. 
We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.  At June 30, 2005,
we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and
option contracts in the amount of $667.5 million and $120.9 million,
respectively.  The foreign currencies
included in forward exchange contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars)
are principally the Swiss franc ($128.6 million), British pound ($127.6
million), Euro ($123.3 million), Canadian dollar ($78.1 million), Australian
dollar ($43.3 million), Japanese yen ($31.6 million) and South Korean won ($27.6
million).  The foreign currencies
included in the option contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are
principally the Japanese yen ($33.6 million), South Korean won ($26.3 million),
Euro ($21.5 million) and Swiss franc ($20.3 million).

Interest Rate Risk Management

We enter into interest rate
derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates
on our funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent with the
identified exposures.  All interest rate
derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong
investment grade by a major rating agency.

We have an interest rate swap
agreement with a notional amount of $250.0 million to effectively convert fixed
interest on the existing $250.0 million 6% Senior Notes to variable interest
rates based on six-month LIBOR.  We
designated the swap as a fair-value hedge. 
As of June 30, 2005, the fair-value hedge was highly effective, in all
material respects.

Market Risk

We use a value-at-risk model to
assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments.  Value-at-risk represents the potential losses
for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a
specified time period and confidence level. 
We estimate value-at-risk across all of our derivative financial
instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations
calculated over the past 250-day period. 
The measured value-at-risk, calculated as an average, for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2005 related to our foreign exchange contracts and our
interest rate contracts was $6.8 million and $11.2 million, respectively.

The model estimates were
made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level.  We used a statistical simulation model that
valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly
generated market price paths.

Our calculated value-at-risk
exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be
recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming
hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative
of actual results, which may or may not occur. 
It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss
that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those
estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures,
and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial
instruments during the year.

We believe, however, that any
such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on
the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial
instrument was intended.


OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We do not maintain any
off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other
relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a
material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of
operations.

RECENTLY
ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 2005, the Emerging
Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached a consensus on Issue No. 05-6, “Determining
the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements.”  This Issue addresses the amortization period
for leasehold improvements in operating leases that are either (a) placed in
service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of
the initial lease term or (b) acquired in a business combination.  Leasehold improvements that are placed in
service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of
the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the
assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are
deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are
purchased.  Leasehold improvements
acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the
useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and
renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of
acquisition.  This Issue shall be applied
to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods
after June 29, 2005 and we do not expect this Issue to have a material impact
on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2005, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS
143-1, “Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations,” to address the
accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations associated with Directive
2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the “Directive”)
adopted by the European Union (“EU”). 
The Directive effectively obligates a commercial user to incur costs
associated with the retirement of a specified asset that qualifies as
historical waste equipment, as defined in the Directive.  Commercial users of electronic equipment
should apply the provisions of SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations” (“SFAS No. 143”), and the related FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting
for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,” to the obligation associated
with historical waste, since this type of obligation is an asset retirement
obligation.  The initial recognition of
an asset-retirement-cost liability shall be recorded as an equal and offsetting
increase in the carrying amount of the related asset.  Subsequent adjustments to the initial
measurement of the asset and liability shall also be made in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 143.  The
guidance in this FSP shall be applied the later of the first reporting period
ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the adoption of the law by the
applicable EU-member country.  We are
currently evaluating the impact this FSP will have on our consolidated
financial statements, if any.

In May 2005, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” (“SFAS No.
154”) which establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as the
required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence
of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting
principle.  The statement provides
guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in
accounting principle is impracticable. 
The statement also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error
by restating previously issued financial statements.  SFAS No. 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005.  We will
adopt this statement as required, and we do not believe the adoption will have
a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

On December 21, 2004, the FASB
issued FSP FAS 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided
by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP No. 109-1”), and FSP FAS
109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation
Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP No. 109-2”).  These staff positions provide accounting
guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the AJCA that was
signed into law on October 22, 2004.

FSP No. 109-1 states that the
tax relief (special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing) from this
legislation should be accounted for as a “special deduction” instead of a tax
rate reduction.  The special deduction
for domestic manufacturing becomes effective for us in the first quarter of
fiscal 2006.  We believe this legislation
and the provisions of FSP No. 109-1 will not have a significant impact on our
effective tax rate.

FSP No. 109-2 gives a company
additional time to evaluate the effects of the legislation on any plan for
reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying FASB
Statement No. 109.  During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005, we formulated a plan to repatriate approximately $690
million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006, which includes $500 million of
extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the AJCA.  This action resulted in an aggregate tax
charge of approximately $35 million, which included an incremental tax charge
of approximately $28 million in fiscal 2005. 
The overall effective rate for income taxes increased from 37.7% for
fiscal 2004 to 41.2% for fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of the repatriation
plan.


In December 2004, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”).  This statement replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation” and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”  SFAS No. 123(R) requires all stock-based
compensation to be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and
that such cost be measured according to the fair value
of the award.  SFAS No. 123(R) will be
effective for our first quarter of fiscal 2006. 
While we currently provide the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS
No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,”
on a quarterly basis (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–Stock-Based
Compensation), we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have
on our consolidated financial statements. 
In March 2005, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB No. 107”) was
issued to provide guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission to
simplify some of the implementation challenges of SFAS No. 123(R) as this
statement relates to the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for
public companies.  We will apply the
principles of SAB No. 107 in connection with our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

In November 2004, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs - an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4”
(“SFAS No. 151”).  SFAS No. 151 requires
all companies to recognize a current-period charge for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials.  This statement also requires that the
allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on
the normal capacity of the production facilities.  SFAS No. 151 will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005.  We
believe the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.


FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION

We and our representatives from
time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including
statements contained in this and other filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders.  The words and phrases “will likely result,” “expect,”
“believe,” “planned,” “may,” “should”, “could,” “anticipated,” “estimate,” “project”

Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable
assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations,
actual results may differ materially from our expectations.  Factors that could cause actual results to
differ from expectations include, without limitation:

(1) increased competitive activity from companies in the skin
care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses, some of which have greater
resources than we do;

(2) our ability to develop, produce and market
new products on which future operating results may depend;

(3)
consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and reorganizations in the retail
industry causing a decrease in the number of stores that sell our products, an
increase in the ownership concentration within the retail industry, ownership
of retailers by our competitors and ownership of competitors by our customers
that are retailers;

(4) shifts in the preferences of consumers as to where and how
they shop for the types of products and services we sell;

(5) social,
political and economic risks to our foreign or domestic manufacturing,
distribution and retail operations, including changes in foreign investment and
trade policies and regulations of the host countries and of the United States;

(6) changes in
the laws, regulations and policies that affect, or will affect, our business,
including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, trade
rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or
regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result;

(7) foreign
currency fluctuations affecting our results of operations and the value of our
foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors
sell products in the same markets and our operating and manufacturing costs
outside of the United States;

(8) changes in
global or local conditions, including those due to natural or man-made
disasters or energy costs, that could affect consumer purchasing, the willingness
of consumers to travel, the financial strength of our customers or suppliers,
our operations, the cost and availability of capital which we may need for new
equipment, facilities or acquisitions, the cost and availability of raw
materials and the assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates;

(9) shipment
delays, depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from
disruptions of operations at any of the facilities which, due to consolidations
in our manufacturing operations, now manufacture nearly all of our supply of a
particular type of product (i.e., focus factories);

(10) real
estate rates and availability, which may affect our ability to increase the
number of retail locations at which we sell our products and the costs
associated with our other facilities;

(11) changes in product mix to products which are less
profitable;

(12) our ability to acquire or develop new information and
distribution technologies, on a timely basis and within our cost estimates;

(13) our ability to capitalize on opportunities for improved
efficiency, such as globalization, and to integrate acquired businesses and
realize value therefrom;

(14)
consequences attributable to the events that are currently taking place in the
Middle East, including terrorist attacks, retaliation and the threat of further
attacks or retaliation; and

(15) the
impact of repatriating certain of our foreign earnings to the United States in
connection with The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

We assume no responsibility to
update forward-looking statements made herein or otherwise.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

All other schedules are omitted because they are not applicable or the

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of The Estée Lauder
Companies Inc. (including its subsidiaries) (the “Company”) is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended).

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Under the supervision of and with
the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
Officer, the Company’s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework and criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
Based on this assessment, the Company’s management has concluded that,
as of June 30, 2005, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
was effective.

KPMG LLP, the independent registered public
accounting firm that audits the Company’s consolidated financial statements has
issued its attestation report on management’s assessment of internal control
over financial reporting.  That attestation
report follows this report.

maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).  The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.  A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).  Also, in our
opinion, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based
on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of The Estée Lauder Companies
Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
June 30, 2005, and our report dated August 23, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  Our report also refers to the adoption of the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, “Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity,” effective July 1, 2003.

Stockholders

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.:

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and
subsidiaries as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2005.  In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement
schedule as listed on the index on page F-1. 
These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended June 30, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.  Also in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 8 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,” effective July 1, 2003.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and
our report dated August 23, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.
and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as continuing operations,
with the exception of the operating results of its reporting unit that sold

jane

brand products, which have been reflected as
discontinued operations for fiscal 2004 and 2003 (see Note 4).  All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.

Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of prior years
have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation for comparative
purposes.

Net Earnings Per
Common Share

For the years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, net earnings per common
share (“basic EPS”) is computed by dividing net earnings, which includes
preferred stock dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain
conditions).  For the year ended June 30,
2003, basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings, after deducting preferred
stock dividends on the Company’s $6.50 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock
(which was outstanding during such fiscal year and exchanged for the 2015
Preferred Stock in fiscal 2004), by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain
conditions).  Net earnings per common
share assuming dilution (“diluted EPS”) is computed by reflecting potential
dilution from the exercise of stock options.

A
reconciliation

between the numerators and
denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:

F-9

THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As of June 30, 2005, 2004 and
2003, options to purchase 12.5 million, 6.6 million and 13.6 million shares,
respectively, of Class A Common Stock were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS because the exercise prices of those options were greater than the
average market price of the common stock and their inclusion would be
anti-dilutive.  The options were still
outstanding at the end of the applicable periods.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents
include $332.9 million and $187.2 million of short-term time deposits at June
30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable is stated
net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions of $28.9
million and $30.1 million as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Currency Translation and
Transactions

All assets and liabilities of
foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end rates of
exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average rates
of exchange for the year.  Unrealized
translation gains or losses are reported as cumulative translation adjustments
through other comprehensive income.  Such
adjustments amounted to $8.2 million, $36.5 million and $51.3 million of
unrealized translation gains in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company enters into forward
foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options to hedge foreign
currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified
exposures.  Accordingly, the Company
categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.

The accompanying consolidated
statements of earnings include net exchange losses of $15.8 million, $14.5
million and $15.0 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Inventory and Promotional
Merchandise

Inventory and promotional
merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future
periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost
being determined on the first-in, first-out method.  Cost components include raw materials,
componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, utilities,
depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and warehousing) as well as
inbound freight.  Promotional merchandise
is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company’s
customers.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  For financial statement purposes,
depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 40 years.  Leasehold improvements are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or
the expected useful lives of those improvements.

Depreciation and amortization
of property, plant and equipment was $187.2 million, $176.9 million and $156.3
million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Depreciation and amortization related to the
Company’s manufacturing process is included in cost of sales and all other
depreciation and amortization is included in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of
earnings.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

The Company follows the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business
Combinations” and SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”  These statements established financial
accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets.  Specifically, the standards
address how acquired intangible assets should be accounted for both at the time
of acquisition and after they have been recognized in the financial statements.  In accordance with SFAS No. 142, intangible assets,
including purchased goodwill, must be evaluated for impairment.  Those intangible assets that will continue to
be classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives are no
longer amortized.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142,
the impairment testing is performed in two steps: (i) the Company determines
impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company measures the amount of
impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the
carrying amount of that goodwill.  To
determine fair value, the Company relied on three valuation models: guideline
public companies, acquisition analysis and discounted cash flow.  For goodwill valuation purposes only, the
revised fair value of a reporting unit would be allocated to the assets and
liabilities of the business unit to arrive at an implied fair value of
goodwill, based upon known facts and circumstances, as if the acquisition
occurred at that time.

F-11

THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In February 2004, the Company
sold the assets and operations of its reporting unit that sold

jane

brand products.  Based on an assessment of the tangible and
intangible assets of this business, the Company determined that the carrying
amount of these assets as then reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet exceeded their estimated fair value. 
In accordance with the assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill
impairment charge in the amount of $26.4 million for fiscal 2004, which is
reported as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying
consolidated statements of earnings. 
This write-down primarily impacted the Company’s makeup product category
and the Americas region.

Goodwill

The Company assigns goodwill of
a reporting unit to the product category in which that reporting unit
predominantly operates at the time of its acquisition.  The change in the carrying amount of goodwill
is as follows:

Included in fiscal 2005
additions to goodwill was $37.7 million related to an expected payment to be
made in fiscal 2006 to satisfy an earn-out provision related to the Company’s
acquisition of Jo Malone Limited in October 1999.

Other
Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets include trademarks and patents, as well as
license agreements and other intangible assets resulting from or related to
businesses purchased by the Company. 
Indefinite lived assets (e.g., trademarks) are not subject to
amortization and are evaluated annually for impairment or sooner if certain
events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment.  Patents are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the legal term or the useful life of the patent,
approximately 20 years.  Other intangible
assets (e.g., non-compete agreements, customer lists) are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their expected period of benefit, approximately 5
years to 8 years.  Intangible assets
related to license agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
useful lives based on the terms of their respective agreements, currently approximately
10 years to 16 years, and are subject to periodic impairment testing.

Other intangible assets consist
of the following:

THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The aggregate amortization
expenses related to amortizable intangible assets for the years ended June 30,
2005, 2004 and 2003 were $4.6 million, $4.0 million and $1.9 million,
respectively.  The estimated aggregate
amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years is as follows:

Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS No.
144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”
long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets in question may
not be recoverable.  An
impairment would be recorded in circumstances where undiscounted cash
flows expected to be generated by an asset are less than the carrying value of
that asset.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income (Loss)

The components of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) included in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets consist of the following:

Of the $12.0 million, net of
tax, derivative instrument gain recorded in OCI at June 30, 2005, $9.0 million,
net of tax, related to the proceeds from the settlement of the treasury lock
agreements upon the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes which will be
reclassified to earnings as an offset to interest expense over the 30-year life
of the debt and $3.0 million, net of tax, related to gains from forward and
option contracts which the Company will reclassify to earnings during the next
twelve months.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from merchandise sales
are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the
customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.  In the Americas region, sales are generally
recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and, in the
Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized
based upon the customer’s receipt.  In
certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale
(e.g., at the Company’s retail stores).

Sales are reported on a net
sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of
actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with
retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.  The Company’s practice is to accept product
returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and
approved.  In accepting returns, the
Company typically provides a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable
from that retailer.  As a percentage of
gross sales, returns were 4.7%, 4.6% and 5.1% in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Payments
to Customers

The Company is subject to the
provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 01-9, “Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the
Vendor’s Products).”  In accordance with
this guidance, the Company has recorded the revenues generated from purchase
with purchase promotions as sales and the costs of its purchase with purchase
and gift with purchase promotions as cost of sales.  Certain other incentive arrangements require
the payment of a fee to customers based on their attainment of pre-established
sales levels.  These fees have been
recorded as a reduction of net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements
of earnings and were not material to the results of operations in any period
presented.

The Company enters into transactions related
to advertising, product promotions and demonstrations, some of which involve
cooperative relationships with customers. 
These activities may be arranged either with unrelated third parties or
in conjunction with the customer.  The
Company’s share of the cost of these transactions (regardless of to whom they
were paid) are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were approximately $906 million,
$845 million and $790 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Advertising and Promotion

Costs associated with
advertising are expensed during the year as incurred.  Global advertising expenses, which primarily
include television, radio and print media, and promotional expenses, such as
products used as sales incentives, were $1,812.5 million, $1,612.0 million and
$1,416.1 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  These amounts include activities relating to
purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in
net sales and cost of sales.

Advertising and promotional
expenses included in operating expenses were $1,595.6 million, $1,426.8 million
and $1,217.8 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Research and Development

Research and development costs,
which amounted to $72.3 million, $67.2 million and $60.8 million in fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively, are expensed as incurred.

Operating Leases

The Company recognizes rent expense from operating leases with periods
of free and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the
applicable lease term.  The Company
considers lease renewals in the useful life of its leasehold improvements when
such renewals are reasonably assured. 
From time to time, the Company may receive capital improvement funding
from its lessors.  These amounts are
recorded as deferred liabilities and amortized over the remaining lease term as
a reduction of rent expense.

Generally, leasing is not a significant portion of the Company’s
business, however, in connection with a February 7, 2005 letter from the Office
of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants expressing its views of
existing accounting literature related to lease accounting, the Company has
completed a review of its lease accounting policies.  The Company has determined that any changes
to its previous practices would not result in a material impact on its results
of operations and statements of financial position and cash flows for the
current period or any individual prior year. 
Accordingly, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for prior
periods have not been restated.

Related Party Royalties and
Trademarks

On April 24, 2004, Mrs. Estée
Lauder passed away.  As a result, the
royalty payments previously made to her since 1969 in connection with the
Company’s purchase of the “Estée Lauder” trademark outside the United States
ceased to accrue.  Royalty payments
totaling $18.8 million and $20.3 million have been charged to expense in fiscal
2004 and 2003, respectively.

License Arrangements

The Company’s license
agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture,
market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories
thereof) using the licensors’ trademarks. 
The licenses typically have an initial term of approximately 2 years to 11
years, and are renewable subject to the Company’s compliance with the license
agreement provisions.  The remaining
terms, including the potential renewal periods, range from approximately 3 years
to 25 years.  Under each license, the
Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based
on net sales to third parties.

Most of the
Company’s licenses were entered into to create new business.  In some cases, the Company acquired, or
entered into, a license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a
pre-existing beauty products business. 
In those cases, intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their
useful lives based on the terms of the agreement and are subject to periodic
impairment testing.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company observes the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS
No. 123”), by continuing to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”).

The Company applies the intrinsic value method as outlined in APB No.
25 and related interpretations in accounting for stock options and share units
granted under these programs.  Under the
intrinsic value method, no compensation expense is recognized if the exercise
price of the Company’s employee stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of the grant. 
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized on options granted
to employees.  SFAS No. 123 requires that
the Company provide pro forma information regarding
net earnings and net earnings per common share as if compensation cost for the
Company’s stock option programs had been determined in accordance with the fair
value method prescribed therein.  The
Company adopted the disclosure portion of SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,” requiring quarterly SFAS
No. 123 pro forma disclosure.  The pro
forma charge for compensation cost related to stock options granted is
recognized over the service period.  The
service period represents the period of time between the date of grant and the
date each option becomes exercisable without consideration of acceleration
provisions (e.g., retirement, change of control, etc.).  The following table illustrates the effect on
net earnings and earnings per common share as if the fair value method had been
applied to all outstanding awards in each period presented.

(i)
Fiscal 2004 pro forma compensation cost includes the acceleration of
exercisability of options held by an executive who retired on June 30, 2004
based on the original terms of the option grants.

F-15

THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The fair value of each option
grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following assumptions:

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company is a worldwide
manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair
care products.  Domestic and
international sales are made primarily to department stores, perfumeries and
specialty retailers.  The Company grants
credit to all qualified customers and does not believe it is exposed
significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.

For the fiscal years ended June
30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company’s three largest customers accounted for an
aggregate of 22%, 22% and 24%, respectively, of net sales.  No single customer accounted for more than
10% of the Company’s net sales during fiscal 2005, 2004, or 2003.  The Company’s two largest customers,
Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company, are in
the process of merging and have stated that they expect the merger to be
completed in calendar 2005.

Additionally, as of June 30,
2005 and 2004, the Company’s three largest customers accounted for an aggregate
of 24% and 25%, respectively, of its outstanding accounts receivable.

Management Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates and assumptions.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for
derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts, and for hedging activities. 
SFAS No. 133 also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments
as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June
2005, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 05-6, “Determining the
Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements.”  This Issue addresses the amortization period
for leasehold improvements in operating leases that are either (a) placed in
service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of
the initial lease term or (b) acquired in a business combination.  Leasehold improvements that are placed in
service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of
the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the
assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are
deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are
purchased.  Leasehold improvements
acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the
useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and
renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of
acquisition.  This Issue shall be applied
to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods
after June 29, 2005 and the Company does not expect this Issue to have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In June 2005, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS
143-1, “Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations,” to address the
accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations associated with Directive
2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the “Directive”)
adopted by the European Union (“EU”). 
The Directive effectively obligates a commercial user to incur costs associated
with the retirement of a specified asset that qualifies as historical waste
equipment, as defined in the Directive. 
Commercial users of electronic equipment should apply the provisions of
SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS No. 143”),
and the related FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations,” to the obligation associated with historical waste,
since this type of obligation is an asset retirement obligation.  The initial recognition of an
asset-retirement-cost liability shall be recorded as an equal and offsetting
increase in the carrying amount of the related asset.  Subsequent adjustments to the initial
measurement of the asset and liability shall also be made in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 143.  The
guidance in this FSP shall be applied the later of the first reporting period
ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the adoption of the law by the
applicable EU-member country.  The
Company is currently evaluating the impact this FSP will have on its
consolidated financial statements, if any.

In May 2005, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” (“SFAS No.
154”) which establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as the
required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence
of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting
principle.  The statement provides
guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in
accounting principle is impracticable. 
The statement also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error
by restating previously issued financial statements.  SFAS No. 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005.  The
Company will adopt this statement as required, and does not believe the
adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

On December 21, 2004, the FASB
issued FSP FAS 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided
by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP No. 109-1”), and FSP FAS
109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings
Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP No.
109-2”).  These staff positions provide
accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “AJCA”) that was signed into law on
October 22, 2004.

FSP No. 109-1 states that the
tax relief (special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing) from this
legislation should be accounted for as a “special deduction” instead of a tax
rate reduction.  The special deduction
for domestic manufacturing becomes effective for the Company in the first
quarter of fiscal 2006.  The Company
believes this legislation and the provisions of FSP No. 109-1 will not have a
significant impact on its effective tax rate.

FSP No. 109-2 gives a company
additional time to evaluate the effects of the legislation on any plan for
reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying FASB
Statement No. 109.  During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company formulated a plan to repatriate
approximately $690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006, which includes
$500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of
the AJCA.  This action resulted in an
aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million, which included an
incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million in fiscal 2005.  The overall effective rate for income taxes
increased from 37.7% for fiscal 2004 to 41.2% for fiscal 2005 primarily as a
result of the repatriation plan.

In December 2004, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”).  This statement replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation” and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”  SFAS No. 123(R) requires all stock-based
compensation to be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and
that such cost be measured according to the fair value
of the award.  SFAS No. 123(R) will be
effective for the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2006.  While the Company currently provides the pro
forma disclosures required by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,” on a quarterly basis (see Note 2 –
Stock-Based Compensation), it is currently evaluating the impact this statement
will have on its consolidated financial statements.  In March 2005, Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
107 (“SAB No. 107”) was issued to provide guidance from the Securities and
Exchange Commission to simplify some of the implementation challenges of SFAS
No. 123(R) as this statement relates to the valuation of share-based payment
arrangements for public companies.  The
Company will apply the principles of SAB No. 107 in connection with its adoption
of SFAS No. 123(R).

In November 2004, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs - an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4”
(“SFAS No. 151”).  SFAS No. 151 requires
all companies to recognize a current-period charge for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials.  This statement also requires that the
allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on
the normal capacity of the production facilities.  SFAS No. 151 will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005.  The
Company believes the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact
on its consolidated financial statements.

PUBLIC OFFERINGS

In June 2004, three Lauder
family trusts sold a total of 13,000,000 shares of Class A
Common Stock in a registered public offering. 
The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sales of these
shares.  The cost of this offering was
borne by the selling stockholders.

NOTE 4 – ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE OF BUSINESSES AND LICENSE
ARRANGEMENTS

As of June 30, 2005, the Company had a current
liability with an equal and offsetting increase in goodwill of $37.7 million
related to an expected payment to be made in fiscal 2006 to satisfy an earn-out
provision related to the Company’s acquisition of Jo Malone Limited in October
1999, which payment may be satisfied by the issuance of a note to the seller.

In July 2004, the Company acquired a majority equity
interest in its former distributor in Portugal. 
The aggregate payments made through June 30, 2005 to acquire the
distributor were funded by cash provided by operations and did not have a
material effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial
condition.  In addition, the Company assumed
debt and other long-term obligations of 4.6 million Euros associated with the
acquisition (approximately $5.6 million at acquisition date exchange
rates).  The debt is payable
semi-annually through February 2008 at a variable interest rate.

In December 2003, the Company committed to a plan to sell the assets
and operations of its reporting unit that sold

jane

brand products and sold them in February
2004.  At the time the decision was made,
circumstances warranted that the Company conduct an
assessment of the tangible and intangible assets of the

jane

business.  Based on this assessment, the
Company determined that the carrying amount of these assets as then reflected
on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet exceeded its estimated fair
value.  In accordance with the assessment
and the closing of the sale, the Company recorded an after-tax charge to
discontinued operations of $33.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2004.  The charge represents the
impairment of goodwill in the amount of $26.4 million; the reduction in value
of other tangible assets in the amount of $2.1 million, net of tax; and the
reporting unit’s operating loss of $4.8 million, net of tax.  Included in the operating loss of fiscal 2004
were additional costs associated with the sale and discontinuation of the
business.  As a result, all consolidated
statements of earnings information in the consolidated financial statements and
footnotes for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 have been restated for comparative
purposes to reflect that reporting unit as discontinued operations, including
the restatement of the makeup product category and the Americas region data presented
in Note 17.

In July 2003, the Company
acquired the Rodan + Fields skin care line. 
The initial purchase price, paid at closing, was funded by cash provided
by operations, the payment of which did not have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations or financial condition.  The Company expects to make additional
payments between fiscal 2007 and 2011 based on certain conditions.

In April 2003, the Company acquired
the Paris-based Darphin group of companies that develops, manufactures and
markets the “Darphin” brand of skin care and makeup products.  The initial purchase price, paid at closing,
was funded by cash provided by operations, the payment of which did not have a
material effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.  An additional payment is expected to be made
in fiscal 2009, the amount of which will depend on future net sales and
earnings of the Darphin business.

At various times during fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company acquired businesses engaged in the wholesale
distribution and retail sale of Aveda products, as well as other products, in
the United States and other countries.

The aggregate purchase price
for these acquisitions, which includes acquisition costs, was $7.1 million, $4.4
million, and $50.4 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and
each transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting.  Accordingly, the results of
operations for each of the acquired businesses are included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements commencing with its date of original
acquisition.  Pro forma results of
operations, as if each of such businesses had been acquired as of the beginning
of the year of acquisition, have not been presented, as the impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial results would not have been material.

In fiscal 2005, the Company was
developing products under license agreements for Sean John (announced in May
2004), Tom Ford (announced in April 2005) and Missoni (announced in May 2005)
and an Origins license agreement to develop and sell products using the name of
Dr. Andrew Weil (announced in October 2004). 
In May 2003, the Company entered into a license agreement for fragrances
and beauty products under the “Michael Kors” trademarks with Michael Kors,
L.L.C. and purchased certain related rights and inventory from American
Designer Fragrances, a division of LVMH.

NOTE 5 –
RESTRUCTURING AND SPECIAL CHARGES

Fiscal 2003

During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003, the Company recorded a special pre-tax charge of $22.0 million, or
$13.5 million after-tax, equal to $.06 per diluted common share, in connection
with the proposed settlement of a legal proceeding brought against a number of
defendants including the Company (see Note 14). 
The amount of the charge in this case is significantly larger than
similar charges the Company has incurred individually or in the aggregate for
legal proceedings in any prior year.  As
of June 30, 2005, cumulative payments related to the special pre-tax charge
were $4.8 million.  The Company expects
to settle a majority of the remaining obligation by the end of fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001

As of June 30, 2005 and 2004, accruals
related to fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 restructurings were $4.7 million and
$10.7 million, respectively.  During
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, $6.0 million, $13.8 million and $36.7 million,
respectively, related to these restructurings were paid.  The Company expects to settle the remaining
obligations through fiscal 2007.

A
reconciliation

between the provision for income
taxes computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to earnings
before income taxes and minority interest and the actual provision for income
taxes is as follows:

Significant components of the
Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2005 and
2004 were as follows:

As of June 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company had current net deferred tax
assets of $85.3 million and $145.9 million, respectively, which are included in
prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.  In addition, the Company
had noncurrent net deferred tax liabilities of $68.1 million and $26.8 million
as of June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004, respectively, which are included in
other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company formulated a plan
to repatriate approximately $690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006,
which includes $500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the
provisions of the AJCA.  This action
resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million, which
includes an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million in fiscal 2005.  Federal income and foreign withholding taxes
have not been provided on $90.2 million of remaining undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries at June 30, 2005. 
The Company intends to reinvest these earnings in its foreign operations
indefinitely, except where it is able to repatriate these earnings to the
United States without material incremental tax provision.  As of June 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company had
not provided federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $560.5 million and
$476.6 million, respectively, of undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries.

THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As of June 30, 2005 and 2004, certain international subsidiaries had
tax loss carryforwards for local tax purposes of approximately $27.7 million
and $24.5 million, respectively.  With
the exception of $12.2 million of losses with an indefinite carryforward period
as of June 30, 2005, these losses expire at various dates through fiscal 2020.  Deferred tax assets in the amount of $8.2
million and $5.7 million as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, have been
recorded to reflect the tax benefits of the losses not utilized to date.  A full valuation allowance has been provided
for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of management, it is
more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Earnings before income taxes and minority interest include amounts
contributed by the Company’s international operations of $585.9 million, $523.0
million and $393.1 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Some of these earnings are taxed in the
United States.

Earnings from the Company’s
global operations are subject to tax in various jurisdictions both within and
outside the United States.  The Company
is routinely audited in these jurisdictions and these reviews can involve
complex issues that may require an extended period of time for resolution.  The Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns
have been examined and settled through fiscal 1997.  The Company is currently under examination by
the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years 1998 through 2001.  In addition, the Company has ongoing audits
in various state and local jurisdictions, as well as audits in various foreign
jurisdictions.

The Company provides tax reserves
for Federal, state, local and international exposures relating to audit
results, tax planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities.  The development of these reserves requires
judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical
estimate.  Although the outcome of these
tax audits is uncertain, in management’s opinion, adequate provisions for
income taxes have been made for potential liabilities emanating from these
reviews.  If actual outcomes differ
materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations.

The Company has been notified of a
disallowance of tax deductions claimed by its subsidiary in Spain for the
fiscal years 1999 through 2002.  As a
result, the subsidiary was reassessed corporate income tax of approximately $3
million for this period.  An appeal
against this reassessment was filed with the Chief Tax Inspector.  On July 18, 2005 the final assessment made by
the Chief Tax Inspector was received, confirming the reassessment made by the
tax auditors.  An appeal against this
final assessment has been filed with the Madrid Regional Economic
Administrative Tribunal on July 29, 2005.  While no assurance can be given as to the
outcome in respect of this assessment, either during the administrative appeals
process or in the Spanish courts, management believes that the subsidiary
should ultimately be successful in its defense against the assessment.  Accordingly, no tax reserve has been
established for this potential exposure.

NOTE 8 –
DEBT

The Company’s short-term and
long-term debt and available financing consist of the following:

As of June 30, 2005, the
Company had outstanding $246.3 million of 6% Senior Notes due January 2012 (“6%
Senior Notes”) consisting of $250.0 million principal, an unamortized debt
discount of $0.8 million, and a $2.9 million adjustment to reflect the fair
value of an outstanding interest rate swap. 
The 6% Senior Notes, when issued in January 2002, were priced at 99.538%
with a yield of 6.062%.  Interest
payments are required to be made semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of
each year.  In May 2003, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0
million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its outstanding 6%
Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR.

As of June 30, 2005, the
Company had outstanding $197.4 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due October 2033 (“5.75%
Senior Notes”) consisting of $200.0 million principal and unamortized debt
discount of $2.6 million.  Interest
payments, which commenced April 15, 2004, are required to be made semi-annually
on April 15 and October 15 of each year. 
In May 2003, in anticipation of the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes,
the Company entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional
amount totaling $195.0 million at a weighted average all-in rate of 4.53%.  The treasury lock agreements were settled
upon the issuance of the new debt and the Company received a payment of $15.0
million that will be amortized against interest expense over the life of the
5.75% Senior Notes.  As a result of the
treasury lock agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the
effective interest rate on the 5.75% Senior Notes will be 5.395% over the life
of the debt.

Effective July 1, 2003, the
Company adopted SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity” (“SFAS No. 150”).  In connection with this pronouncement, the
Company’s cumulative redeemable preferred stock was reclassified as a component
of total debt and the related dividends thereon have been characterized as interest
expense.  On June 28, 2005, the Company
received a notice of exercise of the put right from the holder of the remaining
$68.4 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock, which requires the Company to
purchase the preferred stock, plus any cumulative and unpaid dividends thereon,
on or before October 26, 2005.  The
Company plans to purchase the preferred stock on that date and to pay the
anticipated dividends through that date of $0.5 million at a rate based on the
after-tax yield on six-month U.S. Treasuries of 2.10%, which was reset on July
1, 2005.

The Company has a $750.0
million commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper in
the United States.  The Company’s
commercial paper is currently rated A-1 by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by
Moody’s.  The Company’s long-term credit
ratings are A+ with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A1 with a
stable outlook by Moody’s.  At June 30,

Effective May 27, 2005, the
Company entered into a five-year $600 million senior revolving credit facility,
expiring on May 27, 2010.  The new
facility replaced its prior, unused $400 million revolving credit facility,
which was effective since June 28, 2001. 
The new revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate
purposes, including financing working capital. 
Up to the equivalent of $250 million of the facility is available for
multicurrency loans.  The interest rate
on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of
prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative
agent, or ½% plus the Federal funds rate. 
The credit facility has an annual fee of $0.4 million, payable quarterly,
based on the Company’s current credit ratings. 
The Company incurred debt issuance costs of $0.3 million which will be
amortized over the term of the facility. 
The credit facility contains various covenants, including one financial
covenant which requires the average of the debt of the Company to total capital
ratio at the last day of each fiscal quarter to be less than 0.65:1.  At June 30, 2005, the Company was in
compliance with all financial covenants in the credit facility and there were
no borrowings.

The Company maintains
uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world.  Interest rate terms for these facilities vary
by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit
ratings.  During fiscal 2005 and 2004,
the monthly average amount outstanding was approximately $10.7 million and $5.1
million, respectively, and the annualized monthly weighted average interest
rate incurred was approximately 4.95% and 5.7%, respectively.

The Company also had an
effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to
$300.0 million in debt securities at June 30, 2005 and 2004.

NOTE 9 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Derivative Financial
Instruments

The Company addresses certain
financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that
includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  The Company primarily enters into foreign
currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the
effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company, if necessary, enters into
interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on
the Company’s aggregate liability portfolio. 
The Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes
other than trading.

All derivatives are recognized
on the balance sheet at their fair value. 
On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company
designates the derivative as (i) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized
asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (“fair-value” hedge),
(ii) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to
be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash-flow”
hedge), (iii) a foreign-currency fair-value or cash-flow hedge (“foreign-currency”
hedge), (iv) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, or (v)
other.  Changes in the fair value of a
derivative that is highly effective as (and that is designated and qualifies
as) a fair-value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or
liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on
firm commitments), are recorded in current-period earnings.  Changes in the fair value of a derivative
that is highly effective as (and that is designated and qualifies as) a
cash-flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are
affected by the variability of cash flows (e.g., when periodic settlements on a
variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).  Changes in the fair value of derivatives that
are highly effective as (and that are designated and qualify as)
foreign-currency hedges are recorded in either current-period earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether the hedge transaction is a
fair-value hedge (e.g., a hedge of a firm commitment that is to be settled in a
foreign currency) or a cash-flow hedge (e.g., a foreign-currency-denominated
forecasted transaction).  If, however, a
derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its
changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income within equity.  Furthermore, changes in the fair value of
other derivative instruments are reported in current-period earnings.

F-23

THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For each derivative contract
entered into where the Company looks to obtain special hedge accounting
treatment, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and
strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. 
This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as
fair-value, cash-flow, or foreign-currency hedges to specific assets and
liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted
transactions.  The Company also formally
assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.  If it is determined that a derivative is not
highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the
Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that
derivative prospectively.

Foreign Exchange Risk
Management

The Company enters into forward
exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and
payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with the
Company’s identified exposures.  The
purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange
rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from
foreign subsidiaries.  Almost all foreign
currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries
and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a
major rating agency.  The Company also
enters into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where
there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.  The forward exchange contracts and foreign
currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been
designated as cash-flow hedges.  As of
June 30, 2005, these cash-flow hedges were highly effective, in all material
respects.

As a matter of
policy, the Company only enters into contracts with counterparties that have at
least an “A” (or equivalent) credit rating.

The counterparties to these contracts are
major financial institutions.  The
Company does not have significant exposure to any one
counterparty.  Exposure to credit
loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to
only the recognized, but not realized, gains attributable to the
contracts.  Management believes risk of
loss under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be
material to the Company’s consolidated financial results.  The contracts have varying maturities through
the end of June 2006.  Costs associated
with entering into such contracts have not been material to the Company’s
consolidated financial results.  The
Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.  At June 30, 2005, the
Company had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange
contracts and option contracts in the amount of $667.5 million and $120.9
million, respectively.  The foreign
currencies included in forward exchange contracts (notional value stated in
U.S. dollars) are principally the Swiss franc ($128.6 million), British pound
($127.6 million), Euro ($123.3 million), Canadian dollar ($78.1 million),
Australian dollar ($43.3 million), Japanese yen ($31.6 million) and South
Korean won ($27.6 million).  The foreign
currencies included in the option contracts (notional value stated in U.S.
dollars) are principally the Japanese yen ($33.6 million), South Korean won
($26.3 million), Euro ($21.5 million) and Swiss franc ($20.3 million).  At June 30, 2004, the Company had foreign
currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option
contracts in the amount of $593.6 million and $82.0 million, respectively.  The foreign currencies included in forward
exchange contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the
Euro ($122.6 million), Swiss franc ($117.1 million), British pound ($72.8
million), Japanese yen ($66.7 million), South Korean won ($42.0 million),
Canadian dollar ($41.7 million) and Australian dollar ($33.7 million).  The foreign currencies included in the option
contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($34.1
million), British pound ($25.4 million) and Swiss franc ($12.7 million).

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company enters into
interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of
interest rates on its funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent
with the identified exposures.  All
interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated
as strong investment grade by a major rating agency.

In May 2003, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0
million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing 6% Senior Notes
to a variable interest rate based on six-month LIBOR.  The interest rate swap was designated as a
fair-value hedge.  As of June 30, 2005,
the fair-value hedge was highly effective, in all material respects.

Information regarding the
interest rate swap is presented in the following table:

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to
estimate that value:

Cash and cash equivalents:

The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the
short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.

Short-term and long-term debt:

The fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated based on the current
rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities.  To a lesser extent, debt also includes
capital lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair
value.

Foreign exchange and interest rate contracts:

The fair value
of forwards, swaps and options is the estimated amount the Company would
receive or pay to terminate the agreements.

The estimated fair values of
the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

NOTE 10 – PENSION, DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT
PLANS

The Company maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its
full-time employees for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international
operations.  Several plans provide
pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees’ earnings.  In certain instances, the Company adjusts
benefits in connection with international employee transfers.

Retirement Growth Account Plan (U.S.)

The Retirement Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory qualified
defined benefit pension plan.  The
Company’s funding policy consists of an annual contribution at a rate that
provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded
percentages.  Such contribution is not
less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”) and subsequent pension legislation and is not
more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.

Restoration Plan (U.S.)

The Company also has an
unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to
provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.

International Pension Plans

The Company maintains
International Pension Plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit
pension plans.  The Company’s funding policies
for these plans are determined by local laws and regulations.

after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for retiree medical benefits when they
retire.  Certain retired employees who
are receiving monthly pension benefits are eligible for participation in the
plan.  Contributions required and
benefits received by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on the
age of the retiree.  It is the Company’s
practice to fund these benefits as incurred. 
The cost of the Company-sponsored programs is not significant.

Certain of the Company’s
international subsidiaries and affiliates have postretirement plans, although
most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs.

The measurement date as of
which assets and liabilities are measured is June 30, 2005.  The significant components of the above
mentioned plans as of and for the year ended June 30 are summarized as follows:

Assumed health care cost trend
rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care
plans.  The assumed weighted-average health
care cost trend rate for the coming year is 12.20% while the ultimate trend
rate of 4.50% is expected to be reached in fiscal 2015.  A one-percentage-point change in assumed
health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2005 would have had the following

other comprehensive (income) loss due to change in minimum liability
recognition for the Company’s pension plans at June 30 are as follows:

International pension plans
with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the plans’ assets had aggregate
projected benefit obligations of $176.0 million and $139.4 million, aggregate
accumulated benefit obligations of $156.8 million and $120.3 million and
aggregate fair value of plan assets of $103.5 million and $85.0 million at June
30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The target asset allocation policy
was set to maximize returns with consideration to the long-term nature of the
obligations and maintaining a lower level of overall volatility through the
allocation to fixed income.  During the
year, the asset allocation is reviewed for adherence to the target policy and
is rebalanced periodically towards the target weights.

401(k) Savings Plan (U.S.)

The Company’s 401(k) Savings
Plan (“Savings Plan”) is a contributory defined contribution plan covering
substantially all regular U.S. employees who have completed the hours and
service requirements, as defined by the plan document.  Regular full-time employees are eligible to
participate in the Savings Plan on the first day of the second month following
their date of hire.  The Savings Plan is
subject to the applicable provisions of ERISA. 
The Company matches a portion of the participant’s contributions after
one year of service under a predetermined formula based on the participant’s
contribution level and years of service. 
The Company’s contributions were approximately $9.8 million for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 and $9.1 million for the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2004 and 2003.  Shares of the
Company’s Class A Common Stock are not an investment
option in the Savings Plan and the Company does not use such shares to match
participants’ contributions.

Deferred Compensation

The Company accrues for
deferred compensation and interest thereon, and for the increase in the value
of share units pursuant to agreements with certain key executives and outside
directors.  The amounts included in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets under these plans were $71.0 million
and $135.4 million as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  The expense for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003
was $10.2 million, $16.6 million and $17.4 million, respectively.  During 2005, the Company made deferred
compensation payments to a former executive of $71.2 million.

NOTE 11 –
POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN TO RETIREES

The Company provides certain
postemployment benefits to eligible former or inactive employees and their
dependents during the period subsequent to employment but prior to
retirement.  These benefits include
health care coverage and severance benefits. 
The cost of providing these benefits is accrued and any incremental
benefits were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial results.

NOTE 12 – COMMON STOCK

As of June 30, 2005, the Company’s authorized common stock consists of
650 million shares of Class A Common Stock, par value
$.01 per share, and 240 million shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $.01
per share.  Class B Common Stock is
convertible into Class A Common Stock, in whole or in
part, at any time and from time to time at the option of the holder, on the
basis of one share of Class A Common Stock for each share of Class B Common
Stock converted.  Holders of the Company’s
Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per
share and holders of the Company’s Class B Common Stock are entitled to ten
votes per share.

Non-Employee Director Share Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) and,
additionally, has made available stock options and share units that were, or
will be, granted pursuant to these Plans and certain employment
agreements.  These stock-based
compensation programs are described below.

Total net compensation income attributable to the granting of share
units, the decrease in value of existing share units and the granting of stock
options to a consultant was $1.3 million in fiscal 2005.  Total net compensation expense attributable
to the granting of share units and the increase in value of existing share
units was $7.8 million and $1.4 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company is involved, from
time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to its
business.  Management believes that the
outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material
adverse effect upon the results of operations or financial condition of the

assessment of the Company’s current litigation and other legal proceedings could
change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or

not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome
of such litigation or proceedings.

On March 30, 2005, the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California entered into a
Final Judgment approving the settlement agreement the Company entered into in
July 2003, with the plaintiffs, the other Manufacturer Defendants (as defined
below) and the Department Store Defendants (as defined below) in a consolidated
class action lawsuit that had been pending in the Superior Court of the State
of California in Marin County since 1998. 
On April 29, 2005, notices of appeal were filed by representatives of two
members of the purported class of consumers. 
If the appeal is resolved satisfactorily, the Final Judgment will result
in the plaintiffs’ claims being dismissed, with prejudice, in their entirety in
both the Federal and California actions. 
There has been no finding or admission of any wrongdoing by the Company
in this lawsuit.  The Company entered
into the settlement agreement solely to avoid protracted and costly
litigation.  In connection with the
settlement agreement, the defendants, including the Company, will provide
consumers with certain free products and pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’
fees.  To meet its obligations under the
settlement, the Company took a special pre-tax charge of $22.0 million, or
$13.5 million after-tax, equal to $.06 per diluted common share in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003.  At June 30,
2005, the remaining accrual balance was $17.2 million.  The charge did not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition.  In the Federal action, the plaintiffs,
purporting to represent a class of all U.S. residents who purchased prestige
cosmetics products at retail for personal use from eight department stores
groups that sold such products in the United States (the “Department Store
Defendants”), alleged that the Department Store Defendants, the Company and
eight other manufacturers of cosmetics (the “Manufacturer Defendants”)
conspired to fix and maintain retail prices and to limit the supply of prestige
cosmetics products sold by the Department Store Defendants in violation of
state and Federal laws.  The plaintiffs
sought, among other things, treble damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees,
interest and costs.

In 1998, the Office of the
Attorney General of the State of New York (the “State”) notified the Company
and ten other entities that they are potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”)
with respect to the Blydenburgh landfill in Islip, New York.  Each PRP may be jointly and severally liable
for the costs of investigation and cleanup, which the State estimates to be $16
million for all PRPs.  In 2001, the State
sued other PRPs (including Hickey’s Carting, Inc., Dennis C. Hickey and Maria
Hickey, collectively the “Hickey Parties”), in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of New York to recover such costs in connection with the site,
and in September 2002, the Hickey Parties brought contribution actions against
the Company and other Blydenburgh PRPs. 
These contribution actions seek to recover, among other things, any
damages for which the Hickey Parties are found liable in the State’s lawsuit
against them, and related costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees.  In June 2004, the State added the Company and
other PRPs as defendants in its pending case against the Hickey Parties.  The Company and certain other PRPs have
engaged in settlement discussions which to date have been unsuccessful.  The Company has accrued an amount which it
believes would be necessary to resolve its share of this matter.  If settlement discussions are not successful,
the Company intends to vigorously defend the pending claims.  While no assurance can be given as to the
ultimate outcome, management believes that the resolution of the Blydenburgh
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial condition.

In January 2004, the Portuguese
Tax Administration issued a report alleging that the Company’s subsidiary had
income subject to tax in Portugal for the three calendar years ended December
31, 2002.  The Company’s subsidiary has
been operating in the Madeira Free Trade Zone since 1989 under license from the
Madeira Development Corporation and, in accordance with such license and the
laws of Portugal, the Company believes that its income
is not subject to Portuguese income tax. 
In February 2004, the subsidiary filed an appeal of the finding to the
Portuguese Secretary of State for Fiscal Matters.  The appeal is still pending.  On December 20, 2004, the subsidiary received
a notice of assessment from the Portuguese Tax Administration solely in respect
of the calendar year ended December 31, 2000. 
The assessment, which includes interest, amounted to 27.7 million
Euros.  At the end of March 2005, the
subsidiary filed an opposition to the assessment.  No action has been taken by the Portuguese
Tax Administration in respect of the opposition, which remains pending. 
In August 2005, the Portuguese Tax Administration notified the subsidiary that
it is beginning executive procedures to collect on the assessment for 2000, and
the Company is in the process of arranging the required financial
guarantee.  On May 17 and 18, 2005, the subsidiary received notices of
assessment from the Portuguese Tax Administration in respect of the calendar
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002. 
The assessments are for 21.6 million Euros and 22.4 million Euros,
respectively, to which the subsidiary has filed oppositions in July 2005.  While no assurance can be given as to the
ultimate outcome in respect of the foregoing assessments or any additional
assessments that may be issued for subsequent periods, management believes that
the likelihood that the assessment or any future assessments ultimately will be
upheld is remote.

In December 2004, a plaintiff purporting to represent a nationwide
class brought an action in the Superior Court of California for the County of
San Diego.  The
complaint, as amended, names two of the Company’s subsidiaries and
approximately 25 other defendants, including manufacturers and retailers.  The plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief,
restitution, and general, special and punitive damages for alleged violations
of the California Unfair Competition Law, the California False Advertising Law,
and for negligent and intentional misrepresentation.  The purported class includes individuals “who
have purchased skin care products from defendants that have been falsely
advertised to have an ‘anti-aging’ or youth inducing benefit or effect.”  The Company intends to defend itself
vigorously.  While no assurance can be
given as to the ultimate outcome, management believes that the resolution of
this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition.

In June 2005, an action was
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida
against one of its subsidiaries.  Two of the Company’s department store
customers were added as defendants in an amended complaint filed in August
2005.  The plaintiff, purporting to
represent a nationwide class of individuals “who have purchased skin care
products from Defendant that have been falsely advertised to have an ‘anti-aging’
or youth-inducing benefit or effect,” seeks injunctive relief as well as
compensatory and punitive damages for alleged breach of express and implied

NOTE 15 – NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS

Under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” available-for-sale
securities are recorded at market value. 
Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on
available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a
component of stockholders’ equity until realized.  The Company’s investments subject to the
provisions of SFAS No. 115 are treated as available-for-sale and, accordingly,
the applicable investments have been adjusted to market value with a
corresponding adjustment, net of tax, to net unrealized investment gains in
accumulated other comprehensive income. 
Included in accumulated other comprehensive income was an unrealized
investment gain (net of deferred taxes) of $0.4 million and $0.1 million at
June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

NOTE 16 –
STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

Supplemental disclosure of
significant non-cash transactions

As a result of stock option
exercises, the Company recorded tax benefits of $19.7 million, $19.3 million
and $7.9 million during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which are
included in additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

As of June 30, 2005, and 2004,
the Company had a current liability and an equal and offsetting decrease in
long-term debt of $2.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively, reflecting the
fair market value of an interest rate swap which was classified as a fair value
hedge of the 6% Senior Notes (see Note 8).

As of June 30, 2005, the
Company had a current liability with an equal and offsetting increase in
goodwill of $37.7 million related to an expected payment to be made in fiscal
2006 to satisfy an earn-out provision related to the Company’s acquisition of
Jo Malone Limited in October 1999, which payment may be satisfied by the
issuance of a note to the seller.  In
addition, in fiscal 2005, the Company had acquired $10.9 million of machinery
and equipment through capital lease arrangements, of which the related
liability is included in short-term and long-term debt.

SEGMENT DATA AND RELATED INFORMATION

Reportable operating segments,
as defined by SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information,” include components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker (the “Chief Executive”) in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance. 
As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and
distribution processes for all of the Company’s products, much of the information
provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same
as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive.  Although the Company operates in one business
segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product
category basis.

While the Company’s results of
operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief Executive
reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry
statistics.  Accordingly, net sales,
depreciation and amortization, and operating income are available with respect
to the manufacture and distribution of skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care
and other products.  These product
categories meet the FASB’s definition of operating segments and, accordingly,
additional financial data are provided below. 
The “other” segment includes the sales and related results of ancillary
products and services that do not fit the definition of skin care, makeup,
fragrance and hair care.

The Company evaluates segment performance
based upon operating income, which represents earnings before income taxes,
minority interest, net interest expense and
discontinued operations.  The accounting
policies for each of the reportable segments are the same as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and
amortization charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net
sales.  The assets and liabilities of the
Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as
the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is
produced for the Chief Executive or included herein.
