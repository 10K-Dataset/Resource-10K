Forward-Looking
Statements and Risk Factors

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K includes “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such statements include, without limitation,
our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial
performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new geographic
regions, information systems initiatives, new methods of sale and future
operations or operating results. 
Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable
assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations,
we cannot assure that actual results will not differ materially from our
expectations.  Factors that could cause
actual results to differ from expectations are described herein; in particular,
see “Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Forward-Looking
Information.”  In addition, there is a
discussion of risks associated with an investment in our securities.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

PART I

Item 1.

Business.

The Estée Lauder
Companies Inc., founded in 1946 by Estée and Joseph Lauder, is one of the world’s
leading manufacturers and marketers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance and
hair care products.  Our products are
sold in over 130 countries and territories under the following well-recognized
brand names: Estée Lauder, Aramis, Clinique, Prescriptives, Lab Series,
Origins, M

ž

A

ž

C,
Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone, Bumble and bumble, Darphin, Rodan +
Fields, American Beauty, Flirt!, Good Skin™ and Grassroots.  We are also the global licensee for
fragrances and cosmetics sold under the Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan, Michael
Kors, Donald Trump, Sean John, Missoni and Daisy Fuentes brand names.  Each brand is distinctly positioned within
the market for beauty products.

We are a pioneer in the
cosmetics industry and believe we are a leader in the industry due to the
global recognition of our brand names, our leadership in product innovation,
our strong market position in key geographic markets and the consistently high
quality of our products.  We sell our
prestige products principally through limited distribution channels to
complement the images associated with our brands.  These channels, encompassing over 20,000
points of sale, consist primarily of upscale department stores, specialty
retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and
spas.  In addition, our products are sold
in freestanding company-owned stores and spas, our own and authorized retailer
web sites, stores on cruise ships, television direct marketing, in-flight and
duty-free shops and certain fragrances are sold in self-select outlets.  We believe that our strategy of pursuing
limited distribution strengthens our relationships with retailers, enables our
brands to be among the best selling product lines at the stores and heightens
the aspirational quality of our brands.

Beginning in fiscal 2005,
we began to sell our newly developed brands, American Beauty, Flirt!, Good Skin™
and Grassroots at Kohl’s Department Stores. 
In fiscal 2006, we developed Dianoche by Daisy Fuentes, which became
available at Kohl’s Department Stores in August 2006.

In April 2006, we
completed the sale of certain assets and operations of our reporting unit that
marketed and sold Stila brand products, which was originally acquired in August
1999.  In February 2004, we sold the
assets and operations of our reporting unit that sold

jane

brand products, which was originally acquired in October 1997.

We have been controlled
by the Lauder family since the founding of our company.  Members of the Lauder family, some of whom
are directors, executive officers and/or employees, beneficially own, directly
or indirectly, as of August 22, 2006, shares of Class A Common Stock and Class
B Common Stock having approximately 88.2% of the outstanding voting power of
the Common Stock.

Unless the context
requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries.

Products

Skin Care

- - Our broad range of skin care products addresses various skin care needs for
women and men.  These products include
moisturizers, creams, lotions, cleansers, sun screens and self-tanning
products, a number of which are developed for use on particular areas of the
body, such as the face or the hands or around the eyes.  Skin care products accounted for
approximately 37% of our net sales in fiscal 2006.

Makeup

- - We manufacture, market and sell a full array of makeup products, including
lipsticks, lip glosses, mascaras, foundations, eyeshadows, nail polishes and
powders.  Many of the products are
offered in an extensive array of shades and colors.  We also sell related items such as compacts,
brushes and other makeup tools.  Makeup
products accounted for approximately 39% of our net sales in fiscal 2006.


Fragrance

- - We offer a variety of fragrance products for women and men.  The fragrances are sold in various forms,
including eau de parfum sprays and colognes, as well as lotions, powders,
creams and soaps that are based on a particular fragrance.  Fragrance products accounted for
approximately 19% of our net sales in fiscal 2006.

Hair Care

- - Hair care products are offered mainly in salons and in freestanding retail
stores and include hair color and styling products, shampoos, conditioners and
finishing sprays.  In fiscal 2006, hair
care products accounted for approximately 5% of our net sales.

Given the personal nature
of our products and the wide array of consumer preferences and tastes, as well
as competition for the attention of consumers, our strategy has been to market
and promote our products through distinctive brands seeking to address broad
preferences and tastes.  Each brand has a
single global image that is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and
advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other
brands.

Estée
Lauder

- Estée Lauder brand products, which have been sold
since 1946, are positioned as luxurious, classic and aspirational.  We believe that Estée Lauder brand products
are technologically advanced and innovative and have a worldwide reputation for
excellence.  The broad product line
principally consists of skin care, makeup and fragrance products that are
presented in high quality packaging.  In
April 2005, we announced a creative collaboration with fashion designer, Tom
Ford, pursuant to which he collaborated with the Estée Lauder brand to create a
Tom Ford for Estée Lauder collection, which launched in fiscal 2006.

Aramis

- - We pioneered the marketing of prestige men’s fragrance, grooming and skin
care products with the introduction of Aramis products in 1964.

Clinique

- - First introduced in 1968, Clinique skin care and makeup products are all
allergy tested and 100% fragrance free and have been designed to address
individual skin types and needs.  The
products are based on the research and related expertise of leading
dermatologists.  Clinique skin care
products are generally marketed as part of the 3-Step System: Cleanse,
Exfoliate, Moisturize.  Clinique also
offers fragrances for men and women and a line of hair care products.

Prescriptives

- - We developed and introduced Prescriptives in 1979.  Prescriptives is positioned as a color
authority with an advanced collection of highly individualized products
primarily addressing the makeup and skin care needs of contemporary women with
active lifestyles.  The products are
characterized by simple concepts, minimalist design and an innovative image
and, through a system of color application and extensive range of makeup
shades, accommodate a diverse group of consumers.

Lab
Series

- Lab Series Skincare for Men, introduced by Aramis 17
years ago, offers the full range of advanced products for cleansing, shaving,
treatment and body that are especially formulated to answer the unique needs of
men’s skin.

Origins

- - Origins was introduced in 1990.  It is
positioned as a plant-based line of skin care, makeup and aromatherapy products
that combine time-tested botanical ingredients with modern science to promote
total well-being.  Origins sells its
products at our freestanding Origins stores and through stores-within-stores
(which are designed to replicate the Origins store environment within a
department store), at traditional retail counters, in perfumeries and directly
to consumers over the Internet.  Origins
also has a license agreement to develop and sell products using the name of Dr.
Andrew Weil.

Tommy
Hilfiger

- We have an exclusive global license arrangement to
develop and market a line of men’s and women’s fragrances and cosmetics under
the Tommy Hilfiger brand.  We launched
the line in 1995 with a men’s fragrance,

tommy

.  Today, we manufacture and sell a variety of
fragrances and ancillary products for men and women.

M

ž

A

ž

C

- M

ž

A

ž

C
products comprise a broad line of color-oriented, professional cosmetics and
professional makeup tools targeting makeup artists and fashion-conscious
consumers.  The products are sold through
a limited number of department and specialty stores, at freestanding M

ž

A

ž

C
stores and directly to consumers over the Internet.  We acquired the companies behind M

ž

A

ž

C
in three stages: in December 1994, March 1997 and February 1998.

Bobbi
Brown

- In October 1995, we acquired the Bobbi Brown line of
color cosmetics, professional makeup brushes and skin care products.  Bobbi Brown products are manufactured to our
specifications, primarily by third parties, and sold through a limited number
of department and specialty stores and directly to consumers over the Internet.

La Mer

- - La Mer products primarily consist of moisturizing creams, lotions, cleansers,
toners and other skin care products.  The
line, which is available in very limited distribution in the United States and
certain other countries, is an extension of the initial Crème de la Mer product
that we acquired in 1995.


Donna
Karan Cosmetics

-

In November
1997, we obtained the exclusive global license to develop, market and
distribute a line of fragrances and other cosmetics under the Donna Karan New
York and DKNY trademarks, including certain products that were originally sold
by The Donna Karan Company.  We launched
the first DKNY women’s fragrance in fiscal 2000 and the first DKNY men’s
fragrance in fiscal 2001.  Under this
license, fragrances have been expanded to include extensive lines of companion
bath and body products.

Aveda

- - We acquired the Aveda business in December 1997 and have since acquired
selected Aveda distributors and retail stores. 
Aveda, a prestige hair care leader, is a manufacturer and marketer of
plant-based hair care, skin care, makeup and fragrance products.  We sell Aveda products to third-party
distributors and prestige salons and spas, cosmetology schools, certain
non-U.S. department stores and specialty retailers and directly to consumers at
our own freestanding Aveda Experience Centers and certain Aveda Institutes.

Jo Malone

- - We acquired London-based Jo Malone Limited in October 1999.  Jo Malone is known for its prestige skin
care, fragrance and hair care products showcased at its flagship store in London.  Products are also available through a company
catalogue, at freestanding stores and at a very limited group of specialty
stores in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

Bumble
and bumble

- In June 2000, we acquired a controlling majority
equity interest in Bumble and Bumble Products, LLC, a marketer and distributor
of quality hair care products, and Bumble and Bumble, LLC, the operator of a
premier hair salon in New York City (collectively “Bumble and bumble”).  Bumble and bumble styling and other hair care
products are distributed to top-tier salons and select specialty stores.  In fiscal 2004, we opened a second
wholly-owned salon and a training and education center.  In fiscal 2007, we intend to acquire the
remaining equity interest in Bumble and bumble.

Darphin

- - In April 2003, we acquired Laboratoires Darphin, the Paris-based company
dedicated to the development, manufacture and marketing of prestige skin care
and makeup products which are distributed through high-end independent pharmacies
and specialty stores.

Michael
Kors

- In May 2003, we entered into a license agreement for
fragrances and beauty products under the “Michael Kors” trademarks and
purchased certain related rights and inventory from another party.  All fragrances including MICHAEL and MICHAEL
for Men, as well as ancillary bath and body products, are sold in department
stores, specialty stores, at freestanding Michael Kors boutiques and over the
Internet.

Rodan +
Fields

- In July 2003, we acquired the Rodan + Fields skin
care line launched in 2002 by Stanford University-trained dermatologists Katie
Rodan, M.D. and Kathy Fields, M.D.  The
line offers solutions for specific skin problems, targeting them with
individually packaged and dedicated regimens. 
The line is currently sold in U.S. specialty stores and over the
Internet.

American
Beauty

- Launched in 2004, the luxurious makeup and advanced
skin care line celebrates the beauty of American style.  These products, which are sold in the United
States at Kohl’s Department Stores and Kohls.com, have been developed to meet
the needs of the modern American woman, with a straightforward makeup and skin
care appeal.

Flirt!

-

Launched in 2004 and sold in the United States at Kohl’s
Department Stores and Kohls.com, this makeup line is all about experimenting
with color, pop culture and trends; “you can Flirt! with the possibilities.”

Good

-

Launched in
2004 and sold in the United States at Kohl’s Department Stores and Kohls.com,
this line of skin care products was created with the expertise of a
dermatologist.

This line is color-coded for ease of use.

Donald
Trump The Fragrance

- In September 2004, the Company
announced that it joined forces with Donald Trump in a multi-year deal.  The agreement established Mr. Trump as the
spokesperson for a new men’s fragrance called Donald Trump The Fragrance.

Grassroots

-

Introduced in
2005 and sold

in the United States at Kohl’s
Department Stores and Kohls.com,

Grassroots offers
a range of wholesome, naturally-sourced products to help care for you and your
family.  This line’s seven product
categories include face, body, hair, post-pregnancy, babies, kids and pets.

Sean John
Fragrances

- Introduced in 2005, Sean “Diddy” Combs played an
active role in creating a signature scent, “Unforgivable,” that captured a mood
of sexiness and elegance.  That signature
scent and ancillary products are available at selected department and specialty
stores as well as travel retail outlets around the world.

Missoni

- - In 2006, we launched fragrance and ancillary products under our exclusive
global licensing agreement with Milan-based fashion house, Missoni.  Missoni products are sold in select
distribution channels worldwide.


Daisy
Fuentes

- In early fiscal 2007, we launched Dianoche, the
first fragrance under our license agreement with Daisy Fuentes.  Dianoche holds two scents that connect in a
single bottle and is available exclusively at Kohl’s Department Stores
nationwide or online at Kohls.com.

In addition to the
foregoing brands, we manufacture and sell Kiton and Toni Gard products as a
licensee.  We also have licenses from,
and are developing products to be sold under the Tom Ford brand name.

Distribution

We sell our products
principally through limited distribution channels to complement the images
associated with our brands.  These
channels include more than 20,000 points of sale in over 130 countries and
territories and consist primarily of upscale department stores, specialty
retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and
spas.  In addition, our products are sold
in freestanding company-owned stores and spas, our own and authorized retailer
websites, stores on cruise ships, television direct marketing, in-flight and
duty-free shops and certain fragrances are sold in self-select outlets.

We maintain a dedicated
sales force which sells to our retail accounts in North America and in the
major overseas markets, such as Western Europe and Japan.  We have wholly-owned operations in over 35
countries, and controlling interests in joint ventures that operate in four
other countries, through which we market, sell and distribute our
products.  In certain countries, we sell
our products through selected local distributors under contractual arrangements
designed to protect the image and position of the brands.  In addition, we sell certain products in
select domestic and international military locations.  For
information regarding our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region,
see Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is
incorporated herein by reference.  Our
net sales in the United States in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $3,141.4
million, $3,094.5 million and $2,901.1 million, respectively.  Our long-lived assets in the United States at
June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $452.7 million, $425.5 million and $416.0
million, respectively.

There are risks inherent
in foreign operations, including changes in social, political and economic
conditions.  We are also exposed to risks
associated with changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment
in countries where we have operations as well as, to a lesser extent, changes
in United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and
investment.  In addition, our results of
operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates.  Changes
in such rates also may affect the relative prices at which we and foreign
competitors sell products in the same markets. 
Similarly, the cost of certain items required in our operations may be
affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies.

We principally sell Aveda
products to independent salons and spas, cosmetology schools, third-party
distributors and specialty retailers and directly to consumers at our own
freestanding Aveda Experience Centers and certain Aveda Institutes.  There are currently about 7,000 points of
sale, primarily in the United States, that sell Aveda products.  Bumble and bumble products are principally
sold to more than 2,400 independent salons, primarily in the United
States.  Darphin products are principally
sold through high-end independent pharmacies, principally in Europe,
representing approximately 4,000 points of sale.

As part of our strategy
to diversify our distribution, we have been selectively expanding the number of
single-brand, freestanding stores that we own and operate.  The Origins, Aveda and M

ž

A

ž

C
brands are the primary focus for this method of distribution.  At this time, we operate 467 single-brand,
freestanding stores worldwide, the majority of which are in the United States,
and expect that number to increase moderately over the next several years.

We sell American Beauty,
Flirt!, Good Skin™, Grassroots and our newly developed fragrance, Dianoche, by
Daisy Fuentes in approximately 750 Kohl’s Department Stores in the United
States.

We sell some of our
products directly to consumers over the Internet through our own websites
(Estée Lauder, Clinique, Lab Series, Prescriptives, Origins, M

ž

A

ž

C,
Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone and Rodan + Fields), and through
Gloss.com (Estée Lauder, Clinique, Lab Series, Prescriptives, Origins, M

ž

A

ž

C,
Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Jo Malone, Darphin and Rodan + Fields).  Gloss.com is a joint venture in which we own
a controlling majority interest.  Chanel,
Inc. and Clarins (U.S.A.) Inc. became partners in the venture in August 2000
and Chanel and Clarins products are also available on the website.

As is customary in the
cosmetics industry, our practice is to accept returns of our products from
retailers if properly requested, authorized and approved.  In accepting returns, we typically provide a
credit to the retailer against sales and accounts receivable from that retailer
on a dollar-for-dollar basis.  In
recognition of this practice, and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, we report sales on a net basis, which is computed by
deducting the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for
anticipated returns from gross sales.  As
a percentage of gross sales, returns were 5.0% in fiscal 2006 and 4.6% in
fiscal 2005 and 2004.


Customers

Our strategy has been to
build strong strategic relationships with selected retailers globally.  Senior management works with executives of
our major retail accounts on a regular basis and we believe we are viewed as an
important supplier to these customers.  During
fiscal 2006, Federated Department Stores, Inc. acquired The May Department
Stores Company, resulting in the merger of our previous two largest
customers.  As of and for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2006, this customer accounted for 14% of our accounts receivable
and 16% of our consolidated net sales. 
In fiscal 2005 and 2004, no single customer accounted for more than 10%
of consolidated net sales.

Marketing

Our marketing strategy is
built around our vision statement: “Bringing the Best to Everyone We Touch.”  Mrs. Estée Lauder formulated this marketing
philosophy to provide high-quality service and products as the foundation for a
solid and loyal consumer base.

Our marketing efforts
focus principally on promoting the quality and benefits of our products.  Each of our brands is distinctively positioned,
has a single global image, and is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and
advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other
brands.  We regularly advertise our
products on television and radio, in upscale magazines and newspapers and
through direct mail and photo displays at international airports.  In addition, our products receive extensive
editorial coverage in prestige publications and other media worldwide.  Promotional activities and in-store displays
are designed to introduce existing consumers to different products in the line
and to attract new consumers.  Our
marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with
retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as purchase
with purchase and gift with purchase.  At
in-store counters, sales representatives offer personal demonstrations to
market individual products as well as to provide education on basic skin care
and makeup application.  We conduct
extensive sampling programs and we pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling
program.  We believe that the quality and
perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to
purchases by new and existing consumers.

Starting with the launch
of the Clinique website in 1996, we have used the Internet to educate and
inform consumers about certain of our brands. 
Currently, we have seventeen single-brand marketing sites, eleven of
which have e-commerce capabilities, and Gloss.com, our majority-owned,
multi-brand marketing and e-commerce site.

Most of our creative
marketing work is done by in-house creative teams.  The creative staff designs and produces the
sales materials, advertisements and packaging for all products in each brand.  Global net advertising, merchandising,
sampling and promotional expenditures were $1,793.1 million, $1,793.7 million
and $1,595.5 million for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  These amounts include revenues and expenses
relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions that are
reflected in net sales and cost of sales.

Our marketing and sales
executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers and key
retailers and consulting with sales representatives at the points of sale.  These include Estée Lauder Beauty Advisors,
Clinique Consultants, Aramis Selling Specialists, Prescriptives Analysts,
Origins Guides and M

Makeup Artists.

Information Systems

Information systems
support business processes including product development, marketing, sales,
order processing, production, distribution and finance.  Of the many systems currently being utilized,
the most significant to our business needs are: (i) a centralized data
repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer, or plan
to offer, which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of
consistent quality; (ii) a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the
stock keeping unit (SKU) level at most significant retail sales locations
(i.e., sell-through data), increasing our understanding of consumer preferences
and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development,
manufacturing and marketing strategies; (iii) an automated replenishment system
with many of our key domestic customers, allowing us to replenish inventories
for individual points of sale automatically, with minimal paperwork; and (iv)
an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished
goods availability relative to actual requirements, facilitating inventory control
and distribution for both existing product lines and new product launches.

The efficiencies provided
by these systems have resulted in increased sales, fewer out-of-stocks and
reduced retail inventories.  We expect
that these systems will continue to provide inventory and sales efficiencies in
the short and medium terms.  As part of
our long-term effort to enhance these efficiencies, we are implementing our
Strategic Modernization Initiative (“SMI”), which includes an enterprise-wide
global program that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data,
processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize
business processes across brands, operating units and sales affiliates.  The implementation of SMI at our Aveda
operating unit is planned for fiscal 2007. 
SMI is expected to proceed in stages through fiscal 2010.


Research and Development

We believe that we are an
industry leader in the development of new products.  Marketing, product
development and packaging groups work with our research and development group
to identify shifts in consumer preferences, develop new products and redesign
or reformulate existing products.  In addition, research and development
personnel work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a
worldwide basis to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to
deliver products with attributes that fulfill consumer expectations.

We maintain ongoing
research and development programs at our facilities in Melville, New York; Oevel,
Belgium; Petersfield, U.K.; Tokyo, Japan; Markham, Ontario; Blaine, Minnesota;
Shanghai, China; and Colombes, France.  As of June 30, 2006, we had
approximately 444 employees engaged in research and development.  Research
and development expenditures, which are included in advertising, merchandising
and sampling expenditures, totaled $72.0 million, $72.3 million and $67.2
million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Our research and
development group makes significant contributions toward improving existing
products and developing new products and provides ongoing technical assistance
and know-how to our manufacturing activities.  The research and
development group has had long-standing working relationships with several U.S.
and international medical and educational facilities, which supplement internal
capabilities.  We do not conduct animal testing of our products.

Manufacturing, Warehousing and
Raw Materials

We manufacture skin care,
makeup, fragrance and hair care products in the United States, Belgium,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Canada and France.  We continue to streamline our manufacturing
processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase
efficiencies and reduce costs.  Our major
manufacturing facilities operate as “focus” plants that primarily manufacture
one type of product (e.g., lipsticks) for all of the principal brands.  Our plants are modern and our manufacturing
processes are substantially automated. 
While we believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to
meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue
to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity and
productivity.  To capitalize on innovation
and other supply benefits, we continue to utilize third parties on a global
basis for finished goods production.

We have established a
global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our
customers while maintaining service levels. 
We are continuously evaluating and restructuring this physical
distribution network.  We intend to
establish regional inventory centers strategically positioned throughout the
world in order to facilitate timely delivery of our products to our customers.

The principal raw
materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohol
and specialty chemicals.  We also
purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design
specifications.  Procurement of materials
for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through
our centralized supplier relations department. 
A concentrated effort in supplier rationalization has been made with the
specific objective of reducing costs, increasing innovation and improving quality.  As a result of sourcing initiatives, there is
increased dependency on certain suppliers, but we believe that these suppliers
have adequate resources and facilities to overcome any unforeseen interruption
of supply.  We are continually
benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will add or delete
suppliers based upon the changing needs of the business.  We have, in the past, been able to obtain an
adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have
adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.  As we integrate acquired brands, we
continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities
to improve manufacturing performance.


Competition

The skin care, makeup,
fragrance and hair care businesses are characterized by vigorous competition
throughout the world.  Brand recognition,
quality, performance and price have a significant influence on consumers’
choices among competing products and brands. 
Advertising, promotion, merchandising, the pace and timing of new
product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store sales staff
also have a significant impact on consumers’ buying decisions.  We compete against a number of manufacturers
and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, some of
which have substantially greater resources than we do.

names of many of the products sold under these brands.  We own the material trademark rights used in

major products both in the United States and in the other principal countries
where such products are sold.  We are the
exclusive worldwide licensee for fragrances, cosmetics and related products for
Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Donald Trump, Sean
John, Missoni and Daisy Fuentes. 
Origins, pursuant to a license agreement, sells products using the name
of Dr. Andrew Weil and Estée Lauder, pursuant to a license agreement, sells
products using the name Tom Ford for Estée Lauder.  We are in the process of developing new
products under a license from Tom Ford. 
We protect our trademarks for our principal products in the United
States and significant markets worldwide. 
We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our
business.

A number of our products
incorporate patented or patent-pending technology in formulations or packaging.  In addition, several products are covered by
design patents, patent applications or copyrights.  While we consider these patents and
copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or
copyright is considered material to the conduct of our business.


Employees

At June 30, 2006, we had
approximately 26,200 full-time employees worldwide (including sales
representatives at points of sale who are employed by us), of whom
approximately 11,700 are employed in the United States and Canada.  None of our employees in the United States is
covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
In certain other countries, a limited number of employees are covered by
a works council agreement or other syndicate arrangements.  We believe that relations with our employees
are good.  We have never encountered a
material strike or work stoppage in the United States or in any other country
where we have a significant number of employees.

Government Regulation

We and our products are
subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade
Commission in the United States, as well as by various other Federal, state,
local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities
in the countries in which our products are produced or sold.  Such regulations principally relate to the
ingredients, labeling, packaging and marketing of our products.  We believe that we are in substantial
compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable Federal, state,
local and international and other countries’ rules and regulations governing
the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment.  There are no significant capital expenditures
for environmental control matters either planned in the current year or expected
in the near future.  Along with other
unrelated parties, we have been named as a potentially responsible party by the
Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York with regard to a
landfill in Long Island, New York.  See “

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

.”

Seasonality

Our results of operations
in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal
fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically
being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year.  The higher net sales in the first two fiscal
quarters are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers
for the holiday selling season and for fall fashion makeup introductions.  Fluctuations in net sales and operating
income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal
quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product
introductions.  Additionally, gross
margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by
variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including
purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.

Item
1A.

Risk Factors.

There are risks
associated with an investment in our securities.

Please consider the
following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form
10-K and in our subsequent filings with the SEC.  Our business may also be adversely affected
by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently
believe to be immaterial.  If any of the
events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other
risks arise or develop, our business, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations, as well as the prices of our securities, may be
adversely affected.

The beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are
unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.

We face vigorous
competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational
consumer product companies.  Some of these competitors have greater
resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and
economic conditions more quickly than us.  Competition in the beauty
business is based on pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service
to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new
product introductions, electronic commerce initiatives and other
activities.  It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our
competitors’ actions in these areas.  Also, the trend toward consolidation
in the retail trade, particularly in developed markets such as the United
States and Western Europe, has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent
on key retailers, including large-format retailers, who have increased their
bargaining strength.  This trend has also
resulted in an increased risk related to the concentration of our
customers.  A severe adverse impact on
their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on
us.  Our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our
brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the
efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our
ability to protect our intellectual property.  Our inability to continue
to compete effectively in countries around the world could have an adverse
impact on our business.


Our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and
changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.

Our continued success
depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and
cost-effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care, makeup,
fragrance and hair care products as well as to where and how consumers shop for
those products.  We must continually work to develop, produce and market
new products, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a
favorable mix of products, and refine our approach as to how and where we
market and sell our products.  While we devote considerable effort and
resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, we recognize
that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change
rapidly.  If we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the
market for cosmetics products and changing consumer demands, our financial
results will suffer.

Our
future success depends on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.

Our long-term strategy is
based on five strategic imperatives:

1.

Optimize brand
portfolio

2.

Strengthen product
categories

3.

Strengthen and
expand geographic presence

4.

Diversify and
strengthen distribution channels

5.

Achieve operational
and cost excellence

Achieving our long-term
objectives may require investment in new brands, categories, distribution
channels, technologies and geographic markets. 
These investments may results in short-term costs without any current
revenues.  In addition, there may be
costs incurred in disposing of brands. 
Although we believe that our strategic imperatives will lead to growth
in revenue and profitability, we may not realize in full, or in part, the
anticipated benefits.  The failure to
realize benefits, which may be due to our ability to execute plans or other
risks described in this 10-K, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and operating results.

Any future
acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.

We continuously review
acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our
distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations
or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities.  The financing for any of these acquisitions
could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our
stockholders or both.  Acquisitions may entail
numerous risks, including:

·

difficulties
in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key
employees from or customers of acquired businesses;

·

diversion
of management’s attention from our core businesses;

·

adverse
effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; and

·

risks
of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.

Our failure to
successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating
results.  In addition, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or
consummate acquisitions on favorable terms.

A general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business
conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items, which could
adversely affect our financial results.

The general level of
consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general
economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer
confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control.  Consumer
purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods,
when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products.  In
addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions, for example, as a
consequence of events such as the outbreak of SARs in 2003 or those that are
currently taking place in the Middle East, or as a result of a terrorist
attack, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation, or as a
result of adverse weather conditions, such as Hurricane Katrina, can have a
short and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.

Events that impact
consumers’ willingness or ability to travel and/or purchase our products while
traveling may impact our travel retail business, which is a significant
contributor to our overall results.

A downturn in the
economies in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business
conditions in those economies could adversely affect our sales.


Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our
business could adversely affect our financial results.

Our business is subject
to numerous laws, regulations and policies.  Changes in the laws,
regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof,
that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting
standards, tax laws and regulations, trade rules and customs regulations, and
the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we
may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results.

Our success depends, in part, on
the quality and safety of our products.

Our success depends, in part, on the quality and
safety of our products.  If our products
are found to be defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet our
consumers’ standards, our relationships with customers or consumers could
suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we
could lose sales and/or become subject to liability claims, any of which could
result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Our success depends, in part, on
our key personnel.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain
our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management
team.  The unexpected loss of one or more
of our key employees could adversely affect our business.  Our success also depends, in part, on our
continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified
personnel.  Competition for these
employees can be intense.  We may not be
able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and
our failure to do so could adversely affect our business.  This risk may be exacerbated by uncertainties
associated with our long-term strategy, SMI (as defined below) and other
initiatives.

We are subject to risks related
to our international operations.

We operate on a global
basis, with approximately 51% of our fiscal 2006 net sales generated outside
the United States.  We maintain offices in over 35 countries and have key
operational facilities located outside the United States that manufacture,
warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world.  Foreign
operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including but not
limited to:

·

fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates, which can affect our results of operations;
the value of our foreign assets; the relative prices at which we and foreign
competitors sell products in the same markets; and the cost of certain
inventory and non-inventory items required in our operations;

·

changes in
foreign laws, regulations and policies, including restrictions on trade, import
and export license requirements, and tariffs and taxes, as well as changes in
United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment;
and

·

adverse
weather conditions, social and geopolitical conditions, such as terrorist
attacks, war or other military action.

These risks could have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and
financial condition.

A disruption in operations could adversely affect our
business and financial results.

As a company engaged in
manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent
in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events,
strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in logistics or information
systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality
control, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as
natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no
control.  If such an event were to occur, it could have an adverse affect
on our business and financial results.

Our
information systems and websites may be susceptible to outages and other risks.

We have information
systems that support our business processes, including product development,
marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and
intracompany communications throughout the world.  We have e-commerce and other Internet
websites in the United States and many other countries.  These systems may be susceptible to outages
due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and
similar events.  Despite the
implementation of network security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to
computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized
tampering.  The occurrence of these or
other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely
affect our business and results of operations.


We
are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems.

As part of a program that
we call our “Strategic Modernization Initiative,” or “SMI,” we are implementing
enterprise-wide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated
data, processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to
standardize business processes across brands, operating units and sales
affiliates.  The implementation of SMI at
our Aveda operating unit is planned for fiscal 2007.  The full implementation of SMI is not
expected until 2010.  Failure to
implement SMI as planned, in terms of timing, specifications and/or costs,
could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

The
price of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of
analysts’ or others’ predictions of our earnings or other financial
performance.

Our business planning
process is designed to maximize the long-term strength, growth and
profitability of the Company, not to achieve an earnings target in any
particular fiscal quarter.  We believe
that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our
stockholders.  However, we do recognize
that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to what we think
will be our future net sales and earnings. 
Accordingly, when we announced our year-end financial results for fiscal
2006, we provided guidance as to our expected net sales and earnings for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2007 and the quarter ending September 30,
2006.  While we generally expect to
provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter,
we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at
such times or otherwise.

In all of our public
statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our sales
and/or earnings expectations, we accompany such statements directly, or by
reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our
actual results to differ materially from those we expect.  Such a list is included, among other places,
in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q).  These and other factors make it more
difficult for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our
earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.

Outside analysts, like
all investors, have the right to make their own predictions as to what the
Company’s financial results will be in a given fiscal year or quarter or even
in future years.  Outside analysts,
however, have access to no more material information about the Company’s plans
than any other public investor, and the Company does not endorse their
predictions as to our future performance. 
Nor does the Company assume any responsibility to correct the
predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from the Company’s
own internal expectations.  When the
Company announces actual results that differ from those that outside analysts
or others have been predicting, the market price of the Company’s securities
could be affected.  Investors who rely on
the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions
with respect to the Company’s securities do so at their own risk.  The Company takes no responsibility for any
losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of the Company’s
securities.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

We are involved, from
time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our
business.  Management believes that the
outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material
adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition.  However, management’s assessment of our
current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the
discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending
against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges, juries or
other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of
the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings.

On March 30, 2005, the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California entered
into a Final Judgment approving the settlement agreement we entered into in
July 2003 with the plaintiffs, the other Manufacturer Defendants (as defined
below) and the Department Store Defendants (as defined below) in a consolidated
class action lawsuit that had been pending in the Superior Court of the State
of California in Marin County since 1998. 
On April 29, 2005, notices of appeal were filed by representatives of
two members of the purported class of consumers.  One of those appeals has since been
withdrawn.  If the appeal is resolved
satisfactorily, the Final Judgment will result in the plaintiffs’ claims being
dismissed, with prejudice, in their entirety in both the Federal and California
actions.  There has been no finding or
admission of any wrongdoing by us in this lawsuit.  We entered into the settlement agreement
solely to avoid protracted and costly litigation.  In connection with the settlement agreement,
the defendants, including the Company, will provide consumers with certain free
products and pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees.  To meet its obligations under the settlement,
we took a special pre-tax charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million after-tax,
equal to $.06 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003.  At June 30, 2006, the remaining
accrual balance was $16.3 million.  The
charge did not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
condition.  In the Federal action, the
plaintiffs, purporting to represent a class of all U.S. residents who purchased
prestige cosmetics products at retail for personal use from eight department
stores groups that sold such products in the United States (the “Department
Store Defendants”), alleged that the Department Store Defendants, the Company
and eight other manufacturers of cosmetics (the “Manufacturer Defendants”)
conspired to fix and maintain retail prices and to limit the supply of prestige
cosmetics products sold by the Department Store Defendants in violation of
state and Federal laws. The plaintiffs sought, among other things, treble
damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees, interest and costs.

In 1998, the Office of
the Attorney General of the State of New York (the “State”) notified the
Company and ten other entities that they had been identified as potentially
responsible parties (“PRPs”) with respect to the Blydenburgh landfill in Islip,
New York.  Each PRP may be jointly and
severally liable for the costs of investigation and cleanup, which the State
estimated in 2006 to be approximately $19.7 million for all PRPs.  In 2001, the State sued other PRPs (including
Hickey’s Carting, Inc., Dennis C. Hickey and Maria Hickey, collectively the “Hickey
Parties”), in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York to
recover such costs in connection with the site, and in September 2002, the
Hickey Parties brought contribution actions against the Company and other
Blydenburgh PRPs.  These contribution
actions seek to recover, among other things, any damages for which the Hickey
Parties are found liable in the State’s lawsuit against them, and related costs
and expenses, including attorneys’ fees. 
In June 2004, the State added the Company and other PRPs as defendants
in its pending case against the Hickey Parties. 
In April 2006, the Company and other defendants added numerous other
parties to the case as third-party defendants. 
The Company and certain other PRPs have engaged in settlement
discussions which to date have been unsuccessful.  Settlement negotiations with the new
third-party defendants, the State, the Company and other defendants began in
July 2006.  We have accrued an amount
which we believe would be necessary to resolve our share of this matter.  If settlement discussions are not successful,
we intend to vigorously defend the pending claims.  While no assurance can be given as to the
ultimate outcome, management believes that the resolution of the Blydenburgh
matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.

On June 13, 2006, the
Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego dismissed, without
leave to amend, all of the plaintiff’s final remaining claims against the
Company in a matter originally brought in December 2004 by the plaintiff purporting
to represent a nationwide class of individuals “who have purchased skin care
products from defendants that have been falsely advertised to have an ‘anti-aging’
or youth inducing benefit or effect.” 
The plaintiff sought injunctive relief, restitution, and general,
special and punitive damages for alleged violations of the California Unfair
Competition Law, the California False Advertising Law, and for negligent and
intentional misrepresentation.


In June 2006 and October
2005, we received favorable decisions from the Portuguese Tax Administration on
the oppositions our subsidiary filed in July 2005 to the notices of assessment
it received in May 2005 and on the opposition our subsidiary filed in March
2005 to the notice of assessment it received in December 2004,
respectively.  Furthermore, the
notification we received in June 2006, contained an order canceling the
assessments received in May 2005, which were for the calendar years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2002 in the amounts of 21.6 million Euro and 22.4 million
Euro, respectively, and the assessment received in December 2004, which was for
the calendar year ended December 31, 2000 in the amount of 26.0 million
Euro.  Management believes that the
decisions are not subject to appeal. 
Since 1989, our subsidiary has been operating in the Madeira Free Trade
Zone, located in Portugal, under license from the Madeira Development
Corporation.

On March 30, 2006, a
purported securities class action complaint captioned Thomas S. Shin, et al. v.
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., et al., was filed against the Company and
certain of our officers and directors (collectively the “Defendants”) in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The complaint alleged that the Defendants
made statements during the period April 28, 2005 to October 25, 2005 in press
releases, the Company’s public filings and during conference calls with
analysts that were materially false and misleading and that artificially
inflated the price of the Company’s stock. 
The complaint alleged claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The
complaint also asserted that during the class period, certain executive
officers and the trust for the benefit of a director sold shares of our Class A
Common Stock at artificially inflated prices. 
Three additional purported securities class action complaints were
subsequently filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York containing similar allegations.  On July 10, 2006, the Court consolidated
these actions under the caption In re: Estée Lauder Companies Securities
Litigation, appointed lead plaintiff, and approved the selection of lead
counsel.  A consolidated amended
complaint is expected to be filed on or before September 8, 2006.  The Defendants believe that the claims asserted
in the original complaints, which are likely to form the basis of the consolidated
amended complaint, are without merit and they intend to defend the consolidated
action vigorously.

On April 10, 2006, a
shareholder derivative action complaint captioned Miriam Loveman v. Leonard A.
Lauder, et al., was filed against certain of our officers and all of our
directors as of that date (collectively the “Derivative Action Defendants”) in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The complaint alleges that the Derivative
Action Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company based on the
same alleged course of conduct identified in the Shin complaint described
above.  On May 4, 2006, the derivative
action was reassigned to the judge assigned to the now consolidated securities
action.  The Derivative Action Defendants
similarly believe that this complaint is without merit and they intend to
defend the action vigorously.

The Company previously
disclosed that it had received and was cooperating with an informal request for
information from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Staff”)
regarding matters raised in the Shin complaint described above.  In June 2006, the Company was advised by the
Staff that it does not anticipate seeking further information regarding those
matters.  The Company does not anticipate
any further developments in the inquiry.

We expect to continue the
payment of cash dividends in the future, but there can be no assurance that the
Board of Directors will continue to declare them.  In November 2005 and 2004, the Board of
Directors declared an annual dividend of $.40 per share which was paid in
December 2005 and 2004, respectively.

As of August 22, 2006,
there were approximately 3,526 record holders of Class A Common Stock and 23
record holders of Class B Common Stock.

Share Repurchase Program

We are authorized by the
Board of Directors to repurchase up to 48.0 million shares of Class A Common
Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on
market conditions and other factors.  As
of June 30, 2006, the cumulative total of acquired shares pursuant to the
authorization was 38.6 million, reducing the remaining authorized share
repurchase balance to 9.4 million.  During
fiscal 2006, we purchased approximately 11.2 million shares for $400.5 million

Sales of
Unregistered Securities

Shares of Class B Common Stock may be converted immediately into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis by the holder and are automatically converted into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis upon transfer to a person or entity that is not a “Permitted Transferee” or soon after a record date for a meeting of stockholders where the outstanding Class B Common Stock constitutes less than 10% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company.  There is no cash or other consideration paid by the holder converting the shares and, accordingly, there is no cash or other consideration received by the Company.  The shares of Class A Common Stock issued by the Company in such conversions are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) thereof.

During the three months
ended June 30, 2006, the holders set forth in the table converted shares of

(a) Fiscal 2006 results
included $93.0 million, after-tax, or $.43 per diluted share in special charges
related to our cost savings initiative and tax-related matters.  Included in the charges was an operating
expense charge of $92.1 million, equal to $.27 per diluted common share related
to the cost savings initiative.  The results
also included a special tax charge related to a settlement with the Internal
Revenue Service regarding an examination of our consolidated Federal income tax
returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2001, and represents the aggregate
earnings impact of the settlement through fiscal 2006.  The settlement resulted in an increase to our
fiscal 2006 income tax provision and a corresponding decrease in fiscal 2006
net earnings of approximately $46 million, or approximately $.21 per diluted
common share.  During the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2006, we completed the repatriation of foreign earnings through
intercompany dividends under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004 (the “AJCA”).  In connection with
the repatriation, we finalized computations of the related aggregate tax
impact, resulting in a favorable adjustment of approximately $11 million, or
approximately $.05 per diluted common share, to our initial tax charge of $35
million recorded in fiscal 2005.  The tax
settlement, coupled with the AJCA favorable tax adjustment, resulted in a net
increase to our fiscal 2006 income tax provision and a corresponding decrease
in fiscal 2006 net earnings of approximately $35 million, or approximately $.16
per diluted common share.

(b) In the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2005, we announced plans to repatriate approximately $690 million of
foreign earnings in fiscal year 2006, which included $500 million of
extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the AJCA.  This action resulted in an aggregate tax
charge of approximately $35 million in our fiscal year ended June 30,
2005, which included an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million,
equal to $.12 per diluted share.

(c) Fiscal 2003 included
a special charge related to the proposed settlement of a legal action of $13.5
million, after-tax, or $.06 per diluted common share.

(d) Fiscal 2002
included a restructuring charge of $76.9 million (of which $0.6 million was
included in discontinued operations), after tax, or $.32 per diluted common
share, and a one-time charge of $20.6 million, or $.08 per diluted common
share, attributable to the cumulative effect of adopting Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” which is attributable to our former reporting unit that sold

jane

brand products and is included in
discontinued operations.

(e) During fiscal 2004,
there was an increase of approximately $17.4 million in interest expense, net
and a corresponding decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the
adoption of SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.”  Additionally, in connection with this
pronouncement, redeemable preferred stock was reclassified as a component of
total debt subsequent to June 30, 2003 and all subsequent applicable
periods.

(f) In April 2006,
we completed the sale of certain assets and operations of the reporting unit
that marketed and sold Stila brand products. 
In February 2004, we sold the assets and operations of our former
reporting unit that sold

jane

brand
products.  As a result, all consolidated
statements of earnings information in the consolidated financial statements and
footnotes for all periods presented has been restated for comparative purposes
to reflect those reporting units as discontinued operations.

Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
ESTIMATES

The discussion and
analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2006 and our results of
operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2006 are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  These judgments can be subjective and
complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those
estimates.  Our most critical accounting
policies relate to revenue recognition, concentration of credit risk,
inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill and other
intangible assets, income taxes, derivatives and stock-based compensation.

Management of the Company
has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect
of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon
transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer
of the risk of loss related to those goods. 
In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the
product is shipped to the customer and, in the Europe, Middle East & Africa
and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the
customer’s receipt.  In certain
circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale (e.g., at our
retail stores).

Sales are reported on a
net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of
actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with
retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.  Our practice is to accept product returns
from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved.  In accepting returns, we typically provide a
credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.  As a percentage of gross sales, returns were
5.0% in fiscal 2006 and 4.6% in fiscal 2005 and 2004.

Our
sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact
on reported net sales.

This
accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future
returns and information provided by authorized retailers regarding their
inventory levels.  Consideration of these
factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects
increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.  Experience has shown a relationship between
retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well
as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our
business.  In addition, as necessary,
specific accruals may be established for significant future known or
anticipated events.  The types of known
or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider,
include, but are not limited to, the solvency of our customers, store closings
by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue or
support new and existing products.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

An entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk
if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated
its risks through diversification of customers. 
The significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of
the concentration.

During fiscal 2006,
Federated Department Stores, Inc. acquired The May Department Stores Company,
resulting in the merger of our previous two largest customers.  This customer sells products primarily within
North America and accounted for $1,005.8 million, or 16%, of our consolidated
net sales in fiscal 2006 and $105.4 million, or 14%, of our accounts receivable
at June 30, 2006.  Although management
believes that this customer and our other major customers are sound and
creditworthy, a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a
corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows and/or
financial condition.

In the ordinary course of
business, we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer
deductions in the amount of $27.1 million and $28.9 million as of June 30, 2006
and 2005, respectively.  Our allowance for doubtful accounts is a
subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net
earnings.  The allowance for doubtful
accounts was reduced by $12.0 million, $12.6 million and $25.6 million for
customer deductions and write-offs in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
and increased by $10.2 million, $11.4 million and $23.9 million for additional
provisions in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  This reserve is based upon the evaluation of
accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends.

Inventory

We state our
inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value, with cost being determined
on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. 
We believe FIFO most closely matches the flow of our products from
manufacture through sale.  The reported
net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products,
raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in
future periods.  Inventory cost includes
raw materials, direct labor and overhead.


We also record an
inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the
cost of the inventory and its estimated market value, based on various product
sales projections.  This reserve is
calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory
based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted
sales.  In addition, and as necessary, we
may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.

Pension
and Other Post-retirement Benefit Costs

We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees:
a domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension
plan  (“U.S. Qualified Plan”) and an
unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide
benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S.
Qualified Plan, the “Domestic Plans”); a contributory defined contribution
plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both
defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation;
and certain other post-retirement benefits.

The amounts necessary to
fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and
variables.  Certain significant variables
require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated
discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation
levels.  We evaluate these assumptions
with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry
ranges, although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events
outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings.

The pre-retirement
discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit
cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.  For fiscal 2006, we used a pre-retirement
discount rate for our Domestic Plans of 5.25% and varying rates on our
international plans of between 1.75% and 5.50%. 
The pre-retirement rate for our Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio
that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a
major rating agency.  We believe the
timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio
is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our
Domestic Plans.  For fiscal 2006, we used
an expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and
varying rates of between 2.75% and 7.50% for our international plans.  In determining the long-term rate of return
for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan’s
investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies.  The U.S. Qualified Plan asset allocation as
of June 30, 2006 was approximately 62% equity investments, 27% fixed income
investments and 11% other investments. 
The asset allocation of our combined international plans as of June 30,
2006 was approximately 58% equity investments, 23% fixed income investments and
19% other investments.  The difference
between actual and expected returns on plan assets is accumulated and amortized
over future periods and, therefore, affects our recorded obligations and
recognized expenses in such future periods. 
For fiscal 2006, our pension plans had actual returns on assets of $64.4
million as compared with expected returns on assets of $37.0 million, which
resulted in a net deferred gain of $27.4 million.

A 25 basis-point change
in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have
had the following effect on fiscal 2006 pension expense:

Our post-retirement plans
are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost
trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported.  A one-percentage-point change in assumed
health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2006 would have had the following

For fiscal 2007, we will
use a pre-retirement discount rate for the Domestic Plans of 6.25% and varying
rates for our international plans of between 2.25% and 5.75%.  We anticipate using an expected return on
plan assets of 7.75% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates for our
international pension plans of between 2.75% and 7.25%.  The net change in these assumptions from
those used in fiscal 2006 will cause approximately a $1.5 million decrease in
pension expense in fiscal 2007.  We will
continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and
adjust them accordingly.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of
purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.  Other intangible assets principally consist
of purchased royalty rights and trademarks. 
Goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are
not amortized.


On an annual basis, or
sooner if certain events or circumstances warrant, we test goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.  To determine the fair value of these intangible
assets, there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the
results of the testing.  We have the
ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions
and estimates we choose.  To mitigate
undue influence, we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria
that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management.

Income
Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes.”  This statement establishes
financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes
that result from an enterprise’s activities during the current and preceding
years.  It requires an asset and
liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes.

As of June 30, 2006, we
have current net deferred tax assets of $139.1 million and non-current net
deferred tax liabilities of $43.2 million. 
The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their
realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax
rates.  Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of
approximately $6.5 million for deferred tax assets, which relates to foreign
tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date, where management believes it is
more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the
relevant jurisdiction.  Based on our
assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required.  If we determine that a deferred tax asset
will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in
a reduction of earnings at that time.

We provide tax reserves
for Federal, state, local and international exposures relating to periods
subject to audit.  The development of
reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential
outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.  Although the outcome relating to these
exposures is uncertain, in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income
taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these
exposures.  In certain circumstances, the
ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which
render them inestimable.  If actual
outcomes differ materially from these estimates, including those that cannot be
quantified, they could have a material impact on our results of operations, as
we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 (see “Results of Operations

, Fiscal 2006 as Compared with Fiscal 2005 — Provision for Income Taxes

”).

Derivatives

We account for derivative financial instruments in
accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” as amended, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.  This statement also requires the recognition
of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance
sheet and that they be measured at fair value.

We currently use
derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and
interest rates, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign
currencies.  We do not utilize
derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  Hedge effectiveness is documented, assessed
and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and
monitor the instruments.  Variables that
are external to us such as social, political and economic risks may have an
impact on our hedging program and the results thereof.  For a discussion on the quantitative impact
of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments, refer to “

Liquidity and Capital Resources — Market Risk.”

Stock-Based
Compensation

With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on July 1, 2005, we
are required to record the fair value of stock-based compensation awards as an
expense.  In order to determine the fair
value of stock options on the date of grant, we apply the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model.  Inherent in this
model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, option life,
risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. 
While the risk-free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective
assumptions that are based on factual data derived from public sources, the
expected stock-price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater
level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates.

We
use an expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both
current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which are
obtained from public data sources.  This
approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and
is directly related to stock option valuation. 
For stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended June 30,
2006, we used a weighted-average expected stock-price volatility of 23% based
upon the implied volatility at the time of issuance.

With
regard to the weighted-average option life assumption, we consider the exercise
behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises.  Patterns are determined based on specific
criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees including the reaction to vesting,
realizable value, long-run exercise propensity, pent-up demand, stock run-up
effect and short-time-to-maturity effect. 
For stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended June 30,
2006, we used a weighted-average expected option life assumption of
approximately 8 years.


While
we believe the above critical estimates are based on outcomes that are
reasonably likely to occur, if we were to increase or decrease the expected
option life by 1 year and simultaneously increase or decrease the expected
volatility by 100 basis points, recognized compensation expense would have
changed approximately $2.6 million in either direction for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2006.

Quantitative
Analysis

During the three-year period ended June 30, 2006, there have
not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical
accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates.  With the exception of our tax settlement with
the Internal Revenue Service in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, which
finalized the ultimate liability for exposures which were previously
inestimable (see “Results of Operations

, Fiscal 2006 as Compared
with Fiscal 2005 — Provision for Income Taxes

”), the results of our
business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our
expectations.

While we believe that the
estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations
for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions
could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net
sales, cost of sales, operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as
they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, allowance for
doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.  For fiscal 2006, had these estimates been
changed simultaneously by 2.5% in either direction, our reported gross profit
would have increased or decreased by approximately $4.6 million, operating
expenses would have changed by approximately $0.7 million and the provision for
income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.0
million.  The collective impact of these
changes on operating income, net earnings and net earnings per diluted common
share would be an increase or decrease of approximately $5.3 million, $6.3
million and $.03, respectively.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We manufacture, market
and sell skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products which are
distributed in over 130 countries and territories.  We believe that the best way to increase
stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products
and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and
profitable manner.  With this goal in
mind, we have developed a long-term strategy based on the following five
imperatives:

1.

Optimize brand
portfolio

2.

Strengthen product
categories

3.

Strengthen and
expand geographic presence

4.

Diversify and
strengthen distribution channels

5.

Achieve operational
and cost excellence

In fiscal 2006, our
achievements included excellent growth in sales and profits in our makeup
artist brands, the divestiture of Stila, the strengthening of Estée Lauder

pleasures

, and the introduction of new products such as
Missoni fragrances and Unforgivable. 
These makeup and fragrance efforts, together with successful niche skin
care and hair care products have further strengthened our product categories.

Around the globe, we
generated growth in sales and profits in our travel retail business and
increased our presence in China and India. 
In alternative channels, we continued to grow our online business,
achieved double-digit profitability in our M·A·C stores and improved our
performance at our Aveda stores. 
Short-term improvements in operational and organizational effectiveness
led to improved customer service levels and better alignment of financial and
inventory objectives and strategic cost-cutting.  We also managed to cut costs through our
voluntary separation program and the related reorganization of certain
operations.  At the same time, we
continued to make progress on our Strategic Modernization Initiative, pursuant
to which we are planning to standardize business processes across our brands,
operating units and sales affiliates and implement enterprise-wide SAP
information systems that will provide us with integrated data, processes and
technologies.

During fiscal 2006, we
also faced challenges, many of which we expect to be ongoing in fiscal
2007.  For instance, we continue to see
challenges for certain of our core brands due in part to the consolidation and
changes taking place among retailers and the decline in effectiveness of
gift-with-purchase promotions.  In
addition, the fragrance business model continues to be a challenge, with even
the most successful launches having difficulty becoming profitable.  Efforts to expand geographically are
complicated by increasing regulatory issues and cultural barriers.  Despite our efforts to diversify our
distribution, there was no significant change in the mix of sales in the
various channels.  Continued increases in
energy and raw material costs, as well as inventory obsolescence, are
continuing to pressure cost of goods.

As we continue to
implement our strategic imperatives, we expect to make selective investments,
embark on new business endeavors, and pursue initiatives that we believe will
have long-term benefits.  The timing,
impact and magnitude of any particular actions, such as an acquisition to
strengthen our product categories and/or diversify our distribution channels,
are subject to numerous factors and cannot be predicted.  Nevertheless, we expect that any such actions
will impact our financial condition and/or results of operations in one or more
future quarterly and annual periods.


The following table is a
comparative summary of operating results from continuing operations for fiscal
2006, 2005 and 2004 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Note 2
and Note 17 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods
presented.  Products and services that do
not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been
included in the “other” category.

In order to meet the
demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and
established products through advertising, sampling and merchandising and phase
out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers.  The economics of developing, producing,
launching and supporting products influence our sales and operating performance
each period.  The introduction of new
products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products,
which we take into account in our business planning.

Fiscal
2006 as Compared with Fiscal 2005

NET SALES

Net
sales increased 3% or $183.8 million to $6,463.8 million due to growth in our
makeup, skin care and hair care product categories, which was partially offset
by lower sales in our fragrance product category.  The net increase reflects sales growth in all
geographic regions.  Excluding the impact
of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 4%.

sales of skin care products increased 2% or $48.7 million to $2,400.8 million
primarily due to new product launches. 
The recent launches of Resilience Lift Extreme Ultra Firming Cremes and
Re-Nutriv Ultimate Lifting Serum by Estée Lauder, and Turnaround Concentrate
Visible Skin Renewer and Turnaround 15-Minute Facial by Clinique generated
incremental sales of approximately $123 million, combined.  Perfectionist [CP+] by Estée Lauder and
products in Clinique’s 3-Step Skin Care System, bolstered by the introduction
of Liquid Facial Soap, contributed approximately $78 million to the
increase.  These improvements were offset
by approximately $157 million of decreases in sales of existing products in
certain of our core brands as well as declines in our BeautyBank brands, which
completed their initial rollout during the prior year.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, skin care net sales increased 3%.

Makeup

Makeup
net sales increased 6% or $137.4 million to $2,504.2 million reflecting growth
from our makeup artist brands of approximately $179 million.  This growth was partially offset by
approximately $72 million of lower sales from certain existing products,
reflecting challenges experienced by certain of our core brands, and declines
in our BeautyBank brands, which completed their initial rollout during the
prior year.  Excluding the impact of
foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 7%.


Fragrance

Net
sales of fragrance products decreased 4% or $47.3 million to $1,213.3 million
as we continue to be challenged in this product category, particularly in the
Americas region.  Estée Lauder Beyond
Paradise and various fragrances from

Clinique and Tommy Hilfiger generated approximately $106 million of
lower sales.  Also contributing to the
decrease were lower sales of approximately $28 million of True Star by Tommy
Hilfiger and Lauder Beyond Paradise Men by Estée Lauder as we anniversary the
initial shipments of those products in the prior year.  These decreases were partially offset by the
recent launches of True Star Men by Tommy Hilfiger and Unforgivable by Sean
John, which collectively contributed approximately $49 million to the category,
and higher sales of approximately $47 million of DKNY Be Delicious and Estée
Lauder

pleasures

.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, fragrance net sales decreased 2%.

Hair Care

Hair
care net sales increased 16% or $44.8 million to $318.7 million, primarily due
to sales growth from Bumble and bumble and Aveda products.  Bumble and bumble sales benefited from sales
growth due to new points of distribution, increases in sales of core products
and the launches of Shine and Powder products. 
Aveda net sales increases benefited from the recent launch of Damage
Remedy hair care products, strong demand for color products and from the recent
acquisition of a distributor.  Excluding
the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 17%.

Geographic Regions

Net
sales in the Americas increased 3% or $95.3 million to $3,446.4 million.  The increase was led by growth in the United
States of approximately $190 million from our makeup artist and hair care
brands, our internet distribution, and the introduction of the Unforgivable
fragrance by Sean John.  Partially
offsetting this growth was approximately $122 million related to weaknesses in
certain of our core brands as a result of challenges from competitive pressures
and business disruptions at certain key retailers, and lower sales from our
BeautyBank brands, which completed their initial rollout during the prior
year.  We expect business disruptions at
certain key retailers in the United States to continue into fiscal 2007.  Net sales growth in Canada, Latin America and
Mexico contributed an additional $48 million to the increase.

In
Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 2% or $38.6 million
to $2,147.7 million, reflecting higher net sales of approximately $64 million
from our travel retail and distributor businesses, Russia and the United
Kingdom, with all benefiting from the success of the DKNY Be Delicious
franchise and the

sale of M

C
products.  These increases were partially offset by
decreases of approximately $26 million in Spain and Italy.  Spain’s net sales were adversely affected by
changes to our distribution policy and a difficult retail environment.  Net sales in Italy were negatively impacted
by changes to our distribution policy and, to a lesser extent, the balancing of
inventory levels at its retailers.  On a
local currency basis, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa
increased 5%.

Recent events
related to the suspected terrorist activities in the United Kingdom, and
subsequent restrictions on products that can be carried in-flight, have created
uncertainty in the outlook for our travel retail business in fiscal 2007.  Based on current information, we do not
believe these events will have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations for our fiscal 2007 first quarter or full year.  In fiscal 2006, our travel retail business
comprised approximately 7% of total net sales, and accounted for approximately
20% of operating income.

Net
sales in Asia/Pacific increased 6% or $49.9 million to $869.7 million.  Strategic growth in China combined with
positive results in Korea and Hong Kong, contributed approximately $57 million
to sales growth in this region.  These
increases were partially offset by decreases in Japan and Australia of
approximately $18 million.  Japan’s
results were negatively impacted due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar
against the Japanese yen.  The decrease
in Australia reflected slower sell-through in a difficult retail environment,
particularly in the fragrance category, as well as the balancing of inventory
levels at a major retailer.  On a local
currency basis, net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 7%.

We
strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may
account for differences in regional sales growth.

COST OF SALES

Cost
of sales as a percentage of total net sales increased to 26.1% as compared with
25.5% in the prior year.  This change
reflected an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 40 basis points,
the net change in the mix of our business within our geographic regions and
product categories of approximately 20 basis points, a charge related to
unutilized tooling of approximately 10 basis points and 20 basis points related
to commodity material prices.  Partially
offsetting these increases were favorable changes in promotional activities of
approximately 30 basis points.


The
higher price of oil has resulted in price increases in certain oil-based
chemicals, which has had a slight adverse effect on our cost of sales
margin.  In an ongoing effort to mitigate
the impact of these increases, we are seeking potential offsetting
opportunities in other categories of material purchases through our sourcing
initiative in lower-cost manufacturing locations worldwide.

Since
certain promotional activities are a component of net sales or cost of sales
and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we
have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the
cost of sales percentage.  In addition,
future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which
have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing
brands.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Operating
expenses increased to 64.3% of net sales as compared with 62.9% of net sales in
the prior year.  The current year
operating expense margin was negatively impacted by charges related to the
implementation of our cost savings initiative of approximately $92.1 million or
approximately 140 basis points, costs related to stock-based compensation as a
result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) of approximately 60 basis points, and
the estimated impact of both the merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc.
and The May Department Stores Company and the hurricanes that affected the
southern United States of approximately 40 basis points.  Partially offsetting these incremental costs
were operating expense margin improvements of approximately 90 basis points
primarily resulting from net sales growth in brands and channels with lower advertising,
merchandising and sampling cost structures as well as an overall reduction in
this type of spending.  Overall operating
expenses reflected savings achieved during fiscal 2006 from our cost savings
initiative.

Changes
in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type,
timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as
well as the markets being emphasized.

During fiscal 2006, we recorded special charges associated with a cost savings initiative that was designed to support our long-term financial objectives.  As part of this multi-faceted initiative, we identified savings opportunities that include streamlined processes and organizational changes.  The principal component of the initiative was a voluntary separation program offered primarily to North America-based employees.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, involuntary separations were communicated to certain employees.  Under this initiative, we incurred expenses related to one-time termination benefits for 494 employees, of which 28 were involuntary, which benefits were based principally upon years of service.

In addition, we identified other cost savings opportunities to impr
ove efficiencies in our distribution network and product offerings and to eliminate other nonessential costs.  These charges primarily related to employee severance for facilities that are closing, contract cancellations, counter and door closings and product returns.  An additional $2 million to $3 million is expected to be incurred in fiscal 2007 related to the cost savings initiative.

For the year ended June 30, 2006, aggregate expenses of $92.1 million were recorded as special charges related to the cost savings initiative in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings.  At June 30, 2006, $40.7 million and $28.2 million related to the cost savings initiative were recorded in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The following table summarizes the costs and expected savings associated with our cost savings initiative, which impacted, and will continue to impact, our operating expenses and cost of sales:

OPERATING RESULTS

Operating
income decreased 15%, or $107.2 million, to $619.6 million.  Operating margin was 9.6% of net sales in
fiscal 2006 as compared with 11.6% in the prior year.  These results were negatively impacted by the
effects of special charges related to our cost savings initiative of $92.1
million, or 1.4% of net sales.  In
addition to the special charges, net sales growth was more than offset by the
increases in our cost of sales and operating expense margins as previously
discussed.

The
following discussions of Operating Results by

Product
Categories

and

Geographic Regions

exclude the impact of special
charges related to the implementation of our cost savings initiative.  We believe the following analysis of
operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our
business.

Product
Categories

Operating income declined
79% or $28.1 million to $7.7 million in the fragrance product category
reflecting lower sales and, to a lesser extent, expenses incurred related to
development of new products and brands, partially offset by a shift in spending
in certain of our core brands to other product categories.  As we continue to support selected fragrances
and develop new products, we anticipate the fragrance category to remain
challenging during fiscal 2007.  Skin
care operating income decreased 5% or $19.4 million to $346.4 million primarily
reflecting lower than anticipated net sales in certain of our core brands.  Operating income increased 9% or $28.3
million to $329.4 million in the makeup product category primarily reflecting
sales growth from our makeup artist brands, partially offset by declines in
certain of our core brands.  Hair care
operating income increased 16% or $3.7 million to $26.5 million reflecting
worldwide sales growth.  In fiscal 2006,
the merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores
Company had a negative impact on the operating results of our skin care, makeup
and fragrance product categories, while incremental operating expenses
associated with new accounting rules for stock-based compensation negatively
impacted all of our product categories.

Geographic
Regions

Operating income in the
Americas decreased 6% or $22.1 million to $344.1 million, primarily reflecting
challenges experienced by certain of our core brands, due in part to
competitive pressures and retailer consolidations, and incremental operating
expenses of approximately $33 million associated with new accounting rules for
stock-based compensation.  The ongoing
success of our makeup artist and hair care brands and our internet distribution
partially offset these challenges.  We
expect business disruptions to continue into fiscal 2007 at certain key
retailers in the United States.

In Europe, the Middle
East & Africa, operating income decreased 3% or $7.8 million to $297.5
million.  This decrease was primarily due
to lower results in Spain, Benelux (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg)
and Italy of approximately $20 million, collectively.  These decreases were partially offset by
improvements of approximately $12 million in France, our travel retail business
and Central Europe (Hungary, Poland and Czech Republic).

In Asia/Pacific,
operating income increased 27% or $14.8 million to $70.1 million.  This increase reflects improved results of
approximately $16 million in Korea, Japan and China, partially offset by lower
results in Taiwan and Thailand of approximately $4 million, collectively.  As China is an emerging market for us, we
have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in new brand expansion and
business opportunities there.

INTEREST

EXPENSE, NET

Net
interest expense was $23.8 million as compared with $13.9 million in the prior
year.  The increase in net interest
expense was primarily due to higher average interest rates and, to a lesser
extent, higher average debt balances due to outstanding commercial paper during
the year.  The increased expense was
partially offset by increased interest income related to higher investment
interest rates.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes represents Federal,
foreign, state and local income taxes. 
The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2006 was 43.6% as
compared with 41.2% in the prior year. 
The effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of
state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible
expenses.  The Company’s effective tax
rate will change from year to year based on non-recurring and recurring factors
including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and
amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes,
tax audit findings and settlements and the interaction of various global tax
strategies.


On July 13, 2006, we announced a settlement with the
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding its examination of our consolidated
Federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1998 through
June 30, 2001.  The settlement resolves
previously disclosed issues raised during the IRS’s examination, including
transfer pricing and foreign tax credit computations.  The settlement of these issues resulted in a
tax charge of approximately $46 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006
and represents the aggregate earnings impact of the settlement through fiscal
2006.  In addition, during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed the repatriation of foreign earnings through
intercompany dividends as required under the provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “AJCA”).  In
connection with the repatriation, we finalized computations of the related
aggregate tax impact, resulting in a favorable adjustment of approximately $11
million.  The tax settlement, coupled
with the AJCA favorable tax adjustment, resulted in a net increase to our
fiscal 2006 income tax provision of approximately $35 million.

The increase in the effective income tax rate was
attributable to the tax settlement charge of approximately 770 basis points, an
increase of approximately 60 basis points resulting from our foreign operations
and an increase in nondeductible expenses of approximately 30 basis
points.  These increases were partially
offset by the net reduction in the incremental tax charge relative to the
repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the AJCA of approximately 570
basis points, as well as a reduction of approximately 50 basis points for
miscellaneous items.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On April 10, 2006 (the “Effective
Date”), we completed the sale of certain assets and operations of the reporting
unit that marketed and sold Stila brand products to Stila Corp. (the “Purchaser”),
an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., for consideration of $23.0
million.  The sale price included cash of
$9.3 million, a promissory note with a notional value of $13.3 million and a
fair value of $11.0 million and convertible preferred stock with an aggregate
liquidation preference of $5.0 million and a fair value of $2.7 million.  As additional consideration for the purchased
assets, and subject to the terms and conditions of the sale agreement, the
Purchaser will pay us an amount equal to two percent of the annual net sales of
the acquired business during the period commencing on the Effective Date and
ending August 20, 2019.  We will use
these proceeds to satisfy our commitment under the 1999 agreement pursuant to
which we originally purchased the Stila business.  The Purchaser immediately assumed
responsibility for all decisions regarding the operations of the Stila business
and we agreed to divest ourself of continuing involvement in the Stila
business, except as described below.

In fiscal 2006, we
recorded charges of $80.3 million (net of $43.3 million tax benefit) to
discontinued operations, which reflected the loss on the disposition of the
business of $69.9 million, net of tax, and adjustments to the fair value of
assets sold, the costs to dispose of those assets not acquired by the Purchaser
and other costs in connection with the sale. 
The charges also include the operating losses of $10.4 million, net of
tax, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. 
Net sales associated with the discontinued operations were $45.1 million
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. 
All statements of earnings information for the prior years has been
restated for comparative purposes, including the restatement of the makeup
product category and each of the geographic regions presented in Note 17 -
Segment Data and Related Information.

In order to facilitate
the transition of the Stila business to the Purchaser, we agreed to provide
certain information systems, accounting and other back office services to the
Purchaser in exchange for monthly service fees designed to recover the
estimated costs of providing these transition services.  We also agreed with the Purchaser to provide
certain distribution and online services. 
In both cases, the services are expected to conclude in fiscal
2007.  In addition, we agreed to
manufacture and sell to the Purchaser a limited range of products for a period
of up to four months following the Effective Date and, in the case of one
product, of up to two years.

NET EARNINGS

Net earnings as compared
with the prior fiscal year declined $161.9 million or 40% to $244.2 million and
diluted net earnings per common share decreased 37% from $1.78 to $1.12.  Net earnings from continuing operations as
compared with the prior fiscal year decreased by $85.4 million or 21% to $324.5
million and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations
decreased 17% from $1.80 to $1.49.

Fiscal
2005 as Compared with Fiscal 2004

NET SALES

Net sales increased 9% or
$538.5 million to $6,280.0 million reflecting growth in all major product categories,
led by makeup and skin care, and growth in all geographic regions, led by
Europe, the Middle East & Africa. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales
increased 7%.


Product Categories

Skin Care

Net sales of skin care
products increased 10% or $212.0 million to $2,352.1 million.  Approximately $179 million of this sales
increase was related to the introduction of Future Perfect Anti-Wrinkle
Radiance Creme SPF 15 and launches in the Perfectionist and Re-Nutriv product
lines by Estée Lauder, launches of Superdefense Triple Action Moisturizers SPF
25 and certain Repairwear products by Clinique, the introduction of certain
American Beauty and Good Skin™ products and the recent launch of Modern
Friction by Origins.  On a combined
basis, strong sales of products in Clinique’s 3-Step Skin Care System and The
Lifting Face Serum & The Lifting Intensifier by La Mer contributed
approximately $29 million to the sales increase.  Partially offsetting these increases was a
decrease of approximately $52 million in sales of Perfectionist Correcting
Serum for Lines/Wrinkles, Idealist Micro-D Deep Thermal Refinisher, and the
White Light and LightSource lines of products by Estée Lauder.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, skin care net sales increased 7%.

Makeup

Makeup net sales
increased 13% or $267.4 million to $2,366.8 million.  The growth included approximately $56 million
of net sales from the launches of American Beauty and Flirt!, and higher sales
of Bobbi Brown products, collectively. 
An increase of approximately $105 million was attributable to the recent
launches of Superbalanced Compact Makeup SPF 20 and Colour Surge Eye Shadow
from Clinique and Lash XL Maximum Length Mascara, Tender Blush, Pure Pops
Brush-on Color and AeroMatte Ultralucent Pressed Powder by Estée Lauder.  Also contributing to sales growth was approximately
$70 million of increased sales from M·A·C’s Small Eye Shadow, Studio
Fix, Lustreglass and Pro Longwear Lipcolour. 
Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately $38
million in sales of the High Impact Mascara and High Impact Eye Shadow
collections and the Glosswear line of products by Clinique as well as of Pure
Color Lip Vinyl by Estée Lauder. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales
increased 11%.

Fragrance

Net sales of fragrance
products increased 3% or $39.5 million to $1,260.6 million.  The increase was due to approximately $188
million in sales generated by the fiscal 2005 launches of DKNY Be Delicious and
DKNY Be Delicious Men, True Star from Tommy Hilfiger, Lauder Beyond Paradise
Men from Estée Lauder, Happy To Be from Clinique and Donald Trump The
Fragrance.  Partially offsetting the new
product sales were decreases in sales of approximately $92 million of Estée
Lauder Beyond Paradise, Aramis Life and Clinique Simply, which were launched in
the prior year, as well as decreases in sales of approximately $49 million of
Tommy Jeans and Tommy from Tommy Hilfiger, certain other Aramis products and
Lauder Intuition Men from Estée Lauder. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net
sales increased slightly.  The fragrance
category remained challenging in fiscal 2006.

Hair Care

Hair care net sales
increased 10% to $273.9 million.  This
increase amounting to $24.5 million was due to sales growth from Aveda and
Bumble and bumble products.  Aveda net
sales increased as a result of sales of new professional color products and the
introductions of Pure Abundance and Damage Remedy hair care products, while
Bumble and bumble benefited from recent launches in its hair and scalp
treatment line of products and the initial shipments of Crème de Coco shampoos
and conditioners.  Both of these brands
also benefited from new points of distribution. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net
sales increased 9%.

Geographic Regions

Net sales in the Americas
increased 7% or $230.3 million to $3,351.1 million.  This region experienced growth in all major
categories which was fueled by the diversification in our product offerings as
new products and brands mitigated challenges among certain core brands and successful
fiscal 2004 launches.  In the United
States, our makeup artist and hair care brands along with products from our
Aramis and Designer Fragrances Division contributed approximately $145 million
to the increase.  In addition, higher net
sales in Canada and the inclusion of BeautyBank products contributed
approximately $76 million, collectively.

In Europe, the Middle
East & Africa, net sales increased 13% or $245.7 million to $2,109.1
million primarily due to higher net sales in the United Kingdom, our travel
retail business, Spain, Portugal, South Africa and Greece of approximately $179
million, collectively.  The increase in
net sales included benefits from the effect of the weaker U.S. dollar as
compared to various European currencies. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in
Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased 7%.

Net sales in Asia/Pacific
increased 8% or $62.5 million to $819.8 million.  This increase reflected higher net sales of
approximately $51 million in China, Hong Kong, Australia and Taiwan, partially
offset by lower sales in Japan of approximately $4 million.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 4%.

We strategically stagger
our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for
differences in regional sales growth.


COST OF
SALES

Cost of sales as a
percentage of total net sales was 25.5% and remained unchanged compared with
fiscal 2004.  Favorable net changes in
production and supply chain efforts of approximately 30 basis points, primarily
driven by favorable material sourcing, were offset by the net change in the mix
of our business within our geographic regions and product categories, as
discussed above, which includes the impact of the BeautyBank brands.  Changes in exchange rates compared with the
prior year had a de minimis net impact on our cost of sales margin.

Since certain promotional
activities are a component of net sales or cost of sales and the timing and
level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced,
and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales
percentage.  In addition, future cost of
sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and
product cost structures different from those of our existing brands.

OPERATING
EXPENSES

Operating expenses as a
percentage of net sales improved to 62.9% from 63.2% in fiscal 2004.  Our planned increase in advertising,
merchandising and sampling over the prior year of approximately 50 basis points
was offset in full by our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses
in line with our business needs.  We also
realized a benefit of approximately 30 basis points from the elimination of
royalty payments previously made to Mrs. Estée Lauder.

Changes in
advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing
and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as
the markets being emphasized.

OPERATING
RESULTS

Based on the growth of
net sales, our constant cost of sales margin and the improvement in our
operating expense margin as previously discussed, operating income increased
12% or $77.9 million to $726.8 million as compared with the prior fiscal
year.  Operating margins were 11.6% of
net sales in fiscal 2005 as compared with 11.3% in fiscal 2004.

Product
Categories

Operating income
increased 15% or $38.5 million in makeup and 9% or $29.5 million in skin care
reflecting overall sales growth and sales of recently launched products.  Operating results also increased 44% or $11.0
million in fragrance reflecting sales growth from new and recently launched
products.  While we experienced improved
results in fiscal 2005 due to these new launches, the fragrance business
continues to be challenging.  Hair care
operating results decreased 3% or $0.8 million reflecting an increase in
operating expenses related to the growth of our business in the United States
as well as the opening of new points of distribution in Korea and Japan,
partially offset by increases in net sales as previously discussed.  Hair care results were also adversely
impacted in fiscal 2005 by the need to make alternative arrangements due to the
bankruptcy of a third-party supplier. 
The situation was rectified during fiscal 2005.

Geographic
Regions

Operating income in the
Americas increased 13% or $43.0 million to $366.2 million, primarily due to
higher net sales resulting from an overall improvement in the retail
environment, strong product launches and growth from our newer brands.

In Europe, the Middle
East & Africa, operating income increased 10% or $28.4 million to
$305.3 million primarily due to improved results from our travel retail
business, Spain, the United Kingdom and Switzerland of approximately $33
million, collectively.  Partially offsetting
this improvement were lower results in France, which was negatively impacted by
the consolidation of major retailers, and in Russia, where we converted our
business from a distributor to a direct subsidiary, of approximately $6 million
on a combined basis.

In Asia/Pacific,
operating income increased 13% or $6.5 million to $55.3 million.  This increase reflected improved results in
Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan of approximately $10 million,
collectively, partially offset by a decrease in operating income in Korea and
China of approximately $6 million, combined. 
In addition, the Asia/Pacific region did not realize the benefits of
spending behind new whitening products, which experienced a delay in launching
during fiscal 2005.

INTEREST
EXPENSE, NET

Net interest
expense was $13.9 million as compared with $27.1 million in fiscal 2004.  The decrease in net interest expense was due
primarily to a $16.5 million decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result
of the redemption of $291.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015
Preferred Stock on June 10, 2004 and the reduction in the dividend rate on the
remaining $68.4 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock.  This improvement was partially offset by an
increase in interest expense as a result of higher debt balances and, to a
lesser extent, higher interest rates.


PROVISION
FOR INCOME TAXES

The provision for income
taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.  The effective rate for income taxes for
fiscal 2005 was 41.2% as compared with 37.7% in fiscal 2004.  The effective rate differs from statutory
rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign
jurisdictions, the effect of repatriating foreign earnings and certain
nondeductible expenses.

During the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2005, we formulated a plan to repatriate approximately $690 million
of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006, which included $500 million of
extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the AJCA.  This action resulted in an aggregate tax
charge of approximately $35 million in fiscal 2005, which included an
incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million.

The increase in the
effective income tax rate was attributable to the incremental tax charge
resulting from the repatriation plan of approximately 390 basis points and an
increase of approximately 110 basis points resulting from our foreign
operations.  These increases were
partially offset by a reduction in the amount of nondeductible preferred stock
dividends of approximately 90 basis points, a decrease in state and local
income taxes of approximately 40 basis points and an increase in tax credits of
approximately 20 basis points.

NET
EARNINGS

Net earnings and diluted
net earnings per common share increased approximately 19% and 20%,
respectively.  Net earnings as compared
with fiscal 2004 improved $64.0 million to $406.1 million and diluted net
earnings per common share improved to $1.78 from $1.48.  Net earnings from continuing operations
increased by $31.4 million or 8% and diluted net earnings per common share from
continuing operations increased 10% to $1.80 from $1.64 in the prior fiscal
year.  The planned repatriation of
foreign earnings in accordance with the AJCA, as discussed above, resulted in
an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million, or $.12 per diluted
common share.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our principal sources of
funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under
commercial paper, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed
and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United
States and abroad.  At June 30, 2006, we
had cash and cash equivalents of $368.6 million compared with $553.3 million at
June 30, 2005.

At June 30, 2006, our
outstanding borrowings of $521.5 million included: (i) $230.0 million of 6%
Senior Notes due January 2012 consisting of $250.0 million principal,
unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million and a $19.4 million adjustment to
reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap; (ii) $197.4
million of 5.75% Senior Notes due October 2033 consisting of $200.0 million
principal and unamortized debt discount of $2.6 million; (iii) a 1.8 million
Euro note (approximately $1.9 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2006)
payable semi-annually through February 2008 at a variable interest rate; (iv)
$7.1 million of capital lease obligations; (v) a 3.0 billion yen short-term
borrowing under a revolving credit facility (approximately $26.2 million at the
exchange rate at June 30, 2006); (vi) $38.0 million of outstanding loan
participation notes due July 2006 at an initial interest rate of 5.41%; and
(vii) $20.9 million of other short-term borrowings.

We have a $750.0 million
commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the
United States.  Our commercial paper is
currently rated A-1 by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s.  Our long-term credit ratings are A+ with a
stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A1 with a stable outlook by Moody’s.  At June 30, 2006, we had no commercial paper
outstanding.  We also have an effective
shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to an
additional $300.0 million in debt securities and $150.2 million in additional
uncommitted credit facilities, of which $20.9 million was used as of June 30,
2006.

We have an unused $600.0
million senior revolving credit facility that expires on May 27, 2010.  The facility may be used for general
corporate purposes, including financing working capital, and also as credit
support for our commercial paper program. 
Up to the equivalent of $250.0 million of the facility is available for
multi-currency loans.  The interest rate
on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of
prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative
agent, or the Federal funds rate plus ½%. 
The credit facility has an annual fee of $0.4 million, payable
quarterly, based on our current credit ratings. 
As of June 30, 2006, we were in compliance with all related financial
and other restrictive covenants, including limitations on indebtedness and
liens.


In May 2006, we entered
into a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution for
the primary purpose of funding cash dividend repatriations from certain of our
international affiliates to the United States as permitted by the AJCA.  Under the agreement, we may borrow up to
$150.0 million in the form of loan participation notes which were issued by one
of our subsidiaries in Europe.  The
interest rate on borrowings under this agreement will be an all-in fixed rate
determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each
borrowing.  At June 30, 2006, $38.0
million was outstanding under this agreement and the notes are being refinanced
on a periodic basis as they mature at the then prevailing market interest
rates.  Debt issuance costs incurred
related to this agreement were de minimis.

In March 2006, we
entered into a 3.0 billion yen revolving credit facility that expires on March
24, 2009.  The interest rate on
borrowings under the credit facility is based on TIBOR (Tokyo Interbank Offered
Rate) and a 10 basis point facility fee is incurred on the undrawn balance.  We borrowed 3.0 billion yen under the new
facility on March 28, 2006 to repay the previously outstanding 3.0 billion yen
term loan that was to mature on that date. 
The outstanding balance at June 30, 2006 ($26.2 million at the exchange
rate at June 30, 2006) is classified as short-term debt on our consolidated
balance sheet.

In October 2005,
we redeemed the remaining $68.4 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock that was
outstanding at June 30, 2005 and paid the accrued dividends thereon.

Our business is seasonal
in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.  From time to time, we may enter into
investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.  To the extent that these needs exceed cash
from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper
or loan participation notes, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under
the revolving credit facility or other credit facilities.

Total debt as a
percent of total capitalization was 24% at June 30, 2006 and 30% at June 30,
2005.

The effects of inflation
have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent
years.  Generally, we have been able to
introduce new products at higher selling prices or

increase
selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases, which have been moderate.

We believe that cash on
hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to
credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business
operations and capital expenditures on both a near-term and long-term basis.

Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating activities was $709.8
million in fiscal 2006 as compared with $478.1 million in fiscal 2005.  The net increase in operating cash flows for
fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 primarily reflected favorable changes
in certain working capital accounts, partially offset by a decrease in net
earnings from continuing operations.  Net
accounts receivable balances decreased primarily reflecting higher collections
domestically during fiscal 2006. 
Inventory levels remained constant at June 30, 2006 as compared to June
30, 2005 due to our efforts to better manage our inventory.  Increases in other accrued liabilities
primarily reflected higher advertising, merchandising and sampling accruals
compared to the prior year, as well as significant deferred compensation and
supplemental pension payments made to retired executives in fiscal 2005.  Additional increases in other accrued
liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities reflected accrued employee
separation benefits related to the Company’s cost savings initiative.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $478.1
million in fiscal 2005 and $673.0 million in fiscal 2004.  The net decrease reflected changes in certain
working capital accounts, partially offset by decreases in net deferred taxes
and an increase in net earnings from continuing operations.  The change in other accrued liabilities
primarily reflected the payment of significant deferred compensation and
supplemental payments made to retired executives in fiscal 2005.  Accounts receivable increased as a result of
sales growth in fiscal 2005, reflecting growth in international markets and
customers which generally carry longer payment terms.  The timing of payments from certain domestic
customers as well as shipments that occurred later in the period also
contributed to increased accounts receivable. 
The increase in inventory was primarily due to actual and anticipated
sales levels, the building of safety stock in our new distribution center in
Europe, and, to a lesser extent, the inclusion of new points of
distribution.  The shift in cash
activities related to accounts payable reflected the timing of disbursements
year-over-year as well as the initiation of a vendor-managed inventory program.  Net deferred taxes decreased primarily due to
the then-anticipated repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 as a
result of the AJCA and the realization of the tax benefits related to payments
made to retired executives.

Net cash used for
investing activities was $303.2 million in fiscal 2006 compared with $237.0
million in fiscal 2005 and $213.7 million in fiscal 2004.  The increase in cash flows used for investing
activities during fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the cash payment related to
the Jo Malone Limited earn-out provision and, to a lesser extent, Aveda
distributor acquisitions.  Capital
expenditures also increased in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting our continuing
company-wide initiative to upgrade our information systems, which was initiated
in fiscal 2005.  Fiscal 2005 capital
expenditures reflected those costs related to our information systems as well
as the investment in leasehold improvements in our corporate offices.  Capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 primarily
reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment, dies and molds, new
store openings, store improvements, counter construction and information
technology enhancements.  In fiscal 2007,
we expect to purchase the remaining equity interest in Bumble and Bumble
Products, LLC and Bumble and Bumble, LLC.


Cash used for financing activities was $594.6 million,
$300.4 million and $216.0 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.  In addition to common
stock repurchases and dividend payments, cash flows used for financing activities
reflected the repayment of short-term commercial paper that was outstanding at
June 30, 2005 and the October 2005 redemption of the remaining 2015 Preferred
Stock.  These outflows were partially
offset by short-term borrowings under our loan participation note program.  The 3.0 billion yen term loan outstanding at
the end of fiscal 2005 was refinanced by borrowings under the new 3.0 billion
yen revolving credit facility that we entered into in March 2006.  The net cash used for financing activities in
fiscal 2005 primarily reflected common stock repurchases and dividend payments,
partially offset by the issuance of short-term commercial paper to fund working
capital needs and the receipt of proceeds from employee stock option
transactions.  The net cash used for
financing activities in fiscal 2004 primarily related to the redemption of
$291.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Preferred Stock, common
stock repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by proceeds from the
issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes and from employee stock option transactions.

Dividends

On November 10,
2005, the Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $.40 per share, or
$85.5 million, on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, which was paid on
December 28, 2005 to stockholders of record at the close of business on
December 9, 2005.  The annual common
stock dividend declared during fiscal 2005 was $.40 per share, or $90.1
million, which was paid on December 28, 2004 to stockholders of record at the
close of business on December 10, 2004. 
Dividends on the 2015 Preferred Stock were $0.5 million and $0.9 million
for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  These dividends have been characterized as
interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for
the respective fiscal years.

Pension Plan
Funding and Expense

We maintain pension plans
covering substantially all of our full-time employees for our U.S. operations
and a majority of our international operations. 
Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of
service and employees’ earnings.  In the
United States, we maintain a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined
benefit pension plan (“U.S. Qualified Plan”). 
Additionally, we have an unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory
pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations.  Our international pension plans are comprised
of defined benefit and defined contribution plans.

Several factors influence
our annual funding requirements.  For the
U.S. Qualified Plan, our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a
rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded
percentages.  Such contribution is not
less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and subsequent pension legislation, and is not
more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.  For each international plan, our funding
policies are determined by local laws and regulations.  In addition, amounts necessary to fund future
obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as
detailed in “

Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates

”).  The effect of our pension plan funding on
future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee
demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take
lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.

For fiscal 2006 and 2005,
there was no minimum contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan required by
ERISA.  However, while we did not make
any cash contributions pursuant to the plan during fiscal 2006, we made cash
contributions of $2.0 million during fiscal 2005 at management’s
discretion.  During fiscal 2007, we do
not expect to make any cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan.

For fiscal 2006 and 2005,
we made benefit payments under our non-qualified domestic noncontributory
pension plan of $7.4 million and $5.0 million, respectively.  We expect to make benefit payments under this
plan during fiscal 2007 of $10.3 million. 
For fiscal 2006 and 2005, we made cash contributions to our
international pension plans of $25.7 million and $29.2 million,
respectively.  We expect to make
contributions under these plans during fiscal 2007 of $18.8 million.

In addition, at June 30,
2006 and 2005, we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension
plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the
accumulated benefit obligation and, accordingly, a benefit or a charge was
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’
equity for the change in such liability. 
During fiscal 2006, we recorded a benefit, net of deferred tax, of $29.9
million while in fiscal 2005, we recorded a charge, net of deferred tax, of
$11.4 million to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Commitments and Contingencies

Certain
of our business acquisition agreements include “earn-out” provisions.  These provisions generally require that we
pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the
performance of the acquired business. 
The payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our
next earn-out payment will be made in fiscal 2007, when we

expect to
purchase the remaining equity interest in Bumble and Bumble Products, LLC and
Bumble and Bumble, LLC.  Since the size of each payment depends upon
performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will
have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial
condition.

contingencies, refer to

“Item 3. Legal
Proceedings.”

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

We address certain
financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that
includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  We primarily enter into foreign currency
forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects
of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. 
We also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the
effects of fluctuating interest rates. 
We categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than
trading.

For each derivative
contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting
treatment, we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument
and hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for
undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging
instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed
prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring
ineffectiveness.  This process includes
linking all derivatives that are designated as fair-value, cash-flow, or
foreign-currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet
or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.  We also formally assess, both at the hedge’s
inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values
or cash flows of hedged items.  If it is
determined that a derivative is not highly effective, then we will be required
to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

We enter into forward
exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables
and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with our
identified exposures.  The purpose of the
hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements
on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign
subsidiaries.  Almost all foreign
currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries
and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a
major rating agency.  We also enter into
foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a
high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.  The forward exchange contracts and foreign
currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been
designated as cash-flow hedges.  Hedge
effectiveness of forward exchange contracts is based on a hypothetical
derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to
the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.  Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency
option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.  The ineffective portion of both forward
exchange and foreign currency option contracts is recorded in current-period
earnings. For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge
accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings when the underlying
forecasted transaction occurs. If it is probable that the forecasted
transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses accumulated in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to current-period earnings.  As of June 30, 2006, these cash-flow hedges
were highly effective, in all material respects.

As a matter of policy, we
only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an “A” (or
equivalent) credit rating.  The
counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.  We do not have significant exposure to any
one counterparty.  Our exposure to credit
loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to
only the recognized, but not realized, gains attributable to the
contracts.  Management believes risk of
default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be
material to the consolidated financial results. 
The contracts have varying maturities through the end of June 2007.  Costs associated with entering into such
contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results.  We do not utilize derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.


At June 30, 2006, we had
foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option
contracts in the amount of $782.6 million and $130.2 million,
respectively.  The foreign currencies
included in forward exchange contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars)
are principally the Euro ($238.5 million), Swiss franc ($98.5 million), British
pound ($92.4 million), Canadian dollar ($71.7 million), Japanese yen ($50.6
million), Australian dollar ($50.5 million) and South Korean won ($33.1
million).  The foreign currencies included
in the option contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally
the Japanese yen ($32.0 million), Euro ($27.7 million), Canadian dollar ($22.8
million), Swiss franc ($14.8 million) and South Korean won ($13.4 million).

Interest Rate Risk Management

We enter into interest
rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest
rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent with the
identified exposures.  All interest rate
derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong
investment grade by a major rating agency.

We have an interest rate
swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0 million to effectively convert
fixed interest on the existing $250.0 million 6% Senior Notes to variable
interest rates based on six-month LIBOR. 
We designated the swap as a fair-value hedge.  As of June 30, 2006, the fair-value hedge was
highly effective, in all material respects.

Market Risk

We use a value-at-risk
model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments.  Value-at-risk represents the potential losses
for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a
specified time period and confidence level. 
We estimate value-at-risk across all of our derivative financial
instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations
calculated over the past 250-day period. 
The measured value-at-risk, calculated as an average, for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2006 related to our foreign exchange contracts and our
interest rate contracts was $10.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively.

The model estimates were
made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level.  We used a statistical simulation model that
valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly
generated market price paths.

Our calculated
value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses
that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments
assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily
indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.  It does not represent the maximum possible
loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses
will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market
rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our
portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.

We believe, however, that
any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements
on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial
instrument was intended.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We do not maintain any
off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other
relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a
material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of
operations.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS

In June 2006, the FASB
issued FASB Interpretation Number (“FIN”) 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”).  FIN 48
establishes a recognition threshold and measurement for income tax positions
recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”  FIN 48 also prescribes a two-step evaluation
process for tax positions.  The first
step is recognition and the second is measurement.  For recognition, an enterprise judgmentally
determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be
sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or
litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.  If the tax position meets the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is measured and recognized in the
financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
50% likely of being realized.  If a tax
position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the
benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements.

Tax positions that meet
the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date of FIN 48
may be recognized or, continue to be recognized, upon adoption of FIN 48.  The cumulative effect of applying the
provisions of FIN 48 shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance
of retained earnings for that fiscal year. 
FIN 48 will apply to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006,
with earlier adoption permitted.  We are
currently evaluating the impact FIN 48 will have on our consolidated financial
statements when it becomes effective for us in fiscal 2008 and are unable, at
this time, to quantify the impact, if any, to retained earnings at the time of
adoption.


FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

We
and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward-looking
statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in our reports to
stockholders.  The words and phrases “will
likely result,” “expect,” “believe,” “planned,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “anticipate,”
“estimate,” “project” or similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act

Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable
assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations,
actual results may differ materially from our expectations.  Factors that could cause actual results to
differ from expectations include, without limitation:

(1) increased competitive activity from
companies in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses, some of
which have greater resources than we do;

(2) our ability to develop, produce and market
new products on which future operating results may depend and to successfully
address challenges in our core brands, including gift with purchase, and in our
fragrance business;

(3) consolidations, restructurings,
bankruptcies and reorganizations in the retail industry causing a decrease in
the number of stores that sell our products, an increase in the ownership
concentration within the retail industry, ownership of retailers by our
competitors and ownership of competitors by our customers that are retailers;

(4) destocking by retailers;

(5) the success, or changes in timing or
scope, of new product launches and the success, or changes in the timing or the
scope, of advertising, sampling and merchandising programs;

policies (including the interpretations and enforcement thereof) that affect,
or will affect, our business, including those relating to our products, changes
in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, trade rules and customs
regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings,
and any action we may take as a result;

(9) foreign currency fluctuations affecting
our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets, the relative
prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same
markets and our operating and manufacturing costs outside of the United States;

(10) changes in global or local conditions,
including those due to natural or man-made disasters, real or perceived
epidemics, or energy costs, that could affect consumer purchasing, the willingness
or ability of consumers to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling,
the financial strength of our customers or suppliers, our operations, the cost
and availability of capital which we may need for new equipment, facilities or
acquisitions, the cost and availability of raw materials and the assumptions
underlying our critical accounting estimates;

(11) shipment delays, depletion of inventory
and increased production costs resulting from disruptions of operations at any
of the facilities that manufacture nearly all of our supply of a particular
type of product (i.e., focus factories) or at our distribution or inventory
centers;

(12) real estate rates and availability, which
may affect our ability to increase the number of retail locations at which we
sell our products and the costs associated with our other facilities;

(13) changes in product mix to products which
are less profitable;

(14) our ability to acquire, develop or
implement new information and distribution technologies, on a timely basis and
within our cost estimates;

(15) our ability to capitalize on
opportunities for improved efficiency, such as publicly-announced cost savings
initiatives and the success of Stila under new ownership, and to integrate
acquired businesses and realize value therefrom;

(16) consequences attributable to the events
that are currently taking place in the Middle East, including terrorist
attacks, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation;

(17) the timing and impact of acquisitions and
divestitures, which depend on willing sellers and buyers, respectively; and

(18) additional factors as described in our
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006.

We
assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements made herein or
otherwise.

Controls and Procedures.

Our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  The Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of
management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of June 30, 2006 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded
that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.

As part of our global
distribution strategy to establish regional inventory centers, we continue to
migrate certain storage and distribution activities to a third party in Europe
as well as within our Belgian facilities.

In connection with these
changes, we have updated our internal controls over financial reporting.  Except as noted in the previous sentences,
there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Management’s report on
internal control over financial reporting and the report of independent
registered public accounting firm on our management’s assessment of internal
control over financial reporting are incorporated herein from pages F-2 and
F-3, respectively.

Director Share Incentive Plan (the “Director Plan”), a Sassaby stock option
plan (see note (b)) and five employment agreements entered into in 1995
prior to the Company’s initial public offering.

(b)

Consists of 26,215,748 shares issuable upon
exercise of outstanding options, 111,138 issuable upon conversion of
outstanding Restricted Stock Units, 166,707 upon conversion of outstanding
Performance Share Units (assuming maximum payout) and 13,052 upon conversion of
Share Units.  Outstanding options include
4,104 shares issuable upon exercise of options assumed by the Company in
connection with its acquisition of Sassaby, Inc. in 1997.  The Company never granted any additional
options under the Sassaby plan.

(c)

Calculated based upon outstanding options in
respect of 26,215,748 shares of our Class A Common Stock.

(d)

The 1999 Plan and the 2002 Plan are similar
omnibus plans.  Each authorizes the Stock
Plan Subcommittee of the Board of Directors to grant shares and benefits other
than stock options.  As of June 30,
2006, there were 451,519 shares and 10,205,065 shares of Class A Common
Stock available for issuance under each plan, respectively.  Shares underlying grants cancelled or
forfeited under the 1999 Plan may be used for grants under the 2002 Plan.  Shares underlying grants cancelled or
forfeited under the 1996 Plan may be used for grants under the 1999 Plan or the
2002 Plan. The Director Plan provides for an annual grant of options and a
grant of either options or stock units to non-employee directors.  As of June 30, 2006, there were 70,093
shares available for issuance under the Director Plan.

If
all of the outstanding options, warrants, rights, stock units and share units,
as well as the securities available for future issuance, included in the first
and third columns in the table above were converted to shares of Class A
Common Stock as of June 30, 2006, the total shares of Common Stock
outstanding (i.e., Class A plus Class B) would increase 18% to
248,994,342.  Of the outstanding options
to purchase 26,215,748 shares of Class A Common Stock, options in respect
of 12,965,313 shares are exercisable at a price less than $38.67, the closing
price on June 30, 2006.  Assuming
the exercise of in-the-money options, the total shares outstanding would
increase by 6.1% to 224,726,333.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting

Management of The Estée
Lauder Companies Inc. (including its subsidiaries) (the “Company”) is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended).

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.  A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision of
and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer, the Company’s management conducted an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on the framework and criteria established in

Internal

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors
and Stockholders

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.:

We have audited
management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).  The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.  A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,
management’s assessment that The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2006, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Also, in our opinion, The Estée Lauder
Companies Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of June 30, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of The Estée Lauder Companies
Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
June 30, 2006, and our report dated August 25, 2006 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  Our report also refers to the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” effective
July 1, 2005.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors
and Stockholders

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.:

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and
subsidiaries as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2006.  In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement
schedule as listed on the index on page F-1. 
These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States).  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended June 30, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.  Also in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Notes 2
and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” effective
July 1, 2005.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and
our report dated August 25, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles
of Consolidation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Estée Lauder
Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as continuing
operations, with the exception of the operating results of its reporting unit
that marketed and sold Stila brand products, which have been reflected as
discontinued operations for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 and the reporting unit
that sold

jane

brand products, which have been
reflected as discontinued operations for fiscal 2004 (see Note 4).  All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.

Certain amounts in
the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to
conform to current year presentation for comparative purposes.

Net
Earnings Per Common Share

For the years
ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, net earnings per common share (“basic
EPS”) is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy
certain conditions).  Net earnings per
common share assuming dilution (“diluted EPS”) is computed by reflecting
potential dilution from stock-based awards.

A reconciliation between
the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as
follows:

THE ESTÉE

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As of June 30, 2006,
2005 and 2004, options to purchase 13.6 million, 12.5 million and 6.6
million shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock were not included in
the computation of diluted EPS because the exercise prices of those options
were greater than the average market price of the common stock and their
inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  The
options were still outstanding at the end of the applicable periods.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents
include $66.2 million and $332.9 million of short-term time deposits
at June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts receivable is
stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions of
$27.1 million and $28.9 million as of June 30, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Currency
Translation and Transactions

All assets and
liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end
rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted
average rates of exchange for the year. 
Unrealized translation gains or losses are reported as cumulative
translation adjustments through other comprehensive income.  Such adjustments amounted to
$27.0 million, $8.2 million and $36.5 million of unrealized
translation gains in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company enters into
forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options to hedge
foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified
exposures.  Accordingly, the Company
categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.

The accompanying
consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange gains of $4.0 million
in fiscal 2006 and net exchange losses of $15.8 million and $14.5 million
in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Inventory
and Promotional Merchandise

Inventory and promotional
merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future
periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost
being determined on the first-in, first-out method.

Cost
components include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g.,
indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and
warehousing) as well as inbound freight.

Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the
merchandise is shipped to the Company’s customers.

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and
equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset’s
useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization.  For
financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from
3 to 40 years.  Leasehold improvements
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the
respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

The Company follows the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141,
“Business Combinations” and SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.”  These statements established
financial accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other
intangible assets.  Specifically, the
standards address how acquired intangible assets should be accounted for both
at the time of acquisition and after they have been recognized in the financial
statements.  In accordance with SFAS
No. 142, intangible assets, including purchased goodwill, must be
evaluated for impairment.  Those
intangible assets that will continue to be classified as goodwill or as other
intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer amortized.

In accordance with SFAS
No. 142, the impairment testing is performed in two steps: (i) the
Company determines impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit
with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company
measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill
with the carrying amount of that goodwill. 
To determine fair value, the Company relied on three valuation models:
guideline public companies, acquisition analysis and discounted cash flow.  For goodwill valuation purposes only, the
revised fair value of a reporting unit would be allocated to the assets and
liabilities of the business unit to arrive at an implied fair value of
goodwill, based upon known facts and circumstances, as if the acquisition
occurred at that time.

During fiscal 2006, the
Company sold certain assets and operations of its reporting unit that marketed
and sold Stila brand products.  In
conjunction with the sale, the Company reduced its goodwill by $91.3 million,
which is reported as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying
consolidated statements of earnings.

In February 2004, the
Company sold the assets and operations of its reporting unit that sold

jane

brand products. 
Based on an assessment of the tangible and intangible assets of this
business, the Company determined that the carrying amount of these assets as
then reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet exceeded their
estimated fair value.  In accordance with
the assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the amount
of $26.4 million for fiscal 2004, which is reported as a component of
discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of
earnings.

Goodwill

The Company assigns goodwill
of a reporting unit to the product category in which that reporting unit
predominantly operates at the time of its acquisition.  The change in the carrying amount of
goodwill, including the effect of foreign exchange rates is as follows:

October 1999.

Other Intangible Assets

Other intangible
assets include trademarks and patents, as well as license agreements and other
intangible assets resulting from or related to businesses purchased by the
Company.  Indefinite lived assets (e.g.,
trademarks) are not subject to amortization and are evaluated annually for
impairment or sooner if certain events or circumstances indicate a potential
impairment.  Patents are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the shorter of the legal term or the useful life of
the patent, approximately 20 years. 
Other intangible assets (e.g., non-compete agreements, customer lists)
are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected period of benefit,
approximately 2 years to 10 years. 
Intangible assets related to license agreements are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their useful lives based on the terms of their
respective agreements, currently approximately 10 years to 16 years, and are
subject to impairment testing if certain events or circumstances indicate a
potential impairment.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenues from merchandise
sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to
the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.  In the Americas region, sales are generally
recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and, in the
Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally
recognized based upon the customer’s receipt. 
In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of
sale (e.g., at the Company’s retail stores).

Sales are reported on a
net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of
actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with
retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.  The Company’s practice is to accept product
returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and
approved.  In accepting returns, the Company
typically provides a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from
that retailer.  As a percentage of gross
sales, returns were 5.0% in fiscal 2006 and 4.6% in fiscal 2005 and 2004.

Payments
to Customers

The Company is subject to
the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 01-9, “Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the
Vendor’s Products).”  In accordance with
this guidance, the Company has recorded the revenues generated from purchase
with purchase promotions as sales and the costs of its purchase with purchase
and gift with purchase promotions as cost of sales.  Certain other incentive arrangements require
the payment of a fee to customers based on their attainment of pre-established
sales levels.  These fees have been
recorded as a reduction of net sales in the accompanying consolidated
statements of earnings and were not material to the results of operations in
any period presented.

The Company enters into
transactions related to advertising, product promotions and demonstrations,
some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers.  These activities may be arranged either with
unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer.  The Company’s share of the cost of these
transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements
of earnings and were approximately $912 million, $898 million and $838 million in
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Advertising
and Promotion

Costs associated with
advertising are expensed during the year as incurred.  Global net advertising and promotion
expenses, which primarily include television, radio and print media, and promotional
expenses, such as products used as sales incentives, were $1,793.1 million,
$1,793.7 million and $1,595.5 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.  These amounts include
activities relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions
that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales.

Advertising,
merchandising and sampling expenses included in operating expenses were
$1,586.3 million, $1,577.1 million and $1,410.4 million in fiscal 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

Research
and Development

Research and development
costs are included in advertising, merchandising and sampling and amounted to
$72.0 million, $72.3 million and $67.2 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.  Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred.

Operating Leases

The Company recognizes rent expense from operating leases with periods
of free and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the
applicable lease term.  The Company
considers lease renewals in the useful life of its leasehold improvements when
such renewals are reasonably assured. 
From time to time, the Company may receive capital improvement funding
from its lessors.  These amounts are
recorded as deferred liabilities and amortized over the remaining lease term as
a reduction of rent expense.

Related
Party Royalties

On April 24, 2004, Mrs.
Estée Lauder passed away.  As a result,
the royalty payments previously made to her since 1969 in connection with the
Company’s purchase of the “Estée Lauder” trademark outside the United States
ceased to accrue.  Royalty payments
totaling $18.8 million were charged to expense in fiscal 2004.

License
Arrangements

The Company’s license
agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and
sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof)
using the licensors’ trademarks.  The
licenses typically have an initial term of approximately 2 years to 11 years,
and are renewable subject to the Company’s compliance with the license
agreement provisions.  The remaining
terms, including the potential renewal periods, range from approximately 2
years to 24 years.  Under each license,
the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually,
based on net sales to third parties.

Most of the Company’s
licenses were entered into to create new business.  In some cases, the Company acquired, or
entered into, a license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a
pre-existing beauty products business. 
In those cases, intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over
their useful lives based on the terms of the agreement and are subject to
impairment testing if certain events or circumstances indicate a potential
impairment.

Stock-Based
Compensation

As of June 30, 2006, the
Company had established a number of share incentive programs as discussed in
more detail in Note 13 - Stock Programs. 
Prior to fiscal 2006, the Company applied the intrinsic value method as
outlined in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”), and related interpretations in accounting
for stock options and share units granted under these programs.  Under the intrinsic value method, no
compensation expense was recognized if the exercise price of the Company’s
employee stock options equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the
date of the grant.  Accordingly, no
compensation cost was recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of
earnings prior to fiscal year 2006 on stock options granted to employees, since
all options granted under the Company’s share incentive programs had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant.

Effective July 1, 2005,
the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”).  This statement replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS No. 123”) and supersedes APB No. 25.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires that all stock-based
compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that
such cost be measured at the fair value of the award.  This statement was adopted using the modified
prospective method of application, which requires the Company to recognize
compensation expense on a prospective basis. 
Therefore, prior years’ financial statements have not been
restated.  Under this method, in addition
to reflecting compensation expense for new share-based awards, expense is also
recognized to reflect the remaining service period of awards that had been
included in pro-forma disclosures in prior years.  SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that excess tax
benefits related to stock option exercises be reflected as financing cash
inflows instead of operating cash inflows.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

The Company is a
worldwide manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup,
fragrance and hair care products. 
Domestic and international sales are made primarily to department
stores, perfumeries and specialty retailers. 
The Company grants credit to all qualified customers and does not
believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.

During fiscal 2006,
Federated Department Stores, Inc. acquired The May Department Stores Company,
resulting in the merger of the Company’s previous two largest customers.  This customer sells products primarily within
North America and accounted for $1,005.8 million, or 16%, of the Company’s consolidated
net sales in fiscal 2006 and $105.4 million, or 14%, of its accounts receivable
at June 30, 2006.  No single customer
accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales or accounts receivable
during fiscal 2005, or 2004.

Management
Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in
those financial statements.  Actual
results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for
derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, which
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities.  SFAS No. 133 also
requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or
liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2006, the FASB
issued FASB Interpretation Number (“FIN”) 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”).  FIN 48
establishes a recognition threshold and measurement for income tax positions
recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”  FIN 48 also prescribes a two-step evaluation
process for tax positions.  The first
step is recognition and the second is measurement.  For recognition, an enterprise judgmentally
determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be
sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or
litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.  If the tax position meets the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is measured and recognized in the
financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
50% likely of being realized.  If a tax
position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit
of that position is not recognized in the financial statements.

Tax positions that meet
the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date of FIN 48
may be recognized or, continue to be recognized, upon adoption of FIN 48.  The cumulative effect of applying the
provisions of FIN 48 shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance
of retained earnings for that fiscal year. 
FIN 48 will apply to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006,
with earlier adoption permitted.  The
Company is currently evaluating the impact FIN 48 will have on its consolidated
financial statements when it becomes effective for the Company in fiscal 2008
and is unable, at this time, to quantify the impact, if any, to retained
earnings at the time of adoption.

NOTE 3 – PUBLIC OFFERINGS

In June 2004, three
Lauder family trusts sold a total of 13,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock
in a registered public offering.  The
Company did not receive any proceeds from the sales of these shares.  The cost of this offering was borne by the
selling stockholders.

NOTE 4 –
ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE OF BUSINESSES AND LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS

On April 10, 2006 (the “Effective
Date”), the Company completed the sale of certain assets and operations of the
reporting unit that marketed and sold Stila brand products to Stila Corp. (the “Purchaser”),
an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., for consideration of $23.0
million.  The sale price included cash of
$9.3 million, a promissory note with a notional value of $13.3 million and a
fair value of $11.0 million and convertible preferred stock with an aggregate
liquidation preference of $5.0 million and a fair value of $2.7 million.  As additional consideration for the purchased
assets, and subject to the terms and conditions of the sale agreement, the
Purchaser will pay the Company an amount equal to two percent of the annual net
sales of the acquired business during the period commencing on the Effective
Date and ending August 20, 2019.  The
Company will use these proceeds to satisfy its commitment under the 1999
agreement pursuant to which it originally purchased the Stila business.  The Purchaser immediately assumed
responsibility for all decisions regarding the operations of the Stila business
and the Company agreed to divest itself of continuing involvement in the Stila
business, except as described below.

In fiscal 2006, the
Company recorded charges of $80.3 million (net of $43.3 million tax benefit) to
discontinued operations, which reflected the loss on the disposition of the
business of $69.9 million, net of tax, and adjustments to the fair value of
assets sold, the costs to dispose of those assets not acquired by the Purchaser
and other costs in connection with the sale. 
The charges also include the operating losses of $10.4 million, net of
tax, for fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. 
Net sales associated with the discontinued operations were $45.1 million
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006.

In order to facilitate
the transition of the Stila business to the Purchaser, the Company agreed to
provide certain information systems, accounting and other back office services
to the Purchaser in exchange for monthly service fees designed to recover the
estimated costs of providing these transition services.  The Company also agreed with the Purchaser to
provide certain distribution and online services.  In both cases, the services are expected to
conclude in fiscal 2007.  In addition, the
Company agreed to manufacture and sell to the Purchaser a limited range of
products for a period of up to four months following the Effective Date and, in
the case of one product, of up to two years.

In fiscal 2006, the
Company settled its obligation, recorded as goodwill at June 30, 2005, related
to an earn-out provision in the Company’s fiscal 2000 acquisition of Jo Malone
Limited.

In
fiscal 2005, the Company acquired a majority equity interest in its former
distributor in Portugal.  The aggregate
payments made to acquire the distributor were funded by cash provided by
operations and did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of
operations or financial condition.  In
addition, the Company assumed debt and other long-term obligations of 4.6 million
Euros associated with the acquisition (approximately $5.6 million at
acquisition date exchange rates).  The
debt is payable semi-annually through February 2008 at a variable interest
rate.

In fiscal 2004,
the Company sold the assets and operations of its reporting unit that sold

jane

brand products. 
Pursuant to this decision, circumstances warranted that the Company
conduct an assessment of the tangible and intangible assets of the

jane

business.  Based
on this assessment, the Company determined that the carrying amount of these
assets as then reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet exceeded
its estimated fair value.  In accordance
with the assessment and the closing of the sale, the Company recorded an
after-tax charge to discontinued operations of $33.3 million for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2004.  The charge
represents the impairment of goodwill in the amount of $26.4 million; the
reduction in value of other tangible assets in the amount of $2.1 million, net
of tax; and the reporting unit’s operating loss of $4.8 million, net of
tax.  Included in the operating loss of
fiscal 2004 were additional costs associated with the sale and discontinuation
of the business.

In July 2003, the Company
acquired the Rodan + Fields skin care line. 
The initial purchase price, paid at closing, was funded by cash provided
by operations, the payment of which did not have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations or financial condition.  The Company expects to make additional
payments between fiscal 2007 and 2011 based on certain conditions.

At various times during
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company acquired businesses engaged in the
wholesale distribution and retail sale of Aveda products, as well as other
products, in the United States and other countries.

The aggregate cost for
these activities, which includes purchase price, earn-out payments and
acquisition costs, was $51.7 million, $7.1 million, and $4.4 million in fiscal
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and each transaction was accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting. 
Accordingly, the results of operations for each of the acquired
businesses are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
commencing with its date of original acquisition.  Pro forma results of operations, as if each
of such businesses had been acquired as of the beginning of the year of
acquisition, have not been presented, as the impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial results would not have been material.

In fiscal 2006, the
Company entered into a license agreement with Daisy Fuentes for the development
of fragrance products.  In fiscal 2005,
the Company was developing products under license agreements for Sean John
(announced in May 2004), Tom Ford (announced in April 2005) and Missoni
(announced in May 2005) and an Origins license agreement to develop and sell
products using the name of Dr. Andrew Weil (announced in October 2004).

Certain license agreements may require minimum royalty
payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending
on advertising and promotional activities. 
Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are earned
while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs
are incurred.

NOTE 5 – COST SAVINGS INITIATIVE

During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded special charges associated with a cost savings initiative that was designed to support its long-term financial objectives.  As part of this multi-faceted initiative, the Company has identified savings opportunities that include streamlined processes and organizational changes.  The principal component of the initiative is a voluntary separation program offered primarily to North America-based employees.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, involuntary separations were communicated to certain employees.  Under this initiative, the Company incurred expenses related to one-time termination benefits for 494 employees, of which 28 were involuntary, which benefits were based principally upon years of service.

In addition, the Company identified other cost savings opportunities to improve efficiencies in the Company’s distribution network and product offerings and to eliminate other nonessential costs.  These charges primarily related to employee severance for facilities that are closing, contract cancellations, counter and door closings and product returns.

For the year ended June 30, 2006, aggregate expenses of $92.1 million were recorded as special charges related to the cost savings initiative in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings.  At June 30, 2006, $40.7 million and $28.2 million related to the cost savings initiative were recorded in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The following table summarizes the cost savings initiative, which impacted, and will continue to impact, the Company’s operating expenses and cost of sales:

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On July 13, 2006,
the Company announced a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
regarding its examination of the Company’s consolidated Federal income tax
returns for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1998 through June 30, 2001.  The settlement resolves previously disclosed
issues raised during the IRS’s examination, including transfer pricing and
foreign tax credit computations.  The
settlement of these issues resulted in a tax charge of approximately $46
million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and represents the aggregate
earnings impact of the settlement through fiscal 2006.  In addition, during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2006, the Company completed the repatriation of foreign earnings through
intercompany dividends as required under the provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “AJCA”).  In
connection with the repatriation, the Company finalized computations of the
related aggregate tax impact, resulting in a favorable adjustment of
approximately $11 million.  The tax
settlement, coupled with the AJCA favorable tax adjustment, resulted in a net
increase to the Company’s fiscal 2006 income tax provision of approximately $35
million.

During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company formulated a plan to repatriate
approximately $690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006, which included
$500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of
the AJCA.  This action resulted in an
aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million, which included an
incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million in fiscal 2005.

Federal income and
foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $336 million
of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries at June 30, 2006.  The Company intends to reinvest these
earnings in its foreign operations indefinitely, except where it is able to
repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax
provision.  As of June 30, 2005 and 2004,
the Company had not provided federal income and foreign withholding taxes on
approximately $90 million and $561 million, respectively, of undistributed
earnings of international subsidiaries.

As of June 30,
2006 and 2005, certain international subsidiaries had tax loss carryforwards
for local tax purposes of approximately $23 million and $28 million,
respectively.  With the exception of $4.9
million of losses with an indefinite carryforward period as of June 30, 2006,
these losses expire at various dates through fiscal 2021.  Deferred tax assets in the amount of $7.2
million and $8.2 million as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, have been
recorded to reflect the tax benefits of the losses not utilized to date.  A full valuation allowance has been provided
for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of management, it is
more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Earnings before
income taxes and minority interest include amounts contributed by the Company’s
international operations of approximately $603 million, $583 million and $525
million for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Some of these earnings are taxed in the
United States.

Earnings from the Company’s
global operations are subject to tax in various jurisdictions both within and
outside the United States.  The Company
is routinely audited in these jurisdictions and these reviews can involve
complex issues that may require an extended period of time for resolution.  The Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns
have been examined and settled through fiscal 2001.

The Company is currently
under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years 2002 through
2004.  In addition, the Company has
ongoing audits in various state and local jurisdictions, as well as audits in
various foreign jurisdictions.

The Company provides tax
reserves for Federal, state, local and international exposures relating to
periods subject to audit.  The
development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax
issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical
estimate.  Although the outcome related
to these exposures is uncertain, in management’s opinion, adequate provisions
for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating
from these exposures.  In certain
circumstances, the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involve significant
uncertainties which render them inestimable. 
If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, including
those that cannot be quantified, they could have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company has been
notified of a disallowance of tax deductions claimed by its subsidiary in Spain
for the fiscal years 1999 through 2002. 
As a result, the subsidiary was reassessed corporate income tax of
approximately $3 million for this period. 
An appeal against this reassessment was filed with the Chief Tax
Inspector.  On July 18, 2005 the final
assessment made by the Chief Tax Inspector was received, confirming the
reassessment made by the tax auditors. 
During fiscal 2006, an appeal against this final assessment was filed
with the Madrid Regional Economic Administrative Tribunal.  While no assurance can be given as to the
outcome in respect of this assessment, either during the administrative appeals
process or in the Spanish courts, management believes that the subsidiary
should ultimately be successful in its defense against the assessment.  Accordingly, no tax reserve has been
established for this potential exposure.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As of June 30, 2006, the
Company had outstanding $230.0 million of 6% Senior Notes due January 2012 (“6%
Senior Notes”) consisting of $250.0 million principal, an unamortized debt
discount of $0.6 million, and a $19.4 million adjustment to reflect the fair
value of an outstanding interest rate swap. 
The 6% Senior Notes, when issued in January 2002, were priced at 99.538%
with a yield of 6.062%.  Interest
payments are required to be made semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of
each year.  In May 2003, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0
million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its outstanding 6% Senior
Notes to variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR.

As of June 30, 2006, the
Company had outstanding $197.4 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due October 2033 (“5.75%
Senior Notes”) consisting of $200.0 million principal and unamortized debt
discount of $2.6 million.  Interest
payments are required to be made semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of
each year.  In May 2003, in anticipation
of the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes, the Company entered into a series of
treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling $195.0 million at a
weighted average all-in rate of 4.53%. 
The treasury lock agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new
debt and the Company received a payment of $15.0 million that will be amortized
against interest expense over the life of the 5.75% Senior Notes.  As a result of the treasury lock agreements,
the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the effective interest rate on the
5.75% Senior Notes will be 5.395% over the life of the debt.

In May 2006, the Company
entered into a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial
institution for the primary purpose of funding cash dividend repatriations from
certain of its international affiliates to the United States as permitted by
the AJCA.  Under the agreement, the
Company may borrow up to $150.0 million in the form of loan participation notes
which were issued by one of the Company’s subsidiaries in Europe.  The interest rate on borrowings under this
agreement will be an all-in fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to
by the Company at the date of each borrowing. 
At June 30, 2006, $38.0 million was outstanding under this agreement and
the notes are being refinanced on a periodic basis as they mature at the then
prevailing market interest rates.  Debt
issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis.

In March 2006, the
Company entered into a 3.0 billion yen revolving credit facility that expires
on March 24, 2009.  The interest rate on
borrowings under the credit facility is based on TIBOR (Tokyo Interbank Offered
Rate) and a 10 basis point facility fee is incurred on the undrawn
balance.  The Company borrowed 3.0
billion yen under the new facility on March 28, 2006 to repay the previously
outstanding 1.45% Japan term loan that was to mature on that date.  The outstanding balance at June 30, 2006
($26.2 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2006) is classified as
short-term debt on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

In October 2005, the
Company redeemed the remaining $68.4 million of the 2015 Preferred Stock.

The Company has a $750.0
million commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper in
the United States.  The Company’s
commercial paper is currently rated A-1 by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by
Moody’s.  The Company’s long-term credit
ratings are A+ with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A1 with a
stable outlook by Moody’s.  At June 30,
2006, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding.  The Company also has an effective shelf
registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to an additional
$300.0 million in debt securities at June 30, 2006 and 2005.

The Company has an unused
$600.0 million senior revolving credit facility that expires on May 27,
2010.  The facility may be used for general
corporate purposes, including financing working capital, and also as credit
support for the Company’s commercial paper program.  Up to the equivalent of $250.0 million of the
facility is available for multi-currency loans. 
The interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on
LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly
announced by the administrative agent, or the Federal funds rate plus ½%.  The credit facility has an annual fee of $0.4
million, payable quarterly, based on the Company’s current credit ratings.  The Company incurred debt issuance costs of
$0.3 million in fiscal 2005 which are being amortized over the term of the
facility.  The credit facility contains
various covenants, including one financial covenant which requires the average
of the debt of the Company to total capital ratio at the last day of each
fiscal quarter to be less than 0.65:1. 
At June 30, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all financial
covenants in the credit facility.

The Company maintains
uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world.  Interest rate terms for these facilities vary
by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit
ratings.  During fiscal 2006 and 2005, the
monthly average amount outstanding was approximately $22.8 million and $10.7
million, respectively, and the annualized monthly weighted average interest
rate incurred was approximately 5.56% and 4.95%, respectively.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 9 –
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Derivative
Financial Instruments

The Company addresses
certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management
that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  The Company primarily enters into foreign
currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the
effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company, if necessary, enters into
interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on
the Company’s aggregate liability portfolio. 
The Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes
other than trading.

All derivatives are
recognized at their fair value and are included in prepaid expenses and other
current assets or other accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance
sheets.  The associated gains and losses
on these derivatives are recorded in cost of goods sold and selling, general
and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of earnings.  On the date the derivative contract is
entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (i) a hedge of the fair
value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment
(“fair-value” hedge), (ii) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the
variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset
or liability (“cash-flow” hedge), (iii) a foreign-currency fair-value or
cash-flow hedge (“foreign-currency” hedge), (iv) a hedge of a net investment in
a foreign operation, or (v) other. 
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as
(and that is designated and qualifies as) a fair-value hedge, along with the
loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the
hedged risk (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in
current-period earnings.  Changes in the
fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as (and that is designated
and qualifies as) a cash-flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income,
until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows (e.g., when
periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in
earnings).  Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that are highly effective as (and that are designated and qualify
as) foreign-currency hedges are recorded in either current-period earnings or
other comprehensive income, depending on whether the hedge transaction is a
fair-value hedge (e.g., a hedge of a firm commitment that is to be settled in a
foreign currency) or a cash-flow hedge (e.g., a foreign-currency-denominated
forecasted transaction).  If, however, a
derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its
changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income within equity.  Furthermore, changes in the fair value of
other derivative instruments are reported in current-period earnings.

For each derivative
contract entered into where the Company looks to obtain special hedge
accounting treatment, the Company formally documents all relationships between
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective
and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk
being hedged, how the hedging instruments' effectiveness in offsetting the
hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a
description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.  This process includes linking all derivatives
that are designated as fair-value, cash-flow, or foreign-currency hedges to
specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm
commitments or forecasted transactions. 
The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on
an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of
hedged items.  If it is determined that a
derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective
hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with
respect to that derivative prospectively.

Foreign
Exchange Risk Management

The Company enters into
forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as
receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods
consistent with the Company’s identified exposures.  The purpose of the hedging activities is to
minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash
flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries.  Almost all foreign currency contracts are
denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large
financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating
agency.  The Company also enters into
foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a
high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.  The forward exchange contracts and foreign
currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been
designated as cash-flow hedges.  Hedge
effectiveness of forward exchange contracts is based on a hypothetical
derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the
spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.  Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency
option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.  The ineffective portion of both forward
exchange and foreign currency option contracts is recorded in current-period
earnings.  For hedge contracts that are
no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains
and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings
when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.  If it is probable that the forecasted
transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses accumulated in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to current-period earnings.  As of June 30, 2006, these cash-flow hedges
were highly effective, in all material respects.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As a matter of policy,
the Company only enters into contracts with counterparties that have at least
an “A” (or equivalent) credit rating. 
The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.  The Company does not have significant
exposure to any one counterparty. 
Exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the
counterparties is limited to only the recognized, but not realized, gains
attributable to the contracts.  Management
believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event
would not be material to the Company’s consolidated financial results.  The contracts have varying maturities through
the end of June 2007.  Costs associated
with entering into such contracts have not been material to the Company’s
consolidated financial results.  The
Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.

At June 30, 2006, the
Company had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange
contracts and option contracts in the amount of $782.6 million and $130.2
million, respectively.  The foreign
currencies included in forward exchange contracts (notional value stated in
U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($238.5 million), Swiss franc ($98.5
million), British pound ($92.4 million), Canadian dollar ($71.7 million),
Japanese yen ($50.6 million), Australian dollar ($50.5 million) and South
Korean won ($33.1 million).  The foreign
currencies included in the option contracts (notional value stated in U.S.
dollars) are principally the Japanese yen ($32.0 million), Euro ($27.7
million), Canadian dollar ($22.8 million), Swiss franc ($14.8 million) and
South Korean won ($13.4 million).  At
June 30, 2005, the Company had foreign currency contracts in the form of
forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of $667.5 million
and $120.9 million, respectively.  The
foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts (notional value
stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Swiss franc ($128.6 million),
British pound ($127.6 million), Euro ($123.3 million), Canadian dollar ($78.1
million), Australian dollar ($43.3 million), Japanese yen ($31.6 million) and
South Korean won ($27.6 million).  The foreign
currencies included in the option contracts (notional value stated in U.S.
dollars) are principally the Japanese yen ($33.6 million), South Korean won
($26.3 million), Euro ($21.5 million) and Swiss franc ($20.3 million).

Interest
Rate Risk Management

The Company enters into
interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of
interest rates on its funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent
with the identified exposures.  All interest
rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong
investment grade by a major rating agency.

In May 2003, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0
million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing 6% Senior Notes
to a variable interest rate based on six-month LIBOR.  The interest rate swap was designated as a
fair-value hedge.  As of June 30, 2006,
the fair-value hedge was highly effective, in all material respects.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The following
methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:

Cash and cash
equivalents:

The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily
because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.

Short-term and long-term
debt:

The fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated
based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same
remaining maturities.  To a lesser
extent, debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying
amount approximates the fair value.

Foreign exchange and
interest rate contracts:

The fair value of forwards, swaps and options is the estimated amount
the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements.

The estimated fair values

NOTE 10 –
PENSION, DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Company
maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees
for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international operations.  Several plans provide pension benefits based
primarily on years of service and employees’ earnings.  In certain instances, the Company adjusts
benefits in connection with international employee transfers.

Retirement
Growth Account Plan (U.S.)

The Retirement
Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit
pension plan.  The Company’s funding
policy consists of an annual contribution at a rate that provides for future
plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages.  Such contribution is not less than the
minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, (“ERISA”) and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the
maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.

Restoration
Plan (U.S.)

The Company also has an
unfunded, nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to
provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.

International
Pension Plans

The Company maintains
International Pension Plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit
pension plans.  The Company’s funding
policies for these plans are determined by local laws and regulations.

Post-retirement
Benefits

The Company maintains a
domestic post-retirement benefit plan which provides certain medical and dental
benefits to eligible employees. 
Employees hired after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for retiree
medical benefits when they retire. 
Certain retired employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are
eligible for participation in the plan. 
Contributions required and benefits received by retirees and eligible
family members are dependent on the age of the retiree.  It is the Company’s practice to fund these
benefits as incurred.

Certain of the Company’s
international subsidiaries and affiliates have post-retirement plans, although
most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs.

The measurement date as
of which assets and liabilities are measured is June 30, 2006.  The significant components of the above
mentioned plans as of and for the year ended June 30 are summarized as follows:

401(k)
Savings Plan (U.S.)

The Company’s 401(k)
Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”) is a contributory defined contribution plan
covering substantially all regular U.S. employees who have completed the hours
and service requirements, as defined by the plan document.  Regular full-time employees are eligible to
participate in the Savings Plan on the first day of the second month following
their date of hire.  The Savings Plan is
subject to the applicable provisions of ERISA. 
The Company matches a portion of the participant’s contributions after
one year of service under a predetermined formula based on the participant’s
contribution level and years of service. 
The Company’s contributions were approximately $10.6 million, $9.8
million and $9.1 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.  Shares of the
Company’s Class A Common Stock are not an investment option in the Savings Plan
and the Company does not use such shares to match participants’ contributions.

Deferred
Compensation

The Company accrues for
deferred compensation and interest thereon, and for the increase in the value
of share units pursuant to agreements with certain key executives and outside
directors.  The amounts included in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets under these plans were $71.0 million
as of June 30, 2006 and 2005.  The
expense for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $11.6 million, $10.2 million and
$16.6 million, respectively.  During
fiscal 2005, the Company made deferred compensation payments to a former
executive of $71.2 million.

NOTE 11 – POST-EMPLOYMENT
BENEFITS OTHER THAN TO RETIREES

The Company provides
certain post-employment benefits to eligible former or inactive employees and
their dependents during the period subsequent to employment but prior to
retirement.  These benefits include
health care coverage and severance benefits. 
The cost of providing these benefits is accrued and any incremental
benefits were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial results.

NOTE 12 –
COMMON STOCK

As of June 30,
2006, the Company’s authorized common stock consists of 650 million shares of
Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, and 240 million shares of Class
B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share. 
Class B Common Stock is convertible into Class A Common Stock, in whole
or in part, at any time and from time to time at the option of the holder, on
the basis of one share of Class A Common Stock for each share of Class B Common
Stock converted.  Holders of the Company’s
Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of the
Company’s Class B Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share.

On September 18,
1998, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to
repurchase a total of up to 8.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock in the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market
conditions and other factors.  The Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10.0 million additional shares
of Class A Common Stock in both October 2002 and May 2004, and an additional
20.0 million in May 2005, increasing the total authorization under the share
repurchase program to 48.0 million shares. 
As of June 30, 2006, approximately 38.6 million shares have been
purchased under this program.

In May 2005, the
Company purchased 1,872,000 shares of Class A Common Stock from a related party
for $73.5 million. The repurchase was part of the program described in the
previous paragraph.

NOTE 13 – STOCK PROGRAMS

As of June 30,
2006, the Company has three active equity compensation plans which include the
Amended and Restated Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan, the Fiscal 1999 Share Incentive
Plan and the Non-Employee Director Share Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Plans”).  These Plans currently provide for the
issuance of 32,894,400 shares, which consist of shares originally provided for
and shares transferred to the Plans from a previous plan and employment
agreement, to be granted in the form of stock-based awards to key employees,
consultants and non-employee directors of the Company.  As of June 30, 2006, approximately 10,726,700
shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved and available to be granted
pursuant to these Plans.  The Company may
satisfy the obligation of its stock based compensation awards with either new
or treasury shares.  The Company’s stock
compensation awards outstanding at June 30, 2006 include stock options,
Performance Share Units (“PSU”), Restricted Stock Units (“RSU”) and share
units.

Total net stock-based
compensation expense is attributable to the granting of, and the remaining
requisite service periods of, stock options, PSUs, RSUs and share units.  Compensation expense attributable to net
stock-based compensation for fiscal 2006 was $35.7 million ($23.4 million after
tax, or $.11 for both basic and diluted net earnings per common share).  As of June 30, 2006, the total unrecognized
compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based awards was $26.3 million and
the related weighted-average period over which it is expected to be recognized
is approximately 2.2 years.

THE ESTÉE
LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Prior to the Company’s
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), SFAS No. 123 required that the Company provide pro
forma information regarding net earnings and net earnings per common share as
if compensation cost for the Company’s stock-based awards had been determined
in accordance with the fair value method prescribed therein.  The Company had previously adopted the
disclosure portion of SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

–

Transition and Disclosure,” requiring quarterly SFAS No. 123 pro forma
disclosure.  The pro forma charge for
compensation cost related to stock-based awards granted was recognized over the
service period.  For stock options, the
service period represents the period of time between the date of grant and the
date each option becomes exercisable without consideration of acceleration
provisions (e.g., retirement, change of control, etc.).

The following table
illustrates the effect on net earnings per common share as if the fair value
method had been applied to all outstanding awards for fiscal 2005 and
2004:

Performance
Share Units

During fiscal 2006, the
Company issued 111,100 PSUs, which will be settled in stock subject to the
achievement of the Company’s net sales and net earnings per share goals for the
three years ending June 30, 2008. 
Settlement will be made pursuant to a range of opportunities relative to
the net sales and earnings per share targets of the Company.  No settlement will occur for results below
the applicable minimum threshold and additional shares shall be issued if
performance exceeds the targeted performance goals.  PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent
rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of the PSU.  These awards are subject to the provisions of
the agreement under which the PSUs are granted. 
The PSUs were valued at $35.00 per share representing the closing market
value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant and generally
vest at the end of the performance period. 
The compensation cost of the PSUs is subject to adjustment based upon
the attainability of the target goals.

Legal
Proceedings

The Company is involved,
from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to its
business.  Management believes that the
outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material
adverse effect upon the Company’s results of operations or financial
condition.  However, management’s
assessment of the Company’s current litigation and other legal proceedings
could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions
or other proceedings pending against the Company not presently known to the
Company or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are
not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome
of such litigation or proceedings.

On March 30, 2005, the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California entered
into a Final Judgment approving the settlement agreement the Company entered
into in July 2003 with the plaintiffs, the other Manufacturer Defendants (as
defined below) and the Department Store Defendants (as defined below) in a consolidated
class action lawsuit that had been pending in the Superior Court of the State
of California in Marin County since 1998. 
On April 29, 2005, notices of appeal were filed by representatives of
two members of the purported class of consumers.  One of those appeals has since been
withdrawn.  If the appeal is resolved
satisfactorily, the Final Judgment will result in the plaintiffs’ claims being
dismissed, with prejudice, in their entirety in both the Federal and California
actions.  There has been no finding or
admission of any wrongdoing by the Company in this lawsuit.  The Company entered into the settlement
agreement solely to avoid protracted and costly litigation.  In connection with the settlement agreement,
the defendants, including the Company, will provide consumers with certain free
products and pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees.  To meet its obligations under the settlement,
the Company took a special pre-tax charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million
after-tax, equal to $.06 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003.  At June 30, 2006, the
remaining accrual balance was $16.3 million. 
The charge did not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition.  In the
Federal action, the plaintiffs, purporting to represent a class of all U.S.
residents who purchased prestige cosmetics products at retail for personal use
from eight department stores groups that sold such products in the United
States (the “Department Store Defendants”), alleged that the Department Store
Defendants, the Company and eight other manufacturers of cosmetics (the “Manufacturer
Defendants”) conspired to fix and maintain retail prices and to limit the
supply of prestige cosmetics products sold by the Department Store Defendants in
violation of state and Federal laws. The plaintiffs sought, among other things,
treble damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees, interest and costs.

In 1998, the Office of
the Attorney General of the State of New York (the “State”) notified the Company
and ten other entities that they had been identified as potentially responsible
parties (“PRPs”) with respect to the Blydenburgh landfill in Islip, New
York.  Each PRP may be jointly and
severally liable for the costs of investigation and cleanup, which the State
estimated in 2006 to be approximately $19.7 million for all PRPs.  In 2001, the State sued other PRPs (including
Hickey’s Carting, Inc., Dennis C. Hickey and Maria Hickey, collectively the “Hickey
Parties”), in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York to
recover such costs in connection with the site, and in September 2002, the
Hickey Parties brought contribution actions against the Company and other
Blydenburgh PRPs.  These contribution
actions seek to recover, among other things, any damages for which the Hickey
Parties are found liable in the State’s lawsuit against them, and related costs
and expenses, including attorneys’ fees. 
In June 2004, the State added the Company and other PRPs as defendants
in its pending case against the Hickey Parties. 
In April 2006, the Company and other defendants added numerous other
parties to the case as third-party defendants. 
The Company and certain other PRPs have engaged in settlement
discussions which to date have been unsuccessful.  Settlement negotiations with the new
third-party defendants, the State, the Company and other defendants began in
July 2006.  The Company has accrued an
amount which it believes would be necessary to resolve its share of this
matter.  If settlement discussions are
not successful, the Company intends to vigorously defend the pending
claims.  While no assurance can be given
as to the ultimate outcome, management believes that the resolution of the
Blydenburgh matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition.

On June 13, 2006, the
Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego dismissed, without
leave to amend, all of the plaintiff’s final remaining claims against the
Company in a matter originally brought in December 2004 by the plaintiff
purporting to represent a nationwide class of individuals “who have purchased
skin care products from defendants that have been falsely advertised to have an
‘anti-aging’ or youth inducing benefit or effect.”  The plaintiff sought injunctive relief,
restitution, and general, special and punitive damages for alleged violations
of the California Unfair Competition Law, the California False Advertising Law,
and for negligent and intentional misrepresentation.

In June 2006 and October
2005, the Company received favorable decisions from the Portuguese Tax
Administration on the oppositions its subsidiary filed in July 2005 to the
notices of assessment it received in May 2005 and on the opposition its
subsidiary filed in March 2005 to the notice of assessment it received in
December 2004, respectively. 
Furthermore, the notification the Company received in June 2006,
contained an order canceling the assessments received in May 2005, which were
for the calendar years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002 in the amounts of 21.6
million Euro and 22.4 million Euro, respectively, and the assessment received
in December 2004, which was for the calendar year ended December 31, 2000 in
the amount of 26.0 million Euro. 
Management believes that the decisions are not subject to appeal.  Since 1989, the Company’s subsidiary has been
operating in the Madeira Free Trade Zone, located in Portugal, under license
from the Madeira Development Corporation.

On March 30, 2006, a
purported securities class action complaint captioned Thomas S. Shin, et al. v.
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., et al., was filed against the Company and
certain of its officers and directors (collectively the “Defendants”) in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The complaint alleged that the Defendants
made statements during the period April 28, 2005 to October 25, 2005 in press
releases, the Company’s public filings and during conference calls with
analysts that were materially false and misleading and that artificially
inflated the price of the Company’s stock.  The complaint alleged claims under Sections
10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The complaint also asserted that during the
class period, certain executive officers and the trust for the benefit of a
director sold shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock at artificially
inflated prices.  Three additional
purported securities class action complaints were subsequently filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York containing
similar allegations.  On July 10, 2006,
the Court consolidated these actions under the caption In re: Estée Lauder
Companies Securities Litigation, appointed lead plaintiff, and approved the
selection of lead counsel.  A
consolidated amended complaint is expected to be filed on or before September
8, 2006.  The Defendants believe that the
claims asserted in the original complaints, which are likely to form the basis
of the consolidated amended complaint, are without merit and they intend to
defend the consolidated action vigorously.

On April 10, 2006, a
shareholder derivative action complaint captioned Miriam Loveman v. Leonard A.
Lauder, et al., was filed against certain of the Company’s officers and all of
its directors as of that date (collectively the “Derivative Action Defendants”)
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The complaint alleges that the Derivative
Action Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company based on the
same alleged course of conduct identified in the Shin complaint described
above.  On May 4, 2006, the derivative
action was reassigned to the judge assigned to the now consolidated securities
action.  The Derivative Action Defendants
similarly believe that this complaint is without merit and they intend to
defend the action vigorously.

The Company previously
disclosed that it had received and was cooperating with an informal request for
information from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Staff”)
regarding matters raised in the Shin complaint described above.  In June 2006, the Company was advised by the
Staff that it does not anticipate seeking further information regarding those
matters.  The Company does not anticipate
any further developments in the inquiry.

NET UNREALIZED
INVESTMENT GAINS

Under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS No. 115”),
available-for-sale securities are recorded at market value.  Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of
the related tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from
earnings and are reported as a component of stockholders’ equity until
realized.  The Company’s investments
subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 115 are treated as available-for-sale
and, accordingly, the applicable investments have been adjusted to market value
with a corresponding adjustment, net of tax, to net unrealized investment gains
in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
Included in accumulated other comprehensive income was an unrealized
investment gain (net of deferred taxes) of $0.5 million and $0.4 million at
June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

NOTE 17 – SEGMENT DATA AND
RELATED INFORMATION

Reportable operating
segments, as defined by SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,” include components of an enterprise about
which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly
by the chief operating decision maker (the “Chief Executive”) in deciding how
to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  As a result of the similarities in the
manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company’s
products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial
statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by
the Chief Executive.  Although the
Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also
evaluates performance on a product category basis.

While the Company’s
results of operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief
Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to
industry statistics.  Accordingly, net
sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating income are available with
respect to the manufacture and distribution of skin care, makeup, fragrance,
hair care and other products.  These
product categories meet the FASB’s definition of operating segments and,
accordingly, additional financial data are provided below.  The “other” segment includes the sales and
related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit the
definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care.

The Company evaluates
segment performance based upon operating income, which represents earnings
before income taxes, minority interest, net interest expense and discontinued
operations.  The accounting policies for
each of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary
of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization
charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales.  The assets and liabilities of the Company are
managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the
consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced
for the Chief Executive or included herein.

(a)  Fiscal 2006 results included $93.0
million, after-tax, or $.43 per diluted share in special charges related to the
Company’s cost savings initiative and tax-related matters.  Included in the charges was an operating
expense charge of $92.1 million, equal to $.27 per diluted common share related
to the cost savings initiative.  The
results also included a special tax charge related to a settlement with the IRS
regarding an examination of the Company’s consolidated Federal income tax
returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2001, and represents the aggregate
earnings impact of the settlement through fiscal 2006.  The settlement resulted in an increase to the
Company’s fiscal 2006 income tax provision and a corresponding decrease in
fiscal 2006 net earnings of approximately $46 million, or approximately $.21
per diluted common share.  During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company completed the repatriation of
foreign earnings through intercompany dividends under the provisions of the
AJCA.  In connection with the
repatriation, the Company finalized computations of the related aggregate tax
impact, resulting in a favorable adjustment of approximately $11 million, or
approximately $.05 per diluted common share, to the Company’s initial tax
charge of $35 million recorded in fiscal 2005. 
The tax settlement, coupled with the AJCA favorable tax adjustment,
resulted in a net increase to the Company’s fiscal 2006 income tax provision
and a corresponding decrease in fiscal 2006 net earnings of approximately $35
million, or approximately $.16 per diluted common share.

(b)  In the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company announced plans to repatriate
approximately $690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal year 2006, which
included $500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the
provisions of the AJCA.  This action
resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately $35 million in the Company’s
fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, which included an incremental tax charge of
approximately $28 million, equal to $.12 per diluted share.

(c)  In April
2006, the Company completed the sale of certain assets and operations of the
reporting unit that marketed and sold Stila brand products.  As a result, all consolidated statements of earnings
information in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for all
periods presented has been restated for comparative purposes to reflect those
reporting units as discontinued operations.

Subsequent to June 30, 2006, the Company has given
notice of exercise to purchase the equity interest in Bumble and Bumble
Products, LLC and Bumble and Bumble, LLC that are not currently owned by the
