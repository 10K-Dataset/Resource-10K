Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors

This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such statements include, our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, our long-term strategy, restructuring and other initiatives, product introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information systems initiatives, new methods of sale, and future operations or operating results.  Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, we cannot assure that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations are described herein; in particular, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information.”  In addition, there is a discussion of risks associated with an investment in our securities, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries.

PART I

Item 1.

Business.

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., founded in 1946 by Estée and Joseph Lauder, is one of the world’s leading manufacturers and marketers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.  Our products are sold in over 150 countries and territories under a number of well-known brand names including: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins, M

ž

A

ž

C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Jo Malone London and Aveda.  We are also the global licensee for fragrances and/or cosmetics sold under various designer brand names, including Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors and Tom Ford.  Each brand is distinctly positioned within the market for cosmetics and other beauty products.

We are a pioneer in the cosmetics industry and believe we are a leader in the industry due to the global recognition of our brand names, our leadership in product innovation, our strong position in key geographic markets and the consistently high quality of our products and “High-Touch” services.  We sell our prestige products principally through limited distribution channels to complement the images associated with our brands.  These channels consist primarily of upscale department stores, specialty multi-brand retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and spas.  In addition, our products are sold in freestanding stores, our own and authorized retailer websites, stores in airports and on cruise ships, in-flight, and duty-free shops.  We believe that our strategy of pursuing selective distribution strengthens our relationships with retailers, enables our brands to be among the best selling product lines at the stores, and heightens the aspirational quality of our brands.

For a discussion of recent developments, see “

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Overview

.”

For segment and geographical area financial information, see

“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 20 – Segment Data and Related Information

.”

We have been controlled by the Lauder family since the founding of our Company.  Members of the Lauder family, some of whom are directors, executive officers and/or employees, beneficially own, directly or indirectly, as of August 18, 2016, shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock having approximately 87% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock.

Products

Skin Care

- Our broad range of skin care products addresses various skin care needs.  These products include moisturizers, serums, cleansers, toners, body care, exfoliators, acne and oil correctors, facial masks, cleansing devices and sun care products.  A number of our products are developed for use on particular areas of the body, such as the face, the hands or around the eyes.

Makeup

- We manufacture, market and sell a full array of makeup products, including those for the face, eyes, lips and nails.  Many of the products are offered in an extensive array of shades and colors.  We also sell related items such as compacts, brushes and other makeup tools.

Fragrance

Hair Care

- Hair care products are offered mainly in prestige salons and in freestanding stores as well as some department stores and specialty multi-brand retailers, and include shampoos, conditioners, styling products, treatment, finishing sprays and hair color products.

Other

- We also sell ancillary products and services.

Our Brands

Given the personal nature of our products and the wide array of consumer preferences and tastes, as well as competition for the attention of consumers, our strategy has been to market and promote our products through distinctive brands seeking to address broad preferences and tastes.  Each brand has a single global image that is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands in the market.  Beauty brands are differentiated by numerous factors, including quality, performance, a particular lifestyle, where they are distributed (e.g., prestige, mass) and price point.  Below is a chart showing most of the brands that we sell and how we view them based on lifestyle and price point:

In addition to the brands described above, we manufacture and sell products under the Prescriptives, GoodSkin Labs, Ojon and Osiao brands.  We also develop and sell products under a license from Kiton.

Our heritage brands are Estée Lauder, Clinique and Origins.  Our makeup artist brands are M

C and Bobbi Brown. Our luxury brands are La Mer, Jo Malone London, Tom Ford, RODIN olio lusso, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle and By Kilian.  Our designer fragrances are sold under the Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Ermenegildo Zegna and Tory Burch licenses noted above.

Distribution

We sell our products primarily through limited distribution channels that complement the luxury image and prestige status of our brands.  These channels consist primarily of upscale department stores, specialty multi-brand retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and spas.  In addition, our products are sold in freestanding stores that are operated either by us or by authorized third parties, through our own and third-party operated e-commerce websites and websites of our authorized retailers, in various travel retail locations such as stores in airports and on cruise ships, in-flight and duty-free shops, and certain fragrances are sold in self-select outlets.  As is customary in the cosmetics industry, our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if properly requested and approved.

As part of our strategy, we have selectively opened new freestanding stores globally that we or authorized third parties operate, with M

ž

A

ž

C, Jo Malone London and Bobbi Brown as the brands leading this expansion, and we are also evaluating opportunities to open additional freestanding stores for certain of our other brands. As of June 30, 2016, we operated approximately 1,260 freestanding stores, and more than 400 freestanding stores are operated around the world by authorized third parties.  We expect the number of freestanding stores to increase over the next several years.

We currently sell products from most of our brands directly to consumers online through Company-owned and operated e-commerce and m-commerce sites in approximately 30 countries.  While today a majority of our online sales are generated in the United States and the United Kingdom, we have ample opportunity for expansion of online sales growth globally.  Additionally, our products are sold through various websites operated by authorized retailers.

We maintain dedicated sales teams that manage our retail accounts.  We have wholly-owned operations in over 50 countries, and two controlling interests that operate in several countries, through which we market, sell and distribute our products.  In certain countries, we sell our products through carefully selected distributors that share our commitment to protecting the image and position of our brands.  In addition, we sell certain products in select domestic and international U.S. military exchanges.  For information regarding our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region, see

“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 20 – Segment Data and Related Information

.”

Customers

Our strategy is to build strong relationships with selected retailers globally, as well as with our consumers directly through freestanding stores and online sales and social media.  Senior management works with executives of our major retail accounts on a regular basis, and we believe we are viewed as an important supplier to these customers.  Our largest customer, Macy’s Inc., sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for 9% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016 and 10% for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, and 13% and 12% of our accounts receivable as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Marketing

Our strategy to market and promote our products begins with our well-diversified portfolio of more than 25 distinctive brands across four product categories.  This portfolio enhances our presence in the multiple geographies and distribution channels where our products are sold and our brands’ global reputations benefit us when entering into emerging markets.  Our geographic and distribution channel diversity allows us to engage local consumers across an array of developed and emerging markets by emphasizing products and services with the greatest local appeal.  This strategy is built around “Bringing the Best to Everyone We Touch.” Our founder, Mrs. Estée Lauder, formulated this unique marketing philosophy to provide “High-Touch” service and high quality products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base.  Our “High-Touch” approach is demonstrated through our integrated consumer engagement models that leverage our product specialists and technology to provide the consumer with a distinct experience that can include personal consultations with beauty advisors, in person or online, who demonstrate and educate the consumer on product usage and application.

Our marketing strategies vary by brand and local market.  Our diverse portfolio of brands employ different engagement models suited to each brand’s equity, distribution, product focus and understanding of the core consumer.  This enables us to elevate the consumer experience as we attract new customers, build loyalty, drive consumer advocacy and address the transformation of consumer shopping behaviors.  Our marketing planning approach leverages local insights to optimize allocation of resources across different media outlets and retail touch points to resonate with our most discerning consumers most effectively.  This includes strategically deploying our brands and tailoring product assortments and communications to fit local tastes and preferences in cities and neighborhoods.  Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house teams that design and produce the sales materials, social media strategies, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand.  We build brand equity and drive traffic to retail locations and to our own and authorized retailers’ websites through digital and social media, magazines and newspapers, television, billboards in cities and airports, and direct mail and email.  In addition, we seek editorial coverage for our brands and products not only in publications and other traditional media, but increasingly in digital and social media, leveraging significant opportunities for amplification.

-

8 -


We are increasing our brand awareness and sales by continuing to elevate our digital presence encompassing e-commerce and m-commerce, as well as digital and social media. In order to continue to offer unparalleled service and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online, we continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), support e-commerce and m-commerce businesses via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and consumer engagement, and support our authorized retailers to strengthen their e-commerce businesses and drive sales of our brands on their websites.  We have opportunities to expand our balanced brand portfolio online around the world, and we are investing in and testing new omnichannel concepts in the United States and other established markets to increase brand loyalty by better serving consumers as they shop across channels.  We have dedicated resources to implement creative, coordinated, brand-enhancing strategies across all online activities to increase our direct access to consumers.

Promotional activities and in-store displays are designed to attract new consumers and introduce existing consumers to other product offerings from the respective brands.  Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with some retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as sampling programs, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase, and we continue to believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers.  Such activities attract consumers to our counters and websites and keep existing consumers engaged.  Our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers, retailers, beauty consultants and makeup artists at the points of sale to enable us to offer a seamless experience across channels of distribution.

Information Systems

Information systems support business processes including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution and finance.  We continue to maintain and enhance these systems in alignment with our long-term strategy. Certain elements of our information technology infrastructure are managed by third-party providers.  We have executed our plans to transform and modernize our global technology infrastructure (“GTI”) to fundamentally change the way we deliver information technology services internally (such initiative, the “GTI Restructuring”).  As part of the GTI Restructuring, we transitioned our GTI from Company-owned assets to a primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where we pay for services as they are used.  This model, with a different third-party provider, is expected to provide an enhanced scalable platform to better support current and future requirements, help us achieve key strategic opportunities and improve our agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging more advanced technologies.  This transition is also expected to result in operational efficiencies and reduce our information technology service and infrastructure costs in the future.

During fiscal 2016, we also completed the deployment of our core human resource (“HR”) transformation program globally.  This initiative should provide managers with greater visibility into our global workforce and provide managers and employees with better self-service HR capabilities.

As we continue to strengthen and modernize our key processes, related systems and infrastructure,

we continue to make investments to upgrade many of our legacy systems, including retail systems and retail capabilities globally.  The retail system upgrades are expected to enhance the effectiveness of store operations, and support our omnichannel objectives.  Over the next few years, we will continue to implement upgraded point of sale, retail merchandising, and retail workforce management solutions in certain key markets globally.

Most of our locations are currently enabled with SAP-based technologies (“SAP”).

W

e continue to develop and invest in new data insight and analytic capabilities to allow us to more effectively utilize the information provided by SAP, as well as strategic sources of both internal and external data.  In addition, we are making continuous investments to integrate changes to systems applications with SAP that we expect will bring value creation to the business and increase productivity.  In particular, initiatives are currently underway to optimize certain of our supply chain capabilities, including inventory and warehouse management, as well as adding capabilities to enhance certain financial processes and workforce management solutions.

Research and Development

We believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products.  Our research and development group, which includes scientists and other employees involved in product innovation and packaging design and development, works closely with our marketing and product development teams and third-party suppliers to cultivate ideas, develop new products and product-line extensions, and create new packaging concepts, as well as to improve, redesign or reformulate existing products.  In addition, these research and development personnel provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how to quality and assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products that meet or exceed consumer expectations.  The research and development group has long-standing working relationships with several U.S. and international medical and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities.  Members of the research and development group are also responsible for regulatory compliance matters.

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately 800 employees engaged in research and development activities. We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, see “

Item 2. Properties.

”

We do not conduct animal testing on our products or ingredients, and do not ask others to test on our behalf, except when required by law.

Manufacturing, Warehousing and Raw Materials

We manufacture our products primarily in the United States, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada.  We continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies, minimize our impact on the environment and reduce costs.  Our major manufacturing facilities operate as “focus” plants that primarily manufacture one category of product (e.g., makeup) for all of the principal brands.  Our plants are modern, and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated.  While we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and third-party manufacturers is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity, technology, productivity and align our manufacturing with regional sales demand.  To capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits, we continue to utilize a network of third-party manufacturers on a global basis.

We have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels.  We are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network.  We have established regional distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers.

The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals.  We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications.  Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations department.  We review our supplier base periodically with the specific objectives of improving quality, increasing innovation and speed-to-market and reducing costs.  In addition, we focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies.  Some of our products rely on a single or limited number of suppliers; however, we believe that our portfolio of suppliers has adequate resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply.  In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.

We are continually benchmarking the performance of our supply chain and will change suppliers and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business.  As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.

Competition

There is vigorous competition within each market where our skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products are sold.  Brand recognition, quality, performance, availability and price are some of the factors that impact consumers’ choices among competing products and brands.  Advertising, promotion, social media activities, merchandising, the pace and timing of new product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store demonstrations also have a significant impact on consumers’ buying decisions.  With our numerous brands, sold in various channels, we are one of the world’s leading manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.  We compete against a number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do.

Our principal competitors consist of

large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of

skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names.  They include, among others, L’Oreal S.A.; Shiseido Company, Ltd.; Beiersdorf AG; LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton; Coty, Inc.; The Procter & Gamble Company; Avon Products, Inc.; Chanel S.A.; Groupe Clarins; and Amorepacific. We also face competition from a number of independent brands, as well as some retailers that have their own beauty brands.  Certain of our competitors also have ownership interests in retailers that are customers of ours.

Trademarks, Patents and Copyrights

We own the trademark rights used in connection with the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of our products both in the United States and in the other principal countries where such products are sold, including Estée Lauder, Clinique, Aramis, Prescriptives, Lab Series, Origins, M

ž

A

ž

C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone London, Bumble and bumble, Darphin, GoodSkin Labs, Ojon, Smashbox, Osiao, Le Labo, RODIN olio lusso, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, GLAMGLOW and By Kilian and the names of many of the products sold under these brands.  We are the exclusive worldwide licensee for fragrances, cosmetics and/or related products for Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Kiton, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, Dr. Andrew Weil, Ermenegildo Zegna, AERIN and Tory Burch.  For further discussion on license arrangements, including their duration, see

“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – License Arrangements

.”  We protect our trademarks in the United States and significant markets worldwide.  We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.

A number of our products incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology.  In addition, several products and packaging for such products are covered by design patents or copyrights.  While we consider these patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is considered material to the conduct of our business.

Employees

At June 30, 2016, we had approximately 46,000 full-time employees worldwide (including demonstrators at points of sale who are employed by us).  We have no employees in the United States that are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  A limited number of employees outside of the United States are covered by a works council agreement or other syndicate arrangements.

Government Regulation

We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold.  Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing, advertising, shipment, disposal and safety of our products.  We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable federal, state, local and international and other countries’ rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment or that relate to climate change.  There are no significant capital expenditures for environmental control or climate change matters either planned in the current year or expected in the near future.

Seasonality

Our results of operations in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year.  The higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season.  Many of our customers that are retailers follow a 4-4-5 retail calendar which may influence the amount and timing of their order placement and receipt of goods in any fiscal quarter.  In a traditional 4-4-5 retail calendar, each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4-week periods and one 5-week period, with one extra week in one quarter every seven years.  As a result, our customers’ retail quarter-end and our fiscal quarter-end may be different by up to six days.  Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions.  Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.  Please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading prices of our securities, may be adversely affected.

The beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.

We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational consumer product companies. Some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and others are new companies competing in emerging distribution channels.  In some cases, our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us. Competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and m-commerce initiatives and other activities. It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas. A consolidation in the retail trade may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers. This could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers. A severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. If one or more of our largest customers change their strategies (including pricing or promotional activities) or change or terminate their relationship with us, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.

Our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business. Our Company has a well-recognized and strong reputation that could be negatively impacted by many factors.  If the Company’s reputation is adversely affected, its ability to attract and retain customers and consumers could be impacted.  In addition, certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands. Our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business.

Our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.

Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, attitudes toward our industry and brands, as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products. We must continually work to develop, manufacture and market new products, maintain and adapt our “High-Touch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, successfully manage our inventories, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products. While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly. The issue is compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace, trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment, our financial results will suffer.  In addition, from time to time, sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands. If such a situation persists or a number of brands fail to perform as expected, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

-

14 -


Our future success depends on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.

Achieving our long-term strategy will require investment in new capabilities, brands, categories, distribution channels, technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets. These investments may result in short-term costs without any current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings, at least in the short term. In addition, we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so. Although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, we may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits. The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.

We continuously review acquisition and investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms. If required, the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our stockholders or both. The purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future, a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business.  If the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results, then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts.

Acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks, which may include:

·

difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from, or customers of, acquired businesses;

·

diversion of management’s attention from our existing businesses;

·

adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;

·

adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business; and

·

risks of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.

Our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business, and any adverse consequences associated with our acquisition activities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.

Completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet. We are required at least annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

A general economic downturn, or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items and/or the financial strength of our customers that are retailers, which could adversely affect our financial results.

The general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control. Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products. A decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers. We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. However, the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer. Our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition. If a retailer was to liquidate, we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity.

In addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions, for example, from events such as a pandemic, or other local or global health issues, conflicts around the world, or as a result of a terrorist attack, retaliation or similar threats, or as a result of adverse weather conditions, climate changes or seismic events, can have a short-term and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.

Events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business, including travel retail, a significant contributor to our overall results, and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations.

A downturn in the economies of, or continuing recessions in, the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence, the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability. We remain cautious of

the continued slow retail growth in Hong Kong, the decline in retail traffic

primarily related to mid-tier department stores, as well as certain M

ž

A

ž

C freestanding stores, in the United States as a result of the impact of shifts in preferences of certain consumers as to where and how they shop for our products.  We also remain cautious of the continued strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies.  Additionally, we are continuing to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environment in Brazil, the United Kingdom’s anticipated exit from the European Union, the political instability in Turkey, the impact of declining oil prices on consumer purchases in the Middle East, and global security issues.

Volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets may experience significant disruptions. Deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive. If any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements, such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.

Our business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies. Changes in the laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, laws and regulations relating to data privacy, anti-corruption, advertising, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, product registration, ingredients, chemicals and packaging, laws in Europe and elsewhere relating to selective distribution, environmental or climate change laws, regulations or accords, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results.

We are involved, and may become involved in the future, in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that, if adversely decided or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.

We are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, other disputes or regulatory proceedings. In general, claims made by us or against us in litigation, disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results. We are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims. However, it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to, and the impact of certain of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.

Government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation.

As we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny. The regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving, and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations. From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations or standards. Any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways, including the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business and/or reputation. Even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations, it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business and/or reputation.

Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.

Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products. If our products are found to be defective or unsafe, our product claims are found to be deceptive, or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ expectations, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and/or become subject to liability or claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our success depends, in part, on our key personnel.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management team. The unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business. Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified personnel. Competition for these employees can be intense. We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business. This risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives.

We are subject to risks related to our foreign operations.

We operate on a global basis, with a majority of our fiscal 2016 net sales and operating income generated outside the United States.  We intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely, except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the United States. If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.

We maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world. Foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including:

·

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places, which can affect our results of operations, the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets, the cost of certain inventory and non-inventory items required in our operations, and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets;

·

foreign laws, regulations and policies, including restrictions on trade, import and export license requirements, and tariffs and taxes, as well as United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade, operations and investment;

·

lack of well-established or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate; and

·

adverse weather conditions, currency exchange controls, and social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action.

These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

A disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results.

As a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers, product quality control, safety, increase in commodity prices and energy costs, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control. If such an event were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.

We use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world. Some of our products rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. Changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities, in compliance with applicable standards, and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business. In addition, any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations.

Our information systems and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches, outages, and other risks.

We have information systems that support our business processes, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and intracompany communications throughout the world. We have e-commerce, m-commerce and other Internet websites in the United States and many other countries. These systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and other events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We are dependent upon automated information technology processes. As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain information that is confidential, proprietary or otherwise sensitive, including personal information with respect to customers and employees. We may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business. Moreover, the success of our e-commerce and m-commerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees’ and customers’ personal information, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations.

-

17 -


We are subject to risks associated with our global information systems.

Our implementation and maintenance of global information systems, including supply chain and finance systems, human resource management systems, creative asset management and retail operating systems, as well as associated hardware and use of cloud-based models, involve risks and uncertainties. Failure to implement and maintain these and other systems as planned, in terms of timing, specifications, costs, or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

As we outsource functions, we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions.

As part of our long-term strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner. In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers. These include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations, and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration. While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.  In addition, if we transition systems to one or more new, or among existing, external service providers, we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance.

Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. At the same time, however, we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections. Accordingly, when we announced our year-end financial results for fiscal 2016, we provided guidance as to certain assumptions, including ranges for our expected net sales and earnings per share for the quarter ending September 30, 2016 and the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. While we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. In addition, the longer-term guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. Such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations.  We historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our Class A Common Stock.  At any time, we could stop or suspend payment of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program, and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline.

In all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our net sales and/or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect. Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q). These and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.

Outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period. Outside analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance. Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations. If and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected. Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.

We are controlled by the Lauder family. As a result of their control of us, the Lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.

As of August 18, 2016, members of the Lauder family beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (with one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (with 10 votes per share) having approximately 87% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock. In addition, there are four members of the Lauder family who are employees, including three who are members of our Board of Directors. Another family member is on our board and is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us.

As a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the Company, the Lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business, including, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets, for the foreseeable future.

-

We are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies.”

The Lauder family and their related entities own more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, as a result, we are a “controlled company” under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards. As a controlled company, we are exempt under the New York Stock Exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements, including the requirements; (1) that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors; (2) that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and (3) that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities.

While we have voluntarily caused our Board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and the Compensation Committee to have the required provisions, we are not requiring our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and Compensation Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors. As a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions, investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters

Our Class A Common Stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “EL.”  The following table shows the high and low per share sales prices as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and the cash dividends per share declared in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015:

We expect to continue the payment of cash dividends in the future, but there can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will continue to declare them.

On August 18, 2016, a dividend was declared in the amount of $.30 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock.  The dividend is payable in cash on September 15, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2016.

As of August 18, 2016, there were 8,503 record holders of Class A Common Stock and 16 record holders of Class B Common Stock.

Share Repurchase Program

We are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 216.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors.  As of June 30, 2016, the cumulative total of acquired shares pursuant to the authorization was 197.5 million, reducing the remaining authorized share repurchase balance to 18.5 million.  During fiscal 2016, we purchased approximately 9.9 million shares pursuant to the authorization for $835.0 million as outlined in the following table:

(1)

In November 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 40.0 million shares.

(2)

Includes shares that were repurchased by the Company in connection with shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations upon the vesting of stock-based compensation.

Subsequent to June 30, 2016 and as of August 18, 2016, we purchased approximately 2.2 million additional shares of our Class A Common Stock for $200.0 million pursuant to our share repurchase program.

Sales of Unregistered Securities

Shares of Class B Common Stock may be converted immediately into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis by the holder and are automatically converted into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis upon transfer to a person or entity that is not a “Permitted Transferee” or soon after a record date for a meeting of stockholders where the outstanding Class B Common Stock constitutes less than 10% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company.  There is no cash or other consideration paid by the holder converting the shares and, accordingly, there is no cash or other consideration received by the Company.  The shares of Class A Common Stock issued by the Company in such conversions are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) thereof.

During the year ended June 30, 2016, the stockholders set forth in the table below converted shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock on the dates set forth below:

(b)

As a result of our July 2014 SMI rollout, approximately $178 million of accelerated orders were recorded as net sales and $127 million as operating income in fiscal 2014 that would have occurred in the fiscal 2015 first quarter, equal to approximately $.21 per diluted common share.

(c)

During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a $5.3 million charge, on a before and after tax basis, related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, equal to $.01 per diluted common share.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a $38.3 million charge, on a before and after tax basis, related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, equal to $.10 per diluted common share.

(d)

In May 2016, we issued $450.0 million of 1.70% Senior Notes due May 10, 2021 and an additional $150.0 million of our 4.375% Senior Notes due June 15, 2045.  In June 2015, we issued $300.0 million of 4.375% Senior Notes due June 15, 2045 in a public offering.  We are using the net proceeds of the offerings for general corporate purposes.  In September 2012, we redeemed the $230.1 million principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due November 1, 2013 (“2013 Senior Notes”) at a price of 108% of the principal amount.  We recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $19.1 million ($12.2 million after tax, or $.03 per diluted share) representing the call premium of $18.6 million and the pro-rata write-off of $0.5 million of issuance costs and debt discount.

(e)

For the year ended June 30, 2016, we retrospectively adopted new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.  As a result, we restated the June 30, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 consolidated balance sheets to reclassify $12.4 million, $8.8 million, $9.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, from Other assets to Long-term debt.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2016 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.  We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Company’s financial condition.  Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes.

Management of the Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.

-

22 -


Revenue Recognition

Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales.

This accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels.  Consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.  Experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business.  In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events.  The types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products.

For a discussion of our Revenue Recognition accounting policy, see

“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

.”

Inventory

We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.  We believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale.  The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods.

We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.  This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.  In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.

For further discussion of our Inventory accounting policy, see

“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

.”

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefit Costs

We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (“U.S. Qualified Plan”) and an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S. Qualified Plan, the “Domestic Plans”); a domestic contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation arrangements; and certain other post-retirement benefit plans.

The amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and future compensation levels.  We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations.  While we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings.

The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.  For fiscal 2016, net periodic benefit cost was determined using discount rates for our Domestic Plans of 4.40% and 3.70% and varying rates on our international plans between 0.75% and 7.00%.  The discount rates for our Domestic Plans were based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.  We used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our Domestic Plans.  For our international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.

-

23 -


For fiscal 2016, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates of between 2.00% and 7.00% for our international plans.  In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies.  See

“Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 13 – Pension, Deferred Compensation and Post-retirement Benefit Plans

” for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan investments.  The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  Those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods.  For fiscal 2016, our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $84 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $68 million.  The resulting net deferred gain of approximately $16 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 8 to 19 years.  The actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans was higher than expected, primarily due to strong performance of fixed income assets attributable to our international pension plan in the United Kingdom and the U.S. Qualified Plan, partially offset by equity underperformance globally.

A 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2016 pension expense:

Our post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported.  A 100 basis-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2016 would have had the following effects:

To determine the fiscal 2017 net periodic benefit cost, we are using discount rates of 3.70% and 3.00% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and the non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan, respectively, and varying rates for our international plans of between .25% and 6.00%.  We are using an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 1.50% and 6.00%.  The net change in these two key assumptions from those used in fiscal 2016 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $17 million in fiscal 2017.

Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.  Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.  Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.

When testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. For fiscal 2016 and 2015, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for the majority of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.  This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value.

For those reporting units acquired in fiscal 2015, a quantitative assessment was performed.

We engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management.

For further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets, see

“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

.”

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.  As of June 30, 2016, we have net deferred tax assets of $422.3 million.  The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.  Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of $118.4 million for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.

-

24 -


We provide tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.  The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.  We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.

For further discussion of our Income Taxes accounting policy, see

“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

.”

Quantitative Analysis

During the three-year period ended June 30, 2016, there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates.  The results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations.

While we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.

A 250 basis-point change in the items above collectively would have had the following effects for fiscal 2016:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We manufacture, market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories.  The following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 and reflects the basis of presentation described in

“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

and

Note 20 – Segment Data

and

Related Information

” for all periods presented.  Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category.

26 -


The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales:

In order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives.  The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.  The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods.  While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.

See

“Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

” beginning on page 42 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.

We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States.  Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.  Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States.  Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.  We calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.

Overview

We believe the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with superior products and services in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers’ changing behaviors and shopping preferences.  We are guided by our long-term strategy through fiscal 2019, which has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions that are designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable.  We plan to continue to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth.

Our diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty. We believe our range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumer’s beauty routine and source consumers from brands sold in mass distribution.  Skin care, our most profitable product category historically, remains a strategic priority for us, and we continue to support our large, long-standing skin care product lines including Advanced Night Repair from Estée Lauder, Clinique’s 3-Step Skin Care System and Crème de la Mer from La Mer.  We have also continued to develop and introduce new products, such as New Dimension and Re-Nutriv Ultimate Diamond Transformative Energy eye crème from Estée Lauder, Clinique Smart moisturizers, Clinique Smart treatment oil and Clinique Sculptwear lift and contour serum for face and neck, as well as The Renewal Oil and Genaissance de La Mer The Serum Essence from La Mer.  We supplemented our skin care offerings through the fiscal 2015 acquisitions of GLAMGLOW and RODIN olio lusso. While growth in global prestige skin care remained relatively slow in fiscal 2016, growth in global prestige makeup continued to show the fastest acceleration.  This trend benefited our makeup sales, particularly in certain areas in Europe, the Middle East & Africa, such as the United Kingdom.  We also introduced new products, including new collections from our makeup artist brands and Smashbox, Double Wear Makeup to Go liquid compact and Pure Color Envy liquid lip potion from Estée Lauder, and Chubby Lash fattening mascara and Beyond Perfecting foundation + concealer from Clinique.  We believe that the makeup category represents one of our most compelling growth opportunities.  Our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased sales of Jo Malone London and Tom Ford fragrances, new launches such as Mimosa & Cardamom from Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Noir Pour Femme, and incremental net sales from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of Le Labo and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle.  In addition, we are expanding our hair care brands in salons and other retail channels.  To complement the strategies in our existing business, we are continuously looking to acquire and grow smaller brands that we believe have significant growth potential and may provide unique opportunities for profitable growth in the future.  During our fiscal 2016 third quarter, we further expanded our luxury fragrance portfolio with the acquisition of By Kilian, a prestige fragrance brand.

Our global footprint provides many avenues of growth.  We are leveraging our regional organizations and the talents and expertise of our people in an effort to continue to be locally relevant with our products, services, channels, marketing and visual merchandising.  We are seeking share growth in large, image-building core markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan and Korea by strengthening our presence in these areas.  During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we purchased a minority interest in Have & Be Co. Ltd., the Korean company behind the skin care brands Dr. Jart + and Do The Right Thing. This investment provides us with a strategic opportunity to participate in the expanding Korean beauty trend.  In addition, we are broadening our presence in emerging markets such as China, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico and South Africa.  While we continue to see slow department store traffic in some markets, which is particularly affecting Estée Lauder and Clinique, we are growing faster in other channels such as e- and m-commerce.

In North America, we are hosting targeted in-store events to support key innovations in multiple channels, and we are increasing our presence in specialty multi-brand retailers and freestanding retail stores.  Internationally, we are expanding our business in freestanding stores, in European perfumeries and pharmacies, and in department stores, particularly in the United Kingdom and certain markets in Asia.  We approach distribution strategically by brand, as each is at a different stage of development. We seek to optimize distribution in both channels and geographies, matching each brand with appropriate opportunities.  We focus on those areas where we believe our brands will expand consumer coverage and gain high-quality distribution consistent with their positioning.  As part of this strategy, we continue to expand brands in our travel retail channel, which benefits from increasing international passenger traffic.  Travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building and profit margin expansion, although it is susceptible to a number of external factors, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers’ willingness and ability to travel and spend.  We have strategies focused on consumers who purchase in the travel retail channel, in stores at their travel destinations or when they return to their home market.  This includes partnering with our retailers to open individual boutiques within airports to compete more effectively in this channel.  We are broadening our online portfolio around the world by adding brands to existing markets and entering new markets, resulting in strong net sales growth in the online channel, and we continue to develop and test omnichannel concepts to better serve consumers as they shop across channels.  We have identified opportunities to expand our online portfolio around the world, which we expect will result in continued net sales growth in this channel.  Our success in delivering particularly strong online growth in emerging markets is a result of taking key learnings from our online strategy in established markets, such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, and customizing them to meet local market needs.  To further drive our online sales, we are planning new e- and m-commerce site launches in new and existing markets, and we are extending our third-party platform model, which has been successful in China, into certain other international locations.

While our business is performing well overall, we are faced with strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries. In particular, we are cautious of the continued slow retail growth in Hong Kong, the decline in retail traffic

primarily related to mid-tier department stores, as well as certain M

ž

A

ž

C freestanding stores, in the United States as a result of the impact of shifts in preferences of certain consumers as to where and how they shop for our products.  We are also cautious of the continued strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies.  Additionally, we are continuing to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environment in Brazil, the United Kingdom’s anticipated exit from the European Union, the political instability in Turkey, the impact of declining oil prices on consumer purchases in the Middle East, and global security issues.

-

28 -


We believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of these challenges by accelerating areas of strength, utilizing the various growth drivers among our brands, channels and markets.  However, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously discussed are further prolonged, then there could be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence, demand and spending and, as a result, on our business.  We will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.

We navigate through short-term volatility while focusing on our long-term strategy and using our multiple engines of growth that we believe will promote sustainable growth.  We are increasing our presence in emerging markets, continuing efforts to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands, focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio.  We are also strengthening our consumer engagement by leveraging digital marketing and enhancing our social media strategies and execution.  We will continue to drive product, packaging, and conceptual innovation and creativity that we believe will enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers.  Some initiatives will involve new sub-categories and others may expand key franchises.  We expect to leverage our top line growth through greater productivity, due in part to cost savings and efficiencies from our Strategic Modernization Initiative (“SMI”).

On May 3, 2016, we announced a multi-year initiative (“Leading Beauty Forward”) to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum.  Leading Beauty Forward is designed to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.  We plan to approve specific initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward through fiscal 2019 and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.  We expect that Leading Beauty Forward will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset write-offs and other costs to implement these initiatives.  After its full implementation, we expect Leading Beauty Forward to yield annual net benefits, primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses, of between $200 million and $300 million, before taxes.  We expect to reinvest a portion behind future growth initiatives.  For additional information about Leading Beauty Forward, see “

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Charges Associated with Restructuring Activities

.”

In addition to Leading Beauty Forward, investment in our global information systems is an ongoing process.  We have implemented initiatives to leverage our SMI foundation that are focused on sustainment and global efficiencies.  As we modernize our key processes, related systems and infrastructure, we continue to develop upgraded capabilities to support our human resource operations and are making investments to upgrade our global technology infrastructure (“GTI”), as well as our retail systems and retail capabilities globally.  These initiatives are expected to improve profitability by enhancing gross margin and supporting efficiencies in select operating expenses and working capital, freeing resources to strategically reinvest in activities to support our future growth.

In October 2015, we approved plans to transform and modernize our GTI to fundamentally change the way we deliver information technology services internally (such initiative, the “GTI Restructuring”).  As part of the GTI Restructuring, we transitioned our GTI from Company-owned assets to a primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where we pay for services as they are used.  This model, with a different third-party provider, is expected to provide an enhanced scalable platform to better support current and future requirements, help us achieve key strategic opportunities and improve our agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging more advanced technologies.  This transition is expected to result in operational efficiencies and reduce our information technology service and infrastructure costs in the future.  The implementation of the GTI Restructuring was substantially completed during fiscal 2016.  Net savings from this initiative may be partially reinvested in other strategic areas of our business.  For additional information about the GTI Restructuring initiative, see “

We rolled out the last major wave of SMI in July 2014, and most of our locations are now SAP-enabled.  We plan to continue the implementation of SAP at our remaining locations throughout the next few fiscal years.  In connection with the July 2014 implementation, some retailers accelerated their sales orders that would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter in advance of this implementation to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential short-term business interruption associated with the SMI rollout.  The negative impact on the net sales and operating results for the year ended June 30, 2015 by product category and geographic region was as follows:

The lower orders during the year ended June 30, 2015 created a favorable comparison between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 of approximately $178 million in net sales and approximately $127 million in operating results and impacted our operating margin comparisons.  We believe that the presentation of certain year-to-date comparative information in the following discussions that excludes the impact of the timing of these orders is useful in analyzing the net sales performance and operating results of our business.

Reported net sales in fiscal 2016 grew in each product category, with the exception of skin care, and in each geographic region, with the exception of Asia/Pacific.  The overall decline in the skin care category was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the relatively slow growth in global prestige skin care that particularly impacted net sales in North America, Asia/Pacific and travel retail.  However, this category benefited from increased sales of certain products, particularly from La Mer and Origins.  Net sales increases in product offerings by M

A

C, Smashbox, Tom Ford, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Estée Lauder globally drove the growth in the makeup category.  Our fragrance category benefited from net sales increases from our luxury brands.  Incremental sales from our acquisitions during the past two years also helped drive our skin care and fragrance sales.  The net sales increase in our hair care category was driven by product offerings from Aveda and Bumble and bumble, as well as expanded consumer coverage.  Each of our product categories benefited from brand expansion, comparable door sales growth from certain brands, new product offerings and growth from emerging markets.

Net sales in fiscal 2015 decreased from fiscal 2014, entirely driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $519 million and the difficult comparison due to the accelerated orders, as discussed above, of approximately $357 million.  Inclusive of these items, higher net sales in our makeup and hair care product categories were more than offset by declines in our skin care and fragrance product categories, while geographically, we experienced lower net sales in each region.  Our makeup artist and luxury brands continued to grow net sales through successful product launches and the broadening of their presence globally.  However, net sales from Estée Lauder and Clinique were challenged in all of our product categories and reflected a difficult comparison to fiscal 2014, which featured significant launch activity related to the reformulation of certain iconic skin care products and several significant fragrance launches.  In addition, we experienced strong growth in certain channels such as specialty-multi, online and freestanding stores, as well as expansion in emerging markets.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, net sales would have increased in each of our major product categories and within each geographic region.

Returns associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures.  Accordingly, the following discussions of Net Sales by

and

exclude the fiscal 2016 impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of $1.4 million.

Skin care net sales decreased in fiscal 2016, reflecting approximately $163 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $91 million.  The reported net sales decrease reflected lower net sales from Estée Lauder and Clinique of approximately $138 million, combined. The decrease in net sales of Estée Lauder and Clinique products was due, in part, to lower sales in certain countries within Asia/Pacific, particularly Hong Kong reflecting continued retail softness.  The lower net sales from Clinique also reflected decreased sales in travel retail. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of La Mer and Origins products, as well as incremental sales from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of GLAMGLOW and RODIN olio lusso, of approximately $108 million, combined.   Net sales of La Mer products grew in all regions, driven by the continued momentum of the fiscal 2016 launches of The Renewal Oil, The Lifting Eye Serum and Genaissance de La Mer The Serum Essence and an increase in distribution in specialty-multi brand retailers and department stores.  Net sales growth of Origins products benefited from higher sales of facial mask products.

Skin care net sales decreased in fiscal 2015, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $215 million. The decrease, as reported, reflected lower net sales of Estée Lauder and Clinique products of approximately $303 million, combined, primarily due to the accelerated orders and significant launch activity in fiscal 2014 related to the reformulation of certain iconic products.  These decreases were partially offset by higher sales of La Mer products, primarily due to fiscal 2015 launches and expanded distribution in the travel retail channel, and incremental sales from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of approximately $23 million, combined.

Makeup net sales increased in fiscal 2016 despite approximately $233 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The increase was also impacted by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $65 million.  The reported net sales increase primarily reflected higher net sales from our makeup artist brands, Clinique, Smashbox, Tom Ford and Estée Lauder of approximately $397 million, combined. Sales from our makeup artist brands benefited from new product offerings, as well as the continued broadening of the brands’ presence in a number of channels, including our freestanding retail stores and travel retail.  The higher net sales from Clinique reflected incremental sales from new launches such as Clinique Beyond Perfecting makeup products.   Sales from Smashbox were primarily driven by specialty multi-brand retailers, reflecting the overall strength of the makeup category in that channel.  The increase in Tom Ford net sales was driven by higher sales of lip color products.  Net sales of Estée Lauder products improved partially due to higher sales from the Double Wear line of products and the Pure Color Envy franchise.

Makeup net sales increased in fiscal 2015 and included the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $205 million.  The net sales increase, as reported, primarily reflected higher net sales from our makeup artist brands, Tom Ford and Smashbox of approximately $293 million, combined.  Sales from our makeup artist brands benefited from new product offerings, as well as expanded distribution in a number of channels, including our freestanding retail stores.  The higher net sales from Tom Ford and Smashbox were primarily due to expanded distribution of Tom Ford in the travel retail channel and Smashbox in specialty multi-brand retailers.  Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of Clinique and Estée Lauder products of approximately $161 million, combined.

Fragrance net sales increased in fiscal 2016 despite approximately $75 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.  This increase was also impacted by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $21 million.  The reported net sales increase primarily reflected higher net sales of luxury fragrances from Jo Malone London and Tom Ford, as well as incremental sales from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of Le Labo and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle and the fiscal 2016 acquisition of By Kilian of approximately $134 million, combined.  The higher net sales from Jo Malone London were, in part, due to brand expansion in department stores, freestanding stores and travel retail, the recent launch of Mimosa & Cardamom, and increased sales of existing products.  The increase in Tom Ford net sales reflected incremental sales from new product launches, including Tom Ford Noir Pour Femme and increased distribution, particularly in travel retail. Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of certain fragrances from our heritage brands and certain designer fragrances of approximately $62 million, combined.

Fragrance net sales decreased in fiscal 2015, driven entirely by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $75 million.  The decrease, as reported, primarily reflected lower sales of certain Estée Lauder, Clinique, Coach and Tommy Hilfiger fragrances of approximately $98 million, combined.  These decreases were mostly offset by the strong performance of luxury fragrances from Jo Malone London and Tom Ford that resulted in higher net sales of approximately $91 million, combined.

Hair care net sales increased in fiscal 2016 despite the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $14 million.  The increase in net sales reflected new product launches from Aveda, such as Invati Men and Shampure dry shampoo and, to a lesser extent, an increase in distribution of Aveda products in salons and travel retail and Bumble and bumble products in specialty multi-brand retailers.

Hair care net sales increased in fiscal 2015 and included the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $22 million.  The increase in net sales reflected expanded global distribution of Aveda products in department stores, freestanding retail stores, salons and in the travel retail channel, and Bumble and bumble products in specialty multi-brand retailers.  The category also benefited from increased sales of Smooth Infusion Naturally Straight from Aveda, as well as the expansion of the Hairdresser’s invisible oil line of products from Bumble and bumble which contributed approximately $12 million to the increase, combined.  Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of the Invati line of products and Dry Remedy moisturizing shampoo from Aveda of approximately $6 million, combined.

Net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased in fiscal 2016.  This increase includes approximately $265 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to all currencies in the region. The increase was also impacted by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $68 million.  Higher sales in our travel retail business, the United Kingdom and the Middle East totaled approximately $225 million, combined.  The sales growth in our travel retail business was partially driven by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders.  Travel retail growth also reflected higher net sales from Jo Malone London, Tom Ford, M

A

ž

C and Smashbox, driven in part by increased distribution and new product offerings.  Higher sales in the United Kingdom and the Middle East were primarily due to increased net sales from Estée Lauder, our makeup artist brands and Smashbox, reflecting the strength of our makeup category, as well as higher sales from certain of our luxury brands.  These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in Russia and South Africa of approximately $17 million, combined, driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation.  Excluding this impact, net sales in Russia and South Africa increased $57 million, combined. The sales growth in Russia was primarily due to higher net sales from certain of our heritage and luxury brands. The higher net sales in South Africa were primarily driven by our makeup artist brands and certain of our luxury brands, reflecting successful in-store promotional events.

Net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa decreased in fiscal 2015, driven by approximately $285 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies in the region.  Lower sales in our travel retail business, Germany, Iberia and Italy totaled approximately $185 million, combined. The lower sales in our travel retail business were driven by the impact of the accelerated orders.  Excluding this impact, travel retail net sales increased due to a strategic expansion of certain of our luxury brands and our makeup artist brands, partially offset by the negative impact of the social instability in Hong Kong, as well as changes in the purchasing power of key groups of travelers.  The decrease in sales in Germany, Iberia and Italy was due to the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.  Excluding this impact, net sales in Germany, Iberia and Italy increased, primarily driven by certain of our luxury, makeup artist and hair care brands as a result of expanded distribution and new product introductions.  Partially offsetting these reported decreases were higher sales in the United Kingdom and the Middle East of approximately $122 million, combined.  The increase in sales in the United Kingdom was primarily driven by our makeup artist and luxury brands.  Higher sales in the Middle East were primarily driven by certain of our luxury brands and makeup artist brands as a result of new product introductions and expanded distribution.

Net sales in Asia/Pacific decreased in fiscal 2016, reflecting approximately $122 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to all currencies in the region, partially offset by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $26 million.  Lower sales in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and Korea totaled approximately $56 million, combined.  The lower net sales in Hong Kong were primarily driven by a decrease in traveling Chinese consumers and changes in their spending patterns, which particularly impacted the Estée Lauder, Clinique and La Mer brands.  The decrease in net sales in Thailand, Malaysia, and Korea was driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation.  Excluding this negative impact, the higher sales in Korea were primarily driven by our makeup artist brands, reflecting successful in-store promotional events from M

C and the launch of the Skin Foundation Cushion Compact from Bobbi Brown, as well as new product introductions from certain of our luxury brands, such as Genaissance de La Mer The Serum Essence from La Mer.  These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales in Japan and, to a lesser extent, the Philippines of approximately $48 million, combined.  The net sales in Japan reflected higher tourism and increased net sales from virtually all of our brands, which was primarily driven by the makeup product category.  In the Philippines, the higher net sales reflected the introduction of Jo Malone London and Origins.

Net sales in Asia/Pacific decreased in fiscal 2015, driven by approximately $79 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to certain currencies in the region. Lower sales in Japan and Hong Kong totaled approximately $94 million, combined.  The decrease in net sales in Japan primarily reflected the impact of the accelerated orders and foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher sales of certain of our luxury and makeup artist brands.  The lower sales in Hong Kong were primarily due to the negative impact to our business as a result of the social instability there.  These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales in China, Australia and Korea of approximately $46 million, combined.  The higher net sales in China were primarily driven by certain of our heritage and luxury brands, and our makeup artist brands as a result of expanded distribution in department stores, freestanding stores and online.  For Australia and Korea, the higher net sales were from certain of our makeup artist and luxury brands.

We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.

GROSS PROFIT

Gross profit in fiscal 2016 increased to 80.6% as compared with 80.5% in fiscal 2015 and 80.3% in fiscal 2014.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2016 increased to 66.3% as compared with 65.6% in fiscal 2015 and 63.6% in fiscal 2014.

Fiscal 2016 as compared with Fiscal 2015

The lower advertising, merchandising and sampling costs in fiscal 2016, as a percentage of net sales, as compared to fiscal 2015, were in part due to the brand and channel mix of our spend as certain media formats carry different cost structures.  Certain of our brands have lower costs associated with advertising as they focus on digital and social media strategies and rely less on print and television advertising, which carry a higher media cost.

Adjusting for the impact of the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders, operating expense margin in fiscal 2016 would have increased an additional 90 basis points, to 160 basis points unfavorable as compared to fiscal 2015.  This additional increase, as a percentage of net sales, was reflected in general and administrative, selling and shipping, and advertising, merchandising and sampling costs.

Fiscal 2015 as compared with Fiscal 2014

The increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was a result of higher support spending behind capability-building initiatives, such as information technology, as well as for acquisition-related expenses.  The higher store operating and selling costs in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 were primarily driven by the expansion of M

A

C and Jo Malone London freestanding retail stores.

In fiscal 2015, adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales would have increased approximately 10 basis points, primarily reflecting an increase in general and administrative expenses and higher store operating costs, partially offset by lower spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling and lower charges related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela.

Changes in advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets and brands being emphasized.

OPERATING RESULTS

See

“Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”

beginning on page 42 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.

The overall operating results and operating margin in fiscal 2016 were impacted by a favorable comparison of approximately $127 million related to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders, more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $134 million, which negatively impacted each product category and geographic region.  In addition, the operating results for fiscal 2016 include the impact of charges associated with restructuring activities of $134.7 million.  Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders and charges associated with restructuring activities, operating income would have increased 1% and operating margin would have decreased 30 basis points.

In fiscal 2015, operating margin decreased reflecting an increase in our operating expense margin, partially offset by our higher gross margin.  Our skin care, makeup and fragrance results declined, primarily reflecting the accelerated orders, as well as certain challenges and difficult comparisons affecting our net sales growth in certain markets and channels by our heritage brands as previously discussed.  These decreases were partially offset by improved results from our makeup artist, certain luxury, and our hair care brands.  While certain operating expenses have increased as a percentage of net sales during fiscal 2015, we were able to implement cost containment measures to mitigate the impact.

Charges associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures and to transform and modernize the Company’s GTI.  Accordingly, the following discussions of Operating Income by

Operating income in the Americas decreased in fiscal 2015, primarily reflecting the decrease in net sales from our heritage brands in the United States and Canada associated with the accelerated orders and the significant launch activity in fiscal 2014 related to the reformulation of certain iconic products, as well as higher general and administrative expenses, which include acquisition-related expenses.  This decrease was partially offset by lower advertising, merchandising and sampling spending by our heritage brands due to the lower launch activity and a reallocation of spending among media formats.  The region also benefited from higher results in Latin America, primarily driven by lower charges related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela.

In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income increased in fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting higher results from our travel retail business, which benefited mostly from the accelerated orders, Germany and the Middle East of approximately $92 million, combined.  The higher results in Germany were due to increased sales from certain of our heritage brands and our makeup artist brands, primarily due to new product introductions, as well as more effective promotional programs.  These higher results were partially offset by lower results in the United Kingdom, France and Russia of approximately $33 million.  The lower results in the United Kingdom were driven by the negative impact of foreign currency.  The lower results in France were partially due to higher investment spending behind certain of our heritage and luxury brands.

Operating income in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased in fiscal 2015.  Higher operating results in the United Kingdom, the Middle East, France, India, Russia and Switzerland of approximately $83 million, combined, were partially offset by lower operating results in our travel retail business, due to the accelerated orders, and, to a lesser extent, Germany of approximately $79 million, combined.  The higher results in France, India, Russia and Switzerland were primarily due to an increase in constant currency net sales.

Lower results in Hong Kong and China totaled approximately $36 million, combined.  The decline in operating results in China was also attributable to higher selling and shipping costs.  These lower results were partially offset by higher results in Japan, driven by the impact of the accelerated orders, and, to a lesser extent, Australia, Korea and Taiwan of approximately $44 million, combined.  The improved results in Australia were due to higher sales from virtually all of our brands, as well as an improvement in selling and shipping costs. The higher results in Korea were primarily due to lower advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses.  The improved results from Taiwan were primarily due to an increase in net sales.

In fiscal 2015, operating income in Asia/Pacific increased, primarily reflecting higher results in China, Korea and Australia of approximately $49 million, combined.  These higher results were partially offset by lower results in Japan, due to the accelerated orders, and Singapore of approximately $40 million, combined.

INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME

Interest expense increased in fiscal 2016, primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term debt in June 2015 and May 2016.

Interest expense increased in fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher short- and long- term debt levels.

Interest income and investment income, net increased in fiscal 2016 and 2015, primarily due to higher interest income as a result of an increase in short- and long-term investment balances and rates in connection with our cash investment strategy.  The increase in fiscal 2015 also reflected realized gains on investments.  See

“Financial Condition”

below for further discussion of our modified cash investment strategy.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations, as well as a decrease in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in the current year.

The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations, which included Venezuela remeasurement charges in fiscal 2015 and 2014 of $5.3 million and $38.3 million, respectively, for which no tax benefit was provided. This reduction was partially offset by an increase in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in fiscal 2015.

The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.  The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.  Our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.  In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change.

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  Management believes that excluding these items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods.  While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  The following tables present Net Sales, Operating Income and Diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of accelerated orders associated with the July 2014 SMI rollout (i.e. the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders), charges associated with restructuring activities, the fiscal 2015 Venezuela remeasurement charge and the effects of foreign currency translation.  The tables provide reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad.  At June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $914.1 million compared with $1,021.4 million at June 30, 2015.  Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.  To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.

The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from the prior year primarily reflects cash used to purchase short- and long-term investments pursuant to our cash investment strategy.

Our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, asset diversification, and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy.  These investments are classified as available-for-sale and totaled $1,504.5 million and $917.8 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.  From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.  To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, potential stock repurchases, restructuring activities, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis. Our cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances at June 30, 2016 include approximately $2,002 million of cash and short- and long-term investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy.  We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.  If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.

The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.  Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.

Credit Ratings

Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.  Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below.  Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.  A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  As of August 18, 2016,

our commercial paper is rated A-1 by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s and our long-term debt is rated A+ with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A2 with a stable outlook by Moody’s.

Debt and Access to Liquidity

Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) increased to 39% at June 30, 2016 from 31% at June 30, 2015, primarily due to the issuance of the $450.0 million of 1.70% Senior Notes due May 2021 (“2021 Senior Notes”) and an additional $150.0 million of our 4.375% Senior Notes due June 2045 (“2045 Senior Notes”).

For further information regarding our current and long-term debt and available financing, see

“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 10 – Debt

.”

Cash Flows

The fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by the accelerated orders in connection with our July 2014 SMI implementation, which contributed to an unfavorable comparison in certain working capital components and the increase in net earnings.  The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities also reflected an unfavorable change in accounts receivable, reflecting the timing of shipments and collections, and higher long-term payments related to new freestanding retail store locations, including cash payments made to former tenants to acquire the rights under commercial property leases.  Also contributing to the decrease was an unfavorable change in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of expenses.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in other accrued liabilities, due, in part, to higher accrued restructuring costs and employee incentive compensation.

The fiscal 2015 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected a favorable change in accounts receivable, reflecting the timing of shipments and improved collections, a favorable change in inventory, reflecting our initiative to better align supply levels with forecasted demand and other supply chain improvements, and a favorable change in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments.  The accelerated orders in connection with our July 2014 SMI implementation also contributed to the favorable changes in these working capital components and the decrease in net earnings as compared to fiscal 2014.

The fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy.  The decrease in cash used for investing activities also reflected lower payments related to acquisitions.  Cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2015 acquisitions was partially offset by cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2016 acquisition of By Kilian and an additional purchase price true-up payment related to a fiscal 2015 acquisition.  Partially offsetting the decrease was cash paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 for the long-term investment in Have & Be Co. Ltd., the company behind the skin care brands Dr. Jart + and Do The Right Thing, as well as higher capital expenditure activity, primarily related to leasehold improvements.

The fiscal 2015 increase in net cash used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected

purchases of investments in connection with the implementation of our

cash investment strategy, as previously discussed.  Also contributing to the increase was cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of RODIN olio lusso, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle and GLAMGLOW.  Partially offsetting cash used for investing activities were proceeds from the disposition of investments and, to a lesser extent, lower capital expenditure activity.

The fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected the proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes and additional 2045 Senior Notes, as well as lower treasury stock purchases, partially offset by higher dividend payments.

.”

Pension and Post-retirement Plan Funding

Several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.  For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages.  For any future contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”) and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.  For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.  In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in

“Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.

”  The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.

For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.  This strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio.  During fiscal 2016, we made a cash contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan of $30.0 million.  For fiscal 2016 and 2015, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under ERISA regulations for the U.S. Qualified Plan.  As we continue to monitor the funded status, we may decide to make cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the United States during fiscal 2017.

The following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and post-retirement plans:

Commitments and Contingencies

Certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or “earn-out” provisions.  These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.  Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition.

For additional contingencies refer to

Credit Risk

For a discussion of credit risk, see

“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11 – Derivative Financial Instruments (Credit Risk)

.”

Market Risk

We use a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments.  Value-at-risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level.  We estimate value-at-risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250-day period.  The high, low and average measured value-at-risk during fiscal 2016 and 2015 related to our derivative financial instruments is as follows:

The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level.  We used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths.

Our calculated value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.  It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.  Value-at-risk during fiscal 2016 was higher than fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher volatility in foreign exchange rates.  We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated financial statements.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

We and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders.  The words and phrases “will likely result,” “expect,” “believe,” “planned,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “forecast” or similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements include, our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information systems initiatives, new methods of sale, our long-term strategy, restructuring and other charges and resulting cost savings, and future operations or operating results.  Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, actual results may differ materially from our expectations.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include:

(1) increased competitive activity from companies in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses;

(2) our ability to develop, produce and market new products on which future operating results may depend and to successfully address challenges in our business;

(3) consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and reorganizations in the retail industry causing a decrease in the number of stores that sell our products, an increase in the ownership concentration within the retail industry, ownership of retailers by our competitors or ownership of competitors by our customers that are retailers and our inability to collect receivables;

(4) destocking and tighter working capital management by retailers;

(9) foreign currency fluctuations affecting our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and our operating and manufacturing costs outside of the United States;

(10) changes in global or local conditions, including those due to the volatility in the global credit and equity markets, natural or man-made disasters, real or perceived epidemics, or energy costs, that could affect consumer purchasing, the willingness or ability of consumers to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling, the financial strength of our customers, suppliers or other contract counterparties, our operations, the cost and availability of capital which we may need for new equipment, facilities or acquisitions, the returns that we are able to generate on our pension assets and the resulting impact on funding obligations, the cost and availability of raw materials and the assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates;

(11) shipment delays, commodity pricing, depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from disruptions of operations at any of the facilities that manufacture nearly all of our supply of a particular type of product (i.e. focus factories) or at our distribution or inventory centers, including disruptions that may be caused by the implementation of information technology initiatives, or by restructurings;

(12) real estate rates and availability, which may affect our ability to increase or maintain the number of retail locations at which we sell our products and the costs associated with our other facilities;

(13) changes in product mix to products which are less profitable;

(14) our ability to acquire, develop or implement new information and distribution technologies and initiatives on a timely basis and within our cost estimates and our ability to maintain continuous operations of such systems and the security of data and other information that may be stored in such systems or other systems or media;

(15) our ability to capitalize on opportunities for improved efficiency, such as publicly-announced strategies and restructuring and cost-savings initiatives, and to integrate acquired businesses and realize value therefrom;

(16) consequences attributable to local or international conflicts around the world, as well as from any terrorist action, retaliation and the threat of further action or retaliation;

Controls and Procedures.

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date, due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.

(b)

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change management over certain information technology systems that are relevant to the Company’s financial reporting processes and system of internal control over financial reporting.  As a result, our business process automated and manual controls that are dependent on the affected general information technology controls were also ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.  However, this material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements or restatement of prior-period financial statements, and there were no changes in previously released financial results.

As a result of the material weakness noted above, we completed additional substantive procedures prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 (“Form 10-K”).  Based on these procedures, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Our CEO and CFO have certified that, based on such officer’s knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form 10-K.  In addition, we have developed a remediation plan for this material weakness, which is described below.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the description of the material weakness are included on page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.  The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, which appears on page F-3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(c)

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

Except for the control deficiencies discussed above that have been assessed as a material weakness as of June 30, 2016, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

(d)

Remediation Plan

Management is actively implementing a remediation plan to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated such that these controls will operate effectively.  The remediation actions we are taking, and expect to take, include: (i) improving general information technology program change control activities and policies, including processes to maintain sufficient documentation evidencing execution of these policies; (ii) improving the control activities and procedures associated with user access to certain information technology systems, including proper segregation of duties related to the affected information systems; (iii) educating and re-training control owners regarding internal control processes to mitigate identified risks and maintaining adequate documentation to evidence the effective design and operation of such processes and (iv) implementing enhanced controls to monitor the effectiveness of the underlying business process controls that are dependent on the data and financial reports generated from the relevant information systems.

We believe that these actions, and the improvements we expect to achieve as a result, will effectively remediate the material weakness.  However, the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.  We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed in fiscal 2017.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (including its subsidiaries) (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company’s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  During this assessment, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change management over certain information technology systems that are relevant to the Company’s financial reporting processes and system of internal control over financial reporting.  As a result, our business process automated and manual controls that are dependent on the affected general information technology controls were also ineffective

because they could have been adversely impacted.  These control deficiencies are a result of insufficient awareness of, and training related to, internal control over financial reporting by information technology control owners in connection with a transition to a new information technology service provider.  However, this material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements or restatement of prior-period financial statements, and there were no changes in previously released financial results.  Based on this material weakness, the Company’s management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, which appears on page F-3 below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.:

We have audited The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries’ (“the Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment:

There were ineffective general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change management over certain information technology systems that are relevant to the Company’s financial reporting processes and system of internal control over financial reporting.  As a result, business process automated and manual controls that are dependent on the affected general information technology controls were also ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.  These control deficiencies are a result of insufficient awareness of, and training related to, internal control over financial reporting by information technology control owners in connection with a transition to a new information technology service provider.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2016. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2016 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated August 24, 2016, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion, because of the effect of the aforementioned material weakness on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management’s statements referring to corrective actions taken after June 30, 2016, relative to the aforementioned material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and

subsidiaries (“the Company”) as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2016. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule as listed on the index on page F-1. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated August 24, 2016 expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”).  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

During the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company retrospectively adopted new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) that requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current.  As a result, the Company restated the June 30, 2015 consolidated balance sheet to reclassify $284.9 million related to deferred taxes from Prepaid expenses and other current assets to Other assets, and $5.9 million from Other accrued liabilities to Other noncurrent liabilities.  The Company also retrospectively adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.  As a result, the Company restated the June 30, 2015 balance sheet to reclassify $12.4 million from Other assets to Long-term debt.

Management Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  Certain significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, and income taxes.  Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate.  As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.  Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.

Currency Translation and Transactions

All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange for the period.  Unrealized translation gains (losses) reported as cumulative translation adjustments through other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. amounted to $(108.2) million, $(322.5) million and $95.1 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

For the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary operating in a highly inflationary economy, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.  Remeasurement adjustments in financial statements in a highly inflationary economy and other transactional gains and losses are reflected in earnings.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted changes to the foreign exchange controls that expanded the use of its then-existing exchange mechanisms and created another exchange control mechanism (“SICAD II”), which allowed companies to apply for the purchase of foreign currency and foreign currency denominated securities for any legal use or purpose.  The Company considered its specific facts and circumstances in determining the appropriate remeasurment rate and determined the SICAD II rate was the most appropriate rate that reflected the economics of its Venezuelan subsidiary’s business as of March 24, 2014, when the SICAD II mechanism became operational.  As a result, the Company changed the exchange rate used to remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of its Venezuelan subsidiary from 6.3 to the SICAD II rate, which was 49.

98 as of June 30, 2014.  Accordingly, a remeasurement charge of $38.3 million, on a before and after tax basis, was reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2014.

In February 2015, the Venezuelan government introduced an open market foreign exchange system (“SIMADI”).  As a result, the Company recorded a remeasurement charge of $5.3 million, on a before and after tax basis, for the year ended June 30, 2015.  In March 2016, the Venezuelan government made changes to certain of its foreign currency exchange systems.  As part of these changes, a new free-floating exchange rate mechanism (“DICOM”) replaced the SIMADI foreign exchange system and is the only mechanism legally available for the Company’s highest priority transactions, which are the import of goods.  This change had a de minimis impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of earnings.  The Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary is not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements or liquidity at June 30, 2016.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures.  Accordingly, the Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.

The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange (gains) losses on foreign currency transactions, including the effect of the Venezuela remeasurement charges, of $(15.7) million, $(4.1) million and $46.7 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include $204.5 million and $373.4 million of short-term time deposits at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Investments

The Company’s investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, asset diversification, and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in the Company’s investment policy.  These investments are classified as available-for-sale, with any temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an investment presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”).  See Note 12 – Fair Value Measurements for further information about how the fair values of investments are determined.

Investments in privately-held companies in which the Company has significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  These investments were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 and are included in Long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss positions for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.  Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers.  Factors considered by the Company include, but are not limited to (i) the length of time and extent the security has been in a material loss position; (ii) the financial condition and creditworthiness of the issuer; (iii) future economic conditions and market forecasts related to the issuer’s industry, sector, or geography; (iv) the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value; and (v) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery of market value.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions totaling $24.1 million and $20.6 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  This reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends.

Inventory and Promotional Merchandise

Inventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.  Cost components include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and warehousing) as well as inbound freight.  M

anufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the

normal production capacity

.  Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.

Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company’s customers.  Included in inventory and promotional merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.  This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.  In addition, and as necessary, specific reserves for future known or anticipated events may be established.

THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company’s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value.  All derivatives are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (“fair-value” hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash-flow” hedge), or (iii) not designated as a hedging instrument.  Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge that is highly effective are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments).  Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash-flow hedge of a forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in OCI.  Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).  Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset’s useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.

Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and expensed as incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages.

For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 40 years.  Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.  Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.  Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.

The Company assesses goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.  The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company’s operating segments.  The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components.  The Company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for its reporting units.

When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If necessary, the quantitative

impairment test is performed in two steps: (i) the Company determines if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.  When testing other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company also has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative test.  The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.  If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.

For fiscal 2016 and 2015, the Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for the majority of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.  This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of its reporting units were below carrying value.  The Company considered macroeconomic factors including the global economic growth, general macroeconomic trends for the markets in which the reporting units operate and the intangible assets are employed, and the growth of the global prestige beauty industry.  In addition to these macroeconomic factors, among other things, the Company considered the reporting units’ current results and forecasts, any changes in the nature of the business, any significant legal, regulatory, contractual, political or other business climate factors, changes in the industry/competitive environment, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and its intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use of a trademark.

F-



THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For those reporting units acquired in fiscal 2015, a quantitative assessment was performed.

The Company engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management.  To determine the fair value of the reporting units, the Company used an equal weighting of the income and market approaches.  Under the income approach, we determined fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflected the relative risk of the cash flows.  Under the market approach, we utilized market multiples from publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples.

Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.  If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.  The Company’s sales that are subject to credit risk are made primarily to department stores, perfumeries, specialty multi-brand retailers and retailers in its travel retail business.  The Company grants credit to all qualified customers and does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.

The Company’s largest customer sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for $1,064.5 million, or 9%, $1,060.4 million, or 10%, and $1,142.7 million, or 10%, of the Company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  This customer accounted for $164.0 million, or 13%, and $139.1 million, or 12%, of the Company’s accounts receivable at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.  In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt.  In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at the Company’s retail stores.  The Company records revenues generated from purchase with purchase promotions in Net Sales and costs of its purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions in Cost of Sales.

Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.  The Company’s practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested and approved.  In accepting returns, the Company typically provides a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.  As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 3.1% in fiscal 2016 and 3.4% in fiscal 2015 and 2014.

Payments to Customers

Certain incentive arrangements require the payment of a fee to customers based on their attainment of pre-established sales levels.  These fees have been accrued and recorded as a reduction of Net Sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were not material to the results of operations in any period presented.

The Company enters into transactions related to demonstration, advertising and counter construction, some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers.  These activities may be arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer.  To the extent the Company receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for consideration and the fair-value of the benefit can be reasonably estimated, the Company’s share of the

counter depreciation and the other costs of these transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were approximately $1,387 million, $1,378 million and $1,410 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Advertising and Promotion

Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development were $2,820.7 million, $2,771.5 million and $2,840.0 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are expensed as incurred.  Excluding the impact of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions, costs for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings were $2,607.3 million, $2,558.6 million and $2,618.1 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Research and Development

Research and development costs of $191.3 million, $178.1 million and $157.9 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and are expensed as incurred.

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling expenses of $362.6 million, $363.6 million and $373.6 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses

in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings

and include distribution center costs, third-party logistics costs and outbound freight.

Operating Leases

The Company recognizes rent expense from operating leases with periods of free and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term.  The Company considers lease renewals when such renewals are reasonably assured.  From time to time, the Company may receive capital improvement funding from its lessors.  These amounts are recorded as deferred liabilities and amortized over the remaining lease term as a reduction of rent expense.

License Arrangements

The Company’s license agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using the licensors’ trademarks.  Our current licenses have an initial term of approximately 5 years to 10 years, and are renewable subject to the Company’s compliance with the license agreement provisions.  Most of our license agreements have renewal terms in 5 year increments, with potential renewal periods ranging from approximately 5 years to 25 years.  Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties.

Most of the Company’s licenses were entered into to create new business.  In some cases, the Company acquired, or entered into, a license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a pre-existing beauty products business.  In those cases, other intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives.

Certain license agreements may require minimum royalty payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending on advertising and promotional activities.  Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are recognized while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs are incurred.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company records stock-based compensation, measured at the fair value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest, as an expense in the consolidated financial statements.  Upon the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock units, performance share units, performance share units based on total stockholder return and long-term performance share units, the resulting excess tax benefits, if any, are credited to additional paid-in capital.  Any resulting tax deficiencies will first be offset against those cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital.  If the cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital are exhausted, tax deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its consolidated financial statements or tax returns.  The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.  Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.  If the Company’s assessment of realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.

F-



THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.  The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.  The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.  For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.  For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.

Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.  If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

Debt Issuance Costs

In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs.  Under the revised guidance, entities would no longer be able to recognize debt issuance costs as an asset in the balance sheet.  The amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update.  Upon adoption, the Company applied the new guidance on a retrospective basis and complied with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle, as required.

Adopted date –

The Company adopted this guidance

retrospectively during the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter.

Impact on consolidated financial statements

–

The Company restated the June 30, 2015 balance sheet to reclassify $12.4 million from Other assets to Long-term debt.

Deferred Income Taxes

As part of their simplification initiative to reduce the complexity in accounting standards, in November 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.  Under current guidance, deferred taxes for each jurisdiction are presented on a net current and net noncurrent basis, requiring an in depth analysis by jurisdiction to make the allocation.  The updated guidance simplified the Company’s analysis by eliminating the requirement to allocate between current and noncurrent deferred taxes by jurisdiction.

Adopted date –

The Company adopted this guidance

retrospectively during the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter.

Impact on consolidated financial statements

–

The Company restated the June 30, 2015 consolidated balance sheet to reclassify $284.9 million related to deferred taxes from Prepaid expenses and other current assets to Other assets and $5.9 million from Other accrued liabilities to Other noncurrent liabilities.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

In June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires companies to utilize an impairment model for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other financial instruments, which include trade and other receivables, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, to record an allowance for credit risk based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.  In addition, this new guidance changes the recognition method for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities, which can occur as a result of market and credit risk, as well as additional disclosures.

In general, this guidance will require modified retrospective adoption for all outstanding instruments that fall under this guidance.

Effective date –

This guidance becomes effective for the Company’s fiscal 2021 first quarter

.

Impact on consolidated financial statements

–

The Company is currently evaluating the impact of applying this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

Compensation - Stock Compensation

In March 2016, as part of its simplification initiative, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changes the way companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. This new guidance requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based compensation awards be recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.  In addition, companies are required to treat the tax effects of exercised or vested awards as discrete items in the period that they occur.  This guidance also permits an employer to withhold up to the maximum statutory withholding rates in a jurisdiction without triggering liability classification, allows companies to elect to account for forfeitures as they occur, and provides requirements for the cash flow classification of cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes and for the classification of excess tax benefits.

The new guidance prescribes different transition methods for the various provisions.

Effective date –

This guidance becomes effective for the Company’s fiscal 2018 first quarter, with early adoption permitted

.

Impact on consolidated financial statements

–

The Company is currently evaluating the impact of applying this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheets with the liability being equal to the present value of the lease payments.  The right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability adjusted for certain costs such as direct costs.  Lease expense will be recognized similar to current accounting guidance with operating leases resulting in a straight-line expense, and financing leases resulting in a front-loaded expense similar to the current accounting for capital leases.  This guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements, and provides for certain practical expedients.

This guidance becomes effective for the Company’s fiscal 2020 first quarter, with early adoption permitted

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that defines how companies should report revenues from contracts with customers.  The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  It provides companies with a single comprehensive five-step principles-based model to use in accounting for revenue and supersedes current revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific and transaction-specific revenue guidance.

In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amended the principal versus agent guidance in its new revenue recognition standard.  These amendments do not change the key aspects of the principal versus agent guidance, including the definition that an entity is a principal if it controls the good or service prior to it being transferred to a customer, but the amendments clarify the implementation guidance related to the considerations that must be made during the contract evaluation process.

In April 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amended the new standard to clarify the guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.

In May 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarified certain terms, guidance and disclosure requirements during the transition period related to completed contracts and contract modifications.  In addition, the FASB provided clarification on the concept of collectability, the calculation of the fair value of noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes.

In May 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to reflect the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff’s rescission of their prior comments that covered, among other things, accounting for shipping and handling costs and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer.

Effective date –

In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year.  As a result, the new standard is not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted.  An entity is permitted to apply the foregoing guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented, with certain practical expedients, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment.

Other Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets include trademarks and patents, as well as license agreements and other intangible assets resulting from or related to businesses and assets purchased by the Company.  Indefinite-lived intangible assets (e.g., trademarks) are not subject to amortization and are assessed at least annually for impairment during the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.  Other intangible assets (e.g., non-compete agreements, customer lists) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected period of benefit, approximately 2 years to 20 years.  Intangible assets related to license agreements were amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on the terms of the respective agreements.  The costs incurred and expensed by the Company to extend or renew the term of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2016 and 2015 were not significant to the Company’s results of operations.

NOTE 7 – CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES

Charges associated with restructuring activities in fiscal 2016 were as follows:

Restructuring charges are comprised of the following:

Employee-Related Costs

–

Employee-related costs are primarily comprised of severance and other post-employment benefit costs, calculated based on salary levels, prior service and other statutory minimum benefits, if applicable.  Employee-related costs are expensed when specific employees have been identified and when payment is probable and estimable, which generally occurs upon approval of the related initiative by management with authority delegated from the Company’s Board of Directors.

Asset-Related Costs

– Asset-related costs primarily consist of asset write-offs or accelerated depreciation related to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to their existing useful life as a direct result of a restructuring initiative. The accelerated portion of depreciation expense will be expensed on a straight-line basis and be classified as restructuring charges, while the portion relating to the previous existing useful life will continue to be reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses.

Contract Terminations

– Costs related to contract terminations include continuing payments to a third-party after the Company has ceased benefiting from the rights conveyed in the contract, or a payment made to terminate a contract prior to its expiration.  These may include continuing operating lease payments (less estimated sublease payments) to a landlord after exiting a location prior to the lease-end date as a direct result of an approved restructuring initiative.  Contract terminations also include minimum payments or fees related to the early termination of license or other personal services contracts.  Costs related to contract terminations are expensed upon the cease-use date of a leased property or upon the notification date to the third party in the event of a license or personal service contract termination.

Other Exit Costs

– Other exit costs related to restructuring activities generally include costs to relocate facilities or employees, recruiting to fill positions as a result of relocation of operations, and employee outplacement for separated employees.  Other exit costs are charged to expense as incurred.

Other charges associated with restructuring activities are comprised of the following:

Sales Returns and Cost of Sales

– Product returns (offset by the related cost of sales) and inventory write-offs or write-downs as a direct result of an approved restructuring initiative to exit certain businesses or locations will be recorded as a component of Net Sales and/or Cost of Sales when estimable and reasonably assured.

Other Charges

– The Company approved other charges related to the design and implementation of approved initiatives that primarily include the following:

·

Consulting and other professional services for organizational design of the future structures, processes and technologies, and implementation thereof

·

Temporary labor backfill

·

Costs to establish and maintain a Project Management Office (“PMO”) for the duration of Leading Beauty Forward, including internal costs for employees dedicated solely to project management activities, and other PMO-related expenses incremental to the Company’s ongoing operations (e.g., rent, utilities)

·

Recruitment and training costs for new and reskilled employees to acquire and apply the capabilities needed to perform responsibilities as a direct result of an approved restructuring initiative

Global Technology Infrastructure

In October 2015, officers authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors approved plans to transform and modernize the Company’s global technology infrastructure (“GTI”) to fundamentally change the way it delivers information technology services internally (such initiative, the “GTI Restructuring”).  As part of the GTI Restructuring, the Company transitioned its GTI from Company-owned assets to a primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where it pays for services as they are used.  This model, with a different third-party provider, is expected to provide an enhanced scalable platform to better support current and future requirements, help the Company achieve key strategic opportunities and improve the Company’s agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging more advanced technologies.  The implementation of the GTI Restructuring was substantially completed during fiscal 2016.

The following table presents GTI Restructuring charges and the related activities under this initiative to date:

Accrued GTI Restructuring charges at June 30, 2016 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations in fiscal 2017.

Other charges in connection with the implementation of this initiative were $7.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 and primarily relate to consulting services.  These charges are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

Leading Beauty Forward

On May 3, 2016, the Company announced a multi-year initiative (“Leading Beauty Forward” or “LBF”) to build on its strengths and better leverage its cost structure to free resources for investment to continue its growth momentum.  LBF is designed to enhance the Company’s go-to-market capabilities, reinforce its leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.

The Company plans to approve specific initiatives under LBF through fiscal 2019 and expects to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.  The Company expects that LBF will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million before taxes.

Restructuring actions to be taken over the duration of LBF involve the redesigning, resizing and reorganization of select corporate functions and go-to-market structures to improve effectiveness and create cost-efficiencies in support of increased investment in growth drivers.  As the Company continues to grow, it is important to more efficiently support its diverse portfolio of brands, channels and geographies in the rapidly evolving prestige beauty environment.  The initiatives being evaluated include the creation of a shared-services structure, either through Company-owned or third-party service providers in existing or lower-cost locations.  The Company also believes that decision-making in key areas of innovation, marketing and digital communications should be moved closer to the consumer to increase speed and local relevance.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In connection with LBF, at this time, the Company estimates a net reduction in the range of approximately 900 to 1,200 positions globally, which is about 2.5% of its current workforce. This reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions, retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas.

Specific actions taken since the Program inception included:

·

Optimize Select Corporate Functions

– The Company approved initiatives to realign and optimize its organization to better leverage scale, improve productivity, reduce complexity and achieve cost savings across various functions, including research and development, global information systems and human resources.  These actions will result in a net reduction of the workforce, which includes position eliminations, the re-leveling of certain positions and an investment in new capabilities.  The Company also approved consulting and other professional services related to the design of the future structures, processes and technologies of certain corporate functions including finance, legal, real estate, human resources and global consumer care, as well as the initial organizational design phase of a potential shared-services support structure.  To a lesser extent, also included in the approved other charges are costs to establish a Leading Beauty Forward PMO.

·

Optimize Supply Chain

– An initiative to centralize the Company’s supply chain management, and redesign of supply chain planning and transportation management activities, was approved.  This initiative includes the relocation of certain operations and positions, with some employees being separated and positions replaced in a new location.  Other charges approved are primarily related to consulting fees for design and implementation, temporary labor backfill during the transition and project management costs.

·

Optimize Corporate and Region Market Support Structures

– The Company approved initiatives to enhance its go-to-market support structures and achieve synergies across certain geographic regions, brands and channels.  These initiatives are primarily intended to shift certain areas of focus from traditional to social and digital marketing strategies to provide enhanced consumer experience, as well as to support expanded omnichannel opportunities.  These actions will result in a net reduction of the workforce, which includes position eliminations, the re-leveling of certain positions and an investment in new capabilities.

·

Exit Underperforming Businesses

– To further improve profitability in certain areas of the Company’s brands and regions, the Company approved initiatives to exit certain businesses in select markets and channels of distribution.  The Company has also decided to close a number of underperforming freestanding retail stores and exit mid-tier department stores for certain brands in the United States to redirect resources to other retail locations and channels with potential for greater profitability.  These activities will result in product returns, inventory write-offs, reduction of workforce, accelerated depreciation and termination of contracts.

The following table presents LBF restructuring charges and the related activities under this initiative to date:

Accrued restructuring charges at June 30, 2016 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations of approximately $30 million, $35 million and $8 million in fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

Other charges in connection with the implementation of this initiative were $4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 and primarily relate to consulting services.  These charges are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

NOTE 8 – INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes is comprised of the following:

Earnings before income taxes include amounts contributed by the Company’s foreign operations of approximately $1,448 million, $1,420 million and $1,384 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  A portion of these earnings are taxed in the United States.

A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company’s actual effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes is as follows:

Income tax reserve adjustments represent changes in the Company’s net liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to prior-year tax positions including the impact of tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.

Federal income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $3,548 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2016.  The Company intends to reinvest these earnings in its foreign operations indefinitely, except where it is able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.  The determination and estimation of the future income tax consequences in all relevant taxing jurisdictions involves the application of highly complex tax laws in the countries involved, particularly in the United States, and is based on the tax profile of the Company in the year of earnings repatriation.  Accordingly, it is not practicable to determine the amount of tax associated with such undistributed earnings.

Significant components of the Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $422.3 million and $351.1 million, respectively, substantially all of which are included in Other assets in the accompanying balance sheets.

As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, certain subsidiaries had net operating loss and other carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately $410 million and $430 million, respectively.  With the exception of approximately $390 million of net operating loss and other carryforwards with an indefinite carryforward period as of June 30, 2016, these carryforwards expire at various dates through fiscal 2035.  Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, in the amount of $3.5 million and $4.6 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, have been recorded to reflect the tax benefits of the carryforwards not utilized to date.

A full valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $82.1 million and $77.8 million, respectively.  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $54.8 million.

The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes.  The total gross accrued interest and penalty expenses during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings was $0.1 million and $5.9 million, respectively.  The total gross accrued interest and penalties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $18.4 million and $16.5 million, respectively.

Earnings from the Company’s global operations are subject to tax in various jurisdictions both within and outside the United States.

The Company participates in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”).  The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of income tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company formally concluded the compliance process with respect to fiscal 2015 under the IRS CAP.  The conclusion of this process did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  As of June 30, 2016, the compliance process was ongoing with respect to fiscal year 2016.

The Company is currently undergoing income tax examinations and controversies in several state, local and foreign jurisdictions.  These matters are in various stages of completion and involve complex multi-jurisdictional issues common among multinational enterprises, including transfer pricing, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.

During fiscal 2016, the Company concluded various state, local and foreign income tax audits and examinations while several other matters, including those noted above, were initiated or remained pending.  On the basis of the information available in this regard as of June 30, 2016, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in a range of $10 million to $15 million within 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of global tax examinations and controversies and a potential lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations.

The tax years subject to examination vary depending on the tax jurisdiction.  As of June 30, 2016, the following tax years remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions indicated:

The Company is also subject to income tax examinations in numerous other state, local and foreign jurisdictions.  The Company believes that its tax reserves are adequate for all years subject to examination.

As a result of the treasury lock agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the effective interest rate on the 2021 Senior Notes will be 1.844% over the life of the debt.

The Company has a $1.0 billion commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper in the United States.  At June 30, 2016, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding.  At August 18, 2016, the Company had $290.0 million of commercial paper outstanding, which may be refinanced on a periodic basis as it matures at the then-prevailing market interest rates.

The Company has a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) that is currently set to expire on July 15, 2020.  At June 30, 2016, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility.  The Facility may be used for general corporate purposes and up to the equivalent of $350 million of the Facility is available for multi-currency loans.  The interest rate on borrowings under the Facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or ½% plus the Federal funds rate.

The Company incurred costs of approximately $1.0 million to establish the Facility, which are being amortized over the term of the Facility.  The Facility has an annual fee of $0.6 million, payable quarterly, based on the Company’s current credit ratings.  The Facility also contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $150.0 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under the Facility.

The Company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world.  Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings.  During fiscal 2016 and 2015, the monthly average amount outstanding was approximately $30.5 million and $15.4 million, respectively, and the annualized monthly weighted-average interest rate incurred was approximately 12.5% and 11.3%, respectively.

Refer to Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies for the Company’s projected debt service payments, as of June 30, 2016, over the next five fiscal years.

NOTE 11 – DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company’s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances.  The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.  The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  Costs associated with entering into derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company’s consolidated financial results.

For each derivative contract entered into where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.  This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.  The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedges and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.  If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.

Changes in the fair value of the   interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair   value of the underlying long-term debt.

The amounts of the gains and losses related to the Company’s derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments are presented as follows:

Cash-Flow Hedges

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company’s identified exposures.  The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries.  The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.  The Company may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.  The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of June 2018.  Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.  Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.

The Company enters into interest rate forward contracts to hedge anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the Company’s identified exposures.  The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of interest rate movements on the cost of debt issuance.

The ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and interest rate derivatives is recorded in current-period earnings.  For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.  If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to current-period earnings.  As of June 30, 2016, the Company’s foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective.

At June 30, 2016, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $3,265.2 million.  The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($961.5 million), British pound ($497.0 million), Chinese yuan ($313.3 million), Hong Kong dollar ($273.8 million), Swiss franc ($256.1 million), Australian dollar ($157.2 million) and Taiwan dollar ($129.7 million).

At June 30, 2015, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $2,193.2 million.  The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($418.2 million), British pound ($409.3 million), Chinese yuan ($168.2 million), Swiss franc ($168.1 million), Canadian dollar ($158.4 million), Hong Kong dollar ($137.7 million) and Australian dollar ($123.0 million).

In April and May 2015, in anticipation of the issuance of the 2045 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements, which were designated as cash-flow hedges.  In April 2016, in anticipation of the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a series of treasury lock agreements, which were designated as cash-flow hedges.  See Note 10 – Debt for further discussion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The estimated net gain on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges as of June 30, 2016 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $14.6 million.  The accumulated gain on derivative instruments in AOCI was $50.2 million and $68.4 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Fair-Value Hedges

The Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness. The Company has interest rate swap agreements, with a notional amount totaling $250.0 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its 2022 Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on three-month LIBOR plus a margin.  These interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair-value hedges of the related long-term debt, and the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.

Credit Risk

As a matter of policy, the Company enters into derivative contracts only with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies.  The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.  Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $65.2 million at June 30, 2016.  To manage this risk, the Company has strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.  Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.

NOTE 12 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company records certain of its

financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that require initial measurement or remeasurement at fair value, which principally consist of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations and goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential impairment.  The Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:

Level 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.

Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3: Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.  The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument’s valuation.

The following table presents the Company’s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following table presents the Company’s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2015:

The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:

Cash and cash equivalents –

Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in interest bearing accounts, money market funds and time deposits. The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.

Available-for-sale securities

–

Available-for-sale securities are classified within

Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy and are valued using third-party pricing services,

and for time deposits, the carrying amount approximates fair value

. To determine fair value, the pricing services use market prices or prices derived from other observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors.

Foreign currency forward contracts –

The fair values of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts

were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an income approach.  The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from an independent pricing service.  To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using LIBOR for contracts with maturities up to 12 months, and swap yield curves for contracts with maturities greater than 12 months.

Interest rate swap contracts –

The fair values of the Company’s interest rate swap contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach.  The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and LIBOR forward rates, were obtained from independent pricing services.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Current and long-term debt

– The fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities.  To a lesser extent, debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value.  The Company’s debt is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Additional purchase price payable –

The Company’s additional purchase price payable represents fixed minimum additional purchase price that was discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, which was approximately 1%.  The additional purchase price payable is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Contingent Consideration

– Contingent consideration obligations consist of potential obligations related to our acquisitions. The amounts to be paid under these obligations are contingent upon the achievement of stipulated financial targets by the business subsequent to acquisition. The fair values of the contingent consideration related to certain acquisition earn-outs were estimated using a probability-weighted discount model that considers the achievement of the conditions upon which the respective contingent obligation is dependent (“Monte Carlo Method”).  The Monte Carlo Method has various inputs into the valuation model that include the risk-adjusted projected future operating results of the acquired entity, a risk-adjusted discount rate ranging from 1.1% to 1.6%, a measure of revenue volatility ranging from 4.6% to 13.5%, an asset volatility ranging from 27.6% to 30.0% and a revenue/earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization correlation factor ranging from 80% to 90%.  Significant changes in the projected future operating results would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.  Changes to the discount rate, volatility or correlation factors

would have a lesser effect.

The implied rates are deemed to be unobservable inputs and, as such, the Company’s contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were as follows:

NOTE 13 – PENSION, DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Company maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international operations.  Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees’ earnings.  In certain instances, the Company adjusts benefits in connection with international employee transfers.

Retirement Growth Account Plan (U.S.)

The Retirement Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan.  The Company seeks to maintain appropriate funded percentages.  For contributions, the Company would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), as amended, and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.

Restoration Plan (U.S.)

The Company also has an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.

International Pension Plans

The Company maintains international pension plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit pension plans.  The Company’s funding policies for these plans are determined by local laws and regulations.  The Company’s most significant defined benefit pension obligations are included in the plan summaries below.

Post-retirement Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a domestic post-retirement benefit plan which provides certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees.  Employees hired after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for retiree medical benefits when they retire.  Certain retired employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are eligible for participation in the plan.  Contributions required and benefits received by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on the age of the retiree.  It is the Company’s practice to fund these benefits as incurred and to provide discretionary funding for the future liability up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.

Certain of the Company’s international subsidiaries and affiliates have post-retirement plans, although most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs.

THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.  The discount rate for the Company’s Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.  The Company used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of the Company’s Domestic Plans.  For the Company’s international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.  In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.  The assumed weighted-average health care cost trend rate for the coming year is 7.67% while the weighted-average ultimate trend rate of 4.53% is expected to be reached in approximately 21 years.  A 100 basis-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2016 would have had the following effects:

Plan Assets

The Company’s investment strategy for its pension and post-retirement plan assets is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset classes with the primary goal of meeting long-term cash requirements as they become due.  Assets are primarily invested in diversified funds that hold equity or debt securities to maintain the security of the funds while maximizing the returns within each plan’s investment policy.  The investment policy for each plan specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for selection of investment managers, procedures to monitor overall investment performance, as well as investment manager performance.

The Company’s target asset allocation at June 30, 2016 is as follows:

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for plan assets measured at fair value:

Cash and Cash Equivalents –

Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash and time deposits. The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.

Short-term investment funds –

The fair values are determined using the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) provided by the administrator of the fund.  These assets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy and the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption restrictions.

Government and agency securities –

The fair values are determined using third-party pricing services using market prices or prices derived from observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors.  These investments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Debt instruments –

The fair values are determined using third-party pricing services using market prices or prices derived from observable market inputs such as credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, benchmark curves and other industry and economic factors.  These investments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Equity securities –

The fair values are determined using the closing price reported on a major market where the individual securities are traded.  These investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Commingled funds –

The fair values of publicly traded funds are based upon market quotes and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.  The fair values for non-publicly traded funds are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund.  Those investments where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  When the Company is unable to redeem in the near term, these investments are classified within Level 3.

Insurance contracts –

The fair values are based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the creditworthiness of the issuer.  The underlying investments are primarily government, asset-backed and fixed income securities.  Insurance contracts are generally classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices or other observable inputs for pricing.

Interests in limited partnerships and hedge fund investments

– The fair values are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator of the partnership/fund.  Those investments where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption restrictions are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. When the Company is unable to redeem in the near term, these investments are classified within Level 3.

401(k) Savings Plan (U.S.)

The Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”) is a contributory defined contribution plan covering substantially all regular U.S. employees who have completed the hours and service requirements, as defined by the plan document.  Regular full-time employees are eligible to participate in the Savings Plan thirty days following their date of hire.  The Savings Plan is subject to the applicable provisions of ERISA.  The Company matches a portion of the participant’s contributions after one year of service under a predetermined formula based on the participant’s contribution level.  The Company’s contributions were $37.4 million, $35.1 million and $33.3 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are not an investment option in the Savings Plan and the Company does not use such shares to match participants’ contributions.

Deferred Compensation

The Company accrues for deferred compensation and interest thereon, and for the change in the value of cash units pursuant to agreements with certain key executives and outside directors.  The amounts included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under these plans were $70.5 million and $74.7 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The expense for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $6.3 million, $8.6 million and $10.6 million, respectively.

NOTE 14 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of June 30, 2016:

(1)

Includes long-term and current debt and the related projected interest costs, and to a lesser extent, capital lease commitments.  Interest costs on long-term and current debt are projected to be $88.6 million in fiscal 2017, $72.0 million in each of the years from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2021 and $1,111.9 million thereafter.  Projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at June 30, 2016.  Refer to Note 10 – Debt.

(2)

Minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent.  Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, as well as common area maintenance.  These amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable.  Such amounts have not been material to total rent expense.  Total rental expense included in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings was $441.8 million, $402.2 million and $356.1 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(3)

Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include: inventory commitments, additional purchase price payable and contingent consideration which resulted from the fiscal 2016 and 2015 acquisitions, earn-out payments related to the acquisition of Bobbi Brown, royalty payments pursuant to license agreements, advertising commitments, capital improvement commitments, non-discretionary planned funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations and commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements.  Future contingent consideration, earn-out payments and royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at June 30, 2016, without consideration for potential renewal periods.

(4)

Refer to Note 8 – Income Taxes for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.  As of June 30, 2016, the noncurrent portion of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties was $96.6 million.  At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties, cannot be determined and therefore was not included.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to its business.  Management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  However, management’s assessment of the Company’s current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company, not presently known to the Company or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings.  Reasonably possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for litigation and other legal proceedings are not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 15 – COMMON STOCK

As of June 30, 2016, the Company’s authorized common stock consists of 1,300 million shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, and 304 million shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share.  Class B Common Stock is convertible into Class A Common Stock, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time at the option of the holder, on the basis of one share of Class A Common Stock for each share of Class B Common Stock converted.  Holders of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of the Company’s Class B Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share.

Information about the Company’s common stock outstanding is as follows:

The Company is authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 216.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors.  As of June 30, 2016, the cumulative total of acquired shares pursuant to the authorization was 197.5 million, reducing the remaining authorized share repurchase balance to 18.5 million.  Subsequent to June 30, 2016 and as of August 18, 2016, the Company purchased approximately 2.2 million additional shares of its Class A Common Stock for $200.0 million pursuant to its share repurchase program.

NOTE 16 – STOCK PROGRAMS

As of June 30, 2016, the Company has two active equity compensation plans which include the Amended and Restated Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan (the “Fiscal 2002 Plan”) and the Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Share Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Plans”).  These Plans currently provide for the issuance of 76,806,200 shares of Class A Common Stock, which consist of shares originally provided for and shares transferred to the Fiscal 2002 Plan from other inactive plans and employment agreements, to be granted in the form of stock-based awards to key employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company.  As of June 30, 2016, approximately 17,121,800 shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved and available to be granted pursuant to these Plans.  The Company may satisfy the obligation of its stock-based compensation awards with either new or treasury shares.  The Company’s equity compensation awards include stock options, performance share units (“PSU”), restricted stock units (“RSU”), PSUs based on total stockholder return, long-term PSUs and share units.

Total net stock-based compensation expense is attributable to the granting of, and the remaining requisite service periods of stock options, RSUs, PSUs, PSUs based on total stockholder return, long-term PSUs and share units.  Compensation expense attributable to net stock-based compensation is as follows:

As of June 30, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards was $143.5 million and the related weighted-average period over which it is expected to be recognized is approximately two years.

Stock Options

The following is a summary of the Company’s stock option programs as of June 30, 2016 and changes during the fiscal year then ended:

(1)

The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.

The exercise period for all stock options generally may not exceed ten years from the date of grant.  Stock option grants to individuals generally become exercisable in three substantively equal tranches over a service period of up to four years.  The Company attributes the value of option awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards.

The following is a summary of the per-share weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted and total intrinsic value of stock options exercised:

F-



THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

The Company uses a weighted-average expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock.  The implied volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources.  For the weighted-average expected option life assumption, the Company considers the exercise behavior for past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises.  The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rate for the expected term of the options and the average dividend yield is based on historical experience.

Restricted Stock Units

The Company granted approximately 1,610,300 RSUs during fiscal 2016 which, at the time of grant, were scheduled to vest as follows: 546,000 in fiscal 2017, 566,800 in fiscal 2018 and 497,500 in fiscal 2019.  All RSUs are subject to the continued employment or retirement of the grantees.  Beginning in fiscal 2015, the RSUs granted are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights, payable upon settlement of the RSU either in cash or shares (based on the terms of the particular award) upon settlement of the RSU and, as such, were valued at the closing market price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.

The following is a summary of the status of the Company’s RSUs as of June 30, 2016 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:

Performance Share Units

During fiscal 2016, the Company granted approximately 277,400 PSUs, which will be settled in stock subject to the achievement of the Company’s net sales, diluted net earnings per common share and return on invested capital goals for the three fiscal years ending June 30, 2018, all subject to the continued employment or retirement of the grantees.  Settlement will be made pursuant to a range of opportunities relative to the net sales, diluted net earnings per common share and return on invested capital targets of the Company and, as such, the compensation cost of the PSU is subject to adjustment based upon the attainability of these target goals.  No settlement will occur for results below the applicable minimum threshold of a target and additional shares shall be issued if performance exceeds the targeted performance goals.  PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of the PSU and, as such, were valued at the closing market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.  These awards are subject to the provisions of the agreement under which the PSUs are granted.  The PSUs generally vest at the end of the performance period.  Approximately 274,300 shares of Class A Common Stock are anticipated to be issued, relative to the target goals set at the time of issuance, in settlement of the 284,100 PSUs that vested as of June 30, 2016.  In September 2015, approximately 276,200 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock were issued and related accrued dividends were paid, relative to the target goals set at the time of issuance, in settlement of 249,900 PSUs which vested as of June 30, 2015.

THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following is a summary of the status of the Company’s PSUs as of June 30, 2016 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:

Performance Share Units Based on Total Stockholder Return

During fiscal 2013, the Company granted PSUs to an executive of the Company with an aggregate target payout of 162,760 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, subject to continued employment through the end of the relative performance periods.  The first two performance periods ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2016, and the remaining performance period ends June 30, 2017.  The remaining PSUs will be settled based upon the Company’s relative total stockholder return (“TSR”) over the relevant performance period as compared to companies in the S&P 500 on July 1, 2012.  No settlement will occur on the remaining PSUs if the Company’s TSR falls below a minimum threshold, and up to an aggregate of 86,806 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock will be issued depending on the extent to which the Company’s TSR equals or exceeds the minimum threshold.  The remaining PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement.

The grant date fair value of the PSUs of $11.0 million was estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions for each performance period, respectively: contractual life of 33, 45 and 57 months, average risk-free interest rate of 0.3%, 0.5% and 0.7% and a dividend yield of 1.0%.  Using the historical stock prices and dividends from public sources, the Company estimated the covariance structure of the returns on S&P 500 stocks.  The volatility for the Company’s stock produced by this estimation was 32%.  The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rates over the contractual term of the grant, and the dividend yield is based on historical experience.  In September 2015, 42,549 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock were issued and related dividends were paid, in accordance with the terms of the grant, related to the performance period ended June 30, 2015.  In September 2016, an additional 49,882 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are anticipated to be issued, and related dividends to be paid, in accordance with the terms of the grant, related to the performance period ended June 30, 2016.  The remaining PSUs have an aggregate target payout of 54,254 shares as of June 30, 2016.

Long-term Performance Share Units

During September 2015, the Company granted PSUs to an executive of the Company with an aggregate target payout of 387,848 shares (in three tranches of approximately 129,283 each) of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, generally subject to continued employment through the end of relative performance periods, which end June 30, 2018, 2019 and 2020.  Since the Company achieved positive Net Earnings, as defined in the PSU award agreement, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, performance and vesting of each tranche will be based on the Company achieving positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the PSU award agreement, during the relative performance period.  Payment with respect to a tranche will be made on the third anniversary of the last day of the respective performance period.  The PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash at the same time as the payment of shares of Class A Common Stock.  The grant date fair value of these PSUs of $30.0 million was estimated using the closing stock price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as of September 4, 2015, the date of grant.

During January 2016, the Company granted PSUs to an executive of the Company with an aggregate target payout of 71,694 shares (in three tranches of 23,898 each) of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, generally subject to continued employment through the end of relative service periods that end on January 29, 2018, 2019 and 2020.  No portion of the award will generally vest unless the Company has achieved positive Net Earnings, as defined in the PSU award agreement, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.  Payment with respect to a tranche will be made within 30 business days of the date on which the PSUs vest.  The PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash at the same time as the payment of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock.  The grant date fair value of these PSUs of $6.0 million was estimated using the closing stock price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as of January 28, 2016, the date of grant.

Share Units

The Company grants share units to certain non-employee directors under the Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Share Incentive Plan.  The share units are convertible into shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as provided for in that plan.  Share units are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that are converted to additional share units when such dividends are declared.

The following is a summary of the status of the Company’s share units as of June 30, 2016 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:

Cash Units

Certain non-employee directors defer cash compensation in the form of cash payout share units, which are not subject to the Plans.  These share units are classified as liabilities and, as such, their fair value is adjusted to reflect the current market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock.  The Company recorded $1.7 million, $3.4 million and $2.4 million as compensation expense to reflect additional deferrals and the change in the market value for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

NOTE 17 – NET

EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

ESTÉE

LAUDER COMPANIES INC. PER COMMON SHARE

Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. per common share (“basic EPS”) is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain conditions).  Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. per common share assuming dilution (“diluted EPS”) is computed by reflecting potential dilution from stock-based awards.

A reconciliation between the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:

As of June 30, 2016, there were 0.2 million stock options excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  As of June 30, 2015, there were no anti-dilutive stock options to be excluded from the computation of diluted EPS.  As of June 30, 2014, there were 0.1 million anti-dilutive stock options excluded from the computation of diluted EPS.  As of June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 0.5 million, 0.6 million and 0.5 million, respectively, of PSUs have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on the achievement of certain performance targets of the Company, as discussed in Note 16 – Stock Programs.

NOTE 19 – STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

Supplemental cash flow information is as follows:

NOTE 20 – SEGMENT DATA AND RELATED INFORMATION

Reportable operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the “Chief Executive”) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company’s products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive.  Although the Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis.

While the Company’s results of operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics.  Accordingly, net sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating income are available with respect to the manufacture and distribution of skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and other products.  These product categories meet the definition of operating segments and, accordingly, additional financial data are provided below.  The “other” segment includes the sales and related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit the definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care.

Product category performance is measured based upon net sales before returns associated with restructuring activities, and earnings before income taxes, other income, interest expense, interest income and investment income, net, and charges associated with restructuring activities.  Returns and charges associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to the product categories because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures, and to transform and modernize the Company’s GTI.  The accounting policies for the Company’s reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales.  The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein.
