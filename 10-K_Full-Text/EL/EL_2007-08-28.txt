Forward-Looking
Statements and Risk Factors

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K includes “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such statements include, without limitation,
our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial
performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new geographic
regions, information systems initiatives, new methods of sale and future
operations or operating results. 
Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable
assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations,
we cannot assure that actual results will not differ materially from our
expectations.  Factors that could cause
actual results to differ from expectations are described herein; in particular,
see “Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward-Looking
Information.”  In addition, there is a
discussion of risks associated with an investment in our securities.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

PART I

Item 1.

Business.

The Estée Lauder
Companies Inc., founded in 1946 by Estée and Joseph Lauder, is one of the world’s
leading manufacturers and marketers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance and
hair care products.  Our products are
sold in over 135 countries and territories under the following well-recognized
brand names: Estée Lauder, Aramis, Clinique, Prescriptives, Lab Series,
Origins, M

ž

A

ž

C,
Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone, Bumble and bumble, Darphin, American
Beauty, Flirt!, Good Skin™ and Grassroots. 
We are also the global licensee for fragrances and cosmetics sold under
the Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan, Michael Kors, Sean John, Missoni, Daisy
Fuentes and Tom Ford brand names.  Each
brand is distinctly positioned within the market for beauty products.

We are a pioneer in the
cosmetics industry and believe we are a leader in the industry due to the
global recognition of our brand names, our leadership in product innovation,
our strong market position in key geographic markets and the consistently high
quality of our products.  We sell our
prestige products principally through limited distribution channels to
complement the images associated with our brands.  These channels, encompassing over 20,000
points of sale, consist primarily of upscale department stores, specialty
retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and
spas.  In addition, our products are sold
in freestanding company-owned stores and spas, our own and authorized retailer
websites, stores on cruise ships, television direct marketing, in-flight and
duty-free shops and certain fragrances are sold in self-select outlets.  We believe that our strategy of pursuing
limited distribution strengthens our relationships with retailers, enables our
brands to be among the best selling product lines at the stores and heightens
the aspirational quality of our brands.

We sell American Beauty,
Flirt!, Good Skin™, Grassroots and fragrances by Daisy Fuentes at Kohl’s
Department Stores in the United States. 
In fiscal 2006, we signed an exclusive agreement to create fragrances
and related products to be sold to Coach, Inc., the first fragrance of which
became available in Spring 2007 at Coach retail stores in the United
States.  In July 2007, we acquired Ojon
Corporation, which markets and sells Ojon hair care and skin care products
primarily through direct response television and specialty stores.

In April 2006, we
completed the sale of certain assets and operations of our reporting unit that
marketed and sold Stila brand products, which was originally acquired in August
1999.  As of June 30, 2007, we terminated
the Gloss.com joint venture in which we formerly owned a controlling majority
interest.

We have been controlled
by the Lauder family since the founding of our company.  Members of the Lauder family, some of whom
are directors, executive officers and/or employees, beneficially own, directly
or indirectly, as of August 17, 2007, shares of Class A Common Stock and Class
B Common Stock having approximately 89.1% of the outstanding voting power of
the Common Stock.

Unless the context
requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries.

Products

Skin Care

- - Our broad range of skin care products addresses various skin care needs for
women and men.  These products include
moisturizers, creams, lotions, cleansers, sun screens and self-tanning
products, a number of which are developed for use on particular areas of the
body, such as the face or the hands or around the eyes.  Skin care products accounted for
approximately 37% of our net sales in fiscal 2007.

Makeup

- - We manufacture, market and sell a full array of makeup products, including
lipsticks, lip glosses, mascaras, foundations, eyeshadows, nail polishes and
powders.  Many of the products are

- - Hair care products are offered mainly in salons and in freestanding retail
stores and include hair color and styling products, shampoos, conditioners and
finishing sprays.  In fiscal 2007, hair
care products accounted for approximately 5% of our net sales.

Given the personal nature
of our products and the wide array of consumer preferences and tastes, as well
as competition for the attention of consumers, our strategy has been to market
and promote our products through distinctive brands seeking to address broad
preferences and tastes.  Each brand has a
single global image that is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and
advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other
brands.

Estée
Lauder

- Estée Lauder brand products, which have been sold
since 1946, are positioned as luxurious, classic and aspirational.  We believe that Estée Lauder brand products
are technologically advanced and innovative and have a worldwide reputation for
excellence.  The broad product line
principally consists of skin care, makeup and fragrance products that are
presented in high quality packaging.

Aramis and Designer Fragrances

- - Our Aramis and Designer Fragrances division creates and markets fragrance and
skin care products, including the following brand names:

pioneered the marketing of prestige men’s fragrance, grooming and skin care
products with the introduction of Aramis products in 1964.

division in 1987, offers a full range of products for cleansing, shaving,

men’s skin.

Tommy Hilfiger

of men’s and women’s fragrances and cosmetics under the Tommy Hilfiger brand
name.  We launched the line in 1995 with
a men’s fragrance,

tommy

.  Today, we manufacture and sell a variety of
fragrances and ancillary products for men and women.

·

Donna Karan Cosmetics

-

In November 1997, we obtained the exclusive global license
to develop, market and distribute a line of fragrances and other cosmetics
under the Donna Karan New York and DKNY brand names, including certain products
that were originally sold by The Donna Karan Company.  We launched the first DKNY women’s fragrance
in fiscal 2000 and the first DKNY men’s fragrance in fiscal 2001.  Under this license, fragrances have been
expanded to include extensive lines of companion bath and body products.

·

Michael Kors

-
In May 2003, we entered into a license agreement for fragrances and beauty
products under the Michael Kors brand name and purchased certain related rights
and inventory from another party.  The
fragrances, as well as ancillary bath and body products, are sold in department
stores, specialty stores, at freestanding Michael Kors boutiques and over the
Internet.

·

Sean John Fragrances

- - In 2005, we entered into an exclusive license agreement to develop fragrances
and other beauty products under the Sean John brand name.  Sean “Diddy” Combs played an active role in
creating the signature scent, “Unforgivable.” 
The Unforgivable fragrance and ancillary products are primarily
available at select department and specialty stores as well as travel retail
outlets around the world.

·

Missoni

- In 2006, we launched fragrance and ancillary
products under our exclusive global licensing agreement with Milan-based
fashion house, Missoni.  Missoni products
are sold in select distribution channels worldwide.

In addition to the
foregoing brands, we manufacture and sell Kiton and Toni Gard products as a
licensee.  During fiscal 2007, we entered
into a license agreement with Ford Motor Company to manufacture and sell a
fragrance using the name Mustang.

Clinique

- - First introduced in 1968, Clinique skin care and makeup products are all
allergy tested and 100% fragrance free and have been designed to address
individual skin types and needs.  The
products are based on the research and related expertise of leading
dermatologists.  Clinique skin care products
are generally marketed as part of the 3-Step System: Cleanse, Exfoliate,
Moisturize.  Clinique also offers
fragrances and a line of hair care products.

Prescriptives

- - We developed and introduced Prescriptives in 1979.  Prescriptives is positioned as a color
authority with an advanced collection of highly individualized products
primarily addressing the makeup and skin care needs of contemporary women with
active lifestyles.  The products are
characterized by simple concepts, minimalist design and an innovative image
and, through a system of color application and extensive range of makeup
shades, accommodate a diverse group of consumers.


Origins

- - Origins was introduced in 1990.  It is
positioned as a plant-based line of skin care, makeup and aromatherapy products
that combine time-tested botanical ingredients with modern science to promote
total well-being.  Origins sells its
products at our freestanding Origins stores and through stores-within-stores
(which are designed to replicate the Origins store environment within a
department store), at traditional retail counters, in perfumeries and directly
to consumers over the Internet.  Origins
also has a license agreement to develop and sell products using the name of Dr.
Andrew Weil.

professional makeup tools targeting makeup artists and fashion-conscious
consumers.  The products are sold through

stores and directly to consumers over the Internet.  We acquired the companies behind M

ž

A

ž

in three stages: in December 1994, March 1997 and February 1998.

Bobbi
Brown

- In October 1995, we acquired the Bobbi Brown line of
color cosmetics, professional makeup brushes and skin care products.  Bobbi Brown products are manufactured to our
specifications, primarily by third parties, and sold through a limited number
of department and specialty stores and directly to consumers over the Internet.

La Mer

- - La Mer products primarily consist of moisturizing creams, lotions, cleansers,
toners and other skin care products.  The
line, which is available in very limited distribution in the United States and
certain other countries, is an extension of the initial Crème de la Mer product
that we acquired in 1995.

Aveda

- - We acquired the Aveda business in December 1997 and have since acquired
selected Aveda distributors and retail stores. 
Aveda, a prestige hair care leader, is a manufacturer and marketer of
plant-based hair care, skin care, makeup and fragrance products.  We sell Aveda products to third-party
distributors and prestige salons and spas, cosmetology schools, certain
non-U.S. department stores and specialty retailers and directly to consumers at
our own freestanding Aveda Experience Centers and certain Aveda Institutes.

Jo Malone

- - We acquired London-based Jo Malone Limited in October 1999.  Jo Malone is known for its prestige skin
care, fragrance and hair care products showcased at its flagship store in
London.  Products are also available
through a company catalogue, at freestanding stores and at a very limited group
of specialty stores, primarily in the United States, Canada and the United
Kingdom.

Bumble

- In June 2000, we acquired a controlling majority
equity interest in Bumble and Bumble Products, LLC, a marketer and distributor
of quality hair care products, and Bumble and Bumble, LLC, the operator of a
premier hair salon in New York City (collectively “Bumble and bumble”).  Bumble and bumble styling and other hair care
products are distributed to top-tier salons and select specialty stores.  In fiscal 2004, we opened a second
wholly-owned salon and a training and education center.  In fiscal 2007, we acquired the remaining
equity interest in Bumble and bumble.

Distribution

We sell our products
principally through limited distribution channels to complement the images
associated with our brands.  These
channels include more than 20,000 points of sale in over 135 countries and
territories and consist primarily of upscale department stores, specialty
retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and
spas.  In addition, our products are sold
in freestanding company-owned stores and spas, our own and authorized retailer
websites, stores on cruise ships, television direct marketing, in-flight and
duty-free shops and certain fragrances are sold in self-select outlets.

We maintain a dedicated
sales force which sells to our retail accounts in North America and in the
major overseas markets, such as Western Europe and Japan.  We have wholly-owned operations in over 35
countries, and controlling interests in joint ventures that operate in four
other countries, through which we market, sell and distribute our products.  In certain countries, we sell our products through
selected local distributors under contractual arrangements designed to protect
the image and position of the brands.  In
addition, we sell certain products in select domestic and international
military locations.  For information regarding our net sales and
long-lived assets by geographic region, see Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.  Our net sales in the United States in fiscal
2007, 2006 and 2005 were $3,224.5 million, $3,141.4 million and $3,094.5
million, respectively.  Our long-lived
assets in the United States at June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $520.1
million, $452.7 million and $425.5 million, respectively.

We sell Aveda products
principally to independent salons and spas, cosmetology schools, third-party
distributors and specialty retailers and directly to consumers at our own
freestanding Aveda Experience Centers and certain Aveda Institutes.  There are currently about 7,200 points of
sale, primarily in the United States, that sell Aveda products.  Bumble and bumble products are principally
sold to more than 2,500 independent salons, primarily in the United
States.  Darphin products are principally
sold through high-end independent pharmacies, principally in Europe,
representing approximately 3,700 points of sale.

As part of our strategy
to diversify our distribution, we have been selectively expanding the number of
single-brand, freestanding stores that we operate.  The Origins, Aveda and M

ž

A

ž

C
brands are the primary focus for this method of distribution.  At this time, we operate 505 single-brand,
freestanding stores worldwide, the majority of which are in the United States,
and expect that number to increase moderately over the next several years.  We also operate 86 multi-brand stores.

We sell American Beauty,
Flirt!, Good Skin™, Grassroots and Dianoche, by Daisy Fuentes in approximately
800 Kohl’s Department Stores in the United States.

We sell some of our
products directly to consumers over the Internet through our own websites:
Estée Lauder, Clinique, Lab Series, Prescriptives, Origins, M

ž

A

ž

C,
Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone and Darphin.

As is customary in the
cosmetics industry, our practice is to accept returns of our products from
retailers if properly requested, authorized and approved.  In accepting returns, we typically provide a
credit to the retailer against sales and accounts receivable from that retailer
on a dollar-for-dollar basis.  In
recognition of this practice, and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, we report revenues on a net sales basis, which reflects the
amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated
returns.  As a percentage of gross sales,
returns were 4.2%, 5.0% and 4.6% in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Customers

Our strategy is to build
strong strategic relationships with selected retailers globally.  Senior management works with executives of
our major retail accounts on a regular basis and we believe we are viewed as an
important supplier to these customers. 
During fiscal 2006, Federated Department Stores, Inc. acquired The May
Department Stores Company, resulting in the merger of our previous two largest
customers (collectively “Macy’s, Inc.”). 
As of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, Macy’s,
Inc. accounted for 12% and 14%, respectively, of our accounts receivable and
14% and 16%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.  In fiscal 2005, no single customer accounted
for more than 10% of consolidated net sales.

Marketing

Our marketing strategy is
built around our vision statement: “Bringing the Best to Everyone We Touch.”  Mrs. Estée Lauder formulated this marketing
philosophy to provide high-quality service and products as the foundation for a
solid and loyal consumer base.


Our marketing efforts
focus principally on promoting the quality and benefits of our products.  Each of our brands is distinctively
positioned, has a single global image, and is promoted with consistent logos,
packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it
from other brands.  We regularly
advertise our products on television and radio, in upscale magazines and
newspapers and through direct mail and photo displays at international
airports.  In addition, our products
receive extensive editorial coverage in prestige publications and other media
worldwide.  Promotional activities and
in-store displays are designed to introduce existing consumers to different
products in the line and to attract new consumers.  Our marketing efforts also benefit from
cooperative advertising programs with retailers, some of which are supported by
coordinated promotions, such as purchase with purchase and gift with
purchase.  Our marketing and sales
executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers and key
retailers and consulting with sales representatives at the points of sale.  These include Estée Lauder Beauty Advisors,
Clinique Consultants, Aramis Selling Specialists, Prescriptives Analysts,
Origins Guides and M

ž

A

ž

C
Makeup Artists.  At in-store counters,
sales representatives offer personal demonstrations to market individual
products as well as to provide education on basic skin care and makeup
application.  We conduct extensive
sampling programs and we pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling
program.  We believe that the quality and
perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to
purchases by new and existing consumers.

Starting with the launch
of the Clinique website in 1996, we have used the Internet to educate and
inform consumers about certain of our brands. 
Currently, we have sixteen single-brand marketing sites, eleven of which
have e-commerce capabilities.

Most of our creative marketing
work is done by in-house creative teams. 
The creative staff designs and produces the sales materials,
advertisements and packaging for all products in each brand.

Global net advertising,
merchandising, sampling and promotional expenditures were $1,916.3 million,
$1,793.1 million and $1,793.7 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  These amounts include
revenues and expenses relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase
promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales.

Information Systems

Information systems
support business processes including product development, marketing, sales,
order processing, production, distribution and finance.  Of the many systems currently being utilized,
the most significant to our business needs are: (i) a centralized data
repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer, or plan
to offer, which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of
consistent quality; (ii) a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the
stock keeping unit (SKU) level at most significant retail sales locations
(i.e., sell-through data), increasing our understanding of consumer preferences
and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development,
manufacturing and marketing strategies; (iii) an automated replenishment system
with many of our key domestic customers, allowing us to replenish inventories
for individual points of sale automatically, with minimal paperwork; and (iv)
an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished
goods availability relative to actual requirements, facilitating inventory
control and distribution for both existing product lines and new product
launches.

We expect that these
systems will continue to provide pertinent inventory and sales data in the
short term.  However, as part of our
long-term effort to enhance these systems and increase productivity, we are
implementing our Strategic Modernization Initiative (“SMI”), which includes an
enterprise-wide global program that we expect will deliver a single set of
integrated data, processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used
to standardize business processes across brands, operating units and sales
affiliates.  The initial implementation
of SMI at our Aveda operating unit occurred in May 2007 and we believe it is
operating effectively.  We anticipate SMI
implementation will continue at additional locations in fiscal 2008, with the
majority of our locations to be implemented through fiscal 2010.

Research and Development

We believe that we are an
industry leader in the development of new products.  Marketing, product
development and packaging groups work with our research and development group
to identify shifts in consumer preferences, develop new products and improve,
redesign or reformulate existing products.  In addition, research and
development personnel work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing
personnel on a worldwide basis to provide ongoing technical assistance and
know-how, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver
products with attributes that fulfill consumer expectations.  The research and development group has
long-standing working relationships with several U.S. and international medical
and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities. 
Members of the group are also responsible for regulatory compliance matters.

We do not conduct animal
testing on our products or ingredients, nor ask others to test on our behalf,
except when required by law.  We evaluate
our finished products in clinical tests on volunteer panels.

We maintain ongoing
research and development programs at our facilities in Melville, New York;
Oevel, Belgium; Petersfield, U.K.; Tokyo, Japan; Markham, Ontario; Blaine, Minnesota;
Shanghai, China; and Colombes, France.  As of June 30, 2007, we had
approximately 450 employees engaged in research and development.  Research
and development expenditures, which are included in advertising, merchandising
and sampling expenditures, totaled $74.4 million, $72.0 million and $72.3
million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.


Manufacturing, Warehousing and
Raw Materials

We manufacture skin care,
makeup, fragrance and hair care products in the United States, Belgium,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Canada and France.  We continue to streamline our manufacturing
processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase
efficiencies and reduce costs.  Our major
manufacturing facilities operate as “focus” plants that primarily manufacture
one type of product (e.g., lipsticks) for all of the principal brands.  Our plants are modern and our manufacturing
processes are substantially automated. 
While we believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to meet
current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to
identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity and
productivity.  To capitalize on
innovation and other supply benefits, we continue to utilize third parties on a
global basis for finished goods production, including an increased volume in
Asia/Pacific to support our international growth.

We have established a
global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our
customers while maintaining service levels. 
We are continuously evaluating and restructuring this physical
distribution network.  We have begun to
establish regional inventory centers strategically positioned throughout the
world in order to facilitate timely delivery of our products to our customers.

The principal raw
materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohol
and specialty chemicals.  We also
purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design
specifications.  Procurement of materials
for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through
our Global Supplier Relations department. 
In recent years, we made a concentrated effort in supplier
rationalization with the specific objective of reducing costs, increasing
innovation and improving quality.  In
addition, we continue to focus on supply sourcing within the region of
manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies.  As a result of sourcing initiatives, there is
increased dependency on certain suppliers, but we believe that these suppliers
have adequate resources and facilities to overcome any unforeseen interruption
of supply.  We are continually
benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will add or delete
suppliers based upon the changing needs of the business.  In the past, we have been able to obtain an
adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have
adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.  As we integrate acquired brands, we continually
seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve
manufacturing performance.

Competition

The skin care, makeup,
fragrance and hair care businesses are characterized by vigorous competition
throughout the world.  Brand recognition,
quality, performance and price have a significant influence on consumers’
choices among competing products and brands. 
Advertising, promotion, merchandising, the pace and timing of new
product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store sales staff
also have a significant impact on consumers’ buying decisions.  We compete against a number of manufacturers
and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, some of
which have substantially greater resources than we do.

of the products sold under these brands. 
We own the material trademark rights used in connection with the
manufacturing, marketing and distribution of most of our major products both in
the United States and in the other principal countries where such products are
sold.  We are the exclusive worldwide
licensee for fragrances, cosmetics and related products for Tommy Hilfiger, Donna
Karan, DKNY, Kiton, Michael Kors, Sean John, Missoni, Daisy Fuentes and Tom
Ford.  Origins sells products using the
name of Dr. Andrew Weil and Aramis and Designer Fragrances sells a fragrance in
the Americas region using the name Mustang, in each case pursuant to a license
agreement.  We protect our trademarks for
our principal products in the United States and significant markets
worldwide.  We consider the protection of
our trademarks to be important to our business.

A number of our products
incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology in formulations
or packaging.  In addition, several
products are covered by design patents, patent applications or copyrights.  While we consider these patents and
copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or
copyright is considered material to the conduct of our business.

Employees

At June 30, 2007, we had
approximately 28,500 full-time employees worldwide (including sales
representatives at points of sale who are employed by us), of whom
approximately 12,900 are employed in the United States and Canada.  None of our employees in the United States is
covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
In certain other countries, a limited number of employees are covered by
a works council agreement or other syndicate arrangements.  We believe that relations with our employees
are good.  We have never encountered a
material strike or work stoppage in the United States or in any other country
where we have a significant number of employees.

Government Regulation

We and our products are
subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade
Commission in the United States, as well as by various other Federal, state,
local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities
in the countries in which our products are produced or sold.  Such regulations principally relate to the
ingredients, labeling, packaging and marketing of our products.  We believe that we are in substantial
compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable Federal, state,
local and international and other countries’ rules and regulations governing
the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment.  There are no significant capital expenditures
for environmental control matters either planned in the current year or
expected in the near future.  Along with
other unrelated parties, we have been named as a potentially responsible party
by the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York with regard to a
landfill in Long Island, New York.  See “

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

.”


Seasonality

Our results of operations
in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal
fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically
being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year.  The higher net sales in the first two fiscal
quarters are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers
for the holiday selling season and for fall fashion makeup introductions.  Many of our customers that are retailers
follow a 4-4-5 retail calendar which may influence the amount and timing of
their order placement and receipt of goods in any fiscal quarter.  Fluctuations in net sales and operating
income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal
quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product
introductions.  Additionally, gross
margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by
variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including
purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.

Item
1A.

Risk Factors.

There are risks
associated with an investment in our securities.

Please consider the
following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form
10-K and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”).  Our business may also be
adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that
we currently believe to be immaterial. 
If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks
should occur or other risks arise or develop, our business, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading prices of
our securities, may be adversely affected.

The beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are
unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.

We face vigorous
competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational
consumer product companies.  Some of these competitors have greater
resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and
economic conditions more quickly than us.  Competition in the beauty
business is based on pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service
to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new
product introductions, electronic commerce initiatives and other
activities.  It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our
competitors’ actions in these areas.  In particular, the fragrance
category in the United States is influenced by the high volume of new product
introductions by diverse companies across several different distribution
channels.  Also, the trend toward
consolidation in the retail trade, particularly in developed markets such as
the United States and Western Europe, has resulted in us becoming increasingly
dependent on key retailers, including large-format retailers, who have
increased their bargaining strength. 
This trend has also resulted in an increased risk related to the
concentration of our customers.  A severe
adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material
adverse effect on us.  Our ability to compete also depends on the
continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent
and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and
distribution network, and our ability to protect our intellectual
property.  Our inability to continue to compete effectively in countries
around the world could have an adverse impact on our business.

Our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and
changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.

Our continued success
depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and
cost-effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care, makeup,
fragrance and hair care products as well as to where and how consumers shop for
those products.  We must continually work to develop, produce and market
new products, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a
favorable mix of products, and refine our approach as to how and where we
market and sell our products.  While we devote considerable effort and
resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, we recognize
that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change
rapidly.  If we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the
market for our products and changing consumer demands, our financial results
will suffer.

Our
future success depends on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.

Our long-term strategy is
based on five strategic imperatives:

1.

Optimize brand
portfolio

2.

Strengthen product
categories

3.

Strengthen and
expand geographic presence

4.

Diversify and
strengthen distribution channels

5.

Achieve operational
and cost excellence

Achieving our long-term
objectives may require investment in new brands, categories, distribution
channels, technologies and geographic markets. 
These investments may result in short-term costs without any current
revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings, at least in the
short-term.  In addition, we may dispose
of our brands and incur costs in doing so. 
Although we believe that our strategic imperatives will lead to
long-term growth in revenue and profitability, we may not realize, in full or
in part, the anticipated benefits.  The
failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our ability to execute plans
or other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and operating results.


Any future
acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.

We continuously review
acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our
distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations
or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities.  If required, the financing for any of these
acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests
of our stockholders or both. 
Acquisitions may entail numerous risks, including:

·

difficulties in assimilating acquired
operations or products, including the loss of key employees from or customers
of acquired businesses;

·

diversion of management’s attention
from our core businesses;

·

adverse effects on existing business
relationships with suppliers and customers; and

·

risks
of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have
limited or no prior experience.

Our failure to successfully
complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.  In addition, there can be no assurance that
we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate
acquisitions on favorable terms.

A general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business
conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items, which could
adversely affect our financial results.

The general level of
consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general
economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer
confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control.  Consumer
purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods,
when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products.  In
addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions, for example, as a
consequence of events such as the outbreak of SARs in 2003 or those that are currently
taking place in the Middle East, or as a result of a terrorist attack,
retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation, or as a result of
adverse weather conditions, such as Hurricane Katrina, can have a short and,
sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.

Events that impact
consumers’ willingness or ability to travel and/or purchase our products while
traveling may impact our travel retail business, which is a significant
contributor to our overall results.

A downturn in the economies
in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in
those economies could adversely affect our sales.

Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our
business could adversely affect our financial results.

Our business is subject
to numerous laws, regulations and policies.  Changes in the laws,
regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof,
that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting
standards, tax laws and regulations, trade rules and customs regulations, and
the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we
may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results.

Our success depends, in part, on
the quality and safety of our products.

Our success depends, in part, on the quality and
safety of our products.  If our products
are found to be defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet our
consumers’ standards, our relationships with customers or consumers could
suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we
could lose sales and/or become subject to liability claims, any of which could
result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Our success depends, in part, on
our key personnel.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain
our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management
team.  The unexpected loss of one or more
of our key employees could adversely affect our business.  Our success also depends, in part, on our
continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified
personnel.  Competition for these
employees can be intense.  We may not be
able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and
our failure to do so could adversely affect our business.  This risk may be exacerbated by the stresses
associated with the implementation of SMI (as defined below) and other
initiatives.


We are subject to risks related
to our international operations.

We operate on a global
basis, with approximately 54% of our fiscal 2007 net sales generated outside
the United States.  We maintain offices in over 35 countries and have key
operational facilities located outside the United States that manufacture,
warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world.  Foreign
operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including:

·

fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates, which can affect our results of operations,
the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and foreign
competitors sell products in the same markets and the cost of certain inventory
and non-inventory items required in our operations;

·

changes
in foreign laws, regulations and policies, including restrictions on trade,
import and export license requirements, and tariffs and taxes, as well as
changes in United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and
investment; and

·

adverse
weather conditions, social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as
terrorist attacks, war or other military action.

These risks could have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and
financial condition.

A disruption in operations could adversely affect our
business and financial results.

As a company engaged in
manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks
inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental
events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in logistics or
information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product
quality control, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as
well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no
control.  If such an event were to occur, it could have an adverse affect
on our business and financial results.

Our
information systems and websites may be susceptible to outages and other risks.

We have information
systems that support our business processes, including product development,
marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and
intracompany communications throughout the world.  We have e-commerce and other Internet websites
in the United States and many other countries. 
These systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power
loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events.  Despite the implementation of network
security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins
and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering.  The occurrence of these or other events could
disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and
results of operations.

We
are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems.

As part of a program that
we call our “Strategic Modernization Initiative,” or “SMI,” we are implementing
enterprise-wide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated
data, processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to
standardize business processes across brands, operating units and sales
affiliates.  We implemented SMI at our
Aveda operating unit in May 2007.  We
anticipate SMI implementation will continue at additional locations in fiscal
2008, with the majority of our locations to be implemented through fiscal
2010.  Like most entity-wide changes to
software systems, the implementation of SMI involves risks and uncertainties.  Failure to implement SMI as planned, in terms
of timing, specifications and/or costs, could have an adverse impact on our
business and results of operations.

The
trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the
accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance.

Our business planning
process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and
profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal
quarter.  We believe that this
longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our
stockholders.  At the same time, however,
we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to
our forecast of net sales and earnings. 
Accordingly, when we announced our year-end financial results for fiscal
2007, we provided guidance as to our expected net sales and earnings for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2008 and the quarter ending September 30,
2007.  While we generally expect to
provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter,
we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at
such times or otherwise.  In addition,
the longer-term guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the
time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance
over a number of years.  Such targets are
more speculative than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations.

In all of our public
statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our sales
and/or earnings expectations, we accompany such statements directly, or by
reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our
actual results to differ materially from those we expect.  Such a list is included, among other places,
in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q).  These and other factors may make it difficult
for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings
will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.


Outside analysts, like
all investors, have the right to make their own predictions of our financial
results for any future period.  Outside
analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our plans than
any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our
future performance.  Nor do we assume any
responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when
they differ from our own internal expectations. 
If and when we announce actual results that differ from those that
outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our
securities could be affected.  Investors
who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making
investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own
risk.  We take no responsibility for any
losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

.

We are involved, from
time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our
business.  Management believes that the
outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material
adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition.  However, management’s assessment of our
current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the
discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending
against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges, juries or
other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of
the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings.

On March 30, 2005, the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California entered
into a Final Judgment approving the settlement agreement we entered into in
July 2003 with the plaintiffs, the other Manufacturer Defendants (as defined
below) and the Department Store Defendants (as defined below) in a consolidated
class action lawsuit that had been pending in the Superior Court of the State
of California in Marin County since 1998. 
On April 29, 2005, notices of appeal were filed by representatives of
two members of the purported class of consumers.  One of those appeals has since been
withdrawn.  If the appeal is resolved
satisfactorily, the Final Judgment will result in the plaintiffs’ claims being
dismissed, with prejudice, in their entirety in both the Federal and California
actions.  There has been no finding or
admission of any wrongdoing by us in this lawsuit.  We entered into the settlement agreement
solely to avoid protracted and costly litigation.  In connection with the settlement agreement,
the defendants, including the Company, will provide consumers with certain free
products and pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees.  To meet its obligations under the settlement,
we took a special pre-tax charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million after-tax,
equal to $.06 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003.  At June 30, 2007, the remaining
accrual balance was $16.3 million.  The
charge did not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
condition.  In the Federal action, the
plaintiffs, purporting to represent a class of all U.S. residents who purchased
prestige cosmetics products at retail for personal use from eight department
stores groups that sold such products in the United States (the “Department
Store Defendants”), alleged that the Department Store Defendants, the Company
and eight other manufacturers of cosmetics (the “Manufacturer Defendants”)
conspired to fix and maintain retail prices and to limit the supply of prestige
cosmetics products sold by the Department Store Defendants in violation of
state and Federal laws. The plaintiffs sought, among other things, treble
damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees, interest and costs.

In 1999, the Office of
the Attorney General of the State of New York (the “State”) notified the
Company and ten other entities that they had been identified as potentially
responsible parties (“PRPs”) with respect to the Blydenburgh landfill in Islip,
New York.  Each PRP may be jointly and
severally liable for the costs of investigation and cleanup, which the State
estimated in 2006 to be approximately $19.7 million for all PRPs.  In 2001, the State sued other PRPs (including
Hickey’s Carting, Inc., Dennis C. Hickey and Maria Hickey, collectively the “Hickey
Parties”), in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York to
recover such costs in connection with the site, and in September 2002, the
Hickey Parties brought contribution actions against the Company and other
Blydenburgh PRPs.  These contribution
actions seek to recover, among other things, any damages for which the Hickey
Parties are found liable in the State’s lawsuit against them, and related costs
and expenses, including attorneys’ fees. 
In June 2004, the State added the Company and other PRPs as defendants
in its pending case against the Hickey Parties. 
In April 2006, the Company and other defendants added numerous other
parties to the case as third-party defendants. 
The Company and certain other PRPs have engaged in settlement
discussions which to date have been unsuccessful.  Settlement negotiations with the new
third-party defendants, the State, the Company and other defendants began in
July 2006.  We have accrued an amount
which we believe would be necessary to resolve our share of this matter.  If settlement discussions are not successful,
we intend to vigorously defend the pending claims.  While no assurance can be given as to the
ultimate outcome, management believes that the resolution of the Blydenburgh
matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.

On March 30, 2006, a
purported securities class action complaint captioned Thomas S. Shin, et al. v.
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., et al., was filed against the Company and
certain of our officers and directors (collectively the “Defendants”) in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The complaint alleged that the Defendants
made statements during the period April 28, 2005 to October 25, 2005 in press
releases, the Company’s public filings and during conference calls with
analysts that were materially false and misleading and that artificially
inflated the price of the Company’s stock. 
The complaint alleged claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The
complaint also asserted that during the class period, certain executive
officers and the trust for the benefit of a director sold shares of our Class A
Common Stock at artificially inflated prices. 
Three additional purported securities class action complaints were
subsequently filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York containing similar allegations.  On July 10, 2006, the Court consolidated
these actions under the caption In re: Estée Lauder Companies Securities
Litigation, appointed lead plaintiff, and approved the selection of lead
counsel.  A consolidated amended
complaint addressing the same issues as the original complaint was filed on
September 8, 2006.  The Defendants filed
a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on November 7, 2006.  On May 21, 2007, the Court granted the motion
to dismiss and gave plaintiff until June 4, 2007 to file an amended
complaint.  The plaintiff did not file an amended complaint by the
deadline.


On April 10, 2006, a
shareholder derivative action complaint captioned Miriam Loveman v. Leonard A.
Lauder, et al., was filed against certain of our officers and all of our
directors as of that date (collectively the “Derivative Action Defendants”) in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
 The complaint alleged that the Derivative Action Defendants breached
their fiduciary duties to the Company based on the same alleged course of
conduct identified in the complaint described above.  On May 2, 2007, the
judge granted the Derivative Action Defendants’ motion to dismiss because the
plaintiff failed to satisfy the requirement under Delaware law that she make a
demand on the Board of Directors to pursue litigation on behalf of the Company
prior to initiating the litigation herself.  The plaintiff has not taken
any further action with respect to this matter.

We expect to continue the

Board of Directors will continue to declare them.  In October 2006 and November 2005, the Board
of Directors declared an annual dividend of $.50 and $.40 per share,
respectively, which was paid in December 2006 and 2005, respectively.

As of August 17, 2007,
there were approximately 3,313 record holders of Class A Common Stock and 19
record holders of Class B Common Stock.


Share Repurchase Program

We are authorized by the
Board of Directors to repurchase up to 68.0 million shares of Class A Common
Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on
market conditions and other factors.  As
of June 30, 2007, the cumulative total of acquired shares pursuant to the
authorization was 61.1 million, reducing the remaining authorized share
repurchase balance to 6.9 million. 
During fiscal 2007, we purchased approximately 22.5 million shares for

In
March 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the accelerated repurchase of
$750.0 million of our outstanding common stock, to be implemented through an
accelerated stock repurchase program with a financial counterparty.  In March 2007, we repurchased 15,960,842
shares under this program for $750.0 million, or $46.99 per share. In August
2007, we received 97,417 shares of our common stock from the financial
counterparty as a price adjustment and final settlement.

Sales of Unregistered Securities

Shares of Class B Common Stock may be converted immediately into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis by the holder and are automatically converted into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis upon transfer to a person or entity that is not a “Permitted Transferee” or soon after a record date for a meeting of stockholders where the outstanding Class B Common Stock constitutes less than 10% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company.  There is no cash or other consideration paid by the holder converting the shares and, accordingly, there is no cash or other consideration received by the Company.  The shares of Class A Common Stock issued by the Company in such conversions are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) thereof.

During the three months
ended June 30, 2007, no holders of Class B Common Stock converted such shares
into Class A Common Stock.

(a) Fiscal 2006 results
included $93.0 million, after-tax, or $.43 per diluted share in special charges
related to our cost savings initiative and tax-related matters.  Included in the charges was an operating
expense charge of $92.1 million, equal to $.27 per diluted common share related
to the cost savings initiative.  The
results also included a special tax charge related to a settlement with the
Internal Revenue Service regarding an examination of our consolidated Federal
income tax returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2001, and represents the
aggregate earnings impact of the settlement through fiscal 2006.  The settlement resulted in an increase to our
fiscal 2006 income tax provision and a corresponding decrease in fiscal 2006
net earnings of approximately $46 million, or approximately $.21 per diluted common
share.  During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2006, we completed the repatriation of foreign earnings through
intercompany dividends under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004 (the “AJCA”).  In connection with
the repatriation, we updated the computation of the related aggregate tax
impact, resulting in a favorable adjustment of approximately $11 million, or
approximately $.05 per diluted common share, to our initial tax charge of $35
million recorded in fiscal 2005.  The tax
settlement, coupled with the AJCA favorable tax adjustment, resulted in a net
increase to our fiscal 2006 income tax provision and a corresponding decrease
in fiscal 2006 net earnings of approximately $35 million, or approximately $.16
per diluted common share.

(b) In the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2005, we announced plans to repatriate approximately $690 million of
foreign earnings in fiscal year 2006, which included $500 million of
extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the AJCA.  This action resulted in an aggregate tax
charge of approximately $35 million in our fiscal year ended June 30,
2005, which included an incremental tax charge of approximately $28 million,
equal to $.12 per diluted share.

(c) Fiscal 2003 included
a special charge related to the proposed settlement of a legal action of $13.5
million, after-tax, or $.06 per diluted common share.

(d) During fiscal 2004,
there was an increase of approximately $17.4 million in interest expense, net
and a corresponding decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 150, “Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.”  Additionally, in connection
with this pronouncement, redeemable preferred stock was reclassified as a
component of total debt subsequent to June 30, 2003 and all subsequent
applicable periods.

(e) In April 2006,
we completed the sale of certain assets and operations of the reporting unit
that marketed and sold Stila brand products. 
In February 2004, we sold the assets and operations of our former
reporting unit that sold

jane

brand
products.  As a result, all consolidated
statements of earnings information in the consolidated financial statements and
footnotes for all periods presented has been restated for comparative purposes
to reflect those reporting units as discontinued operations.

(f) In May 2007, we
issued and sold $300.0 million of 5.55% Senior Notes due May 15, 2017 and
$300.0 million of 6.00% Senior Notes, due May 15, 2037 in a public
offering.  We used the net proceeds of
this offering to repay long-term commercial paper, which was used to fund our
accelerated stock repurchase program, and to pay transaction fees and expenses
related to this offering.

(g) During fiscal 2007,
we repurchased 22,461,642 shares of our outstanding common stock, of which
15,960,842 shares were purchased for $750.0 million through an accelerated
stock repurchase program with a financial counterparty.

Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
ESTIMATES

The discussion and
analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2007 and our results of
operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  These judgments can be subjective and
complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those
estimates.  Our most critical accounting
policies relate to revenue recognition, concentration of credit risk,
inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill and other
intangible assets, income taxes, derivatives and stock-based compensation.

Management of the Company
has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect
of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from merchandise
sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to
the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.  In the Americas region, sales are generally
recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the Europe,
Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions sales are generally
recognized based upon the customer’s receipt. 
In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of
sale, for example, at our retail stores. 
Sales at our retail stores and online are recognized in accordance with
a 4-4-5 retail calendar.

Revenues are reported on
a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount
of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with
retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.  Our practice is to accept product returns
from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved.  In accepting returns, we typically provide a
credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.  As a percentage of gross sales, returns were
4.2%, 5.0% and 4.6% in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Our
sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact
on reported net sales.

This
accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future
returns and information provided by authorized retailers regarding their
inventory levels.  Consideration of these
factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects
increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.  Experience has shown a relationship between
retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well
as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our
business.  In addition, as necessary,
specific accruals may be established for significant future known or
anticipated events.  The types of known
or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider,
include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers,
store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision
to continue or support new and existing products.

Concentration of Credit Risk

An entity is vulnerable
to concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than
it would have if it mitigated its risks through diversification of
customers.  The significance of such
credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration.

During fiscal 2006,
Federated Department Stores, Inc. acquired The May Department Stores Company,
resulting in the merger of our previous two largest customers (collectively “Macy’s,
Inc.”).  This customer sells products
primarily within North America and accounted for $958.8 million, or 14%, and
$1,005.8 million, or 16%, of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2007 and
2006, respectively.  This customer
accounted for $105.3 million, or 12%, and $105.4 million, or 14%, of our
accounts receivable at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Although management believes that this
customer and our other major customers are sound and creditworthy, a severe
adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material
adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows and/or financial condition.

In the ordinary course of
business, we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer
deductions in the amount of $23.3 million and $27.1 million as of June 30, 2007
and 2006, respectively.  Our allowance for doubtful accounts is a
subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net
earnings.  The allowance for doubtful
accounts was reduced by $18.2 million, $12.0 million and $12.6 million for
customer deductions and write-offs in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
and increased by $14.4 million, $10.2 million and $11.4 million for additional
provisions in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  This reserve is based upon the evaluation of
accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends.

Inventory

We
state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value, with cost being
determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.  We believe FIFO most closely matches the flow
of our products from manufacture through sale. 
The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products,
promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that
will be sold or used in future periods. 
Inventory cost includes raw materials, direct labor and overhead.


We also record an
inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the
cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various
product sales projections.  This reserve
is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the
inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support
forecasted sales.  In addition, and as
necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated
events.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefit Costs

We offer the following
benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust-based
noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (“U.S. Qualified Plan”)
and an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide
benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S.
Qualified Plan, the “Domestic Plans”); a domestic contributory defined
contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country,
consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans;
deferred compensation arrangements; and certain other post-retirement benefit
plans.

The amounts needed to
fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and
variables.  Certain significant variables
require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an
anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and future
compensation levels.  We evaluate these
assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted
industry ranges, although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or
economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net
earnings.

The pre-retirement
discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit
cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.  For fiscal 2007, we used a pre-retirement
discount rate for our Domestic Plans of 6.25% and varying rates on our
international plans of between 2.25% and 6.25%. 
The pre-retirement rate for our Domestic Plans is based on a bond
portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent,
from a major rating agency.  We believe
the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this
portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of
our Domestic Plans.  For fiscal 2007, we
used an expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and
varying rates of between 2.75% and 7.25% for our international plans.  In determining the long-term rate of return for
a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan’s
investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies.  The U.S. Qualified Plan asset allocation as
of June 30, 2007 was approximately 49% equity investments, 31% fixed income
investments and 20% other investments. 
The asset allocation of our combined international plans as of June 30,
2007 was approximately 55% equity investments, 29% fixed income investments and
16% other investments.  The difference
between actual and expected returns on plan assets is accumulated and amortized
over future periods and, therefore, affects our recorded obligations and
recognized expenses in such future periods. 
For fiscal 2007, our pension plans had actual returns on assets of $80.1
million as compared with expected returns on assets of $42.5 million, which
resulted in a net deferred gain of $37.6 million.

A 25 basis-point change
in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have
had the following effect on fiscal 2007 pension expense:

For fiscal 2008, we are
using a pre-retirement discount rate for the Domestic Plans of 6.25% and
varying rates for our international plans of between 2.25% and 6.25%.  We are using an expected return on plan
assets of 7.75% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates for our
international pension plans of between 3.00% and 6.75%.  The net change in these assumptions from
those used in fiscal 2007 will result in a decrease in pension expense of
approximately $2.0 million in fiscal 2008. 
We will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these
assumptions and adjust them accordingly.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is calculated as
the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their
underlying net assets.  Other intangible
assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks.  Goodwill and other intangible assets that
have an indefinite life are not amortized.


On an annual basis, or
more frequently if certain events or circumstances warrant, we test goodwill
and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.  To determine the fair value of these
intangible assets, there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly
impact the results of the testing.  We have
the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions
and estimates we choose.  To mitigate
undue influence, we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria
that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and, in certain
instances, we engage third-party valuation specialists to advise us.

Income Taxes

We account for income
taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” as amended.  This statement establishes financial
accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result
from an enterprise’s activities during the current and preceding years.  It requires an asset and liability approach
for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes.

As of June 30, 2007, we
have current net deferred tax assets of $124.0 million and non-current net
deferred tax liabilities of $16.6 million. 
The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their
realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax
rates.  Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of
approximately $5.5 million for deferred tax assets, where management believes
it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in
the relevant jurisdiction.  Based on our
assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required.  If we determine that a deferred tax asset
will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in
a reduction of earnings at that time.

We provide tax reserves for
Federal, state, local and international exposures relating to periods subject
to audit.  The development of reserves
for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and
timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. 
Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in
management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for
estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.  In certain circumstances, the ultimate
outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which render
them inestimable.  If actual outcomes
differ materially from these estimates, including those that cannot be
quantified, they could have a material impact on our results of operations, as
we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 (see “Results of Operations

, Fiscal 2006 as Compared with Fiscal 2005 – Provision for Income Taxes

”).

Derivatives

We account for derivative
financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging
activities.  This statement also requires
the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities
on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value.

We currently use
derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and
interest rates, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign
currencies.  We do not utilize
derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  Hedge effectiveness is documented, assessed
and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and
monitor the instruments.  Variables that
are external to us such as social, political and economic risks may have an
impact on our hedging program and the results thereof.  For a discussion on the quantitative impact
of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments, refer to “

Liquidity and Capital Resources – Market Risk.”

Stock-Based Compensation

We
are required to record the fair value of stock-based compensation awards as an
expense in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” as
amended.  In order to determine the fair
value of stock options on the date of grant, we apply the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model.  Inherent in this
model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, option life,
risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. 
While the risk-free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective
assumptions that are based on factual data derived from public sources, the
expected stock-price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater
level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates.

We
use an expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both
current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which are
obtained from public data sources.  This
approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and
is directly related to stock option valuation. 
For stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended June 30,
2007, we used a weighted-average expected stock-price volatility of 24% based
upon the implied volatility at the time of issuance.

With
regard to the weighted-average option life assumption, we consider the exercise
behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises.  Patterns are determined based on specific
criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees including the reaction to vesting,
realizable value, long-run exercise propensity, pent-up demand, stock run-up
effect and short-time-to-maturity effect. 
For stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended June 30,
2007, we used a weighted-average expected option life assumption of
approximately 8 years.


W

hile
we believe the above critical estimates are based on outcomes that are
reasonably likely to occur, if we were to increase or decrease the expected
option life by one year and simultaneously increase or decrease the expected
volatility by 100 basis points, recognized compensation expense would have
changed approximately $2.0 million in either direction for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2007.

Quantitative Analysis

During the three-year
period ended June 30, 2007, there have not been material changes in the
assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related
significant estimates.  With the exception
of our tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2006, which finalized the ultimate liability for exposures which were
previously inestimable (see “Results of Operations

, Fiscal
2006 as Compared with Fiscal 2005 – Provision for Income Taxes

”),
the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed
significantly from our expectations.

While we believe that the
estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations
for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions
could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net
sales, cost of sales, operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as
they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, allowance for
doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.  For fiscal 2007, had these estimates been
changed simultaneously by 2.5% in either direction, our reported gross profit
would have increased or decreased by approximately $4.7 million, operating
expenses would have changed by approximately $0.6 million and the provision for
income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.4
million.  The collective impact of these
changes on operating income, net earnings and net earnings per diluted common
share would be an increase or decrease of approximately $5.3 million, $6.7
million and $.03, respectively.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We manufacture, market and sell skin care, makeup, fragrance
and hair care products which are distributed in over 135 countries and
territories.  We believe that the best
way to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers
with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the
most efficient and profitable manner. 
With this goal in mind, we have developed a long-term strategy based on
the following five imperatives:

1.

Optimize brand
portfolio

2.

Strengthen product
categories

3.

Strengthen and
expand geographic presence

4.

Diversify and
strengthen distribution channels

5.

Achieve operational
and cost excellence

In fiscal 2007, we
continued to find ways to strengthen our core brands and product categories,
maximize high-growth brands, incubate and develop next generation brands and
divest non-strategic brands.  Net sales
from Estée Lauder and Clinique grew on a global basis, fueled by strong demand
overseas.  Our faster growing M.A.C., Bobbi
Brown, La Mer, Jo Malone and Aveda brands continued to grow in virtually all
regions and we acquired the remaining equity interest in Bumble and
bumble.  Sean John Unforgivable continued
to be a success at retail in North America and we rolled out the brand in
certain international markets during fiscal 2007.  We launched products under the Tom Ford brand
name in North America and Europe and entered into a license agreement with Ford
Motor Company to create a fragrance using the name Mustang.  In July 2007, we acquired the Ojon
Corporation, a privately held hair care and skin care company based in
Canada.  In August 2007, we sold Rodan +
Fields back to its founders.

The majority of our net
sales continue to be generated outside the United States.  Around the globe, we generated growth in
sales and profits in our travel retail business and increased our presence in
China and Russia.  We also acquired a
distributor in Turkey and established an affiliate in Brazil.

In alternative
distribution channels, we continued to grow our online business in North
America, where products from most of our brands are available at Company-owned
websites.  However, in order to
streamline this business, we terminated our majority-owned Gloss.com joint
venture.  In addition, we recently
expanded the online business into the United Kingdom, Australia and France.  Certain of our products are now available at
specialty retailers such as Sephora, ULTA, and Shoppers Drug Mart.  We made strategic investments to establish
the platform upon which we intend to build our pharmacy channel business in
Europe.  Origins has recently expanded
into the French pharmacy channel.  We
also began to expand the number of Company-owned Jo Malone retail stores in
Europe, including the brand’s first French store in Cannes.

We continued to make
progress on our Strategic Modernization Initiative (“SMI”).  In May 2007, our Aveda operating unit began
using SAP software, a critical part of SMI. 
We anticipate SMI implementation will continue at additional locations
in fiscal 2008, with the majority of our locations to be implemented through
fiscal 2010.


Despite the rise in
energy and raw material costs, we were able to improve our overall cost of
goods margin by negotiating new contracts with suppliers and achieving
significant savings by sourcing from Asia. 
We also reduced the number of our global manufacturing and distribution
facilities by increasing the use of third-parties to control shipping and
warehousing costs.  In addition, we
improved speed to market of new SKUs and expanded our hub warehouse concept,
which allows us to take components on a just-in-time basis.

During fiscal 2007, we
also faced challenges, many of which we expect to be ongoing in fiscal
2008.  For instance, we continue to see
challenges for certain of our core brands due in part to the consolidation and
changes taking place among retailers and the decline in effectiveness of
gift-with-purchase promotions.  In
addition, the fragrance business model continues to be a challenge, with even
the most successful launches having difficulty becoming profitable.  Efforts to expand geographically are
complicated by increasing regulatory issues and cultural barriers.

As we continue to
implement our strategic imperatives, we expect to make selective investments,
embark on new business endeavors, and pursue initiatives that we believe will
have long-term benefits.  The timing,
impact and magnitude of any particular actions, such as an acquisition to
strengthen our product categories and/or diversify our distribution channels,
are subject to numerous factors and cannot be predicted.

The following table is a
comparative summary of operating results from continuing operations for fiscal
2007, 2006 and 2005 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Note 2
and Note 17 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods
presented.  Products and services that do
not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been
included in the “other” category.

In order to meet the
demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and
established products through advertising, sampling and merchandising and phase
out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers.  The economics of developing, producing,
launching and supporting products influence our sales and operating performance
each period.  The introduction of new
products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products,
which we take into account in our business planning.

Fiscal
2007 as Compared with Fiscal 2006

NET SALES

Net sales increased 9%,
or $573.7 million, to $7,037.5 million, reflecting net sales growth in all
product categories and geographic regions.  The increases in our skin
care, makeup and fragrance product categories were led by Europe, the Middle
East & Africa while the increase in hair care net sales was predominantly
in the Americas.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation,
net sales increased 7%.

Product Categories

Skin Care

Net sales of skin care
products increased 8%, or $200.2 million, to $2,601.0 million.  Most of
this growth was fueled by new product launches which made their most
significant impact in our Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific
regions.  The recent launches of Advanced Night Repair Concentrate
Recovery Boosting Treatment and Idealist Refinisher from Estée Lauder, and
Repairwear Lift Firming Night Cream, Continuous Rescue Antioxidant Moisturizer,
All About Eyes Rich and Repairwear Contour Firming Formula from Clinique
contributed incremental sales of approximately $95 million, combined.  Net
sales increases from our fast-growing La Mer brand, Resilience Lift Extreme
Ultra Firming products and other existing Advanced Night Repair products from
Estée Lauder, along with products in the Clinique 3-Step Skin Care System and
Superdefense from Clinique, totaled approximately $97 million.  These
improvements were partially offset by approximately $35 million of lower sales
from certain other Resilience Lift products and Perfectionist [CP+] from Estée
Lauder.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care
net sales increased 6%.


Makeup

Makeup net sales
increased 8%, or $208.5 million, to $2,712.7 million, reflecting growth from
our makeup artist brands of approximately $191 million.  This increase was
supported by new points of distribution and new product launches as well as
M·A·C Viva Glam lip products, the proceeds of which are donated to AIDS-related
charities.  Higher sales of Double Wear Foundation and the recent launch
of Resilience Lift Extreme Ultra Firming Makeup SPF 15 by Estée Lauder
contributed approximately $56 million to the growth in this product
category.  Lower sales of approximately $35 million of Pure Color Gloss and
Individualist Natural Finish Makeup by Estée Lauder, and Repairwear Anti-Aging
Makeup SPF 15 by Clinique partially offset this growth.  Excluding the
impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 6%.

Fragrance

Net sales of fragrance
products increased 8%, or $95.3 million, to $1,308.6 million, primarily driven
by incremental international sales from newer fragrance offerings.  DKNY
Red Delicious, Pure White Linen from Estée Lauder, Sean John Unforgivable, DKNY
Red Delicious Men and Donna Karan Gold collectively contributed approximately
$128 million to the category.  Lower sales of approximately $67 million of
True Star and True Star Men by Tommy Hilfiger, and Estée Lauder

pleasures

partially offset the growth in
this product category.  While current year sales levels compared favorably
to the prior year, we anticipate continued challenges in this product category
due in part to competitive dynamics, particularly in the United States. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales
increased 5%.

Hair Care

Hair care net sales
increased 18%, or $58.4 million, to $377.1 million, primarily due to sales
growth from Aveda and Bumble and bumble products.  Aveda net sales
increases were primarily due to sales of professional color products, the
recent launch of Be Curly shampoo and conditioner and the acquisition of an
independent distributor.  Bumble and bumble sales benefited from a new
hotel amenities program, sales growth in its existing salon distribution and new
points of distribution.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, hair care net sales increased 17%.

Geographic Regions

Net sales in the Americas
increased 3%, or $114.5 million, to $3,560.9 million.  The increase was
led by growth in the United States of approximately $152 million from our
makeup artist brands, our hair care business, our internet distribution, and
the recent launch of the Unforgivable fragrance by Sean John.  Partially
offsetting this growth was approximately $90 million related to weaknesses in
our core brands as a result of competitive pressures and retailer
consolidations.  Net sales growth in Canada, Latin America and Mexico
contributed an additional $31 million to the increase.  The prior year
results reflected an incremental provision of approximately $16 million for
returns that were anticipated at that time as a result of then-announced store
closings from retailer consolidations.

In Europe, the Middle
East & Africa, net sales increased 16%, or $345.7 million, to $2,493.4
million, including an exchange rate benefit due to the weakening of the U.S.
dollar of approximately $122 million.  The growth in the region reflected
higher net sales of approximately $260 million in the United Kingdom, our
travel retail business, Russia, Germany and Spain, with all benefiting from an
improving retail environment, and in Turkey, where we acquired a
distributor.  On a local currency basis,
net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased 10%.

Net sales in Asia/Pacific
increased 13%, or $113.5 million, to $983.2 million.  The growth in this
region reflected higher net sales of approximately $86 million in Korea, China,
Hong Kong and Australia.  These markets
benefited from an improved economy across the region while China’s growth in
net sales primarily reflected our continuing strategic expansion in this
country.  We also experienced modest
sales growth in Japan, our largest market in this region.  Excluding the
impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 11%.

We strategically stagger
our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for
differences in regional sales growth.

COST OF SALES

Cost of sales as a
percentage of total net sales decreased to 25.2% as compared with 26.1% in the
prior year.  Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales reflected a
favorable change in the mix of our business of approximately 40 basis points, a
decrease in the level and timing of promotional activities of approximately 20
basis points, the effect of exchange rate translation of approximately 20 basis
points and a decrease in obsolescence charges of approximately 10 basis
points.  Certain of these items reflect savings achieved during the
current period from our cost savings initiative, which commenced during fiscal
2006.

Since certain promotional
activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level
of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and
expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales
percentage.  In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the
inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different
from those of our existing brands.


Operating Expenses

Operating expenses
improved to 64.1% of net sales as compared with 64.3% of net sales in the prior
year.  During the prior year, we recorded a $92.1 million charge to
operating expenses related to the implementation of our cost savings initiative
that negatively impacted our operating expense margin by approximately 140
basis points.  Partially offsetting this improvement was an increase of
approximately 50 basis points in selling, general and administrative expenses
reflecting higher demonstration, field selling and training costs in support of
our business.  In fiscal 2007, our
operating expense margin was negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis
points resulting from expenses related to our pharmacy channel for
organizational costs, costs to streamline the distribution of goods, and the
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.  An increase in costs incurred related to the
implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative and higher stock-based
compensation expenses lowered our operating expense margin by approximately 20
additional basis points, combined.  Overall operating expenses reflected
savings achieved during the current period from our cost savings initiative,
which commenced during fiscal 2006.

Changes in
advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing
and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as
the markets being emphasized.

Operating Results

Due to the growth
in net sales and the decreases in our cost of sales and operating expense
margins as previously discussed, operating income increased 21%, or $130.3
million, to $749.9 million as compared with the prior year.  Operating
margins were 10.7% of net sales as compared with 9.6% in the prior year, which
was negatively impacted by 1.4% of net sales as a result of the special charge
related to our cost savings initiative.

The following
discussions of Operating Results by

Product
Categories

and

Geographic Regions

exclude the impact of special charges related to our cost savings initiative of
$1.1 million and $92.1 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and
2006, respectively.  We believe the following analysis of operating
results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our
business.  See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -

Segment Data and Related Information

.

Product Categories

Fragrance
operating results increased over 100%, or $20.4 million, to $28.1 million, as
profits from higher international net sales and lower spending at certain of
our core brands in the United States more than offset spending behind new and
developing brands.  Hair care operating results grew 60%, or $16.0
million, to $42.5 million as the increase in net sales outpaced increased
spending in support of new distribution points and product launches. 
Operating results increased 3%, or $9.9 million, to $339.3 million in makeup,
primarily as a result of higher net sales and profits from our makeup artist brands,
which more than offset challenges among certain core brands.  Skin care
operating results decreased 1%, or $4.9 million, to $341.5 million.  The results in this product category were
negatively impacted in fiscal 2007 by charges related to our pharmacy channel.  We recorded approximately $30 million for
organizational costs, costs to streamline the distribution of goods, and the
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.  In addition, improvements in international
skin care results were partially offset by challenges in certain core brands in
the United States.

Geographic Regions

Operating income
in the Americas decreased 2%, or $7.7 million, to $336.4 million, reflecting
spending behind strategic initiatives at our core brands, retailer consolidation
and costs to develop new brands in the United States.  Operating income
growth from our makeup artist brands, hair care business and our internet
distribution partially offset these results.

In Europe, the
Middle East & Africa, operating income increased 8%, or $23.9 million, to
$321.4 million primarily due to higher results of approximately $49 million
from our travel retail business, the United Kingdom, Russia and Germany. 
Lower results from France partially offset these improvements by approximately
$10 million.  The current year operating
results in France reflected the rebalancing of inventory levels at certain
retailers as well as strategic investment spending behind the field sales
force.  During the current year, the
region was negatively impacted by the charges discussed above related to our
pharmacy channel, partially offset by modest combined operating income growth
from the remaining affiliates in this region.

In Asia/Pacific,
operating income increased 33%, or $23.1 million, to $93.2 million.  This
increase reflected improved results of approximately $23 million in Hong Kong,
China, Australia and Korea.


Interest Expense, Net

Net interest
expense was $38.9 million as compared with $23.8 million in the prior year. 
This change primarily resulted from higher average debt balances, primarily
associated with the funding of our accelerated share repurchase program, and
higher average interest rates.  Also contributing to the increase was
reduced interest income generated from lower average investment balances
internationally, partially offset by higher average investment rates.  These increases were partially offset by the
capitalization of interest expense on internally developed software in
connection with the upgrade of our information systems.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for
income taxes represents Federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. 
The effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and
local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible
expenses.  Our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter
based on non-recurring and recurring factors including, but not limited to, the
geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax
audit settlements and the interaction of various global tax strategies. 
The effective rate for income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2007 was 35.9%
as compared with 43.6% in the prior year.  The decrease in the effective
income tax rate was primarily attributable to the prior year effect of the IRS
tax settlement of approximately 770 basis points.

Discontinued Operations

On September 30,
2005, we committed to a plan to sell and on April 10, 2006, we completed the
sale of certain assets and operations of our reporting unit that marketed and
sold Stila brand products.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, $0.5
million, net of tax, of operating income was reflected as discontinued
operations, reflecting the conclusion of transitional distribution services
provided to the purchaser.  The prior year charge of $80.3 million, net of
tax, reflected the then-anticipated loss on the sale of the business of $69.9
million, net of tax, and the operating loss of $10.4 million, net of tax.

Net Earnings

Net earnings as
compared with the prior fiscal year increased $205.0 million to $449.2 million
and diluted net earnings per common share improved 93% from $1.12 to
$2.16.  Net earnings from continuing
operations as compared with the prior fiscal year increased by $124.2 million,
or 38%, to $448.7 million and diluted net earnings per common share from
continuing operations increased 45% from $1.49 to $2.16.

Fiscal
2006 as Compared with Fiscal 2005

Net Sales

Net sales increased 3%, or
$183.8 million, to $6,463.8 million due to growth in our makeup, skin care and
hair care product categories, which was partially offset by lower sales in our
fragrance product category.  The net
increase reflected sales growth in all geographic regions.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, net sales increased 4%.

Product Categories

Skin Care

Net sales of skin care
products increased 2%, or $48.7 million, to $2,400.8 million primarily due to
new product launches.  The fiscal 2006
launches of Resilience Lift Extreme Ultra Firming Cremes and Re-Nutriv Ultimate
Lifting Serum by Estée Lauder, and Turnaround Concentrate Visible Skin Renewer
and Turnaround 15-Minute Facial by Clinique generated incremental sales of
approximately $123 million, combined. 
Perfectionist [CP+] by Estée Lauder and products in Clinique’s 3-Step
Skin Care System, bolstered by the introduction of Liquid Facial Soap,
contributed approximately $78 million to the increase.  These improvements were offset by
approximately $157 million of decreases in sales of existing products in
certain of our core brands as well as declines in our BeautyBank brands, which
completed their initial rollout during fiscal 2005.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, skin care net sales increased 3%.

Makeup

Makeup net sales increased
6%, or $137.4 million, to $2,504.2 million reflecting growth from our makeup
artist brands of approximately $179 million. 
This growth was partially offset by approximately $72 million of lower
sales from certain existing products, reflecting challenges experienced by
certain of our core brands, and declines in our BeautyBank brands, which
completed their initial rollout during fiscal 2005.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, makeup net sales increased 7%.


Fragrance

Net sales of fragrance
products decreased 4%, or $47.3 million, to $1,213.3 million as we continued to
be challenged in this product category, particularly in the Americas
region.  Estée Lauder Beyond Paradise and
various fragrances from

Clinique
and Tommy Hilfiger generated approximately $106 million of lower sales.  Also contributing to the decrease were lower
sales of approximately $28 million of True Star by Tommy Hilfiger and Lauder
Beyond Paradise Men by Estée Lauder as we anniversaried the initial shipments
of those products in fiscal 2005.  These
decreases were partially offset by the fiscal 2006 launches of True Star Men by
Tommy Hilfiger and Unforgivable by Sean John, which collectively contributed
approximately $49 million to the category, and higher sales of approximately
$47 million of DKNY Be Delicious and Estée Lauder

pleasures

.  Excluding
the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales decreased 2%.

Hair Care

Hair care net sales
increased 16%, or $44.8 million, to $318.7 million, primarily due to sales
growth from Bumble and bumble and Aveda products.  Bumble and bumble sales benefited from sales
growth due to new points of distribution, increases in sales of core products
and the launches of Shine and Powder products. 
Aveda net sales increases benefited from the fiscal 2006 launch of
Damage Remedy hair care products, strong demand for color products and from the
acquisition of a distributor.  Excluding
the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 17%.

Geographic Regions

Net
sales in the Americas increased 3%, or $95.3 million, to $3,446.4 million.  The increase was led by growth in the United
States of approximately $190 million from our makeup artist and hair care
brands, our internet distribution, and the introduction of the Unforgivable
fragrance by Sean John.  Partially
offsetting this growth was approximately $122 million related to weaknesses in
certain of our core brands as a result of challenges from competitive pressures
and business disruptions at certain key retailers, and lower sales from our
BeautyBank brands, which completed their initial rollout during fiscal
2005.  Net sales growth in Canada, Latin
America and Mexico contributed an additional $48 million to the increase.

In
Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 2%, or $38.6 million,
to $2,147.7 million, reflecting higher net sales of approximately $64 million
from our travel retail and distributor businesses, Russia and the United
Kingdom, with all benefiting from the success of the DKNY Be Delicious
franchise and the

sale of M

C
products.  These increases were partially offset by
decreases of approximately $26 million in Spain and Italy.  Spain’s net sales were adversely affected by
changes to our distribution policy and a difficult retail environment.  Net sales in Italy were negatively impacted
by changes to our distribution policy and, to a lesser extent, the balancing of
inventory levels at its retailers.  On a
local currency basis, net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa
increased 5%.

Net sales in
Asia/Pacific increased 6%, or $49.9 million, to $869.7 million.  Strategic growth in China combined with
positive results in Korea and Hong Kong, contributed approximately $57 million
to sales growth in this region.  These
increases were partially offset by decreases in Japan and Australia of
approximately $18 million.  Japan’s
results were negatively impacted due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar
against the Japanese yen.  The decrease
in Australia reflected slower sell-through in a difficult retail environment,
particularly in the fragrance category, as well as the balancing of inventory
levels at a major retailer.  On a local
currency basis, net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 7%.

We
strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may
account for differences in regional sales growth.

Cost of Sales

Cost
of sales as a percentage of total net sales increased to 26.1% as compared with
25.5% in fiscal 2005.  This change
reflected an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 40 basis points,
the net change in the mix of our business within our geographic regions and
product categories of approximately 20 basis points, a charge related to
unutilized tooling of approximately 10 basis points and 20 basis points related
to commodity material prices.  Partially
offsetting these increases were favorable changes in promotional activities of
approximately 30 basis points.  The
higher price of oil resulted in price increases in certain oil-based chemicals,
which had a slight adverse effect on our cost of sales margin.

Since
certain promotional activities are a component of net sales or cost of sales
and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we
have experienced fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage.


Operating Expenses

Operating
expenses increased to 64.3% of net sales as compared with 62.9% of net sales in
fiscal 2005.  The fiscal 2006 operating
expense margin was negatively impacted by charges related to the implementation
of our cost savings initiative of approximately $92.1 million or approximately
140 basis points, costs related to stock-based compensation as a result of the
fiscal 2006 adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) of approximately 60 basis points, and
the estimated impact of both the merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc.
and The May Department Stores Company and the hurricanes that affected the
southern United States of approximately 40 basis points.  Partially offsetting these incremental costs
were operating expense margin improvements of approximately 90 basis points
primarily resulting from net sales growth in brands and channels with lower
advertising, merchandising and sampling cost structures as well as an overall
reduction in this type of spending. 
Overall operating expenses reflected savings achieved during fiscal 2006
from our cost savings initiative.

Changes
in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type,
timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as
well as the markets being emphasized.

During fiscal 2006, we recorded special charges associated with a cost savings initiative that was designed to support our long-term financial objectives.  As part of this multi-faceted initiative, we identified savings opportunities that include streamlined processes and organizational changes.  The principal component of the initiative was a voluntary separation program offered primarily to North America-based employees.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, involuntary separations were communicated to certain employees.  Under this initiative, we incurred expenses related to one-time termination benefits for 494 employees, of which 28 were involuntary, which benefits were based principally upon years of service.

In addition, we identified other cost savings opportunities to impr
ove efficiencies in our distribution network and product offerings and to eliminate other nonessential costs.  These charges primarily related to employee severance for facilities that are closing, contract cancellations, counter and door closings and product returns.

For the year ended June 30, 2006, aggregate expenses of $92.1 million were recorded as special charges related to the cost savings initiative in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings.

The following table summarizes the costs and expected savings associated with our cost savings initiative, which impacted, and will continue to impact, our operating expenses and cost of sales:

Operating Results

Operating
income decreased 15%, or $107.2 million, to $619.6 million.  Operating margin was 9.6% of net sales in
fiscal 2006 as compared with 11.6% in fiscal 2005.  These results were negatively impacted by the
effects of special charges related to our cost savings initiative of $92.1
million, or 1.4% of net sales.  In
addition to the special charges, net sales growth was more than offset by the
increases in our cost of sales and operating expense margins as previously
discussed.

The
following discussions of Operating Results by

Product
Categories

and

Geographic Regions

exclude the impact of special
charges related to the implementation of our cost savings initiative.  We believe the following analysis of
operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our
business.


Product
Categories

Operating income
declined 79%, or $28.1 million, to $7.7 million in the fragrance product
category reflecting lower sales and, to a lesser extent, expenses incurred
related to development of new products and brands, partially offset by a shift
in spending in certain of our core brands to other product categories.  Skin care operating income decreased 5%, or
$19.4 million, to $346.4 million primarily reflecting lower than anticipated
net sales in certain of our core brands. 
Operating income increased 9%, or $28.3 million, to $329.4 million in
the makeup product category primarily reflecting sales growth from our makeup
artist brands, partially offset by declines in certain of our core brands.  Hair care operating income increased 16%, or
$3.7 million, to $26.5 million reflecting worldwide sales growth.  In fiscal 2006, the merger of Federated
Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company had a negative
impact on the operating results of our skin care, makeup and fragrance product
categories, while incremental operating expenses associated with new accounting
rules for stock-based compensation negatively impacted all of our product
categories.

Geographic
Regions

Operating income
in the Americas decreased 6%, or $22.1 million, to $344.1 million, primarily
reflecting challenges experienced by certain of our core brands, due in part to
competitive pressures and retailer consolidations, and incremental operating
expenses of approximately $33 million associated with new accounting rules for
stock-based compensation.  The ongoing success
of our makeup artist and hair care brands and our internet distribution
partially offset these challenges.

In Europe, the
Middle East & Africa, operating income decreased 3%, or $7.8 million, to
$297.5 million.  This decrease was
primarily due to lower results in Spain, Benelux (Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg) and Italy of approximately $20 million, collectively.  These decreases were partially offset by
improvements of approximately $12 million in France, our travel retail business
and Central Europe (Hungary, Poland and Czech Republic).

In Asia/Pacific,
operating income increased 27%, or $14.8 million, to $70.1 million.  This increase reflects improved results of
approximately $16 million in Korea, Japan and China, partially offset by lower
results in Taiwan and Thailand of approximately $4 million, collectively.  As China is an emerging market for us, we
have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in new brand expansion and
business opportunities there.

Interest

Expense, Net

Net
interest expense was $23.8 million as compared with $13.9 million in fiscal
2005.  The increase in net interest
expense was primarily due to higher average interest rates and, to a lesser
extent, higher average debt balances due to outstanding commercial paper during
the year.  The increased expense was
partially offset by increased interest income related to higher investment
interest rates.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes represents Federal,
foreign, state and local income taxes. 
The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2006 was 43.6% as
compared with 41.2% in fiscal 2005.  The
effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and
local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible
expenses.  The Company’s effective tax
rate will change from year to year based on non-recurring and recurring factors
including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, enacted tax
legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements and the
interaction of various global tax strategies.

On July 13, 2006, we announced a settlement with the
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding its examination of our consolidated
Federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1998 through
June 30, 2001.  The settlement resolves
previously disclosed issues raised during the IRS’s examination, including
transfer pricing and foreign tax credit computations.  The settlement of these issues resulted in a
tax charge of approximately $46 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006
and represents the aggregate earnings impact of the settlement through fiscal
2006.  In addition, during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed the repatriation of foreign earnings
through intercompany dividends as required under the provisions of the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “AJCA”). 
In connection with the repatriation, we updated the computation of the
related aggregate tax impact, resulting in a favorable adjustment of
approximately $11 million.  The tax
settlement, coupled with the AJCA favorable tax adjustment, resulted in a net
increase to our fiscal 2006 income tax provision of approximately $35 million.

The increase in the effective income tax rate was
attributable to the tax settlement charge of approximately 770 basis points, an
increase of approximately 60 basis points resulting from our foreign operations
and an increase in nondeductible expenses of approximately 30 basis
points.  These increases were partially
offset by the net reduction in the incremental tax charge relative to the
repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the AJCA of approximately 570
basis points, as well as a reduction of approximately 50 basis points for
miscellaneous items.


Discontinued Operations

On April 10, 2006
(the “Effective Date”), we completed the sale of certain assets and operations
of the reporting unit that marketed and sold Stila brand products to Stila
Corp. (the “Purchaser”), an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., for
consideration of $23.0 million.  The sale
price included cash of $9.3 million, a promissory note with a notional value of
$13.3 million and a fair value of $11.0 million and convertible preferred stock
with an aggregate liquidation preference of $5.0 million and a fair value of
$2.7 million.  As additional consideration
for the purchased assets, and subject to the terms and conditions of the sale
agreement, the Purchaser will pay us an amount equal to two percent of the
annual net sales of the acquired business during the period commencing on the
Effective Date and ending August 20, 2019. 
We will use these proceeds to satisfy our commitment under the 1999
agreement pursuant to which we originally purchased the Stila business.  The Purchaser immediately assumed
responsibility for all decisions regarding the operations of the Stila business
and we agreed to divest ourselves of continuing involvement in the Stila
business, except as described below.

In fiscal 2006, we
recorded charges of $80.3 million (net of $43.3 million tax benefit) to
discontinued operations, which reflected the loss on the disposition of the
business of $69.9 million, net of tax, and adjustments to the fair value of
assets sold, the costs to dispose of those assets not acquired by the Purchaser
and other costs in connection with the sale. 
The charges also included the operating losses of $10.4 million, net of
tax, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. 
Net sales associated with the discontinued operations were $45.1 million
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006.

In order to
facilitate the transition of the Stila business to the Purchaser, we agreed to
provide certain information systems, accounting and other back office services
to the Purchaser in exchange for monthly service fees designed to recover the
estimated costs of providing these transition services.  We also agreed with the Purchaser to provide
certain distribution and online services. 
In both cases, the services concluded in fiscal 2007.  In addition, we agreed to manufacture and sell
to the Purchaser a limited range of products for a period of up to four months
following the Effective Date and, in the case of one product, of up to two
years.

Net Earnings

Net earnings as
compared with fiscal 2005 declined $161.9 million or 40% to $244.2 million and
diluted net earnings per common share decreased 37% from $1.78 to $1.12.  Net earnings from continuing operations as
compared with fiscal 2005 decreased by $85.4 million, or 21%, to $324.5 million
and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations decreased
17% from $1.80 to $1.49.


FINANCIAL
CONDITION

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our principal
sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and
borrowings under commercial paper, borrowings from the issuance of long-term
debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other
lenders in the United States and abroad. 
At June 30, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents of $253.7 million
compared with $368.6 million at June 30, 2006.

At June 30, 2007,
our outstanding borrowings were as follows:

We have a $750.0
million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in
the United States.  Our commercial paper
is currently rated A-1 by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s.  Our long-term credit ratings are A with a
stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A2 with a stable outlook by Moody’s.  At June 30, 2007, we had $26.5 million of
commercial paper outstanding, which we may refinance on a periodic basis as it
matures at then-prevailing market interest rates.  We also have $178.9 million in additional
uncommitted credit facilities, of which $28.9 million was used as of June 30,
2007.

Effective April
2007, we entered into a $750.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit
facility, expiring on April 26, 2012, primarily to provide credit support for
our commercial paper program, to repurchase shares of our common stock and for
general corporate purposes.  The new
facility replaced our prior, undrawn $600.0 million senior unsecured revolving
credit facility, which had been effective since May 27, 2005.  Up to the equivalent of $250 million of the
current facility is available for multi-currency loans.  The interest rate on borrowings under the
credit facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate
of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or ½% plus the
Federal funds rate.  We incurred costs of
approximately $0.3 million to establish the facility which will be amortized
over the term of the facility.  The credit
facility has an annual fee of $0.4 million, payable quarterly, based on our
current credit ratings.  As of June 30,
2007, we were in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive
covenants, including limitations on indebtedness and liens.

In May 2007, we
issued and sold the 2017 Senior Notes and the 2037 Senior Notes in a public
offering.  The 2017 Senior Notes were
priced at 99.845% with a yield of 5.570% and the 2037 Senior Notes were priced
at 98.722% with a yield of 6.093%. 
Interest payments on both notes are required to be made semi-annually on
May 15 and November 15, commencing November 15, 2007.  We used the net proceeds of this offering to
repay long-term commercial paper, which was used to fund our accelerated stock
repurchase program, and to pay transaction fees and expenses related to this
offering.

We have a fixed
rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which
we may borrow up to $150.0 million in the form of loan participation notes
through one of our subsidiaries in Europe. 
The interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an all-in
fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each
borrowing.  At June 30, 2007, no
borrowings were outstanding under this agreement.  Debt issuance costs incurred related to this
agreement were de minimis.


We have an
overdraft borrowing agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which
our subsidiary in Turkey may be credited to satisfy outstanding negative daily
balances arising from its business operations. 
The total balance outstanding at any time shall not exceed 20.0 million
Turkish lira.  The interest rate
applicable to each such credit shall be 40 basis points per annum above the
spot rate charged by the lender or the lender’s floating call rate agreed to by
us at each borrowing.  There were no debt
issuance costs incurred related to this agreement.  The outstanding balance at June 30, 2007
($9.4 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2007) is classified as
short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet.

We have a 3.0 billion yen
revolving credit facility that expires on March 24, 2009.  The interest rate on borrowings under the
credit facility is based on TIBOR (Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate) and a 10 basis
point facility fee is incurred on the undrawn balance.  At June 30, 2007, no borrowings were
outstanding under this facility.

Our business is
seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.  From time to time, we may enter into
investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.  To the extent that these needs exceed cash
from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial
paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit
facilities.

Total debt as a percent
of total capitalization was 48% at June 30, 2007 and 24% at June 30, 2006.

The effects of
inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent
years.  Generally, we have been able to
introduce new products at higher selling prices or

increase
selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases, which have been moderate.

Based on past
performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash
generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets
will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information
systems enhancements, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, commitments and
other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.

Cash
Flows

Net cash provided
by operating activities was $661.6 million, $709.8 million and $478.1 million
in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
The net decrease in operating cash flows from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007
reflected higher domestic and international inventory levels primarily driven
by growth in new and emerging international markets, increased regulatory
requirements and the building of safety stock for the recent implementation of
SAP as part of our Strategic Modernization Initiative at our Aveda
manufacturing facility.  In addition, the
decrease in operating cash flows reflected higher accounts receivable balances,
primarily related to significant sales growth from our international operations.  Cash flows were also impacted by cash
payments made during fiscal 2007 related to our fiscal 2006 cost savings
initiative.  Partially offsetting the
decrease was an improvement in net earnings from continuing operations.

The net increase
in operating cash flows for fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 primarily
reflected favorable changes in certain working capital accounts, partially
offset by a decrease in net earnings from continuing operations.  Net accounts receivable balances decreased
primarily reflecting higher collections domestically during fiscal 2006.  Inventory levels remained constant at June
30, 2006 as compared to June 30, 2005 due to our efforts to better manage our
inventory.  Increases in other accrued
liabilities primarily reflected higher advertising, merchandising and sampling
accruals compared to fiscal 2005, as well as significant deferred compensation
and supplemental pension payments made to retired executives in fiscal
2005.  Additional increases in other
accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities reflected accrued employee
separation benefits related to the Company’s fiscal 2006 cost savings
initiative.

Net cash used for
investing activities was $373.8 million, $303.2 million and $237.0 million in
fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.  The increase
in cash flows used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2006
primarily reflected capital expenditures, which reflected our continuing
company-wide initiative to upgrade our information systems, store improvements
and counter construction.  Fiscal 2007
investing activities also reflected the purchase of the remaining equity
interest in Bumble and Bumble Products, LLC and Bumble and Bumble, LLC, as well
as the acquisition of businesses engaged in the wholesale distribution and
retail sale of our products in the United States and other countries.  The increase in cash flows used for investing
activities during fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the cash payment related to
the Jo Malone Limited earn-out provision and, to a lesser extent, Aveda
distributor acquisitions.  Capital
expenditures also increased in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting our continued
company-wide initiative to upgrade our information systems, which was initiated
in fiscal 2005.  Fiscal 2005 capital
expenditures reflected those costs related to our information systems as well
as the investment in leasehold improvements for our corporate offices.


Cash used for
financing activities was $411.6 million, $594.6 million and $300.4 million in
fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
Net cash flows related to short-term and long-term borrowings increased
approximately $722.1 million from the prior year.  An increase in proceeds from employee stock
transactions of approximately $87 million also contributed to the
improvement.  Partially offsetting these
improvements were increases in treasury stock repurchases of approximately $604
million and an increase of approximately $18 million in dividends paid to
stockholders.  During fiscal 2006, in
addition to common stock repurchases and dividend payments, cash flows used for
financing activities reflected the repayment of short-term commercial paper
that was outstanding at June 30, 2005 and the October 2005 redemption of the
remaining 2015 Preferred Stock.  These
outflows were partially offset by short-term borrowings under our loan
participation note program.  The 3.0
billion yen term loan outstanding at the end of fiscal 2005 was refinanced by
borrowings under the new 3.0 billion yen revolving credit facility that we
entered into in March 2006.  The net cash
used for financing activities in fiscal 2005 primarily reflected common stock
repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by the issuance of
short-term commercial paper to fund working capital needs and the receipt of
proceeds from employee stock option transactions.

Dividends

On October 25,
2006, the Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $.50 per share on
our Class A and Class B Common Stock, of which an aggregate of $103.6 million
was paid on December 27, 2006 to stockholders of record at the close of
business on December 8, 2006.  The annual
common stock dividend declared during fiscal 2006 was $.40 per share, of which
an aggregate of $85.4 million was paid on December 28, 2005 to stockholders of
record at the close of business on December 9, 2005.  Dividends on the 2015 Preferred Stock were
$0.5 million for fiscal 2006 and were characterized as interest expense in the
accompanying consolidated statement of earnings.  2015 Preferred Stock was redeemed in October
2005.

Pension Plan Funding and Expense

We maintain
pension plans covering substantially all of our full-time employees for our
U.S. operations and a majority of our international operations.  Several plans provide pension benefits based
primarily on years of service and employees’ earnings.  In the United States, we maintain a
trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (“U.S.
Qualified Plan”).  Additionally, we have
an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide
benefits in excess of statutory limitations. 
Our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and
defined contribution plans.

Several factors
influence our annual funding requirements. 
For the U.S. Qualified Plan, our funding policy consists of annual
contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains
appropriate funded percentages.  Such
contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and subsequent pension
legislation, and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax
purposes.  For each international plan,
our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.  In addition, amounts necessary to fund future
obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as
detailed in “

Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates

”).  The effect of our pension plan funding on
future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics,
mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum
distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.

For fiscal 2007
and 2006, there was no minimum contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan required
by ERISA.  During the first quarter of
fiscal 2007, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was adopted into law in the
United States.  Certain provisions of this law changed the calculation
related to the maximum contribution amount deductible for income tax
purposes.  As a result of these provisions, we made discretionary
contributions totaling $20.0 million to the U.S. Qualified Plan during fiscal
2007.  We did not make any cash
contributions pursuant to the plan during fiscal 2006.  During fiscal 2008, we expect to make cash
contributions totaling $20.0 million to the U.S. Qualified Plan.

For fiscal 2007
and 2006, we made benefit payments under our non-qualified domestic
noncontributory pension plan of $5.3 million and $7.4 million,
respectively.  We expect to make benefit
payments under this plan during fiscal 2008 of $11.7 million.  For fiscal 2007 and 2006, we made cash
contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of $24.0
million and $25.7 million, respectively. 
We expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2008 of
$21.0 million.

In September 2006,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 106, and 132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”). 
SFAS No. 158 requires employers to recognize a net liability or asset and an
offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income to report the
funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit
plans.  Previous standards required employers to disclose the complete
funded status of its plans only in the notes to the financial statements. 
Changes in the funded status of these plans will be recognized as they occur
through other comprehensive income. 
Additional minimum liability adjustments are no longer recognized upon
adoption of SFAS No. 158.  As of June 30,
2007, we prospectively adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 158.  Additionally, SFAS
No. 158 requires employers to measure plan assets and obligations at their
year-end balance sheet date.  Our principal pension and post-retirement
benefit plans are measured as of June 30; therefore, the measurement provisions
of SFAS No. 158 did not affect our existing valuation practices.  The adoption of SFAS No. 158 did not impact
the consolidated statements of earnings or our financial debt covenant.  As of June 30, 2007, we recognized other
assets of $128.0 million, other accrued liabilities of $19.0 million and other
noncurrent liabilities of $237.3 million on our consolidated balance sheet
representing the funded status of our pension and post-retirement plans.


Prior to the
adoption of SFAS No. 158, we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for
each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less
than the accumulated benefit obligation and, accordingly, a benefit or a charge
was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity
for the change in such liability.  During
fiscal 2006, we recorded a benefit, net of deferred tax, of $29.9 million.

Commitments
and Contingencies

Certain of our business acquisition agreements include “earn-out”
provisions.  These provisions generally
require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts
based on the performance of the acquired business.

Since the
size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do
not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future
results of operations or financial condition.

For additional
contingencies, refer to

“Item 3. Legal
Proceedings.”

future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned
future sales for the term that was in effect at June 30, 2007, without
consideration for potential renewal periods.

Derivative
Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

We address certain
financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that
includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  We primarily enter into foreign currency
forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects
of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. 
We also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the
effects of fluctuating interest rates. 
We categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than
trading.

For each
derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge
accounting treatment, we formally document the relationship between the hedging
instrument and hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy
for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging
instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed
prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring
ineffectiveness.  This process includes
linking all derivatives that are designated as fair-value, cash-flow, or
foreign-currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet
or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.  We also formally assess, both at the hedge’s
inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values
or cash flows of hedged items.  If it is
determined that a derivative is not highly effective, then we will be required
to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.


Foreign
Exchange Risk Management

We enter into
forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as
receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods
consistent with our identified exposures. 
The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of
foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we
receive from foreign subsidiaries. 
Almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of
major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as
strong investment grade by a major rating agency.  We also may enter into foreign currency
options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability
that anticipated exposures will materialize. 
The forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into
to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash-flow
hedges.  Hedge effectiveness of forward
exchange contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and
excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference
which is recorded in current-period earnings. 
Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a
dollar offset methodology.  The
ineffective portion of both forward exchange and foreign currency option
contracts is recorded in current-period earnings.  For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed
highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses
accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings when the
underlying forecasted transaction occurs. 
If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur,
then any gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are
reclassified to current-period earnings. 
As of June 30, 2007, these cash-flow hedges were highly effective, in
all material respects.

As a matter of
policy, we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an “A”
(or equivalent) credit rating.  The
counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.  We do not have significant exposure to any
one counterparty.  Our exposure to credit
loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to
only the recognized, but not realized, gains attributable to the
contracts.  Management believes risk of
default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be
material to the consolidated financial results. 
The contracts have varying maturities through the end of June 2008.  Costs associated with entering into such contracts
have not been material to our consolidated financial results.  We do not utilize derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

At June 30, 2007,
we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts in
the amount of $862.0 million.  The
foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts (notional value
stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the British pound ($148.1 million),
Canadian dollar ($140.3 million), Euro ($124.1 million), Swiss franc ($113.1
million), Australian dollar ($79.3 million), Japanese yen ($42.6 million) and
South Korean won ($33.6 million).  As of
June 30, 2007, all of our previously outstanding option contracts have matured.

Interest
Rate Risk Management

We enter into
interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of
interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent
with the identified exposures.  All
interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated
as strong investment grade by a major rating agency.

In April 2007, we terminated
an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0 million to
effectively convert fixed rate interest on the 2012 Senior Notes to variable
interest rates based on six-month LIBOR.  This instrument, which was
designated as a fair-value hedge and classified as a liability, had a
termination fair value of $11.1 million at cash settlement, which included $0.9
million of accrued interest payable to the counterparty.  Hedge accounting treatment was discontinued
prospectively and the offsetting adjustment to the carrying amount of the
related debt will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of
the debt.

In April 2007, in
connection with the anticipated issuance of debt, we entered into a series of
forward-starting interest rate swap agreements on a notional amount totaling
$210.0 million at a weighted average all-in rate of 5.45%.  These
forward-starting swap agreements, designated as cash-flow hedges, were used to
hedge the exposure to a possible rise in interest rates prior to the May 2007
issuance of debt.  The agreements were settled upon the issuance of the
2037 Senior Notes and we recognized a loss in other comprehensive income of
$0.9 million that will be amortized to interest expense over the 30-year life
of the 2037 Senior Notes.

In April 2007, we entered
into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling $250.0
million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on our 2017 Senior Notes
to variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR.  The interest rate
swaps were designated as fair-value hedges. 
As of June 30, 2007, these fair-value hedges were highly effective, in
all material respects.

Market
Risk

We use a
value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial
instruments.  Value-at-risk represents
the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in
market factors for a specified time period and confidence level.  We estimate value-at-risk across all of our
derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and
correlations calculated over the past 250-day period.  The measured value-at-risk, calculated as an
average, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2007 related to our foreign
exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was $10.2 million and $7.5
million, respectively.

The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95
percent confidence level.  We used a
statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments
against one thousand randomly generated market price paths.


Our calculated
value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses
that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments
assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily
indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.  It does not represent the maximum possible
loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses
will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market
rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our
portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.

We believe,
however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market
rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the
derivative financial instrument was intended.

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We do not maintain
any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships
with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current
or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

RECENTLY
ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 2006, the FASB
issued FASB Interpretation Number (“FIN”) 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”).  FIN 48
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes.”  FIN 48 prescribes a
two-step evaluation process for tax positions taken, or expected to be taken,
in a tax return.  The first step is
recognition and the second is measurement. 
For recognition, an enterprise judgmentally determines whether it is
more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination,
including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the
technical merits of the position.  If the
tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is
measured and recognized in the financial statements as the largest amount of
tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.  If a tax position does not meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not
recognized in the financial statements.

Tax positions that
meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date of
FIN 48 may be recognized or, continue to be recognized, upon adoption of FIN
48.  The cumulative effect of applying
the provisions of FIN 48 shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening
balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year.  FIN 48 will apply to fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted.  In May 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position (“FSP”) No. FIN 48-1, “Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation
No. 48, an amendment of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FSP No. FIN 48-1”).  FSP No. FIN 48-1 provides guidance on how to
determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of
recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits.

The provisions of
FIN 48 became effective for us on July 1, 2007. 
While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the interpretation on
the consolidated financial statements, we expect the cumulative effect of
adoption to reduce opening retained earnings by approximately $10 million to
$20 million with a corresponding increase to reserves for uncertain tax
positions.

In September 2006,
the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 157, “Fair
Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”) to clarify the definition of fair value,
establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand the disclosures on fair
value measurements.  SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an
exit price).  SFAS No. 157 also stipulates that, as a market-based
measurement, fair value measurement should be determined based on the
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (a)
market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from
sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs) and (b) the
reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
(unobservable inputs).  SFAS No. 157 becomes effective for us in our
fiscal year ending June 30, 2009.  We are currently evaluating the impact
of the provisions of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities,” (“SFAS No. 159”) to permit all entities to choose to
elect, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments
at fair value.  An entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on
items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each
subsequent reporting date, and recognize upfront costs and fees related to
those items in earnings as incurred and not deferred.  SFAS No. 159
applies to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with early adoption
permitted for an entity that has also elected to apply the provisions of SFAS
No. 157.  An entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying SFAS No.
159, unless it chooses early adoption.  We are currently evaluating the
impact of the provisions of SFAS No. 159 on our consolidated financial
statements, if any, when it becomes effective for the fiscal year ending June
30, 2009.


FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION

We and our
representatives from time to time make written or oral forward-looking
statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in our reports to
stockholders.  The words and phrases “will
likely result,” “expect,” “believe,” “planned,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “anticipate,”
“estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “forecast” or similar expressions are intended
to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
These statements include, without limitation, our expectations regarding
sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, product introductions,
entry into new geographic regions, information systems initiatives, new methods
of sale and future operations or operating results.  Although we believe that our expectations are
based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our
business and operations, actual results may differ materially from our
expectations.  Factors that could cause
actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation:

(1) increased competitive activity from companies in
the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses, some of which have
greater resources than we do;

(2) our ability to develop, produce and market new
products on which future operating results may depend and to successfully
address challenges in our core brands, including gift with purchase, and in our
fragrance business;

(3) consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and
reorganizations in the retail industry causing a decrease in the number of
stores that sell our products, an increase in the ownership concentration
within the retail industry, ownership of retailers by our competitors or
ownership of competitors by our customers that are retailers;

(4) destocking by retailers;

(5) the success, or changes in timing or scope, of new
product launches and the success, or changes in the timing or the scope, of
advertising, sampling and merchandising programs;

(6) shifts in the preferences of consumers as to where
and how they shop for the types of products and services we sell;

(7) social, political and economic risks to our
foreign or domestic manufacturing, distribution and retail operations,
including changes in foreign investment and trade policies and regulations of
the host countries and of the United States;

(8) changes in the laws, regulations and policies
(including the interpretations and enforcement thereof) that affect, or will
affect, our business, including those relating to our products, changes in
accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, trade rules and customs
regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings,
and any action we may take as a result;

(9) foreign currency fluctuations affecting our
results of operations and the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices
at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and
our operating and manufacturing costs outside of the United States;

(10) changes in global or local conditions, including
those due to natural or man-made disasters, real or perceived epidemics, or
energy costs, that could affect consumer purchasing, the willingness or ability
of consumers to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling, the
financial strength of our customers or suppliers, our operations, the cost and
availability of capital which we may need for new equipment, facilities or
acquisitions, the cost and availability of raw materials and the assumptions
underlying our critical accounting estimates;

(11) shipment delays, depletion of inventory and
increased production costs resulting from disruptions of operations at any of
the facilities that manufacture nearly all of our supply of a particular type
of product (i.e., focus factories) or at our distribution or inventory centers,
including disruptions that may be caused by the implementation of SAP as part
of our Strategic Modernization Initiative;

(12) real estate rates and availability, which may
affect our ability to increase the number of retail locations at which we sell
our products and the costs associated with our other facilities;

(13) changes in product mix to products which are less
profitable;

(14) our ability to acquire, develop or implement new
information and distribution technologies, on a timely basis and within our
cost estimates;

(15) our ability to capitalize on opportunities for
improved efficiency, such as publicly-announced cost-savings initiatives and
the success of Stila under new ownership, and to integrate acquired businesses
and realize value therefrom;

(16) consequences attributable to the events that are
currently taking place in the Middle East, including terrorist attacks,
retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation;


(17) the timing and impact of acquisitions and
divestitures, which depend on willing sellers and buyers, respectively; and

(18) additional factors as described in our filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

We assume no
responsibility to update forward-looking statements made herein or otherwise.

Controls and Procedures.

Our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  The
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from
other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of June 30, 2007 and, based on their evaluation,
have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
such date.

As part of our Strategic
Modernization Initiative, we have implemented SAP at our Aveda operating unit
in May 2007 and we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to this
system at additional locations in fiscal 2008, with the majority of our
locations being fully implemented through fiscal 2010.  Based on
management’s evaluation, the necessary steps have been taken to monitor and
maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this
period.

In connection with these
changes, we have updated our internal control over financial reporting.  Except as noted in the previous sentences,
there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Management’s
report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of
independent registered public accounting firm on our management’s assessment of
internal control over financial reporting are incorporated herein from pages
F-2 and F-3, respectively.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting

Management of The Estée
Lauder Companies Inc. (including its subsidiaries) (the “Company”) is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended).

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.  A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision of
and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer, the Company’s management conducted an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on the framework and criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, the Company’s
management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2007, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective.

KPMG LLP, the independent
registered public accounting firm that audits the Company’s consolidated
financial statements has issued its attestation report on management’s
assessment of internal control over financial reporting.  That attestation report follows this report.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors
and Stockholders

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.:

We have audited
management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,
2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).  The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.  A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,
management’s assessment that The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Also, in our opinion, The Estée Lauder
Companies Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of The Estée Lauder Companies
Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2007 and 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
June 30, 2007, and our report dated August 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors
and Stockholders

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.:

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and
subsidiaries as of June 30, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2007.  In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement
schedule as listed on the index on page F-1. 
These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States).  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended June 30, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.  Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in the notes
to the consolidated financial statements, effective July 1, 2005, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payment.”  Also as discussed in the notes
to the consolidated financial statements, effective July 1, 2006, the Company
changed their method for quantifying errors based on SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,”  and effective June 30, 2007, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 158, “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans – An
Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).”

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and
our report dated August 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles
of Consolidation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Estée Lauder
Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as continuing
operations, with the exception of the operating results of its reporting unit
that marketed and sold Stila brand products, which have been reflected as
discontinued operations for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 (see Note 4).  All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated.

Certain amounts in
the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to
conform to current year presentation for comparative purposes.

Net
Earnings Per Common Share

For the years
ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, net earnings per common share (“basic EPS”)
is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain
conditions).  Net earnings per common share
assuming dilution (“diluted EPS”) is computed by reflecting potential dilution
from stock-based awards and contingently issuable shares.

A reconciliation between
the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as
follows:

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As of June 30,
2007, 2006 and 2005, outstanding options to purchase 6.0 million, 13.6 million
and 12.5 million shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock were not
included in the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be
anti-dilutive.  As of June 30, 2007 and
2006, 0.2 million and 0.1 million, respectively, of performance share units
have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the number of
shares ultimately issued is contingent on the achievement of certain
performance targets of the Company, as discussed in Note 13 – Stock Programs.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents
include $51.3 million and $66.2 million of short-term time deposits at June 30,
2007 and 2006, respectively.  The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts receivable is
stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions of
$23.3 million and $27.1 million as of June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Currency
Translation and Transactions

All assets and
liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end
rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted
average rates of exchange for the year. 
Unrealized translation gains or losses are reported as cumulative
translation adjustments through other comprehensive income.  Such adjustments amounted to $53.1 million,
$27.0 million and $8.2 million of unrealized translation gains in fiscal 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company enters into foreign
currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to hedge
foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified
exposures.  Accordingly, the Company
categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.

The accompanying
consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange gains (losses) of
$(0.6) million, $4.0 million and $(15.8) million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Inventory
and Promotional Merchandise

Inventory and promotional
merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future
periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost
being determined on the first-in, first-out method.

Cost
components include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g.,
indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and
warehousing) as well as inbound freight.

Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the
merchandise is shipped to the Company’s customers.  Included in inventory and promotional
merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the
difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable
value, based on various product sales projections.  This reserve is calculated using an estimated
obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical
trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.  In addition, and as necessary, specific
reserves for future known or anticipated events may be established.

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and
equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset’s
useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization.  The cost
of assets related to projects in progress of $72.1 million and $91.9 million as
of June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, respectively, is included in their
respective asset categories in the table below. 
For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally
on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging
from 3 to 40 years.  Leasehold improvements
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the
respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.

Company’s manufacturing process is included in cost of sales and all other
depreciation and amortization is included in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

The Company follows the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141”) and SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”).  These
statements establish financial accounting and reporting standards for acquired
goodwill and other intangible assets. 
Specifically, the standards address how acquired intangible assets
should be accounted for both at the time of acquisition and after they have
been recognized in the financial statements. 
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, intangible assets, including purchased
goodwill, must be evaluated for impairment. 
Those intangible assets that will continue to be classified as goodwill
or as other intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer amortized.

In accordance with SFAS
No. 142, the impairment testing is performed in two steps: (i) the Company
determines impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its
carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company measures the
amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with
the carrying amount of that goodwill.  To
determine fair value, the Company relies on three valuation models: guideline
public companies, acquisition analysis and discounted cash flow.  For goodwill valuation purposes only, the
revised fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to the assets and
liabilities of the business unit to arrive at an implied fair value of
goodwill, based upon known facts and circumstances, as if the acquisition
occurred at that time.

During fiscal 2007, the
Company purchased the remaining minority equity interest in the Bumble and
bumble business, recorded additional goodwill related to payments made in prior
years in connection with the acquisition of the Bobbi Brown brand (see Note 3 –
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108), and acquired businesses engaged in the
wholesale distribution and retail sale of the Company’s products in the United
States and other countries.  The combined
results of these activities increased goodwill by $20.4 million and other
intangible assets by $47.0 million.  Also
during fiscal 2007, as a result of the Company’s annual impairment testing, the
Company determined that the carrying values of its goodwill and intangible
assets related to the Darphin and Rodan + Fields brands exceeded their
respective fair values.  As such, the
Company reduced its goodwill by $7.3 million and other intangible assets by
$4.3 million, which are reported in selling, general and administrative
expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

During fiscal 2006, the
Company sold certain assets and operations of its reporting unit that marketed
and sold Stila brand products.  In
conjunction with the sale, the Company reduced its goodwill by $91.3 million,
which is reported as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying
consolidated statements of earnings.

Other Intangible Assets

Other intangible
assets include trademarks and patents, as well as license agreements and other
intangible assets resulting from or related to businesses purchased by the
Company.  Indefinite lived assets (e.g.,
trademarks) are not subject to amortization and are evaluated annually for
impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances indicate a
potential impairment.  Indefinite lived
assets of $70.5 million and $30.3 million at June 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, are classified as “Trademarks and other” in the table below.  Patents are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the legal term or the useful life of the patent,
approximately 20 years.  Other intangible
assets (e.g., non-compete agreements, customer lists) are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their expected period of benefit, approximately 2
years to 10 years.  Intangible assets
related to license agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
useful lives based on the term of the respective agreement, currently
approximately 10 years to 16 years, and are subject to impairment testing if
certain events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment.

Long-Lived
Assets

In accordance with SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”
long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets in question may
not be recoverable.  An impairment would
be recorded in circumstances where undiscounted cash flows expected to be

Revenue
Recognition

Revenues from merchandise
sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to
the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.  In the Americas region, sales are generally
recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the
Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions sales are generally
recognized based upon the customer’s receipt. 
In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of
sale, for example, at the Company’s retail stores.  Sales at the Company’s retail stores and online
are recognized in accordance with a 4-4-5 retail calendar.

Revenues are reported on
a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount
of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with
retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.  The Company’s practice is to accept product
returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and
approved.  In accepting returns, the
Company typically provides a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable
from that retailer.  As a percentage of
gross sales, returns were 4.2%, 5.0% and 4.6% in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Payments
to Customers

The Company is subject to
the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 01-9, “Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the
Vendor’s Products).”  In accordance with
this guidance, the Company has recorded the revenues generated from purchase
with purchase promotions as sales and the costs of its purchase with purchase
and gift with purchase promotions as cost of sales.  Certain other incentive arrangements require
the payment of a fee to customers based on their attainment of pre-established
sales levels.  These fees have been
recorded as a reduction of net sales in the accompanying consolidated
statements of earnings and were not material to the results of operations in
any period presented.

The Company enters into
transactions related to advertising, product promotions and demonstrations,
some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers.  These activities may be arranged either with
unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer.  The Company’s share of the cost of these
transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements
of earnings and were approximately $978 million, $912 million and $898 million
in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Advertising
and Promotion

Costs associated with
advertising are expensed during the year as incurred.  Global net advertising and promotion
expenses, which primarily consist of television, radio, print media, product
development and promotional expenses, such as products used as sales
incentives, were $1,916.3 million, $1,793.1 million and $1,793.7 million in
fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
These amounts include activities relating to purchase with purchase and
gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of
sales.

Advertising,
merchandising and sampling expenses included in operating expenses were
$1,715.3 million, $1,586.3 million and $1,577.1 million in fiscal 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively.

Research
and Development

Research and development
costs are included in advertising, merchandising and sampling and amounted to
$74.4 million, $72.0 million and $72.3 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred.

Operating Leases

The Company recognizes rent expense from operating leases with periods
of free and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the
applicable lease term.  The Company
considers lease renewals in the useful life of its leasehold improvements when
such renewals are reasonably assured. 
From time to time, the Company may receive capital improvement funding
from its lessors.  These amounts are
recorded as deferred liabilities and amortized over the remaining lease term as
a reduction of rent expense.

License
Arrangements

The Company’s license
agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and
sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof)
using the licensors’ trademarks.  The
licenses typically have an initial term of approximately 3 years to 11 years,
and are renewable subject to the Company’s compliance with the license
agreement provisions.  The remaining
terms, including the potential renewal periods, range from approximately 1 year
to 23 years.  Under each license, the
Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based
on net sales to third parties.

Most of the Company’s
licenses were entered into to create new business.  In some cases, the Company acquired, or
entered into, a license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a
pre-existing beauty products business. 
In those cases, intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over
their useful lives based on the terms of the agreement and are subject to
impairment testing if certain events or circumstances indicate a potential
impairment.

Stock-Based
Compensation

As of June 30, 2007, the
Company had established a number of share incentive programs as discussed in
more detail in Note 13 - Stock Programs. 
Prior to fiscal 2006, the Company applied the intrinsic value method as
outlined in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”), and related interpretations in accounting
for stock options and share units granted under these programs.  Under the intrinsic value method, no
compensation expense was recognized if the exercise price of the Company’s employee
stock options equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
the grant.  Accordingly, no compensation
cost was recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings
prior to fiscal year 2006 on stock options granted to employees, since all
options granted under the Company’s share incentive programs had an exercise
price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of
grant.

Effective July 1, 2005,
the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”).  This statement replaced SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS No. 123”) and superseded APB No. 25.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires that all stock-based
compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that
such cost be measured at the fair value of the award.  This statement was adopted using the modified
prospective method of application, which requires the Company to recognize
compensation expense on a prospective basis. 
Therefore, prior years’ financial statements have not been
restated.  Under this method, in addition
to reflecting compensation expense for new share-based awards, expense is also
recognized to reflect the remaining service period of awards that had been
included in pro-forma disclosures in prior years.  SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that excess tax
benefits related to stock option exercises be reflected as financing cash
inflows instead of operating cash inflows.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

The Company is a worldwide
manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair
care products.  Domestic and
international sales are made primarily to department stores, perfumeries and
specialty retailers.  The Company grants
credit to all qualified customers and does not believe it is exposed
significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.

During fiscal 2006,
Federated Department Stores, Inc. acquired The May Department Stores Company,
resulting in the merger of the Company’s previous two largest customers
(collectively “Macy’s, Inc.”).  This
customer sells products primarily within North America and accounted for $958.8

Management
Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses reported in those financial statements.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates and assumptions.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for
derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” (“SFAS No. 133”) as
amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. 
SFAS No. 133 also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments
as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured
at fair value.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation Number (“FIN”) 48, “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). 
FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”  FIN 48 prescribes a two-step evaluation
process for tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return.  The first step is recognition and the second
is measurement.  For recognition, an
enterprise judgmentally determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that a
tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of
related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the
position.  If the tax position meets the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is measured and recognized in the
financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
50% likely of being realized.  If a tax
position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the
benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements.

Tax positions that meet
the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date of FIN 48
may be recognized or, continue to be recognized, upon adoption of FIN 48.  The cumulative effect of applying the
provisions of FIN 48 shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance
of retained earnings for that fiscal year. 
FIN 48 will apply to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006,
with earlier adoption permitted.  In May
2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FIN 48-1, “Definition of
Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48, an amendment of FASB Interpretation
(FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FSP No. FIN 48-1”).  FSP No. FIN 48-1 provides guidance on how to
determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of
recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits.

The provisions of FIN 48
became effective for the Company on July 1, 2007.  While the Company is continuing to evaluate
the impact of the interpretation on the consolidated financial statements, the
Company expects the cumulative effect of adoption to reduce opening retained
earnings by approximately $10 million to $20 million with a corresponding
increase to reserves for uncertain tax positions.

In September 2006, the
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 157, “Fair
Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”) to clarify the definition of fair value,
establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand the disclosures on
fair value measurements.  SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an
exit price).  SFAS No. 157 also stipulates that, as a market-based
measurement, fair value measurement should be determined based on the
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
(a) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from
sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs) and (b) the
reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
(unobservable inputs).  SFAS No. 157 becomes effective for the Company in
its fiscal year ending June 30, 2009.  The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of the provisions of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial
statements.

In February 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities,” (“SFAS No. 159”) to permit all entities to choose to
elect, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments
at fair value.  An entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on
items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each
subsequent reporting date, and recognize upfront costs and fees related to
those items in earnings as incurred and not deferred.  SFAS No. 159
applies to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with early adoption
permitted for an entity that has also elected to apply the provisions of SFAS
No. 157.  An entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying SFAS No.
159, unless it chooses early adoption.  The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of the provisions of SFAS No. 159 on its consolidated
financial statements, if any, when it becomes effective for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 2009.

NOTE 3 – STAFF ACCOUNTING
BULLETIN NO. 108

In September 2006, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”)
No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB No. 108”), which sets
forth the SEC Staff’s views on the proper methods for quantifying errors when
there were uncorrected errors in a prior year.  Under SAB No. 108,
companies should evaluate a misstatement that existed in prior years based on
its impact on the current year income statement (the “rollover” approach), as
well as the cumulative effect of correcting such misstatements in the current
year’s ending balance sheet (the “iron curtain” approach), or collectively, the
“dual” approach.  In prior years, the
Company utilized the “rollover” approach to evaluate uncorrected misstatements
and believes the conclusions reached regarding its quantitative and qualitative
assessments of materiality of such items, both individually and in the
aggregate, were appropriate.

SAB No. 108 became
effective for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.  In accordance with the transition guidance
set forth in SAB No. 108, the Company elected to record a one-time
cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings to correct errors in
certain balance sheet accounts that arose in prior years, which previously had
been considered immaterial using the “rollover” approach.

Since the fiscal 1996
acquisition of the Bobbi Brown brand, the Company made payments to the sellers
based on a percentage of Bobbi Brown sales internationally, which should have
been capitalized as goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations,” as amended.  These
payments were previously recorded as selling, general and administrative
expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.  As such, goodwill increased by $10.5 million
and opening retained earnings increased by $6.7 million, net of tax, in the
accompanying fiscal 2007 consolidated balance sheet.

In connection with the
Company’s defined benefit pension obligations, certain liability amounts were
incorrectly reflected on the balance sheet in years prior to fiscal 2002, the
majority of which related to benefit plans for the Company’s international
operations.  As such, other noncurrent
liabilities decreased by $8.7 million and opening retained earnings increased
by $5.0 million, net of tax, in the accompanying fiscal 2007 consolidated
balance sheet.

Beginning in years prior
to fiscal 2003, inventory valuation was impacted by the incorrect application
of profit in ending inventory partially offset by the overstatement of
inventory obsolescence reserves, culminating in the current year net decrease
to inventory of $2.5 million and opening retained earnings decrease of $2.0
million, net of tax, in the accompanying fiscal 2007 consolidated balance
sheet.

In years prior to fiscal
2004, the Company overstated certain accrued liability positions.  As such, other accrued liabilities decreased
by $19.1 million and opening retained earnings increased by $14.5 million, net
of tax, in the accompanying fiscal 2007 consolidated balance sheet.

NOTE 4 –
ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE OF BUSINESSES AND LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS

During fiscal 2007, the
Company purchased the remaining minority equity interests in Bumble and Bumble
Products, LLC and Bumble and Bumble, LLC, which have been accounted for as
indefinite lived intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet.

On April 10, 2006 (the “Effective
Date”), the Company completed the sale of certain assets and operations of the
reporting unit that marketed and sold Stila brand products to Stila Corp. (the “Purchaser”),
an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., for consideration of $23.0 million.  The sale price included cash of $9.3 million,
a promissory note with a notional value of $13.3 million and a fair value of
$11.0 million and convertible preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation
preference of $5.0 million and a fair value of $2.7 million.  As additional consideration for the purchased
assets, and subject to the terms and conditions of the sale agreement, the
Purchaser will pay the Company an amount equal to two percent of the annual net
sales of the acquired business during the period commencing on the Effective
Date and ending August 20, 2019.  The
Company will use these proceeds to satisfy its commitment under the 1999
agreement pursuant to which it originally purchased the Stila business.  The Purchaser immediately assumed responsibility
for all decisions regarding the operations of the Stila business and the
Company agreed to divest itself of continuing involvement in the Stila
business, except as described below.

In fiscal 2006, the
Company recorded charges of $80.3 million (net of $43.3 million tax benefit) to
discontinued operations, which reflected the loss on the disposition of the
business of $69.9 million, net of tax, and adjustments to the fair value of
assets sold, the costs to dispose of those assets not acquired by the Purchaser
and other costs in connection with the sale. 
The charges also include the operating losses of $10.4 million, net of
tax, for fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. 
Net sales associated with the discontinued operations were $45.1 million
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. 
All statement of earnings information for fiscal 2005 has been restated
for comparative purposes, including the restatement of the makeup product
category and each of the geographic regions presented in Note 17 - Segment Data
and Related Information.

In order to facilitate
the transition of the Stila business to the Purchaser, the Company agreed to
provide certain information systems, accounting and other back office services
to the Purchaser in exchange for monthly service fees designed to recover the
estimated costs of providing these transition services.  The Company also agreed with the Purchaser to
provide certain distribution and online services.  In both cases, the services concluded in
fiscal 2007.

In fiscal 2006, the
Company settled its obligation, recorded as goodwill at June 30, 2005, related
to an earn-out provision in the Company’s fiscal 2000 acquisition of Jo Malone
Limited.

In
fiscal 2005, the Company acquired a majority equity interest in its former
distributor in Portugal.  The aggregate
payments made to acquire the distributor were funded by cash provided by
operations and did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations
or financial condition.  In addition, the
Company assumed debt and other long-term obligations of 4.6 million Euros
associated with the acquisition (approximately $5.6 million at acquisition date
exchange rates).  The debt is payable
semi-annually through February 2008 at a variable interest rate.

At various times during
fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company also acquired businesses engaged in the
wholesale distribution and retail sale of the Company’s products in the United
States and other countries.

The aggregate cost for
these activities, which includes purchase price, earn-out payments and
acquisition costs, was $61.2 million, $51.7 million, and $7.1 million in fiscal
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and each transaction was accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting. 
Accordingly, the results of operations for each of the acquired
businesses are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
commencing with its date of original acquisition.  Pro forma results of operations, as if each
of such businesses had been acquired as of the beginning of the year of
acquisition, have not been presented, as the impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial results would not have been material.

In fiscal 2007, the
Company signed an exclusive agreement to create fragrances and related products
to be sold to Coach Inc., which are available at Coach retail stores in the
United States.  In May 2007, the Company
entered into a license agreement with Ford Motor Company to create a fragrance
using the name Mustang.  Since fiscal
2006, the Company developed and sold fragrance products pursuant to a license
agreement with Daisy Fuentes.  Since
fiscal 2005, the Company developed and sold products under license agreements
for Sean John (announced in May 2004), Tom Ford (announced in April 2005) and
Missoni (announced in May 2005) and an Origins license agreement to develop and
sell products using the name of Dr. Andrew Weil (announced in October 2004).

Certain license agreements may require minimum royalty
payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending
on advertising and promotional activities. 
Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are earned
while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs
are incurred.

NOTE 5 – COST SAVINGS INITIATIVE

During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded special charges associated with a cost savings initiative that was designed to support its long-term financial objectives.  As part of this multi-faceted initiative, the Company had identified savings opportunities that include streamlined processes and organizational changes.  The principal component of the initiative was a voluntary separation program offered primarily to North America-based employees.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, involuntary separations were communicated to certain employees.  Under this initiative, the Company incurred expenses related to one-time termination benefits for 494 employees, of which 28 were involuntary, which benefits were based principally upon years of service.  Employees designated for separation under the cost savings initiative have been separated as of June 30, 2007.

In addition, the Company identified other cost savings opportunities to improve efficiencies in the Company’s distribution network and product offerings and to eliminate other nonessential costs.  These charges primarily related to employee severance for facilities that are closing, contract cancellations, counter and door closings and product returns.

As of June 30,
2007 and 2006, the Company had current net deferred tax assets of $124.0
million and $139.1 million, respectively, which are included in prepaid
expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.  In addition, the Company had
noncurrent net deferred tax liabilities of $16.6 million and $43.2 million as
of June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, respectively, which are included in other
noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

On July 13, 2006,
the Company announced a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
regarding its examination of the Company’s consolidated Federal income tax
returns for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1998 through June 30, 2001.  The settlement resolves previously disclosed
issues raised during the IRS’s examination, including transfer pricing and
foreign tax credit computations.  The
settlement of these issues resulted in a tax charge of approximately $46
million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and represents the aggregate
earnings impact of the settlement through fiscal 2006.  In addition, during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2006, the Company completed the repatriation of foreign earnings through
intercompany dividends as required under the provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “AJCA”).  In
connection with the repatriation, the Company updated the computation of the
related aggregate tax impact, resulting in a favorable adjustment of
approximately $11 million.  The tax
settlement, coupled with the AJCA favorable tax adjustment, resulted in a net
increase to the Company’s fiscal 2006 income tax provision of approximately $35
million.

Federal income and
foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $539 million
of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries at June 30, 2007.  The Company intends to reinvest these earnings
in its foreign operations indefinitely, except where it is able to repatriate
these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax
provision.  As of June 30, 2006 and 2005,
the Company had not provided federal income and foreign withholding taxes on
approximately $336 million and $90 million, respectively, of undistributed
earnings of international subsidiaries.

As of June 30,
2007 and 2006, certain international subsidiaries had tax loss carryforwards
for local tax purposes of approximately $11 million and $23 million,
respectively.  With the exception of $6.4
million of losses with an indefinite carryforward period as of June 30, 2007,
these losses expire at various dates through fiscal 2022.  Deferred tax assets, net of valuation
allowances, in the amount of $1.2 million and $0.7 million as of June 30, 2007
and 2006, respectively, have been recorded to reflect the tax benefits of the
losses not utilized to date.

A full valuation
allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for which, in the
opinion of management, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.

Earnings before
income taxes and minority interest include amounts contributed by the Company’s
international operations of approximately $696 million, $603 million and $583
million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Some of these earnings are taxed in the
United States.

THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Earnings from the Company’s
global operations are subject to tax in various jurisdictions both within and
outside the United States.  The Company
is routinely audited in these jurisdictions and these reviews can involve
complex issues that may require an extended period of time for resolution.  The Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns
have been examined and settled through fiscal 2001.

The Company is currently
under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years 2002 through
2005.  In addition, the Company has
ongoing audits in various state and local jurisdictions, as well as audits in
various foreign jurisdictions.

The Company provides tax
reserves for Federal, state, local and international exposures relating to
periods subject to audit.  The
development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax
issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical
estimate.  Although the outcome related
to these exposures is uncertain, in management’s opinion, adequate provisions
for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating
from these exposures.  In certain
circumstances, the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involve significant
uncertainties which render them inestimable. 
If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, including
those that cannot be quantified, they could have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations.

The Company has been
notified of a disallowance of tax deductions claimed by its subsidiary in Spain
for the fiscal years 1999 through 2002. 
As a result, the subsidiary was reassessed corporate income tax of
approximately $3 million for this period. 
An appeal against this reassessment was filed with the Chief Tax
Inspector.  On July 18, 2005, the final
assessment made by the Chief Tax Inspector was received, confirming the
reassessment made by the tax auditors. 
During fiscal 2006, an appeal against this final assessment was filed
with the Madrid Regional Economic Administrative Tribunal.  While no assurance can be given as to the
outcome in respect of this assessment, either during the administrative appeals
process or in the Spanish courts, management believes that the subsidiary
should ultimately be successful in its defense against the assessment.  Accordingly, no tax reserve has been
established for this potential exposure.

In April 2007, in anticipation of the issuance of the 2037 Senior Notes,
the Company entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swap
agreements on a notional amount totaling $210.0 million at a weighted average
all-in rate of 5.45%.  The forward-starting
interest rate swap agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new debt
and the Company recognized a loss in other comprehensive income of $0.9 million
that will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2037 Senior
Notes.  As a result of the
forward-starting interest rate swap agreements, the debt discount and debt
issuance costs, the effective interest rate on the 2037 Senior Notes will be
6.181% over the life of the debt.

As of June 30, 2007, the
Company had outstanding $290.9 million of 2017 Senior Notes consisting of
$300.0 million principal, an unamortized debt discount of $0.5 million, and an
$8.6 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest
rate swap.  The 2017 Senior Notes, when
issued in May 2007, were priced at 99.845% with a yield of 5.570%.  Interest payments are required to be made
semi-annually on May 15 and November 15. 
In April 2007, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement
with a notional amount of $250.0 million to effectively convert the fixed rate
interest on its outstanding 2017 Senior Notes to variable interest rates based
on six-month LIBOR.

As of June 30, 2007, the
Company had outstanding $239.7 million of 2012 Senior Notes consisting of
$250.0 million principal, an unamortized debt discount of $0.5 million, and a
$9.8 million adjustment to reflect the remaining termination value of an
interest rate swap.  The 2012 Senior
Notes, when issued in January 2002, were priced at 99.538% with a yield of
6.062%.  Interest payments are required
to be made semi-annually on January 15 and July 15.  In May 2003, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250.0 million to
effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its outstanding 2012 Senior
Notes to variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR.  In April 2007, the Company terminated this
interest rate swap.  The instrument,
which was classified as a liability, had a fair value of $11.1 million at cash
settlement, which included $0.9 million of accrued interest payable to the
counterparty.  Hedge accounting treatment
was discontinued prospectively and the offsetting adjustment to the carrying
amount of the related debt will be amortized to interest expense over the
remaining life of the debt.

As of June 30, 2007, the
Company had outstanding $197.4 million of 2033 Senior Notes consisting of
$200.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $2.6 million.  The 2033 Senior Notes, when issued in September
2003, were priced at 98.645% with a yield of 5.846%.  Interest payments are required to be made
semi-annually on April 15 and October 15. 
In May 2003, in anticipation of the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes,
the Company entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional
amount totaling $195.0 million at a weighted average all-in rate of 4.53%.  The treasury lock agreements were settled
upon the issuance of the new debt and the Company received a payment of $15.0
million that will be amortized against interest expense over the life of the
2033 Senior Notes.  As a result of the
treasury lock agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the
effective interest rate on the 2033 Senior Notes will be 5.395% over the life
of the debt.

In October 2006, the
Company entered into an overdraft borrowing agreement with a financial
institution pursuant to which its subsidiary in Turkey may be credited to
satisfy outstanding negative daily balances arising from its business
operations.  The total balance
outstanding at any time shall not exceed 20.0 million Turkish lira.  The interest rate applicable to each such
credit shall be 40 basis points per annum above the spot rate charged by the
lender or the lender’s floating call rate agreed to by the Company at each
borrowing.  There were no debt issuance
costs incurred related to this agreement. 
The outstanding balance at June 30, 2007 ($9.4 million at the exchange
rate at June 30, 2007) is classified as short-term debt on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet.

In March 2006, the
Company entered into a 3.0 billion yen revolving credit facility that expires
on March 24, 2009.  The interest rate on
borrowings under the credit facility is based on TIBOR (Tokyo Interbank Offered
Rate) and a 10 basis point facility fee is incurred on the undrawn
balance.  The Company borrowed 3.0
billion yen under the new facility on March 28, 2006 to repay the previously
outstanding 1.45% Japan term loan that matured on that date.  At June 30, 2007, the Company did not have
any borrowings outstanding under this facility.

In May 2006, the Company
entered into a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial
institution for the primary purpose of funding cash dividend repatriations from
certain of its international affiliates to the United States as permitted by
the AJCA.  Under the agreement, the
Company may borrow up to $150.0 million in the form of loan participation notes
through one of the Company’s subsidiaries in Europe.  The interest rate on borrowings under this
agreement will be an all-in fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to
by the Company at the date of each borrowing. 
Debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis.  At June 30, 2007, the Company did not have
any borrowings outstanding under this agreement.

The Company has a $750.0
million commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper in
the United States.  The Company’s
commercial paper is currently rated A-1 by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by
Moody’s.  The Company’s long-term credit
ratings are A with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A2 with a
stable outlook by Moody’s.  At June 30,
2007, the Company had $26.5 million of commercial paper outstanding, due at
various dates through July 2007 at an average interest rate of 5.40%, which may
be refinanced on a periodic basis as it matures at then-prevailing market
interest rates.

Effective April 2007, the
Company entered into a $750.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit
facility, expiring on April 26, 2012, primarily to provide credit support for
its commercial paper program, to repurchase shares of its common stock and for
general corporate purposes.  The new
facility replaced the Company’s prior, undrawn $600.0 million senior unsecured
revolving credit facility, which was effective since May 27, 2005.  Up to the equivalent of $250 million of the
facility is available for multi-currency loans. 
The interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on
LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly
announced by the administrative agent, or ½% plus the Federal funds rate.  The Company incurred costs of approximately
$0.3 million to establish the facility which will be amortized over the term of
the facility.  The credit facility has an
annual fee of $0.4 million, payable quarterly, based on the Company’s current
credit ratings.  The credit facility
contains various covenants, including one financial covenant which requires the
Company’s interest expense coverage ratio (as defined in the facility) at the
last day of each fiscal quarter to be greater than 3.0:1.0.  As of June 30, 2007, the Company was in
compliance with this financial covenant. 
There are no other conditions where the lender’s commitments may be
withdrawn, other than certain events of default, as defined in the facility,
which are customary for facilities of this type.

The Company maintains
uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world.  Interest rate terms for these facilities vary
by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit
ratings.  During fiscal 2007 and 2006,
the monthly average amount outstanding was approximately $20.0 million and $22.8
million, respectively, and the annualized monthly weighted average interest
rate incurred was approximately 5.96% and 5.56%, respectively.

NOTE 9 –
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Derivative
Financial Instruments

The Company addresses
certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management
that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  The Company primarily enters into foreign
currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the
effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company, if necessary, enters into
interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on
the Company’s aggregate liability portfolio. 
The Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes
other than trading.

All derivatives are
recognized at their fair value and are included in prepaid expenses and other
current assets or other accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance
sheets.  The associated gains and losses
on these derivatives are recorded in cost of goods sold and selling, general
and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of earnings.  On the date the derivative contract is
entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (i) a hedge of the fair
value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment
(“fair-value” hedge), (ii) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the
variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset
or liability (“cash-flow” hedge), (iii) a foreign-currency fair-value or
cash-flow hedge (“foreign-currency” hedge), (iv) a hedge of a net investment in
a foreign operation, or (v) other. 
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as
(and that is designated and qualifies as) a fair-value hedge, along with the
loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the
hedged risk (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in
current-period earnings.  Changes in the
fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as (and that is designated
and qualifies as) a cash-flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income,
until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows (e.g., when
periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in
earnings).  Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that are highly effective as (and that are designated and qualify
as) foreign-currency hedges are recorded in either current-period earnings or
other comprehensive income, depending on whether the hedge transaction is a
fair-value hedge (e.g., a hedge of a firm commitment that is to be settled in a
foreign currency) or a cash-flow hedge (e.g., a foreign-currency-denominated
forecasted transaction).  If, however, a
derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its
changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income within equity.  Furthermore, changes in the fair value of
other derivative instruments are reported in current-period earnings.

For each derivative
contract entered into where the Company looks to obtain special hedge
accounting treatment, the Company formally documents all relationships between
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective
and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk
being hedged, how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the
hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a
description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.  This process includes linking all derivatives
that are designated as fair-value, cash-flow, or foreign-currency hedges to
specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm
commitments or forecasted transactions. 
The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on
an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of
hedged items.  If it is determined that a
derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly
effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting
with respect to that derivative prospectively.

Foreign
Exchange Risk Management

The Company enters into
forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as
receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods
consistent with the Company’s identified exposures.  The purpose of the hedging activities is to
minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash
flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries.  Almost all foreign currency contracts are
denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large
financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating
agency.  The Company also enters into
foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a
high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.  The forward exchange contracts and foreign
currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been
designated as cash-flow hedges.  Hedge
effectiveness of forward exchange contracts is based on a hypothetical
derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to
the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.  Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency
option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.  The ineffective portion of both forward
exchange and foreign currency option contracts is recorded in current-period
earnings.  For hedge contracts that are
no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains
and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to
earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.  If it is probable that the forecasted
transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses accumulated in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to current-period earnings.  As of June 30, 2007, these cash-flow hedges
were highly effective, in all material respects.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As a matter of policy,
the Company only enters into contracts with counterparties that have at least
an “A” (or equivalent) credit rating. 
The counterparties to these contracts are major financial
institutions.  The Company does not have
significant exposure to any one counterparty. 
Exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the
counterparties is limited to only the recognized, but not realized, gains
attributable to the contracts. 
Management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote
and in any event would not be material to the Company’s consolidated financial
results.  The contracts have varying
maturities through the end of June 2008. 
Costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been
material to the Company’s consolidated financial results.  The Company does not utilize derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

At June 30, 2007, the
Company had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange
contracts in the amount of $862.0 million. 
The foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts (notional
value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the British pound ($148.1
million), Canadian dollar ($140.3 million), Euro ($124.1 million), Swiss franc
($113.1 million), Australian dollar ($79.3 million), Japanese yen ($42.6
million) and South Korean won ($33.6 million). 
As of June 30, 2007, all of the Company’s previously outstanding option
contracts have matured.

At June 30, 2006, the
Company had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange
contracts and option contracts in the amount of $782.6 million and $130.2
million, respectively.  The foreign
currencies included in forward exchange contracts (notional value stated in
U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($238.5 million), Swiss franc ($98.5
million), British pound ($92.4 million), Canadian dollar ($71.7 million),
Japanese yen ($50.6 million), Australian dollar ($50.5 million) and South
Korean won ($33.1 million).  The foreign
currencies included in the option contracts (notional value stated in U.S.
dollars) are principally the Japanese yen ($32.0 million), Euro ($27.7
million), Canadian dollar ($22.8 million), Swiss franc ($14.8 million) and
South Korean won ($13.4 million).

Interest
Rate Risk Management

The Company enters into
interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of
interest rates on its funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent
with the identified exposures.  All
interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated
as strong investment grade by a major rating agency.

In April 2007, the
Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount
totaling $250.0 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its
2017 Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR.  The interest rate swaps were designated as
fair-value hedges.  As of June 30, 2007,
these fair-value hedges were highly effective in all material respects.

In April 2007, the
Company terminated an interest-rate swap agreement with a notional amount of
$250.0 million to effectively convert fixed rate interest on its 2012 Senior
Notes to variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR.  This instrument was classified as a liability
and had a termination fair value of $11.1 million at cash settlement, which
included $0.9 million of accrued interest payable to the counterparty.  Hedge accounting treatment was discontinued
prospectively and the offsetting adjustment to the carrying amount of the
related debt will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of
the debt.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The following
methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:

Cash and cash
equivalents:

The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily
because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.

Short-term and long-term
debt:

The fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated
based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same
remaining maturities.  To a lesser
extent, debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying
amount approximates the fair value.

Foreign exchange and
interest rate contracts:

The fair value of forwards, swaps and options is the estimated amount
the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements.

The estimated fair values
of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

PENSION, DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Company
maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees
for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international operations.  Several plans provide pension benefits based
primarily on years of service and employees’ earnings.  In certain instances, the Company adjusts
benefits in connection with international employee transfers.

Retirement
Growth Account Plan (U.S.)

The Retirement
Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit
pension plan.  The Company’s funding
policy consists of an annual contribution at a rate that provides for future
plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages.  Such contribution is not less than the
minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended,
(“ERISA”) and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum
amount deductible for income tax purposes.

Restoration
Plan (U.S.)

The Company also has an
unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to
provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.

International
Pension Plans

The Company maintains
International Pension Plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit
pension plans.  The Company’s funding
policies for these plans are determined by local laws and regulations.

Post-retirement
Benefits

The Company maintains a
domestic post-retirement benefit plan which provides certain medical and dental
benefits to eligible employees. 
Employees hired after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for retiree
medical benefits when they retire. 
Certain retired employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are
eligible for participation in the plan. 
Contributions required and benefits received by retirees and eligible
family members are dependent on the age of the retiree.  It is the Company’s practice to fund these
benefits as incurred.

Certain of the Company’s
international subsidiaries and affiliates have post-retirement plans, although
most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs.

Plan
Summaries

In September 2006, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 106,
and 132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”).  SFAS No. 158 requires employers to
recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated
other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined benefit
pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.  Previous standards
required employers to disclose the complete funded status of its plans only in
the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  Changes in the funded
status of these plans will be recognized as they occur through other
comprehensive income.  Additional minimum
liability adjustments are no longer recognized upon adoption of SFAS No.
158.  As of June 30, 2007, the Company
prospectively adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of SFAS No.
158.  The incremental effect of applying
SFAS No. 158 on individual line items in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet is summarized below:

benefit plans are measured as of June 30; therefore, the measurement provisions
of SFAS No. 158 did not affect the Company’s existing valuation practices.  The adoption of SFAS No. 158 did not impact

The target asset

reviewed for adherence to the target policy and is rebalanced periodically
towards the target weights.

401(k)
Savings Plan (U.S.)

The Company’s 401(k)
Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”) is a contributory defined contribution plan
covering substantially all regular U.S. employees who have completed the hours
and service requirements, as defined by the plan document.  Regular full-time employees are eligible to
participate in the Savings Plan on the first day of the second month following
their date of hire.  During fiscal 2007,
the Savings Plan was enhanced to accelerate new regular full-time employee
eligibility, to increase the rate of Company contributions and to provide an
automatic enrollment feature.  The
Savings Plan is subject to the applicable provisions of ERISA.  The Company matches a portion of the
participant’s contributions after one year of service under a predetermined
formula based on the participant’s contribution level.  The Company’s contributions were
approximately $13.7 million, $10.6 million and $9.8 million for the fiscal
years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock
are not an investment option in the Savings Plan and the Company does not use
such shares to match participants’ contributions.

Deferred
Compensation

The Company accrues for
deferred compensation and interest thereon, and for the increase in the value
of share units pursuant to agreements with certain key executives and outside
directors.  The amounts included in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets under these plans were $69.6 million
and $71.0 million as of June 30, 2007 and 2006. 
The expense for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $8.5 million, $11.6
million and $10.2 million, respectively.

NOTE 11 – POST-EMPLOYMENT
BENEFITS OTHER THAN TO RETIREES

The Company provides
certain post-employment benefits to eligible former or inactive employees and
their dependents during the period subsequent to employment but prior to
retirement.  These benefits include
health care coverage and severance benefits. 
The cost of providing these benefits is accrued and any incremental
benefits were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial results.

NOTE 12 –
COMMON STOCK

As of June 30,
2007, the Company’s authorized common stock consists of 650 million shares of
Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, and 240 million shares of Class
B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share. 
Class B Common Stock is convertible into Class A Common Stock, in whole
or in part, at any time and from time to time at the option of the holder, on
the basis of one share of Class A Common Stock for each share of Class B Common
Stock converted.  Holders of the Company’s
Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of the
Company’s Class B Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share.

On September 18,
1998, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to
repurchase a total of up to 8.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock in the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market
conditions and other factors.  The Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10.0 million additional shares
of Class A Common Stock in both October 2002 and May 2004, and an additional
20.0 million in both May 2005 and February 2007, increasing the total
authorization under the share repurchase program to 68.0 million shares.  As of June 30, 2007, approximately 61.1
million shares have been purchased under this program.

In May 2005, the
Company purchased 1,872,000 shares of Class A Common Stock from a related party
for $73.5 million.  The repurchase was
part of the program described in the previous paragraph.

Accelerated
Share Repurchase Program

In March 2007, the
Company repurchased approximately 15,960,800 shares of its outstanding Class A
Common Stock for $750.0 million through an accelerated share repurchase program
with a financial counterparty.  These shares
were accounted for as treasury stock, carried at cost, and reflected as a
reduction to stockholders’ equity.  The
financial counterparty is expected to purchase shares for its own account in
the open market over a period ending no later than October 2007.  At the end of that period, the Company will
receive or pay a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of
the Company’s shares traded during the period (“VWAP”).  For the purpose of limiting the price
adjustment, approximately 10,640,500 shares purchased are subject to a cap,
which sets a maximum price for these shares. 
For the shares subject to the cap, the maximum price adjustment the
Company could pay is equal to $80.6 million. 
The cap is not carried on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as
an asset or liability because it is a component of a transaction involving the
Company’s equity securities and can potentially be settled by the issuance of
the Company’s common stock or a cash payment at the Company’s discretion.  If share settlement is elected by the
Company, the number of shares it could potentially issue at the end of the
repurchase period cannot currently be determined since the number will be
dependent upon the amount, if any, that the Company might owe as a price
adjustment, divided by the market price of its common stock on the settlement
date.  The maximum number of shares
potentially issuable is 25,000,000.

NOTE 13 –
STOCK PROGRAMS

As of June 30,
2007, the Company has three active equity compensation plans which include the Amended
and Restated Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan, the Fiscal 1999 Share Incentive
Plan and the Non-Employee Director Share Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Plans”).  These Plans currently provide for the
issuance of 32,894,400 shares, which consist of shares originally provided for
and shares transferred to the Plans from a previous plan and employment
agreement, to be granted in the form of stock-based awards to key employees,
consultants and non-employee directors of the Company.  As of June 30, 2007, approximately 8,532,300
shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved and available to be granted
pursuant to these Plans.  The Company may
satisfy the obligation of its stock-based compensation awards with either new
or treasury shares.  The Company’s stock
compensation awards outstanding at June 30, 2007 include stock options,
performance share units (“PSU”), restricted stock units (“RSU”) and share
units.

Stock-based compensation
expense is attributable to the granting of, and the remaining requisite service
periods of, stock options, PSUs, RSUs and share units.  Compensation expense attributable to net
stock-based compensation for fiscal 2007 and 2006 was $43.2 million ($28.3
million after tax) and $35.7 million ($23.4 million after tax), respectively,
or $.14 and $.11 for both basic and diluted net earnings per common share,
respectively.  As of June 30, 2007 and
2006, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based
awards was $30.4 million and $26.3 million, respectively, and the related
weighted-average period over which it is expected to be recognized is
approximately 1.8 years and 2.2 years, respectively.

Prior to the Company’s
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in fiscal 2006, SFAS No. 123 required that the
Company provide pro forma information regarding net earnings and net earnings
per common share as if compensation cost for the Company’s stock-based awards
had been determined in accordance with the fair value method prescribed
therein.  The Company had previously
adopted the disclosure portion of SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,” requiring quarterly SFAS No. 123 pro
forma disclosure.  The pro forma charge
for compensation cost related to stock-based awards granted was recognized over
the service period.  For stock options,
the service period represents the period of time between the date of grant and
the date each option becomes exercisable without consideration of acceleration
provisions (e.g., retirement, change of control, etc.).

The intrinsic value of a
stock option is the amount by which the current market value of the underlying
stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.

The exercise
period for all stock options generally may not exceed ten years from the date
of grant.  Stock option grants to
individuals generally become exercisable in three substantively equal tranches
over a service period of up to four years. 
The Company attributes the value of option awards on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of
the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards.

The per-share
weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted during fiscal
2007, 2006 and 2005 was $13.69, $11.87 and $16.45, respectively.  The total intrinsic value of stock options
exercised during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $72.3 million, $38.0 million
and $73.2 million, respectively.

Share Units

During fiscal 2007, the
Company issued 119,000 PSUs, which will be settled in stock subject to the
achievement of the Company’s net sales and net earnings per share goals for the
three years ending June 30, 2009. 
Settlement will be made pursuant to a range of opportunities relative to
the net sales and net earnings per share targets of the Company and, as such, the
compensation cost of the PSU is subject to adjustment based upon the
attainability of these target goals.  No
settlement will occur for results below the applicable minimum threshold and
additional shares shall be issued if performance exceeds the targeted
performance goals.  PSUs are accompanied
by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of
the PSU.  These awards are subject to the
provisions of the agreement under which the PSUs are granted.  The PSUs were valued at the closing market
value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant and generally
vest at the end of the performance period.

Cash Units

Certain
non-employee directors defer cash compensation in the form of cash payout share
units, which are not subject to the Plans. 
These cash units are classified as liabilities and, as such, their fair
value is adjusted to reflect the current market value of the Company’s Class A
Common Stock.  The Company recorded $0.8
million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million as compensation expense to reflect additional
deferrals and the change in the market value for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Legal
Proceedings

The Company is involved,
from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to its
business.  Management believes that the
outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material
adverse effect upon the Company’s results of operations or financial
condition.  However, management’s
assessment of the Company’s current litigation and other legal proceedings
could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions
or other proceedings pending against the Company not presently known to the
Company or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are
not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome
of such litigation or proceedings.

On March 30, 2005, the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California entered into
a Final Judgment approving the settlement agreement the Company entered into in
July 2003 with the plaintiffs, the other Manufacturer Defendants (as defined
below) and the Department Store Defendants (as defined below) in a consolidated
class action lawsuit that had been pending in the Superior Court of the State
of California in Marin County since 1998. 
On April 29, 2005, notices of appeal were filed by representatives of
two members of the purported class of consumers.  One of those appeals has since been
withdrawn.  If the appeal is resolved
satisfactorily, the Final Judgment will result in the plaintiffs’ claims being
dismissed, with prejudice, in their entirety in both the Federal and California
actions.  There has been no finding or
admission of any wrongdoing by the Company in this lawsuit.  The Company entered into the settlement
agreement solely to avoid protracted and costly litigation.  In connection with the settlement agreement,
the defendants, including the Company, will provide consumers with certain free
products and pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees.  To meet its obligations under the settlement,
the Company took a special pre-tax charge of $22.0 million, or $13.5 million
after-tax, equal to $.06 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003.  At June 30, 2007, the
remaining accrual balance was $16.3 million. 
The charge did not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition.  In the
Federal action, the plaintiffs, purporting to represent a class of all U.S.
residents who purchased prestige cosmetics products at retail for personal use
from eight department stores groups that sold such products in the United
States (the “Department Store Defendants”), alleged that the Department Store
Defendants, the Company and eight other manufacturers of cosmetics (the “Manufacturer
Defendants”) conspired to fix and maintain retail prices and to limit the
supply of prestige cosmetics products sold by the Department Store Defendants
in violation of state and Federal laws. The plaintiffs sought, among other
things, treble damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees, interest and costs.

In 1999, the Office of
the Attorney General of the State of New York (the “State”) notified the
Company and ten other entities that they had been identified as potentially
responsible parties (“PRPs”) with respect to the Blydenburgh landfill in Islip,
New York.  Each PRP may be jointly and
severally liable for the costs of investigation and cleanup, which the State
estimated in 2006 to be approximately $19.7 million for all PRPs.  In 2001, the State sued other PRPs (including
Hickey’s Carting, Inc., Dennis C. Hickey and Maria Hickey, collectively the “Hickey
Parties”), in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York to
recover such costs in connection with the site, and in September 2002, the
Hickey Parties brought contribution actions against the Company and other
Blydenburgh PRPs.  These contribution
actions seek to recover, among other things, any damages for which the Hickey
Parties are found liable in the State’s lawsuit against them, and related costs
and expenses, including attorneys’ fees. 
In June 2004, the State added the Company and other PRPs as defendants
in its pending case against the Hickey Parties.  In April 2006, the Company and other
defendants added numerous other parties to the case as third-party
defendants.  The Company and certain
other PRPs have engaged in settlement discussions which to date have been
unsuccessful.  Settlement negotiations with
the new third-party defendants, the State, the Company and other defendants
began in July 2006.  The Company has
accrued an amount which it believes would be necessary to resolve its share of
this matter.  If settlement discussions
are not successful, the Company intends to vigorously defend the pending
claims.  While no assurance can be given
as to the ultimate outcome, management believes that the resolution of the
Blydenburgh matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition.

On March 30, 2006, a
purported securities class action complaint captioned Thomas S. Shin, et al. v.
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., et al., was filed against the Company and
certain of its officers and directors (collectively the “Defendants”) in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The complaint alleged that the Defendants
made statements during the period April 28, 2005 to October 25, 2005 in press
releases, the Company’s public filings and during conference calls with
analysts that were materially false and misleading and that artificially
inflated the price of the Company’s stock. 
The complaint alleged claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The
complaint also asserted that during the class period, certain executive
officers and the trust for the benefit of a director sold shares of the Company’s
Class A Common Stock at artificially inflated prices.  Three additional purported securities class
action complaints were subsequently filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York containing similar allegations.  On July 10, 2006, the Court consolidated
these actions under the caption In re: Estée Lauder Companies Securities Litigation,
appointed lead plaintiff, and approved the selection of lead counsel.  A consolidated amended complaint addressing
the same issues as the original complaint was filed on September 8, 2006.  The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the
amended complaint on November 7, 2006. 
On May 21, 2007, the Court granted the motion to dismiss and gave
plaintiff until June 4, 2007 to file an amended complaint.  The plaintiff
did not file an amended complaint by the deadline.

On April 10, 2006,
a shareholder derivative action complaint captioned Miriam Loveman v. Leonard
A. Lauder, et al., was filed against certain of the Company’s officers and all
of its directors as of that date (collectively the “Derivative Action
Defendants”) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York.  The complaint alleged that the Derivative Action Defendants
breached their fiduciary duties to the Company based on the same alleged course
of conduct identified in the complaint described above.  On May 2, 2007,
the judge granted the Derivative Action Defendants’ motion to dismiss because
the plaintiff failed to satisfy the requirement under Delaware law that she
make a demand on the Board of Directors to pursue litigation on behalf of the
Company prior to initiating the litigation herself.  The plaintiff has not
taken any further action with respect to this matter.

NOTE 15 –
NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS

Under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS No. 115”),
available-for-sale securities are recorded at market value.  Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of
the related tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from
earnings and are reported as a component of stockholders’ equity until
realized.  The Company’s investments
subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 115 are treated as available-for-sale
and, accordingly, the applicable investments have been adjusted to market value
with a corresponding adjustment, net of tax, to net unrealized investment gains
in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
Included in accumulated other comprehensive income was an unrealized
investment gain (net of deferred taxes) of $0.8 million and $0.5 million at
June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

NOTE 17 – SEGMENT DATA AND
RELATED INFORMATION

Reportable operating
segments, as defined by SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,” include components of an enterprise about
which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly
by the chief operating decision maker (the “Chief Executive”) in deciding how
to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  As a result of the similarities in the
manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company’s
products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial
statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by
the Chief Executive.  Although the
Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also
evaluates performance on a product category basis.

While the Company’s
results of operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief
Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to
industry statistics.  Accordingly, net
sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating income are available with
respect to the manufacture and distribution of skin care, makeup, fragrance,
hair care and other products.  These
product categories meet the FASB’s definition of operating segments and,
accordingly, additional financial data are provided below.  The “other” segment includes the sales and
related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit the
definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care.

The Company evaluates
segment performance based upon operating income, which represents earnings
before income taxes, minority interest, net interest expense and discontinued
operations.  The accounting policies for
each of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary
of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization
charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales.  The assets and liabilities of the Company are
managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the
consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced
for the Chief Executive or included herein.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(a) Fiscal 2006 results
included $93.0 million, after-tax, or $.43 per diluted share in special charges
related to the Company’s cost savings initiative and tax-related matters.  Included in the charges was an operating
expense charge of $92.1 million, equal to $.27 per diluted common share related
to the cost savings initiative.  The
results also included a special tax charge related to a settlement with the IRS
regarding an examination of the Company’s consolidated Federal income tax
returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2001, and represents the aggregate
earnings impact of the settlement through fiscal 2006.  The settlement resulted in an increase to the
Company’s fiscal 2006 income tax provision and a corresponding decrease in
fiscal 2006 net earnings of approximately $46 million, or approximately $.21
per diluted common share.  During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company completed the repatriation of
foreign earnings through intercompany dividends under the provisions of the
AJCA.  In connection with the
repatriation, the Company updated the computation of the related aggregate tax
impact, resulting in a favorable adjustment of approximately $11 million, or
approximately $.05 per diluted common share, to the Company’s initial tax
charge of $35 million recorded in fiscal 2005. 
The tax settlement, coupled with the AJCA favorable tax adjustment,
resulted in a net increase to the Company’s fiscal 2006 income tax provision
and a corresponding decrease in fiscal 2006 net earnings of approximately $35
million, or approximately $.16 per diluted common share.

(b) In April 2006,
the Company completed the sale of certain assets and operations of the
reporting unit that marketed and sold Stila brand products.

NOTE 19 – UNAUDITED SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS

In July 2007, the Company
acquired Ojon Corporation, which markets and sells Ojon hair care and skin care
products primarily through direct response television and specialty
stores.  In August 2007, the Company sold
Rodan + Fields back to its founders.

In August 2007, pursuant
to the Company’s accelerated share repurchase program (see Note 12 — Common
Stock), the financial counterparty informed the Company that it had completed
its obligations under the agreement.  The
per-share price paid by the Company at inception of the program exceeded the
final VWAP.  Accordingly, the Company
received 97,417 shares of its common stock from the financial counterparty as a
price adjustment and final settlement, which was recorded as treasury stock and
additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet.
