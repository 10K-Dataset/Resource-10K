DEFINITION OF
ABBREVIATIONS AND INDUSTRY TERMS






COMPANY OVERVIEW

Xcel
Energy is a holding company, with subsidiaries engaged primarily in the utility
business.  In 2005, Xcel Energy’s
continuing operations included the activity of four wholly owned utility
subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in 10 states. These
utility subsidiaries are NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS. These
utilities serve customers in portions of Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota,
New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin.  Along with WGI, an interstate natural gas
pipeline company, these companies comprise our continuing regulated utility
operations

Xcel
Energy’s nonregulated subsidiaries in continuing operations include Eloigne and
Planergy International, Inc. 
Planergy International, Inc. closed and began selling a majority of
its business operations in 2003 with all operations ceasing in 2004.

Discontinued utility operations include the activity of Viking, which
was sold in January 2003; BMG, which was sold in October 2003; and
Cheyenne, which was sold in January 2005.

In April 2005, Zachry Group, Inc. acquired all of the
outstanding shares of UE, a nonregulated subsidiary.  In August 2005, Xcel Energy’s board of
directors approved management’s plan to pursue the sale of Quixx Corp., a
former subsidiary of UE that partners in cogeneration projects that was not
included in the sale of UE to Zachry.  As
a result, Xcel Energy is reporting UE and Quixx as components of discontinued
operations for all periods presented.

During
2004, Xcel Energy’s board of directors approved management’s plan to pursue the
sale of Seren Innovations, Inc.   On
Nov. 3, 2005, Xcel Energy completed the sale of Seren’s California assets
to WaveDivision Holdings, LLC.  On Jan. 9,
2006, Xcel Energy completed the sale of Seren’s Minnesota assets to Charter
Communications.

During
2003, Xcel Energy divested its ownership interest in NRG.  On May 14, 2003, NRG filed for
bankruptcy to restructure their debt.  As
a result of the reorganization, Xcel Energy relinquished its ownership interest
in NRG.  Xcel Energy made payments of
$752 million to NRG in 2004.  During
2003, the board of directors of Xcel Energy also approved management’s plan to
exit certain businesses conducted by the nonregulated subsidiaries Xcel Energy
International Inc. and e prime inc.  NRG,
Xcel Energy International, e prime, Seren, UE and Quixx are accounted for as
components of discontinued operations.

For
more information regarding Xcel Energy’s discontinued operations, see Note 2 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Historically, Xcel Energy
has been a registered holding company under

the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935

(PUHCA).  As a registered holding
company, Xcel Energy, its utility subsidiaries and certain of its non-utility
subsidiaries have been subject to extensive regulation by the SEC under PUHCA
with respect to numerous matters, including issuances and sales of securities,
acquisitions and sales of certain utility properties, payments of dividends out
of capital and surplus, and intra-system sales of certain non-power goods and
services.  In addition, the PUHCA
generally limited the ability of registered holding companies to acquire
additional public utility systems and to acquire and retain businesses
unrelated to the utility operations of the holding company.

On August 8, 2005,
President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Energy Act),
significantly changing many federal statutes and repealing PUHCA as of February 8,
2006.  As part of the repeal of PUHCA,
FERC was given more authority over the merger and acquisition of public
utilities and more authority over the books and records of public
utilities.  Despite these increases in
FERC’s authority, Xcel Energy believes that the repeal of PUHCA will lessen its
regulatory burdens and give it more flexibility in the event it were to choose
to expand its utility or non-utility businesses.

Besides repealing PUHCA, the
Energy Act is also expected to have substantial long-term effects on energy
markets, energy investment and regulation of public utilities and holding
company systems by the FERC and DOE. 
FERC and DOE are in various stages of rulemaking in implementing the
Energy Act.  While the precise impact of
these rulemakings cannot be determined at this time, Xcel Energy generally
views the Energy Act as legislation that will enhance the utility industry
going forward.

Xcel
Energy was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in 1909

.

Xcel
Energy’s executive offices are located at 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minn.
55402.  Its Web site address is www.xcelenergy.com.  Xcel Energy makes available, free of charge
through its Web site, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those
reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after
such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  In addition,


the
Xcel Energy Guidelines on Corporate Governance and Code of Conduct also are
available on its Web site.

NSP-Minnesota

NSP-Minnesota
was incorporated in 2000 under the laws of Minnesota.  Prior to 2000, the regulated utility
operations currently conducted by NSP-Minnesota were conducted by the legal
entity now operating under the name Xcel Energy.  NSP-Minnesota is an operating utility engaged
in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity
in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. 
The wholesale customers served by NSP-Minnesota comprised approximately
X percent of the total Kwh sales in 2005. 
NSP-Minnesota also purchases, transports, distributes and sells natural
gas to retail customers and transports customer-owned natural gas in Minnesota
and North Dakota.  NSP-Minnesota provides
electric utility service to approximately 1.3 million customers and gas utility
service to approximately 0.5 million customers.

The
electric production and transmission system of NSP-Minnesota is managed as an
integrated system with that of NSP-Wisconsin, jointly referred to as the NSP
System. The electric production and transmission costs of the entire NSP System
are shared by NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin. 
A FERC-approved agreement between the two companies, called the
Interchange Agreement, provides for the sharing of all costs of generation and
transmission facilities of the NSP System, including capital costs.

NSP-Minnesota owns the following direct subsidiaries: United Power and
Land Co., which holds real estate; and NSP Nuclear Corp., which holds
NSP-Minnesota’s interest in the NMC.  NSP
Financing I, a former special purpose financing trust of NSP-Minnesota, was
dissolved in September 2003.

NSP-Wisconsin

NSP-Wisconsin
was incorporated in 1901 under the laws of Wisconsin.  NSP-Wisconsin is an operating utility engaged
in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to
approximately 242,000 customers in portions of northwestern Wisconsin and in
the western portion of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

The wholesale customers served by
NSP-Wisconsin comprised approximately 8 percent of NSP-Wisconsin’s total Kwh
sales in 2005.

NSP-Wisconsin also purchases, transports,
distributes and sells natural gas to retail customers and transports
customer-owned natural gas in the same service territory to approximately
98,000 customers.  See the discussion of
the integrated management of the electric production and transmission system of
NSP-Wisconsin under NSP-Minnesota, discussed previously.

NSP-Wisconsin
owns the following direct subsidiaries: Chippewa and Flambeau Improvement Co.,
which operates hydro reservoirs; Clearwater Investments Inc., which owns
interests in affordable housing; and NSP Lands, Inc., which holds real
estate.

PSCo

PSCo
was incorporated in 1924 under the laws of Colorado. PSCo is an operating
utility engaged primarily in the generation, purchase, transmission,
distribution and sale of electricity. 
PSCo also purchases, transports, distributes and sells natural gas to
retail customers and transports customer-owned natural gas.  PSCo serves approximately 1.3 million
electric customers and approximately 1.2 million natural gas customers in
Colorado.

The wholesale customers
served by PSCo comprised approximately 23 percent of PSCo’s total Kwh sales in
2005.

PSCo
owns the following direct subsidiaries: 1480 Welton, Inc., which owns
certain real estate interests for PSCo; PSRI, which owns and manages permanent
life insurance policies on certain current and former employees; and Green and
Clear Lakes Company, which owns water rights. PSCo also holds a controlling
interest in several other relatively small ditch and water companies whose
capital requirements are not significant. 
PSCo Capital Trust I, a former special purpose financing trust of PSCo,
was dissolved in December 2003.

SPS

SPS was
incorporated in 1921 under the laws of New Mexico. SPS is an operating utility
engaged primarily in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and
sale of electricity. SPS serves approximately 395,000 electric customers in
portions of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas. The wholesale customers
served by SPS comprised approximately 38 percent of SPS’s total Kwh sales in
2005.  A major portion of SPS’ retail
electric operating revenues is derived from operations in Texas.  In October 2005, SPS reached a

definitive agreement to sell its delivery system operations in Oklahoma, Kansas
and a small portion of Texas to Tri-County Electric Cooperative.  The transaction, subject to regulatory
approvals, is expected to


be completed in
2006.

Southwestern
Public Service Capital I, a former special purpose financing trust of SPS, was
dissolved in January 2004.

Other Regulated
Subsidiaries

WGI was incorporated in 1990 under the laws of Colorado. WGI is a small
interstate natural gas pipeline company engaged in transporting natural gas
from the PSCo system near Chalk Bluffs, Colo., to the Cheyenne system near
Cheyenne, Wyo.

ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS

Electric Utility Trends

Overview

Utility Industry Growth

— Xcel Energy intends to focus on growing
through investments in electric and natural gas rate base to meet growing
customer demands and to maintain or increase reliability and quality of service
to customers.  Xcel Energy will file rate
cases with state and federal regulators to earn a return on its investments and
recover costs of operations.

Utility
Restructuring and Retail Competition

— The structure of
the utility industry has been subject to change.  Merger and acquisition activity has been
significant as utilities combined to capture economies of scale or establish a
strategic niche in preparing for the future. 
Some states have implemented some form of retail electric utility
competition.  Much of Texas has
implemented retail competition, but it is presently limited to utilities within
the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which does not include SPS.  Under current law, SPS can file a plan to
implement competition, subject to regulatory approval, in Texas on or after Jan. 1,
2007.  However, SPS has no plan to
implement retail competition in its service area.  In 2002, NSP-Wisconsin began providing its
Michigan electric customers with the opportunity to select an alternative
electric energy provider.  To date, no
NSP-Wisconsin customers have selected an alternative electric energy provider.

The retail electric business
does face some competition as industrial and large commercial customers have
some ability to own or operate facilities to generate their own electricity. In
addition, customers may have the option of substituting other fuels, such as
natural gas or steam/chilled water for heating, cooling and manufacturing
purposes, or the option of relocating their facilities to a lower cost
region.  While each of Xcel Energy’s
Utility Subsidiaries face these challenges, these subsidiaries believe their
rates are competitive with currently available alternatives.

Summary of Recent Federal
Regulatory Developments

The FERC has jurisdiction over rates for electric transmission service
in interstate commerce and electric energy sold at wholesale, hydro facility
licensing, accounting practices and certain other activities of Xcel Energy’s
Utility Subsidiaries.  State and local
agencies have jurisdiction over many of Xcel Energy’s activities, including
regulation of retail rates and environmental matters.

FERC Rules Implementing
Energy Act

- The Energy Act repealed PUHCA
effective Feb. 8, 2006.  In
addition, the Energy Act required the FERC to conduct several rulemakings to
adopt new regulations to implement various aspects of the Energy Act.  Since Aug. 2005, the FERC has completed
or initiated the proceedings to modify its regulations on a number of subjects,
including:

•

Adopting new
regulations to implement the Energy Act repeal of PUHCA by establishing rules for
accounting procedures for holding company systems, including cost allocation rules for
transactions between companies within a holding company system;

•

Adopting new
regulations to implement changes to the FERC’s merger and asset transfer
authority under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act;

•

Adopting new “market
manipulation regulations” prohibiting any
“manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance” in wholesale natural gas and
electricity commodity and transportation or transmission markets and
interpreting this standard in a manner consistent with Rule 10b-5 of the
SEC; violations are subject to potential civil penalties of up to $1
million per day;

•

Adopting
regulations to establish a national Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to
replace the voluntary North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC)
structure, and requiring the ERO to establish mandatory reliability


standards and imposition of financial or
other penalties for violations of adopted standards; NERC is expected to apply
to become designated as the ERO later in 2006;

•

Adopting rules to
implement changes to the Public Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA) to allow
utility ownership of Qualifying Facilities (QFs) and strengthening the thermal
energy requirements for entities seeking to be QFs;

•

Proposing rules that
would allow a utility to seek to eliminate its mandatory QF power purchase
obligation for utilities in organized wholesale energy markets;

•

Proposing rules to
establish incentives for investment in new electric transmission infrastructure.

Xcel Energy cannot predict the ultimate impact the new regulations will
have on its operations or financial results.

Market-Based Rate
Authority

— The FERC regulates the wholesale sale
of electricity.  In order to obtain
market-based rate authorization from the FERC, utilities are required to submit
analyses demonstrating whether they have market power in the relevant
markets.  Xcel Energy and its utility
subsidiaries were previously granted market-based rate authority by the
FERC.  However, the FERC has subsequently
modified its standards making it more difficult for utilities to demonstrate
that they do not have market power and thus more difficult to obtain
market-based rate authority, particularly in their own service territories.

On Feb. 7, 2005, Xcel Energy on behalf of itself and the utility
subsidiaries filed an updated market-power analysis that applied FERC’s new
standards.  This analysis demonstrated
that all of the Utility Subsidiaries, with the exception of PSCo, passed the
pivotal supplier analysis in their own control areas and all adjacent markets,
but that all failed the market share analysis in their own control areas, and
in the case of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin, which jointly operate a single
control area and accordingly are analyzed as one company, in certain adjacent
markets.

In June 2005, the FERC initiated a proceeding to investigate PSCo’s
and SPS’ market-based rate authority within their own control areas.  The refund effective date that has been set
as part of that investigation for such sales is Aug. 12, 2005.  Because of the commencement of the MISO Day 2
market, and the FERC’s decision consistent with other precedent to analyze
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin as part of that larger market, the FERC is not
addressing NSP-Minnesota’s and NSP-Wisconsin’s market power in that
investigation. The FERC did require that Xcel Energy make a compliance filing
providing information, including information regarding the FERC’s affiliate
abuse component of its market power analysis and the allegations regarding that
component made by an intervenor within 30 days of the date of issuance of its
order.  The latter compliance filing was
submitted on July 5, 2005.

On Aug. 1, 2005, SPS and PSCo submitted a filing to withdraw their
market-based rate authority with respect to sales within their control
areas.  SPS and PSCo proposed to charge
existing cost-based rates for sales into the SPS and PSCo control areas.  In October 2005, PSCo and SPS filed
revised tariff sheets to reflect that limitation on their market-based rate
authority.  Certain intervenors are still
contending that the FERC must hold an investigation regarding SPS’ market power
and the rates that SPS is proposing to charge where it has relinquished
market-based rate authority.  The matter
is pending before the FERC.

Electric Transmission Rate Regulation

— The FERC also regulates the rates charged
and terms and conditions for electric transmission services.  FERC policy encourages utilities to turn over
the functional control over their electric transmission assets and the related
responsibility for the sale of electric transmission services to an RTO.  NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin are members
of the MISO, which began RTO operations in early 2002.  SPS is a member of the SPP, which proposes
to begin RTO operations on May 1, 2006.  SPS has been a member of SPP’s
regional transmission tariff since 2001. 
Each RTO separately files for regional transmission tariff rates for
approval by FERC.  All members within
that RTO are then subjected to those rates. 
SPS has not yet filed for state regulatory authorization in New Mexico
to transfer functional control of its transmission system to the SPP RTO.  PSCo is currently participating with other
utilities in the development of an RTO.

Centralized Regional Wholesale Markets

– FERC rules require RTO’s to operate
centralized regional wholesale energy markets. 
The FERC required the MISO to begin operation of a “Day 2” energy market
on April 1, 2005.  MISO uses
security constrained regional economic dispatch and congestion management using
locational marginal pricing (LMP) and FTR’s. 
The Day 2 market is intended to provide more efficient generation
dispatch over the 15 state MISO region.


NSP-Minnesota

Ratemaking Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of
Jurisdiction

—
Retail rates, services and other aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s operations are
regulated by the MPUC, the NDPSC and the SDPUC within their respective states.
The MPUC has regulatory authority over aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s financial
activities, including security issuances, property transfers, mergers and
transactions between NSP-Minnesota and its affiliates. In addition, the MPUC
reviews and approves NSP-Minnesota’s electric resource plans for meeting
customers’ future energy needs. The MPUC also certifies the need for generating
plants greater than 50 MW and transmission lines greater than 100 KV.

The
MPUC is also empowered to select and designate sites for new power plants with
a capacity of 50 MW or more and wind energy conversion plants with a capacity
of five MW or more. It also designates routes for electric transmission lines
with a capacity of 100 KV or more. No power plant or transmission line may be
constructed in Minnesota except on a site or route designated by the MPUC. The
NDPSC and SDPUC have regulatory authority over the need for certain generating
and transmission facilities, and the siting and routing of certain new
generation and transmission facilities in North Dakota and South Dakota,
respectively.

NSP-Minnesota
is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to its wholesale
electric operations, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale and the
transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. NSP-Minnesota has received
authorization from the FERC to make wholesale electric sales at market-based
prices (see market-based rate authority discussion) and is a transmission-owner
member of the MISO RTO.

Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation
Cost Recovery Mechanisms

— NSP-Minnesota’s retail electric rate schedules in Minnesota, North
Dakota and South Dakota include a FCA that provides for monthly adjustments to
billings and revenues for changes in prudently incurred cost of fuel, fuel
related items and purchased energy. 
NSP-Minnesota is permitted to recover these costs through FCA mechanisms
individually approved by the regulators in each jurisdiction.  The FCA mechanisms allow NSP-Minnesota to
bill customers for the cost of fuel and fuel related costs used to generate
electricity at its plants and energy purchased from other suppliers.  With NSP-Minnesota’s participation in the
MISO Day 2 market, questions have been raised regarding the inclusion of
certain MISO charges in the FCA.  For
further discussion, see NSP-Minnesota Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory
Proceedings – MPUC.  In general, capacity
costs are not recovered through the FCA. 
NSP-Minnesota’s electric wholesale customers also have a FCA provision
in their contracts.

NSP-Minnesota
is required by Minnesota law to spend a minimum of 2 percent of Minnesota
electric revenue on conservation improvement programs.  These costs are recovered through an annual
cost recovery mechanism for electric conservation and energy management program
expenditures. NSP-Minnesota is required to request a new cost recovery level
annually.

Performance-Based Regulation

— In December 2003, the MPUC voted to
approve NSP-Minnesota’s MERP proposal to convert two coal-fueled electric generating
plants to natural gas, and to install advanced pollution control equipment at a
third coal-fired plant.  All three plants
are located in the Minneapolis - St. Paul metropolitan area. These improvements
are expected to significantly reduce air emissions from these facilities, while
increasing the capacity at system peak by 300 MW. The projects are expected to
come on line between 2007 and 2009, at a cumulative investment of approximately
$1 billion.  The MPUC approved a rate
rider to recover prudent costs of the projects from Minnesota customers
beginning Jan. 1, 2006, including a rate of return on the construction
work in progress.  The MPUC approval has
a sliding ROE scale based on actual construction cost compared with a target
level of construction costs (based on an equity ratio of 48.5 percent and debt
of 51.5 percent) to incentivize NSP-Minnesota to control construction costs.


Pending and
Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings

MISO Operations
—

NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin are members of the MISO. The MISO is an RTO that provides
regional transmission tariff administration services for electric transmission
systems, including those of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin.  In 2002, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin
received all required regulatory approvals to transfer functional control of
their high voltage (100 KVand above) transmission systems to the MISO. The MISO
membership grants MISO functional control over the operations of these
facilities and the facilities of certain neighboring electric utilities.

On April 1, 2005, MISO initiated a regional wholesale energy
market using LMP and FTR’s Day 2 market pursuant to its TEMT.  While it is anticipated the Day 2 market will
provide efficiencies through region-wide generation dispatch and increased
reliability, as well as long-term benefits through dispatch of power from the
most cost-effective sources of generation or transmission, there are costs
associated with the Day 2 market. 
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have requested recovery of these costs
within their respective jurisdictions. 
For further discussion, see Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory
Proceedings

–
MPUC.

Within MISO, an
independent market monitor reviews market bids and prices to identify any
unusual activity.  The FERC has notified
Xcel Energy that it is investigating pricing and market-related issues.  Xcel Energy and other market participants
continue to work with MISO, the independent market monitor and the FERC to
resolve Day 2 market implementation issues such as dispatch methods and
settlement calculation details.  Xcel
Energy also intends to work with these parties to resolve any identified
issues.

New business processes, systems and internal controls over financial
reporting were planned and implemented by Xcel Energy and MISO during the
second quarter of 2005 to conduct business within the MISO Day 2 market.  Xcel Energy continues to validate these
changes and to review the energy costs and revenues determined by MISO.  Xcel Energy and other market participants
have disputed certain transactions.

MISO Long Term
Transmission Pricing

- On Oct. 7, 2005, MISO
filed proposed tariff revisions that would allow MISO to regionalize the cost
of certain future high voltage transmission lines owned by specific
transmission owners but constructed pursuant to the MISO transmission expansion
plan.  The proposed tariffs reflect
stakeholder input to MISO.  MISO proposed
the tariff revisions to be effective on Feb. 4, 2006.  Xcel Energy generally supports the proposed
tariff revisions, which should encourage transmission construction by
regionalizing a share of the cost of projects providing regional benefits.  Comments on or protests to the proposed
tariff revisions were filed at FERC in late 2005.  In February 2006, the FERC issued an
order accepting the tariff revisions, subject to modifications and additional
procedures.  Xcel Energy cannot predict
the ultimate impact of the MISO tariff proposed at this time.

MISO/PJM SECA

- On Nov. 18, 2004, FERC issued an
order approving portions of a plan providing for continued use of “license
plate” rates for the MISO/PJM region, but rejecting proposed transition
payments to compensate transmission owners for reductions in transmission
revenues.  FERC instead ordered the MISO
and PJM to file a Seams Elimination Charge Adjustment (SECA) transition
mechanism.  The replacement compliance
filings were effective Dec. 1, 2004. 
The FERC order eliminates any transition payments and the SECA filings
instead provide for both revenues and payments that net to approximately
$86,000 in revenues per month to NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin in 2005.

Various
parties sought rehearing of the Nov. 18, 2004 order and/or filed
objections to the Nov. 24, 2004 SECA compliance filings.  On Feb. 10, 2005, the FERC issued an
order accepting the SECA filings effective Dec. 1, 2004, subject to
refund, and set the proposals for hearings. 
The SECA proposals are now in hearings at the FERC.  Certain parties have proposed a regional
average transition charge, which could shift costs to NSP-Minnesota and
NSP-Wisconsin, effective Dec. 1, 2004. 
Xcel Energy has opposed these regionalized approaches.  The final FERC decision is expected to be
issued by the end of 2006.  Under the
FERC orders, the SECA transition charges are set to expire Mar. 31, 2006.

NSP-Minnesota Electric Rate Case

–
In November 2005, NSP-Minnesota requested an electric rate increase of
$168 million or 8.05 percent.  This
increase was based on a requested 11 percent return on common equity, a
projected common equity ratio to total capitalization of 51.7 percent and a
projected electric rate base of $3.2 billion. 
On Dec. 15, 2005, the MPUC authorized an interim rate increase of

Renewable Transmission Cost Recovery

—

In 2002, NSP-Minnesota filed for MPUC
approval to establish an RCR adjustment mechanism to recover the costs of
transmission investments incurred to deliver renewable energy resources.  The RCR adjustment mechanism provides for
annual filings to set the RCR adjustment rates using updated transmission cost
information.  The MPUC approved the RCR
adjustment mechanism and the two-phase filing mechanism in April 2003.  In February 2004, the MPUC conditionally
approved the initial Phase 1 facility eligibility determination filing.  NSP-Minnesota then filed for approval to
recover annual additional transmission costs from May 2004 to December 2004,
which were approximately $6 million. The request was approved and the RCR was
implemented Dec. 1, 2004. 
NSP-Minnesota collected approximately $0.2 million in 2004.  NSP-Minnesota submitted a filing in February 2005
to determine the eligibility of additional transmission projects and to establish
the RCR factors for 2005, seeking recovery of $12.9 million of additional costs
in 2005.  The MPUC approved revised
factors by order dated Jan. 9, 2006, and NSP-Minnesota submitted its
compliance filing in late January 2006 for rates to be effective Mar. 1,
2006.  In Oct. 2005, NSP-Minnesota
revised the recoverable expense to $9.3 million, of which $5.4 million has been
recovered. Because of the pending Minnesota rate case, the RCR rates in effect
in 2006 will recover only the unrecovered 2005 costs of $3.9 million.  All 2006 costs are proposed to be recovered
in the Minnesota electric rate case discussed above.

MISO Cost Recovery

—
On Dec. 18, 2004, NSP-Minnesota filed with the MPUC a petition to seek
recovery of the Minnesota jurisdictional portion of all net costs associated
with the implementation of the MISO Day 2 market through its FCA.  The MPUC issued an interim order in April 2005
allowing MISO Day 2 charges to be recovered through the NSP-Minnesota FCA
mechanism. In December 2005, the MPUC issued a second interim order
approving the recovery of certain MISO charges through the FCA mechanism but
requiring that additional charges either be recovered as part of a general rate
case or through an annual review process outside the fuel and purchased energy
cost recovery mechanism, and requiring refunds of non-FCA costs.  The December 2005 MPUC order also
suspended the refund obligation until such time as it could reconsider the
matter.  On Feb. 9, 2006, the MPUC
voted to reconsider its December 2005 order.  The MPUC on reconsideration determined that
parties be directed to determine which charges are appropriately in the FCA and
which are more appropriately established in base rates and report back to the
MPUC in 60 days; to grant deferred accounting treatment for costs ultimately
determined to be included in base rates for a period of 36 months, with
recovery of deferred amounts to be reviewed in a general rate case; and that
amounts collected to date through the FCA under the April and December 2005
interim orders are not subject to refund. 
As a result, NSP-Minnesota expects to have the opportunity to recover
(or seek to recover in a rate case) all of its MISO Day 2 costs.

In

March 2005, the PSCW issued an interim order allowing NSP-Wisconsin deferred
accounting treatment of MISO charges. 
However, the PSCW staff issued an interpretive memorandum in October 2005
asserting that certain MISO costs may not be recovered through the interim fuel
cost mechanism and may not be deferrable. 
NSP-Wisconsin and the other Wisconsin utilities contested staff’s
interpretation in their November comments to the PSCW.  To date, NSP-Wisconsin has deferred
approximately $5.7 million of MISO Day 2 costs as a regulatory asset.

Xcel
Energy also notified MISO that NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin may seek to
withdraw from MISO if rate recovery of Day 2 costs is not allowed.  Withdrawal would require FERC approval and
could require Xcel Energy to pay a withdrawal fee.

In addition, in March 2005, NSP-Minnesota filed petitions similar
to the December 2004 Minnesota filing with the NDPSC and the SDPUC
proposing changes to allow recovery of the applicable North Dakota and South
Dakota jurisdictional portions of the MISO Day 2 market costs.  The SDPUC approved the proposed tariff
changes effective April 1, 2005, as requested.  The NDPSC granted interim recovery through
the FCA beginning April 1, 2005, but similar to the decision of the MPUC,
conditioned the relief as being subject to refund until the merits of the case
are determined.  To date, the NDPSC has
conducted no further proceedings regarding the NSP-Minnesota filing.

Energy Legislation

—

In 2005, the
Minnesota Legislature passed and the Governor signed an Omnibus Energy Bill,
effective July 1, 2005.  Among other
things, the new law provides authority for the MPUC to approve rate rider
recovery for transmission investments that have been approved through a
certificate of need, the biennial transmission plan, or are associated with
compliance with the state’s renewable energy objective.  The statute provides that the rate rider may
include recovery of the revenue requirement associated with qualifying
projects, including a current return on construction work in progress.  NSP-Minnesota is currently preparing a filing
to the MPUC for approval of a new tariff to implement this statute.


Capacity and Demand

Uninterrupted
system peak demand for the NSP System’s electric utility for each of the last
three years and the forecast for 2006, assuming normal weather, are listed
below.

The
peak demand for the NSP System typically occurs in the summer. The 2005 uninterrupted
system peak demand for the NSP System occurred on June 23, 2005.

Energy Sources and Related Initiatives

NSP-Minnesota
expects to use existing electric generating stations; purchases from other
utilities, independent power producers and power marketers; demand-side
management options; and phased expansion of existing generation at select power
plants to meet its system capacity requirements.

Purchased Power

— NSP-Minnesota has contractual arrangements
to purchase power from other utilities and nonregulated energy suppliers.
Capacity, typically measured in KW or MW, is the measure of the rate at which a
particular generating source produces electricity. Energy, typically measured
in Kwh or Mwh, is a measure of the amount of electricity produced from a
particular generating source over a period of time. Long-term purchase power
contracts typically require a periodic payment to secure the capacity from a
particular generating source and a charge for the associated energy actually
purchased from such generating source.

NSP-Minnesota
also makes short-term firm and non-firm purchases to replace generation from
company-owned units that are unavailable due to maintenance and unplanned
outages, to provide the utility’s reserve obligation, to obtain energy at a
lower cost than that which could be produced by other resource options,
including company-owned generation and/or long-term purchase power contracts,
and for various other operating requirements.

On Dec. 27,
2005, Excelsior Energy Inc. (Excelsior), an independent energy developer, filed
a petition with the MPUC seeking to compel NSP-Minnesota to enter into a power
purchase agreement related to its proposed integrated gasification,
combined-cycle power plant (Mesaba project) that would be located in northern
Minnesota.  The petition requested the
MPUC to determine that the proposed purchase is in the public interest and that
the technology proposed for the Mesaba Project, which Excelsior claims is a “clean
energy technology” under Minnesota law, is or is likely to be a least-cost
resource pursuant to Minnesota law. 
NSP-Minnesota has not been provided a full, unredacted copy of the
proposed power purchase agreement and has not entered into the power purchase agreement
with Excelsior.  The petition seeks to
compel NSP-Minnesota to purchase at least 13 percent of NSP-Minnesota’s
electric energy provided to retail customers from the Mesaba Project, which
Excelsior claims would require two units of its Mesaba Project each proposed at
603 MW.  Excelsior’s filing asserts much
of its proposal is confidential under the MPUC’s rules, including the pricing
and other economic terms.  NSP-Minnesota
is seeking access to the confidential information.  The MPUC asked for comments on the process
for the filing and comments on the ability to obtain information filed under
confidential protection.  NSP-Minnesota
has asked the MPUC to first resolve issues surrounding the confidential
information, then to address legal issues surrounding the proposal and after
resolution of those issues, to consider the proposal in light of its legal
conclusions.

NSP System Resource Plan

— On Nov. 1, 2004, NSP-Minnesota filed
its 2004 resource plan with the MPUC. 
The resource plan projects a need for an additional 3,100 MW of
electricity resources during the next 15 years, based on an anticipated growth
in demand of 1.61 percent annually, or approximately 170 MW per year, during
the period.  The resource plan:

•

identifies the need for adding up to 1,125 MW
of new base-load electricity generation by 2015;

•

recommends a new resource acquisition process
that includes multiple options for consideration, including generation built by
NSP-Minnesota;

•

recommends increasing energy-saving goals for
demand-side energy management programs by nearly 17 percent;

•

recommends extending the operating licenses
for the Prairie Island and Monticello nuclear plants by 20 years (on Jan. 18,
2005, NSP-Minnesota applied for a certificate of need in Minnesota for a dry
spent-fuel storage facility at the Monticello plant, and plans to file an
application with the federal government to extend the Monticello plant’s


license and to make similar filings for the Prairie Island plant in
2008);

•

assumes nearly 1,700 MW of wind power with
most developed on NSP-Minnesota’s system;

•

identifies the need for obtaining up to 550
MW of new power resources for peak usage times by 2015 depending on the amount
and timing of any base-load resources acquired; and

•

cites the importance of ensuring that
sufficient transmission resources are available to move electricity from
generation sources.

On
Aug. 1, 2005, the Minnesota Department of Commerce filed comments that
Xcel Energy had overestimated its forecast and that there was no need for new
resources until 2015.  Other parties
filed various comments relating to the environmental impacts of the plan, the
use of renewable fuels, the need to construct a 600 MW integrated gasification
combined-cycle facility in Northern Minnesota, and NSP-Minnesota’s monitoring
of the Northern Flood Agreement between the Province of Manitoba and various
Canadian First Nations.

On
Nov. 23, 2005, Xcel Energy filed updated analysis and replies with the
MPUC.  The updated analysis supported
Xcel Energy’s original forecast and identified upgrades to certain existing
facilities that could provide cost-effective base load energy to Xcel Energy’s
customers and defer the need for new base load until 2015.  The filing also detailed Xcel Energy’s
examination of new base load options.  On
the same day, the Minnesota Department of Commerce filed a proposal to select
base load resources through a certificate of need process rather than a bidding
process.  Xcel Energy expects the MPUC to
make a final ruling on the Resource Plan and the bidding process in the first
half of 2006.

NSP-Minnesota Transmission Certificates of
Need

— In December 2001,
NSP-Minnesota proposed construction of various transmission system upgrades to
provide transmission outlet capacity for up to 825 MW of renewable energy
generation (wind and biomass) being constructed in southwest and western
Minnesota.  In March 2003, the MPUC
granted four certificates of need to NSP-Minnesota, thereby approving
construction, subject to certain conditions. The initial projected cost of the
transmission upgrades was approximately $160 million.  The MEQB granted a routing permit for the
first major transmission facilities in the development program in 2004.  The remaining route permit proceedings were
completed in 2005

.

In 2003, the MPUC also approved an RCR
adjustment that allows NSP-Minnesota to recover the revenue requirements
associated with certain transmission investments associated with delivery of
renewable energy resources through an automatic adjustment mechanism that
started in 2004.  See the Pending and
Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings — MPUC, Renewable Transmission Cost
Recovery section for further discussion.

Purchased Transmission Services

—NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have
contractual arrangements with MISO to deliver power and energy to NSP System
native load customers.  Point-to-point
transmission services typically include a charge for the specific amount of
transmission capacity being reserved. Network transmission services include a
charge based on the transmission customer’s monthly peak demand.

Nuclear Power Operations and Waste Disposal
- -

NSP-Minnesota
owns two nuclear generating plants: the Monticello plant and the Prairie Island
plant. See additional discussion regarding the nuclear generating plants at
Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nuclear
power plant operation produces gaseous, liquid and solid radioactive wastes.
The discharge and handling of such wastes are controlled by federal
regulation.  High-level radioactive
wastes primarily include used nuclear fuel. Low-level radioactive waste
consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags,
tools and equipment that have become contaminated through use in the plant.

Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal

—

Federal law places responsibility on each
state for disposal of its low-level radioactive waste generated within its
borders. Low-level radioactive waste from NSP-Minnesota’s Monticello and
Prairie Island nuclear plants is currently disposed at the Barnwell facility
located in South Carolina (all classes of low-level waste) and at the Clive
facility located in Utah (class A low-level substance only). Chem Nuclear is
the owner and operator of the Barnwell facility, which has been given
authorization by South Carolina to accept low-level radioactive waste from
states that are not a member of South Carolina’s state compact.  Envirocare, Inc. operates the Clive
facility.  NSP-Minnesota has an annual
contract with Barnwell, but is also able to utilize the Envirocare facility
through various low-level waste processors. 
NSP-Minnesota has low-level storage capacity available on-site at
Prairie Island and Monticello that would allow both plants to continue to
operate until the end of their current licensed lives, if off-site low-level
disposal facilities were not available to NSP-Minnesota.

High-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal

—

The federal government has the responsibility
to dispose of, or permanently store, domestic spent nuclear fuel and other
high-level radioactive wastes. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the DOE to


implement
a program for nuclear high level waste management. This includes the siting,
licensing, construction and operation of a repository for domestically produced
spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors and other high-level
radioactive wastes at a permanent Federal storage or disposal facility. To
date, the DOE has not accepted any of NSP-Minnesota’s spent nuclear fuel.  See Item 3 — Legal Proceedings and Note 15 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this matter.

NSP-Minnesota
has on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel at its Monticello and Prairie Island
nuclear plants. In 1993, the Prairie Island plant was licensed by the federal
NRC to store up to 48 casks of spent fuel at the plant. In 1994, the Minnesota
Legislature adopted a limit on dry cask storage of 17 casks for the entire
state.  On May 29, 2003, the
Minnesota Legislature enacted revised legislation that will allow NSP-Minnesota
to continue to operate the facility and store spent fuel there until its
current licenses with the NRC expire in 2013 and 2014. The legislation
transfers the primary authority concerning future spent-fuel storage issues
from the state Legislature to the MPUC. It also allows for additional storage
without the requirement of an affirmative vote from the state Legislature, if
the NRC extends the licenses of the Prairie Island and Monticello plants and
the MPUC grants a certificate of need for such additional storage. It is
estimated that operation through the end of the current license will require 12
additional storage casks to be stored at the plant, for a total of 29 casks.  As of Dec. 31, 2005, there were 20 casks
loaded and stored at the Prairie Island plant. See Note 15 in the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of the matter.

Visual Inspections

—

Required visual inspections have been
performed on the Prairie Island Unit 2 upper and lower reactor vessel heads,
and the Unit 1 upper head. Reactor vessel heads for both units were found to be
in compliance with all NRC requirements. The reactor vessel upper head for
Prairie Island Unit 2 was replaced during the 2005 refueling outage, and Xcel
Energy expects to replace the reactor vessel upper head for Prairie Island Unit
1 in early 2006.

Private Fuel Storage (PFS)

—

NSP-Minnesota
is part of a consortium of private parties working to establish a private
facility for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. In 1997, PFS filed a
license application with the NRC for a temporary storage site for spent nuclear
fuel on the Skull Valley Indian Reservation in Utah. The NRC license review
process includes formal evidentiary hearings before the ASLB and opportunities
for public input. On Sept. 9, 2005, the NRC Commissioners directed the NRC
staff to issue the license for PFS, ending the 8-year effort to gain a license
for the site.  In December 2005, the
U.S. Supreme Court denied Utah’s petition for a writ of certiorari to hear an
appeal of a lower court’s ruling on a series of state statutes aimed at
blocking the storage and transportation of spent fuel to PFS. Also in December 2005,
NSP-Minnesota forwarded a letter to Senator Hatch (UT) indicating that it would
hold in abeyance future investments in the construction of PFS as long as there
is apparent and continuing progress in federally sponsored initiatives for
storage, reuse, and/or disposal for the nation’s spent nuclear fuel.

Prairie Island Steam Generator Replacement

—

In the fall of 2004, NSP-Minnesota spent
approximately $132 million to successfully replace the Prairie Island Unit 1
steam generators.  The Unit 2 steam
generators have not yet been replaced, but received the required inspections
during the scheduled 2005 outage. Based on current rates of degradation and
available repair processes, NSP-Minnesota plans to replace these steam
generators in the 2013 regular refueling outage. Due to the potential shortages
in the world markets for materials and shop capabilities, NSP-Minnesota expects
to begin the approval process in 2006 for long-lead time materials.

NSP-Minnesota Nuclear Plant Re-licensing

— Monticello’s current 40-year
license expires in 2010, and Prairie Island’s licenses for its two units expire
in 2013 and 2014.  In March 2005,
NSP-Minnesota filed its application with the NRC for an operating license
extension for Monticello of up to 20 years. 
NSP-Minnesota filed its application with the MPUC for Monticello in January 2005
seeking a certificate of need for dry spent fuel storage. Decisions by both the
federal and state agencies regarding Monticello re-licensing are expected in
early 2007. Prairie Island has initiated the necessary plant assessments and
aging analysis to support submittal of similar applications to the NRC and
Minnesota, currently planned for submittal in early 2008.

Nuclear Management Co. (NMC)

— During 1999,
NSP-Minnesota, Wisconsin Electric Power Co., Wisconsin Public Service
Corporation (WPS) and Alliant Energy Corp. established NMC. The Consumers Power
subsidiary of CMS Energy Corp. joined the NMC during 2000.

NMC
manages the operations and maintenance at the plants, and is responsible for
physical security. NMC’s responsibilities also include oversight of on-site dry
storage facilities for used nuclear fuel at the Prairie Island nuclear plant.
Utility plant owners, including NSP-Minnesota, continue to own the plants,
control all energy produced by the plants, and retain responsibility for nuclear
liability insurance and decommissioning costs.

In
2005 and 2006, as a result of selling their nuclear plants, WPS and Alliant
Energy ended their participation in NMC. 
In December 2005, Consumer Power announced its intent to sell its
nuclear plant, which will leave NSP-Minnesota and Wisconsin Electric Power Co.
as the remaining members of the NMC, with a combined total of 3 sites and 5
reactors. NMC


is
in the process of identifying and marketing its services to other potential
nuclear utility candidates to replace the departing members.

For
further discussion of nuclear issues, see Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Fuel Supply and Costs

The
following table shows the delivered cost per MMBtu of each significant category
of fuel consumed for electric generation, the percentage of total fuel
requirements represented by each category of fuel and the total weighted
average cost of all fuels during such years.

*
Includes refuse-derived fuel and wood

See additional discussion of fuel supply and costs under Factors
Affecting Results of Continuing Operations in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis under Item 7.

Fuel Sources

— Coal inventory levels may vary widely among
plants.  However, the NSP System normally
maintains no less than 30 days of coal inventory at each plant site.  Estimated coal requirements at NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin’s major coal-fired generating plants are approximately 13.3
million tons per year. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have long-term contracts
providing for the delivery of up to 99 percent of 2006 coal requirements. Coal
delivery may be subject to short-term interruptions or reductions due to
transportation problems, weather, and availability of equipment.  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis for
further discussion of coal delivery disruptions.

NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin expect that all of the coal burned in 2006 will have an average
sulfur content of less than 0.75 percent. 
The NSP System has contracts for a maximum of 35.8 million tons of
low-sulfur coal for the next 3 years. 
The contracts are with 1 Montana coal supplier, 3 Wyoming suppliers and
1 Minnesota oil refinery, with expiration dates in 2006 and 2007.

To
operate NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear generating plants, NSP-Minnesota secures
contracts for uranium concentrates, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment and
fuel fabrication. The contract strategy involves a portfolio of spot purchases
and medium- and long-term contracts for uranium, conversion and enrichment.

•

Current nuclear fuel supply contracts cover 100
percent of uranium requirements through 2006 and 91.8 percent of the 2007
requirements with no coverage of requirements for 2008 and beyond. Contracts
with additional uranium concentrates suppliers are currently in various stages
of negotiations that are expected to provide a portion of the requirements
through 2016.

•

Current contracts for conversion services
requirements cover 100 percent of the requirements for 2006 and 53 percent for 2007
with no current coverage of requirements for 2011 and beyond. A contract with
an additional conversion services supplier is nearing completion that is
expected to provide additional coverage for 2007 through 2011.

•

Current enrichment services contracts cover 100
percent of the 2006 requirements. Approximately 30 percent of the 2007 through
2010 requirements are currently covered with no coverage of requirements for
2011 and beyond. These contracts expire at varying times between 2006 and 2010.
Contracts with additional enrichment services suppliers are currently in
various stages of negotiation that are expected to supply additional coverage
from 2007 through 2010.

•

Fuel fabrication for Monticello is covered
through 2010.  Fuel fabrication is 100
percent committed for Prairie Island Unit 1 through 2006 and Prairie Island
Unit 2 is covered for the 2006 fuel fabrication services under an amendment
signed in 2005. NSP-Minnesota and NMC are currently in negotiations with
Westinghouse to pursue fuel fabrication for Prairie Island plant needs beyond
the current fuel contracts.

NSP-Minnesota
expects sufficient uranium, conversion and enrichment to be available for the
total fuel requirements of its nuclear generating plants. Contracts for
additional uranium and enrichment services are currently being negotiated that
would provide additional supply requirements through 2016 for uranium and 2010
for enrichment services.

The NSP System uses both firm and interruptible natural gas and standby
oil in combustion turbines and certain boilers. 
Natural gas supplies for power plants are procured under short-,
intermediate- and long-term contracts which expire in various years from 2006
through 2027 in order to provide an adequate supply of fuel.  Certain natural gas supply and transportation
agreements include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified
volumes of natural gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery.  At Dec. 31, 2005, NSP-Minnesota’s commitments
related to these contracts were approximately $127 million.  The NSP System has current fuel oil inventory
adequate to meet anticipated 2006 requirements and also has access to the spot
market to buy more oil, if needed.


Commodity Marketing Operations

NSP-Minnesota
conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and
sale of electric capacity, energy and energy related products. Participation in
short-term wholesale energy markets provides market intelligence and
information that supports the energy management of NSP-Minnesota.  NSP-Minnesota uses physical and financial
instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge supplies and
purchases. Engaging in short-term sales and purchase commitments results in an
efficient use of our plants and the capturing of additional margins from
non-traditional customers. NSP-Minnesota also uses these marketing operations
to capture arbitrage opportunities created by regional pricing differentials,
supply and demand imbalances and changes in fuel prices.  See additional discussion under Item 7A —
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

NSP-Wisconsin

Ratemaking Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of
Jurisdiction

—
Retail rates, services and other aspects of NSP-Wisconsin’s operations are
regulated by the PSCW and the MPSC, within their respective states.  In addition, each of the state commissions
certifies the need for new generating plants and electric transmission lines to
be located within the respective states before the facilities may be sited and
built.  NSP-Wisconsin is subject to the
jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to its wholesale electric operations, accounting
practices, wholesale sales for resale and the transmission of electricity in
interstate commerce. NSP-Wisconsin has received authorization from the FERC to
make wholesale electric sales at market-based prices (see market-based rate
authority discussion).

The
PSCW has a biennial base-rate filing requirement.  By June of each odd-numbered year,
NSP-Wisconsin must submit a rate filing for the test year beginning the
following January. The filing procedure and review generally allow the PSCW
sufficient time to issue an order and implement new base rates effective with
the start of the test year.

Fuel and Purchased Energy Cost Recovery
Mechanisms

—
NSP-Wisconsin does not have an automatic electric fuel adjustment clause for
Wisconsin retail customers.  Instead, it
has a procedure that compares actual monthly and anticipated annual fuel costs
with those costs that were included in the latest retail electric rates. If the
comparison results in a difference of 2 percent above base rates or 0.5 percent
below, the PSCW may hold hearings limited to fuel costs and revise rates upward
or downward. Any revised rates would remain in effect until the next rate
change. The adjustment approved is calculated on an annual basis, but applied
prospectively.  NSP-Wisconsin’s wholesale
electric rate schedules provide for adjustments to billings and revenues for
changes in the cost of fuel and purchased energy.

NSP-Wisconsin’s
retail electric rate schedules for Michigan customers include power supply cost
recovery factors, which are based on 12-month projections.  After each 12-month period, a reconciliation
is submitted whereby over-collections are refunded and any under-collections
are collected from the customers over the subsequent 12-month period.

under NSP-Minnesota Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings.

Pending and Recently
Concluded Regulatory Proceedings - PSCW

MISO Cost Recovery

-

On Mar. 29, 2005, NSP-Wisconsin
received an order from the PSCW granting its request to defer the costs and
benefits attributable to the start-up of the MISO Day 2 energy market.  NSP-Wisconsin also received an order granting
its request to record energy market transactions on a net basis. The netting of
transactions is consistent with the approach envisioned by the FERC in
approving the transmission and energy markets tariff and is consistent with
generally accepted accounting principles. 
On Sept. 22, 2005, the PSCW opened an investigation to obtain
information from interested persons related to MISO policy development that is
beneficial to ratepayers and that protects the public interest.  On Oct. 18, 2005, the PSCW solicited
comments on the PSCW staff proposal regarding rate and accounting treatment of
MISO revenues and costs, as well as a request to escrow MISO Day 2 energy
market costs until 2008.  On Nov. 17,
2005, NSP-Wisconsin and other Wisconsin utilities filed comments on the PSCW
staff proposal and clarified the utilities’ position on their interpretation of
the previously granted deferral order. 
NSP-Wisconsin will continue to work with the PSCW and other utilities to
address the longer-term issue related to MISO policies.


NSP-Wisconsin 2005 Fuel Cost Recovery

-
On April 22, 2005, NSP-Wisconsin filed an application with the PSCW to
increase electric rates by $10 million, or 2.7 percent, annually to provide for
recovery of forecasted increased costs of fuel and purchased power over the
balance of 2005.  The March 2005
actual fuel costs were approximately 13 percent higher than authorized recovery
in current base rates, and the forecast for the remainder of 2005 showed costs
outside the previously established annual range by 9.6 percent.  On May 18, 2005, the PSCW issued an
order approving interim rates at the level requested, effective May 19,
2005.  This rate increase generated an
estimated $6.5 million in additional revenue for NSP-Wisconsin in 2005.  Under the provisions of the Wisconsin fuel
rules, any difference between interim rates and final rates is subject to
refund.  On Sept. 28, 2005, the PSCW
issued a final order approving an increase of $11.6 million, or 3.1 percent
annually.  Because the final rates were
slightly higher than interim rates authorized in May 2005, no refund was
necessary.  With an effective date of Oct. 1,
2005, final rates collected approximately $0.4 million in incremental revenue,
as compared to interim rates, over the last three months of 2005.

On Oct. 14,
2005, NSP-Wisconsin filed an application with the PSCW to increase the amount
of the authorized fuel and purchased power surcharge by $8.9 million or 2.3
percent on an annual basis.  This
additional request was due to dramatic increases in the cost of natural gas and
purchased power since the surcharge amount was set in mid-August.  September 2005 actual fuel costs were
approximately 38 percent higher than authorized recovery in current rates, and
the forecast for the remainder of 2005 showed costs outside the annual range by
7.5 percent.  A PSCW order authorizing an
increase in the amount of the surcharge on an interim basis, subject to refund,
was issued Nov. 10, 2005, and NSP-Wisconsin collected approximately $1.3
million in additional revenue over the remainder of 2005.  The surcharge was discontinued with the
implementation of new 2006 base rates, which went into effect Jan. 9,
2006.  A final hearing in the 2005 fuel
surcharge case was held Feb. 10, 2006, to determine whether any refund of
interim rates is necessary. 
NSP-Wisconsin and PSCW staff both filed testimony indicating that actual
fuel costs for the period in question exceeded levels assumed in setting
interim rates, and no refund is necessary. 
A final PSCW decision is expected in the first quarter of 2006.

NSP-Wisconsin 2006
General Rate Case

– In 2005, NSP-Wisconsin, requested an electric revenue increase of
$58.3 million and a natural gas revenue increase of $8.1 million, based on a
2006 test year, an 11.9 percent return on equity and a common equity ratio of
56.32 percent.  On Jan. 5, 2006, the
PSCW approved an electric revenue increase of $43.4 million and a natural gas
revenue increase of $3.9 million, based on an 11.0 percent return on equity and
a 54-percent common equity ratio target. 
The new rates were effective Jan. 9, 2006.  The order authorized the deferral of an
additional $6.5 million in costs related to nuclear decommissioning and
manufactured gas plant site clean up for recovery in the next rate case.  The order also prohibits NSP-Wisconsin from
paying dividends above $42.7 million, if its actual calendar year average
common equity ratio is or will fall below 54.03 percent.  It also imposes an asymmetrical electric fuel
clause bandwidth of positive 2 percent to negative 0.5 percent outside of which
NSP-Wisconsin would be permitted to request or be required to change rates.

Capacity and Demand

NSP-Wisconsin operates an integrated system with NSP-Minnesota.  See discussion of the system capacity and demand
under NSP-Minnesota Capacity and Demand discussed previously.

Energy Sources and Related Initiatives

NSP-Wisconsin

PSCo

Ratemaking Principles

Summary of
Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction

— PSCo is
regulated by the CPUC with respect to its facilities, rates, accounts, services
and issuance of securities.  PSCo is
regulated by the FERC with respect to its wholesale electric operations,
accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale and the transmission of
electricity in interstate commerce.

Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation
Cost Recovery Mechanisms

— PSCo has several retail adjustment clauses that recover fuel,
purchased energy and resource costs:


•

Electric Commodity
Adjustment (ECA)

— The ECA,
effective Jan. 1, 2004, is an incentive adjustment mechanism that compares
actual fuel and purchased energy expense in a calendar year to a benchmark
formula. The ECA also provides for an $11.25 million cap on any cost sharing
over or under an allowed ECA formula rate. 
The formula rate is revised annually and collected or refunded in the
following year, if necessary.  The
current ECA mechanism will expire Jan. 1, 2007.

•

Purchased Capacity Cost
Adjustment (PCCA)

— The
PCCA, which became effective June 1, 2004, allows for recovery of
purchased capacity payments to certain power suppliers under specifically
identified power purchase agreements that are not included in the determination
of PSCo’s base electric rates or other recovery mechanisms.  The PCCA will expire on Dec. 31,
2006.  Purchased capacity costs both from
contracts included within the PCCA and from contracts not included within the
PCCA are expected to be eligible for recovery through base rates, when PSCo
files its next general rate case.

•

Steam Cost Adjustment (SCA)

— The SCA allows PSCo to
recover the difference between its actual cost of fuel and the amount of these
costs recovered under its base steam service rates. The SCA rate is revised at
least annually to coincide with changes in fuel costs.

•

Air-Quality Improvement
Rider (AQIR)

— The AQIR
recovers, over a 15-year period, the incremental cost (including fuel and
purchased energy) incurred by PSCo as a result of a voluntary plan to reduce
emissions and improve air quality in the Denver metro area.

•

Demand-Side Management Cost
Adjustment (DSMCA)

— The
DSMCA clause currently permits PSCo to recover DSM costs over five years while
non-labor incremental expenses and carrying costs associated with deferred DSM
costs are recovered on an annual basis. PSCo also has a low-income energy
assistance program. The costs of this energy conservation and weatherization
program for low-income customers are recovered through the DSMCA.

PSCo
recovers fuel and purchased energy costs from its wholesale customers through a
fuel cost adjustment clause accepted for filing by the FERC.

Performance-Based Regulation and Quality of
Service Requirements

— PSCo currently operates under an electric and natural gas PBRP.  The major components of this regulatory plan
include:

•

an
annual electric earnings test for 2004 through 2006 with the sharing between
customers and shareholders of earnings in excess of a return on equity for
electric operations of 10.75 percent;

•

an
electric QSP that provides for bill credits to customers if PSCo does not
achieve certain performance targets relating to electric reliability and
customer service through 2006; and

•

a natural gas QSP that provides for bill
credits to customers if PSCo does not achieve certain performance targets
relating to natural gas leak repair time and customer service through 2007.

PSCo
regularly monitors and records as necessary an estimated customer refund
obligation under the PBRP. In April of each year following the measurement
period, PSCo files its proposed rate adjustment under the PBRP. The CPUC
conducts proceedings to review and approve these rate adjustments annually.

•

In 2003, PSCo did not achieve the performance
targets for the QSP electric service unavailability measure or the customer
complaint measure.  Targets were met for
the natural gas QSP.  There was no
sharing of earnings for 2003, as PSCo established new rates in its general rate
case.

•

In 2004, PSCo did not earn a return on equity
in excess of 10.75 percent, so no refund liability was recorded.  PSCo did not achieve the 2004 performance
targets for the electric service unavailability measure, creating a bill credit
obligation for 2004 and increasing the maximum bill credit obligation for
subsequent years’ performance.  Targets
were met for the natural gas QSP.

•

In 2005, PSCo does not anticipate earning a
return on equity in excess of 10.75 percent and did not record a refund
liability.  QSP results will be filed
with the CPUC in April 2006.  An
estimated customer refund obligation under the electric QSP plan was recorded
in 2005 related to the electric service unavailability measure.  No refund under the natural gas QSP is
anticipated. See further discussion of the QSP below.


Pending
and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings - FERC

PSCo
and SPS FERC Transmission Rate Case

— On Sept. 2, 2004, Xcel Energy filed on
behalf of PSCo and SPS an application to increase wholesale transmission
service and ancillary service rates within the Xcel Energy joint open access
transmission tariff (OATT).  PSCo and SPS
requested an increase in annual transmission service and ancillary services
revenues of $6.1 million.  As a result of
a settlement with certain PSCo wholesale power customers in 2003, their power
sales rates would be reduced by $1.4 million. 
The net increase in annual revenues proposed was $4.7 million, of which
$3.0 million is attributable to PSCo. 
The FERC suspended the filing and delayed the effective date of the
proposed increase to June 1, 2005.  The interim rates went into effect on June 1,
2005, subject to refund.  On Feb. 6,
2006, the parties in the proceeding submitted an uncontested offer of
settlement that contains a formula rate for PSCo, a 10.5 percent rate of return
on common equity, and the phased inclusion of PSCo’s 345 KV tie line costs in
wholesale transmission service rates.  The settlement results in a $1.6 million rate
increase for PSCo effective June 2005. 
The offer of settlement is pending FERC approval.

California Refund
Proceeding

—

A
number of proceedings are pending before the FERC relating to the price of
sales into the California electricity markets from May 1, 2000 through June 20,
2001.  PSCo supplied energy to
these markets during this period and has been an active participant in the
proceedings.  In September 2005, PSCo reached an agreement with respect to these
proceedings with a group of California entities including: San Diego Gas &
Electric Company, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison
Company, the California Department of Water Resources, the California
Electricity Oversight Board, the California Public Utilities Commission and the
California Attorney General.  In December 2005,
the FERC approved the settlement without condition for the period of Jan. 1,
2000 through June 20, 2001.  PSCo
will pay approximately $5.5 million in cash and assign $1.8 million in accounts
receivable from the California Independent System Operator and the California
Power Exchange to the settling participants. In 2004, PSCo reserved
approximately $7 million related to this proceeding.  The settlement, which includes no
acknowledgment of wrongdoing by PSCo, avoids further costly litigation and
resolves all claims by PSCo against the settling participants and by the
settling participants against PSCo. 
While accounting for approximately 90 percent of purchases in the
California markets, the California utilities were not the only purchasers in
those markets.  However, the settlement
makes provision for other purchasers to opt into the settlement.  We do not expect a material financial impact
as resolution is reached with the non-settling parties.

Pacific Northwest FERC Refund Proceeding

—

In July 2001, the FERC ordered a
preliminary hearing to determine whether there may have been unjust and
unreasonable charges for spot market bilateral sales in the Pacific Northwest
for the period Dec. 25, 2000 through June 20, 2001. PSCo supplied
energy to the Pacific Northwest markets during this period and has been an
active participant in the hearings. In September 2001, the presiding ALJ
concluded that prices in the Pacific Northwest during the referenced period
were the result of a number of factors, including the shortage of supply,
excess demand, drought and increased natural gas prices. Under these
circumstances the ALJ concluded that the prices in the Pacific Northwest markets
were not unreasonable or unjust and no refunds should be ordered. Subsequent to
the ruling the FERC has allowed the parties to request additional evidence
regarding the use of certain strategies and how they may have impacted the
markets in the Pacific Northwest markets. For the referenced period, parties
have claimed that the total amount of transactions with PSCo subject to refund
are $34 million.

On June 25, 2003, the FERC issued an order
terminating the proceeding without ordering further proceedings.  On Nov. 10, 2003, in response to
requests for rehearing, FERC reaffirmed this ruling to terminate the proceeding
without refunds.  Certain purchasers have
filed appeals of the FERC’s orders in this proceeding.

FERC
OMOI Compliance Audit

— On October 28, 2004,
the OMOI sent a letter to Xcel Energy stating that OMOI had initiated a routine
audit of PSCo compliance with various FERC regulations, including PSCo’s OATT,
FERC’s Order No. 889 standards of conduct rules and PSCo’s code of
conduct for transactions in power and non-power goods with affiliates with
market-based rates.  Similar compliance
audits of other utilities have resulted in compliance orders and, in certain
cases, civil penalties.  On November 28,
2005, FERC issued an order approving an audit report that recommended certain
operational changes but imposed no civil penalties.

Pending and Recently
Concluded Regulatory Proceedings - CPUC

Tie Line Cost
Recovery

- On Sept. 20, 2001, the CPUC ruled that
only 50 percent of the total cost of the high voltage direct current (HVDC)
converter constructed by PSCo in Lamar, Colorado would be allowed in rate
base.  This facility is part of the 345
KV tie line transmission facilities connecting the PSCo and SPS systems.  The CPUC decision resulted in a reduction of
potential PSCo rate base of approximately $16.7 million.  On April 7, 2005, PSCo filed an
application with the CPUC proposing a mechanism that would leave half of the
HVDC facility as a non-rate-base asset, but that would generate revenue


to recover the cost of the non-rate-base asset on a pay-as-you-go
basis.  The proposal would involve
allocating half of any energy or fuel cost savings derived from buying
electricity through the tie line or making sales through the tie line.  Alternatively, PSCo stated that it would not
object to the entire HVDC facility being placed in rate base.  A hearing examiner for the CPUC issued a
recommended decision on Nov. 16, 2005, that reasoned that 100 percent of
the HVDC converter be placed in rate base. 
The CPUC acted on the recommended decision in February 2006 with
generally favorable results.

Quality of Service
Plan

—
The PSCo QSP provides for bill credits to Colorado retail customers, if PSCo
does not achieve certain operational performance targets. During the second
quarter of 2005, PSCo filed its calendar year 2004 operating performance
results for electric service unavailability, phone response time, customer
complaints, accurate meter reading and natural gas leak repair time
measures.  PSCo did not achieve the 2004
performance targets for the electric service unavailability measure.  The CPUC staff and the OCC disputed the performance
results.  The parties agreed PSCo did not
achieve the 2004 performance targets for the electric service unavailability
measure as filed, creating a bill credit obligation for 2004 of $5.6
million.  Additionally, the agreement
provides that PSCo will invest an additional $11 million in 2006 toward
improving reliability, and PSCo will not be required to pay any bill credits
that may be owed for 2006 performance results for electric service
unavailability.  For 2005, PSCo has
evaluated its performance under the QSP and has recorded a liability of $13.6
million.  Under the electric QSP, the
estimated maximum potential bill credit obligation for calendar 2005
performance is approximately $16.8 million, assuming none of the performance
targets are met.  The maximum potential
bill credit obligation for the same period related to permanent natural gas
leak repair and natural gas meter reading errors is approximately $1.6 million.

Capacity and Demand

Uninterrupted
system peak demand for PSCo’s electric utility for each of the last three years
and the forecast for 2006, assuming normal weather, are listed below.

The
peak demand for PSCo’s system typically occurs in the summer.  The 2005 uninterrupted system peak demand for
PSCo occurred on July 21, 2005.

Energy Sources and Related Transmission Initiatives

PSCo
expects to meet its system capacity requirements through existing electric
generating stations; purchases from other utilities, independent power
producers and power marketers; demand-side management options and phased
expansion of existing generation at select power plants.

Purchased Power

— PSCo has contractual arrangements to
purchase power from other utilities and nonregulated energy suppliers.  Capacity, typically measured in KW or MW, is
the measure of the rate at which a particular generating source produces
electricity.  Energy, typically measured
in Kwh or Mwh, is a measure of the amount of electricity produced from a
particular generating source over a period of time. Long-term purchase power
contracts typically require a periodic payment to secure the capacity from a
particular generating source and a charge for the associated energy actually
purchased from such generating source.

PSCo
also makes short-term firm and non-firm purchases to replace generation from
company-owned units that are unavailable due to maintenance and unplanned
outages, to provide the utility’s reserve obligation, to obtain energy at a
lower cost than that which could be produced by other resource options,
including company-owned generation and/or long-term purchase power contracts,
and for various other operating requirements.

PSCo Resource Plan

— PSCo estimates it will purchase
approximately 36 percent of its total electric system energy needs for 2006 and
generate the remainder with PSCo-owned resources.  Additional capacity has been secured under
contract making additional energy auditable for purchase, if required. PSCo
currently has under contract or through owned generation, the resources
necessary to meet its anticipated 2006 load obligation.

On
April 30, 2004, PSCo filed a least-cost resource plan (LCP) with the
CPUC.  PSCo’s plan showed a need to
provide for approximately 3,600 MW of additional generation capacity through
2013 to meet load growth and replace expiring power purchase contracts. The LCP
proposed to meet these resource needs through a combination of utility built
generation, DSM, and power purchases.


On Dec. 17, 2004, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement between
PSCo and intervening parties concerning the LCP.  The CPUC approved PSCo’s plan to construct a
750-MW pulverized coal-fired unit at the existing Comanche power station
located near Pueblo, Colo.; transfer up to 250 MW of capacity ownership from
the 750-MW unit to Intermountain Rural Electric Association and Holy Cross
Energy; and install additional emission control equipment on the two existing
Comanche station units.  PSCo has
completed permitting the 750 MW Comanche 3 unit and began construction of the
facility in December 2005. In the approved settlement, PSCo also agreed to
invest in additional demand-side management and fund environmental programs in
Pueblo, Colo.

The approved settlement contains a confidential construction cost cap
for the Comanche 3 project (i.e., the new unit and the emission controls on
existing units 1 and 2) and a regulatory plan that authorizes PSCo to increase
the equity component of its capital structure up to 60 percent in its 2006 rate
case to offset the debt equivalent value of PSCo’s existing power purchase
contracts and to otherwise improve PSCo’s financial strength.  Depending upon PSCo’s senior unsecured debt
rating during the time of PSCo general rate cases, the approved settlement
permits PSCo to include various amounts of construction work in progress that
are associated with the Comanche 3 project in rate base without an offset for
allowance for funds used during construction.

PSCo has
signed agreements with IREA that define the respective rights and obligations
of PSCo and IREA in the transfer of capacity ownership in the Comanche 3
unit.  PSCo continues to discuss the
possibility of partnership arrangements with Holy Cross Energy.

PSCo has
received the following permits or authorizations for construction and operation
of Comanche 3:

•

Final
air quality permits (received July 5, 2005);

•

A
long-term water supply contract with the Pueblo Board of Water Works (received July 19,
2005);

•

Pueblo
City Council approval to annex the Comanche plant into the city (received Sept.
12, 2005) and

•

Use
by Special Review permit for onsite disposal of ash over a 50-year period
(received Sept. 27, 2005).

The settlement agreement also called for PSCo to acquire the remaining
resource needs through an all-source competitive bidding process.  On Feb. 24, 2005, in conjunction with
the approved LCP, PSCo released an All-Source solicitation for new supply and
demand-side resources.  In May 2005,
PSCo received proposals for over 11,000 MW of firm capacity, nearly 4,600 MW of
nameplate wind capacity, and almost 900 MW of demand-side management
programs.  On Dec. 28, 2005 PSCo
filed a report with the CPUC detailing the bids received, the bid evaluation
process, and the winning bids. PSCo selected bids for approximately 30 MW of
DSM resources, approximately 1300 MW of gas-fired generation resources and
approximately 775 MW of wind generation resources.  These bids, together with Comanche 3, and the
additional DSM agreed to in the LCP settlement agreement, are expected to meet
PSCo’s resource needs through 2012.

Renewable Portfolio Standards —

In November 2004, an amendment to the Colorado statutes was passed by
referendum requiring implementation of a renewable energy portfolio standard
for electric service.  The law requires
PSCo to generate, or cause to be generated, a certain level of electricity from
eligible renewable resources.  Generation
of electricity from renewable resources, particularly solar energy, may be a
higher-cost alternative to traditional fuels, such as coal and natural
gas.  These incremental costs are
expected to be recovered from customers. 
On March 29, 2005, the CPUC initiated a proceeding and held various
hearings to determine the rules and regulations required to implement the
renewable portfolio standard.  The CPUC
determined that compliance with the renewable energy portfolio standard should
be measured through the acquisition of renewable energy credits either with or
without the accompanying renewable energy; that the utility purchaser owns the
renewable energy credits associated with existing contracts where the power
purchase agreement is silent on this issue; that Colorado utilities should be
required to file implementation plans, thereby rejecting the proposal to use an
independent plan administrator; and the methods utilities should use for
determining the budget available for renewable resources.  The CPUC issued proposed rules on Jan. 27,
2006.  Final rules are expected to
become effective by the end of the first quarter 2006.

Renewable Energy Standard Adjustment (RESA)
–

On December 1,
2005, PSCo filed with the CPUC to implement a new 1 percent rider that would
apply to each customer’s total electric bill, providing approximately $22
million in annual revenue.  The revenues
collected under the RESA will be used to acquire sufficient solar resources to
meet the on-site solar system requirements in the Colorado statutes. On Feb.
14, 2006, PSCo and the other parties to the case filed a stipulation agreeing
to reduce the RESA rider to 0.60 percent and to provide monthly reports.  Hearings were held on Feb. 17, 2006.  A CPUC decision is pending.  PSCo expects the RESA rider will go into
effect in early March 2006.

Purchased Transmission Services

— PSCo has contractual arrangements with
regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to the
subsidiaries’ native load customers, which are retail and wholesale load
obligations with terms of more than one year. 
Point-to-point transmission services typically include a charge for the
specific amount of


transmission
capacity being reserved, although some agreements may base charges on the
amount of metered energy delivered. 
Network transmission services include a charge for the metered demand at
the delivery point at the time of the provider’s monthly transmission system
peak, usually calculated as a 12-month rolling average.

Fuel Supply and Costs

The
following table shows the delivered cost per MMBtu of each significant category
of fuel consumed for electric generation, the percentage of total fuel
requirements represented by each category of fuel and the total weighted
average cost of all fuels during such years.

See additional discussion of fuel supply and costs under Factors
Affecting Results of Continuing Operations in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis under Item 7.

Fuel Sources

—

Coal inventory levels may vary widely among
plants.  However, PSCo normally maintains
no less than 30 days of coal inventory at each plant site.  PSCo’s generation stations use low-sulfur
western coal purchased primarily under long-term contracts with suppliers
operating in Colorado and Wyoming. During 2005, PSCo’s coal requirements for
existing plants were approximately 9.8 million tons. Coal supply inventories at
Dec. 31, 2005 were approximately 12 days usage, based on the maximum burn
rate for all of PSCo’s coal-fired plants. 
See Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of coal
delivery disruptions.

PSCo
has contracted for coal suppliers to supply 100 percent of the Cherokee, Cameo,
and Valmont stations’ projected requirements in 2006.

PSCo
has long-term coal supply agreements for the Pawnee and Comanche stations’
projected requirements. Under the long-term agreements the supplier has
dedicated specific coal reserves at the contractually defined mines to meet the
contract quantity obligations. In addition, PSCo has a coal supply agreement to
supply approximately 70 percent of Arapahoe station’s projected requirements
for 2006. Any remaining Arapahoe station requirements will be procured via spot
market purchases.

PSCo
operates the jointly owned Hayden generating plant in Colorado.  All of Hayden’s coal requirements are under
contract through the end of 2011.  The
coal will be trucked approximately 14 miles under a trucking contract effective
through 2009 with an option to extend to the end of 2011.  In addition to Hayden, PSCo has partial
ownership in the Craig generating plant in Colorado.  Approximately 70 percent of PSCo’s coal
requirements for Craig are supplied by two long-term agreements.  The remaining coal requirements for Craig are
purchased on the spot market under short term contracts.  All of 2006 expected requirements for Craig
are under contract.

PSCo
had a number of coal transportation contracts, which expired over the course of
2005.  PSCo has entered into new
transportation agreements at rates substantially higher than its 2005 costs.

PSCo
uses both firm and interruptible natural gas and standby oil in combustion
turbines and certain boilers. Natural gas supplies for PSCo’s power plants are
procured under short- and intermediate- term contracts, which expire in various
years from 2006 through 2025 to provide an adequate supply of fuel.  Certain natural gas supply and transportation
agreements include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified
volumes of natural gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery.  At Dec. 31, 2005, PSCo’s commitments related
to these contracts were approximately $205 million.

Commodity Marketing Operations

PSCo
conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and
sale of electric capacity, energy and energy related products. Participation in
short-term wholesale energy markets provides market intelligence and
information that supports the energy management of PSCo.  PSCo uses physical and financial instruments
to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge supplies and purchases.
Engaging in short-term sales and purchase commitments results in an efficient
use of our plants and the capturing of additional margins from non-traditional
customers.  PSCo also uses these
marketing operations to capture arbitrage opportunities created by regional pricing
differentials, supply and demand imbalances and changes in fuel prices.  See additional discussion under Item 7A —
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.


SPS

Ratemaking Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of
Jurisdiction

—
The PUCT regulates SPS’ Texas operations as an electric utility and has
jurisdiction over its retail rates and services. The municipalities in which
SPS operates in Texas have jurisdiction over SPS’ rates in those communities.
The NMPRC has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities. The NMPRC, the
Oklahoma Corporation Commission and the Kansas Corporation Commission have
jurisdiction with respect to retail rates and services and construction of
transmission or generation in their respective states.  SPS is subject to the jurisdiction of the
FERC with respect to its wholesale electric operations, accounting practices,
wholesale sales for resale and the transmission of electricity in interstate
commerce.  SPS has received authorization
from the FERC to make wholesale electricity sales at market-based prices,
however, as discussed previously, SPS has filed to withdraw its market-based
rate authority with respect to sales in its own control area.

Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation
Cost Recovery Mechanisms

— Fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered in Texas through a
fixed fuel and purchased energy recovery factor, which is part of SPS’ retail
electric rates.  The Texas retail fuel
factors change each November and May based on the projected cost of
natural gas.

If
it appears that SPS will materially over-recover or under-recover these costs,
the factor may be revised upon application by SPS or action by the PUCT. The
regulations require refunding or surcharging over- or under-recovery amounts,
including interest, when they exceed 4 percent of the utility’s annual fuel and
purchased energy costs, as allowed by the PUCT, if this condition is expected
to continue.

PUCT
regulations require periodic examination of SPS fuel and purchased energy
costs, the efficiency of the use of fuel and purchased energy, fuel acquisition
and management policies and purchase energy commitments.  SPS is required to file an application for
the PUCT to retrospectively review at least every three years the operations of
SPS’ electric generation and fuel management activities.  SPS is scheduled to file for review and
reconciliation of its 2004-2005 costs at the end of May 2006.

The
NMPRC regulations provide for a fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause
for SPS’ New Mexico retail jurisdiction. 
SPS files monthly and annual reports of its fuel and purchased power
costs with the NMPRC.  The NMPRC
authorized SPS to implement a monthly adjustment factor.

SPS
recovers fuel and purchased energy costs from its wholesale customers through a
fuel cost adjustment clause accepted for filing by the FERC.

Performance-Based Regulation and Quality of
Service Requirements

— In Texas, SPS is subject to a quality of service plan requiring SPS
to comply with electric service reliability, telephone response and abandoned
call performance targets.  If these
targets are not met, SPS is required to make refunds to its customers of up to
$950,000 per year.  As of Dec. 31,
2005, SPS accrued $800,000 to reflect the expected refund obligation for those
measures.

Pending and Recently
Concluded Regulatory Proceedings - FERC

PSCo and SPS FERC
Transmission Rate Case

— On Sept. 2, 2004, Xcel Energy filed on behalf of SPS and
PSCo an application to increase wholesale transmission service and ancillary
service rates within the Xcel Energy joint open access transmission tariff
(OATT).  PSCo and SPS requested an
increase in annual transmission service and ancillary services revenues, which
was adjusted to reflect a net increase in annual revenues of $4.7 million, of
which $1.7 million is attributable to SPS. 
The FERC suspended the filing and delayed the effective date of the
proposed increase to June 1, 2005.  The interim rates went into effect on June 1,
2005, subject to refund.  On Feb. 6,
2006, the parties in the proceeding submitted to the settlement judge an
uncontested offer of settlement that contains stated rates for SPS, with the
opportunity to file revised rates effective Oct. 1, 2006, by which time
the SPP is expected to have filed a regional formula transmission rate
mechanism similar to MISO.  The
settlement results in a $1.1 million SPS rate increase effective June 2005.  The offer of settlement is pending FERC
approval.

SPS Wholesale Rate
Complaints

— In November 2004, several
wholesale cooperative customers of SPS filed a $3 million rate complaint at the
FERC requesting that the FERC investigate SPS’ wholesale power base rates and
fuel cost adjustment clause calculations. 
In December 2004, the FERC accepted the complaint filing and
ordered SPS base rates subject to refund,


effective Jan. 1, 2005. 
Also in November 2004, SPS filed revisions to its wholesale fuel
cost adjustment clause.  The FERC set the
proposed rate changes into effect on Jan. 1, 2005, subject to refund, and
consolidated the proceeding with the wholesale cooperative customers’ complaint
proceeding.  The FERC set the
consolidated proceeding for hearing and settlement judge procedures, which were
terminated when the parties could not reach a settlement.  A hearing judge has been appointed by the
FERC.  Hearings began Feb. 24, 2006 and are
expected to last several weeks.

On Sept. 15, 2005, Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) filed a
separate complaint at the FERC in which it contended that its demand charge
under an existing interruptible power supply contract with SPS is excessive and
that SPS has overcharged PNM for fuel costs under three separate agreements
through erroneous fuel clause calculations. 
PNM’s arguments mirror those that it made as an intervenor in the
cooperatives’ complaint case, and SPS believes that they have little
merit.  SPS submitted a response to PNM’s
complaint in October 2005.  In November 2005,
the FERC accepted PNM’s complaint, set it for hearing, suspended hearings and
set the matter for settlement judge procedures.

SPS Wholesale Power Base Rate Application

— In December 2005, SPS filed at the FERC
for a $4.1 million annual increase in wholesale power rates for many of its
requirements and interruptible capacity wholesale customers.  In January 2006, the FERC issued an
order conditionally accepting and suspending the proposed rates until July 1,
2006, establishing hearing and settlement judge procedures.

Southwest Power Pool (SPP) Restructuring —

SPS is a member of the SPP regional
reliability council, and SPP acts as transmission tariff administrator for the
SPS system. In October 2003, SPP filed for FERC authorization to transform
its operation into an RTO.  On Oct. 1,
2004, the FERC issued an order granting the SPP status as an RTO.  SPS is required to obtain Kansas and NMPRC
approval before it can transfer functional control of its electrical
transmission system to SPP.  When SPP
begins RTO operations and SPS obtains all required approvals, SPS will be
required to transfer functional control of its electric transmission system to
SPP and take all transmission services, including services required to serve
retail native loads, under the SPP regional tariff.

SPP Energy Imbalance
Service

-

On June 15, 2005, SPP filed
proposed tariff provisions to establish an Energy Imbalance Service (EIS)
wholesale energy market for the SPP region, using a phased approach toward the
development of a fully-functional LMP energy market with appropriate FTR’s, to
be effective Mar. 1, 2006.  On July 15,
2005, Xcel Energy filed a protest addressing the EIS market proposal and urging
FERC to reject the proposal and provide guidance to SPP in its effort to design
and implement a fully functional Day 2 market for the SPP region to avoid “seams”
between the MISO and SPP regions.  On
Sept. 19, 2005, FERC issued an order rejecting the SPP EIS proposal and
providing guidance and recommendations to SPP; however, the FERC did not
require SPP to implement a full Day 2 market similar to MISO.  On Jan. 4, 2006, SPP filed a revised EIS
market proposal, to be effective May 1, 2006.  On Jan. 25, 2006, Xcel Energy protested
the revised EIS market proposal, requesting that FERC find SPP’s proposal as
incomplete and deficient even as a limited market, and reject it on that
basis.  A final FERC decision is expected
later in 2006.  SPS has not yet requested
NMPRC or PUCT approval regarding accounting and ratemaking treatment of EIS
costs.

Pending and Recently
Concluded Regulatory Proceedings - PUCT

SPS Texas Retail
Fuel Cost Reconciliation

– Fuel and purchased
energy costs are recovered in Texas through a fixed fuel and purchased energy
recovery factor.  In May 2004, SPS
filed with PUCT its periodic request for fuel and purchased power cost recovery
for January 2002 through December 2003.  SPS requested approval of approximately $580
million of Texas-jurisdictional fuel and purchased power costs for the two-year
period.  Intervenor testimony contained
objections to SPS’ methodology for assigning average fuel costs to certain
wholesale sales, among other things. 
Recovery of $49 million to $86 million of the requested amount was
contested by multiple intervenors.

In 2005, SPS entered into a non-unanimous stipulation with the PUCT
staff and several of the intervenors. 
The stipulation provided reasonable regulatory certainty for SPS on all
key issues raised in this proceeding.  On
Dec. 19, 2005, the PUCT issued an order approving the stipulation.  The stipulation reflects a liability of
approximately $25 million, which was accrued in 2004.  An additional accrual of $4 million was
recorded in 2005 to reflect the impact of the order through Dec. 31,
2005.  Under the terms of the
stipulation, SPS will file a Texas base rate case and its next fuel
reconciliation application by the end of May 2006.

Energy Legislation -

The 2005 Texas Legislature passed a law, effective
June 18, 2005, establishing statutory authority for electric utilities
outside of the electric reliability council of Texas in the SPP or the Western
Electricity Coordinating Council to have timely recovery of transmission
infrastructure investments.  After notice
and hearing, the PUCT may allow recovery on an annual basis of the reasonable
and necessary expenditures for transmission infrastructure improvement costs
and changes in wholesale transmission charges under a tariff approved by
FERC.  The PUCT will initiate a
rulemaking for this


process that is expected to take place largely in the first quarter of
2006.

Lamb County Electric Cooperative

—

On July 24, 1995, Lamb County Electric
Cooperative, Inc. (LCEC) petitioned the PUCT for a cease and desist order
against SPS. LCEC alleged that SPS had been unlawfully providing service to oil
field customers and their facilities in LCEC’s singly-certificated area. The
PUCT denied LCEC’s petition. See further discussion under Item 3 — Legal
Proceedings.

Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings - NMPRC

New Mexico Fuel
Review

- On Jan. 28, 2005, the NMPRC accepted
the staff petition for a review of SPS’ fuel and purchased power cost.  The staff requested a formal review of SPS’
fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause (FPPCAC) for the period of Oct. 1,
2001 through August 2004.  Hearings
in the fuel review case have been scheduled for April 2006.

New Mexico Fuel Factor Continuation Filing

-

The filing to continue the use of SPS’
FPPCAC was made on Aug. 18, 2005. 
This filing is required every two years pursuant to the NMPRC
rules.  The filing proposes that the
FPPCAC continue the current monthly factor cost recovery methodology.  Certain industrial customers have asked the
NMPRC to review SPS’ assignment of system average fuel cost to certain wholesale
capacity sales.  Customers have also
asked the NMPRC to investigate the treatment of renewable energy certificates
and sulfur dioxide allowance credit proceeds in relation to SPS’ New Mexico
retail fuel and purchased power recovery clause.   Hearings have been scheduled for April 2006,
and a NMPRC decision is expected in late 2006.

Capacity and Demand

Uninterrupted
system peak demand for SPS for each of the last three years and the forecast
for 2006, assuming normal weather, are listed below.

The
peak demand for the SPS system typically occurs in the summer.  The 2005 uninterrupted system peak demand for
SPS occurred on July 25, 2005.

Energy Sources and Related Transmission Initiatives

SPS
expects to use existing electric generating stations; purchases from other
utilities, independent power producers and power marketers and demand-side
management options to meet its net dependable system capacity requirements.

Purchased Power

— SPS has contractual arrangements to
purchase power from other utilities and nonregulated energy suppliers.
Capacity, typically measured in KW or MW, is the measure of the rate at which a
particular generating source produces electricity. Energy, typically measured
in Kwh or Mwh, is a measure of the amount of electricity produced from a
particular generating source over a period of time. Long-term purchase power
contracts typically require a periodic payment to secure the capacity from a
particular generating source and a charge for the associated energy actually
purchased from such generating source.

SPS
also makes short-term firm and non-firm purchases to replace generation from
company-owned units that are unavailable due to maintenance and unplanned
outages, to provide the utility’s reserve obligation, to obtain energy at a
lower cost than that which could be produced by other resource options,
including company-owned generation and/or long-term purchase power contracts,
and for various other operating requirements.

Purchased Transmission Services

— SPS has contractual arrangements with
regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to the
subsidiaries’ native load customers, which are retail and wholesale load
obligations with terms of more than one year. 
Point-to-point transmission services typically include a charge for the
specific amount of transmission capacity being reserved, although some
agreements may base charges on the amount of metered energy


delivered.  Network transmission services include a
charge for the metered demand at the delivery point at the time of the provider’s
monthly transmission system peak, usually calculated as a 12-month rolling
average.

Fuel Supply and Costs

The
following table shows the delivered cost per MMBtu of each significant category
of fuel consumed for electric generation, the percentage of total fuel
requirements represented by each category of fuel and the total weighted
average cost of all fuels during such years.

* The lower 2003 SPS coal costs reflect a prior period fuel credit
adjustment. The normalized cost per MMBtu was approximately $1.14.

See additional discussion of fuel supply and costs under Factors
Affecting Results of Continuing Operations in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis under Item 7.

Fuel Sources

— SPS purchases all of its coal requirements
for its two coal facilities, Harrington and Tolk electric generating stations, from
TUCO, Inc. in the form of crushed, ready-to-burn coal delivered to the
plant bunkers. TUCO, in turn, arranges for the purchase, receiving,
transporting, unloading, handling, crushing, weighing, and delivery of coal to
the plant bunkers to meet SPS’ requirements. TUCO is responsible for
negotiating and administering contracts with coal suppliers, transporters, and
handlers. For the Harrington station, the coal supply contract with TUCO
expires in 2016. For the Tolk station, the coal supply contract with TUCO
expires in 2017.  At Dec. 31, 2005,
coal supplies at the Harrington and Tolk sites were approximately 36 and 40
days supply, respectively.  See Item 7 –
Management’s Discussion & Analysis for discussion of coal delivery
disruptions.  TUCO has coal supply
agreements to supply 100 percent of the projected 2006 requirements for
Harrington and Tolk stations.  TUCO has
long-term contracts for supply of coal in sufficient quantities to meet the
primary needs of the Harrington and Tolk stations.

SPS
uses both firm and interruptible natural gas and standby oil in combustion
turbines and certain boilers. Natural gas suppliers for SPS’ power plants are
procured under short- and intermediate-term contracts to provide an adequate
supply of fuel.

Commodity Marketing Operations

SPS
conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and
sale of electric capacity, energy and energy related products. Participation in
short-term wholesale energy markets provides market intelligence and
information that supports the energy management of SPS.  SPS uses physical and financial instruments
to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge supplies and purchases.
Engaging in short-term sales and purchase commitments results in an efficient
use of our plants and the capturing of additional margins from non-traditional
customers.  On a limited basis, SPS also
uses these marketing operations to capture arbitrage opportunities created by
regional pricing differentials, supply and demand imbalances and changes in
fuel prices.  See additional discussion
under Item 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

NATURAL GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS

Natural Gas Utility Trends

Changes in regulatory policies and market forces have shifted the
industry from traditional bundled natural gas sales service to an unbundled
transportation and market-based commodity service at the wholesale level and
for larger commercial and industrial retail customers. These customers have
greater ability to buy natural gas directly from suppliers and arrange their
own pipeline and retail LDC transportation service.

The
natural gas delivery/transportation business has remained competitive as
industrial and large commercial customers have the ability to bypass the local
natural gas utility through the construction of interconnections directly with
interstate pipelines, thereby avoiding the delivery charges added by the local
natural gas utility.

As
LDCs, NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and PSCo provide unbundled transportation
service to large customers. Transportation service does not have an adverse
effect on earnings because the sales and transportation rates have been
designed to make them economically indifferent to whether natural gas has been
sold and transported or merely transported. However, some transportation
customers may have greater opportunities or incentives to physically bypass the
LDCs’ distribution system.

The
most significant recent developments in the natural gas operations of the
utility subsidiaries was the substantial and continuing increases in wholesale
natural gas market prices and the continued trend toward declining use per
customer by residential customers as a result of improved building construction
technologies and higher appliance efficiencies. 
From 1995 to 2005, average annual sales to the typical residential
customer declined from 104 Dth per year to 87 Dth per year on a
weather-normalized basis.  Although
recent wholesale price increases do not directly affect earnings because of gas
cost recovery mechanisms, the high prices are expected to encourage further
efficiency efforts by customers.

NSP-Minnesota

Ratemaking Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of
Jurisdiction

—
Retail rates, services and other aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s operations are
regulated by the MPUC and the NDPSC within their respective states. The MPUC
has regulatory authority over aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s financial activities,
including security issuances, certain property transfers, mergers with other
utilities and transactions between NSP-Minnesota and its affiliates. In
addition, the MPUC reviews and approves NSP-Minnesota’s gas supply plans for
meeting customers’ future energy needs.

Purchased Gas and Conservation Cost
Recovery Mechanisms

—

NSP-Minnesota’s retail natural gas rate
schedules for Minnesota and North Dakota include a PGA clause that provides for
prospective monthly rate adjustments to reflect the forecasted cost of
purchased natural gas. The annual difference between the natural gas costs
collected through PGA rates and the actual natural gas costs are collected or
refunded over the subsequent 12-month period. The MPUC and NDPSC have the
authority to disallow recovery of certain costs if they find the utility was
not prudent in its procurement activities.

NSP-Minnesota
is required by Minnesota law to spend a minimum of 0.5 percent of Minnesota
natural gas revenue on conservation improvement programs. These costs are
recovered through an annual cost recovery mechanism for natural gas
conservation and energy management program expenditures. NSP-Minnesota is
required to request a new cost recovery level annually.

Pending and
Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings

NSP-Minnesota
Natural Gas Rate Case

- In September 2004,
NSP-Minnesota filed a natural gas rate case for its Minnesota retail customers,
seeking a rate increase of $9.9 million, based on a return on equity of 11.5
percent.  In August 2005, the MPUC
approved an annual rate increase of $5.8 million, based on a return on equity
of 10.4 percent. Final rates became effective Dec. 1, 2005.


Capability and Demand

Natural
gas supply requirements are categorized as firm or interruptible (customers
with an alternate energy supply). The maximum daily send-out (firm and
interruptible) for NSP-Minnesota was 611,950 MMBtu for 2005, which occurred on Jan. 5,
2005.

NSP-Minnesota
purchases natural gas from independent suppliers. The natural gas is delivered
under natural gas transportation agreements with interstate pipelines. These
agreements provide for firm deliverable pipeline capacity of 521,854 MMBtu/day.
In addition, NSP-Minnesota has contracted with providers of underground natural
gas storage services. These storage agreements provide storage for
approximately 21 percent of winter natural gas requirements and 26 percent of
peak day, firm requirements of NSP-Minnesota.

NSP-Minnesota
also owns and operates one LNG plant with a storage capacity of 2.13 Bcf
equivalent and three propane-air plants with a storage capacity of 1.4 Bcf
equivalent to help meet its peak requirements. These peak-shaving facilities
have production capacity equivalent to 250,300 MMBtu of natural gas per day, or
approximately 34 percent of peak day firm requirements. LNG and propane-air
plants provide a cost-effective alternative to annual fixed pipeline
transportation charges to meet the peaks caused by firm space heating demand on
extremely cold winter days.

NSP-Minnesota
is required to file for a change in natural gas supply contract levels to meet
peak demand, to redistribute demand costs among classes or to exchange one form
of demand for another. NSP-Minnesota’s 2004-2005 entitlement levels were
approved on July 12, 2005 which allow NSP-Minnesota to recover the demand
entitlement costs associated with the increase in transportation, supply, and
storage levels in its monthly PGA. In June 2005, NSP-Minnesota also filed
to add incremental storage to its portfolio. 
The increase in storage was approved by the MPUC on Nov. 18,
2005.  The 2005-2006 entitlement levels
are pending MPUC action.

Natural Gas Supply and Costs

NSP-Minnesota
actively seeks natural gas supply, transportation and storage alternatives to
yield a diversified portfolio that provides increased flexibility, decreased
interruption and financial risk, and economical rates. This diversification
involves numerous domestic and Canadian supply sources with varied contract
lengths.

following table summarizes the average cost per MMBtu of natural gas purchased
for resale by NSP-Minnesota’s regulated retail natural gas distribution
business:


$

8.90


$

6.88


$

5.47

The
cost of natural gas supply, transportation service and storage service is
recovered through the PGA cost recovery mechanism.

NSP-Minnesota
has firm natural gas transportation contracts with several pipelines, which
expire in various years from 2006 through 2027.

NSP-Minnesota
has certain natural gas supply and transportation agreements that include
obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of natural
gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery. At Dec. 31, 2005, NSP-Minnesota
was committed to approximately $810 million in such obligations under these
contracts.

NSP-Minnesota
purchases firm natural gas supply utilizing long-term and short-term agreements
from approximately 25 domestic and Canadian suppliers. This diversity of
suppliers and contract lengths allows NSP-Minnesota to maintain competition
from suppliers and minimize supply costs.

delivered to the respective delivery systems through a combination of
transportation agreements with interstate pipelines and deliveries by suppliers
directly to each company. These agreements provide for firm deliverable
pipeline capacity of approximately 1,802,524 MMBtu/day, which includes 831,866
MMBtu of supplies held under third-party underground storage agreements. In
addition, PSCo operates three company-owned underground storage facilities,
which provide about 40,000 MMBtu of natural gas supplies on a peak day. The
balance of the quantities required to meet firm peak day sales obligations are
primarily purchased at the companies’ city gate meter stations and a small amount
is received directly from wellhead sources.

PSCo
has closed the Leyden Storage Field and is in the monitoring phase of the
abandonment process, which is expected to continue until December 2007.
See further discussion at Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Levee Station Manufactured Gas Plant Site

—
A portion of NSP-Minnesota’s High Bridge plant coal yard is located on the site
of the former Levee Station MGP site. The Levee Station was a coke-oven gas
purification, storage and distribution facility.  The Levee Station supplied manufactured gas
to the city of St. Paul from 1918 to the early 1950s.  In the 1950s, the facility was demolished,
and the High Bridge coal yard was extended onto the property.  In the 1990s, the site was investigated and
partially remediated at a cost of approximately $2.9 million.  In 2006, NSP-Minnesota plans to commence
construction of the High Bridge Combined Cycle Generating Plant, as part of the
MERP, on the site of the Levee Station. The construction of the new plant
required the removal of buried structures and soil and groundwater remediation.
Remediation activities were essentially completed in 2005 at a cost of $3.5
million, which will be accounted for as a capital expenditure of the MERP
project.

Item 1A —
Risk Factors

Risks
Associated with Our Business

Our profitability depends in part on the ability of our utility
subsidiaries to recover their costs from their customers and there may be
changes in circumstances or in the regulatory environment that impair the
ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover costs from their customers.

We are subject
to comprehensive regulation by several federal and state utility regulatory
agencies, which significantly influences our operating environment and our
ability to recover our costs from utility customers. The utility commissions in
the states where our utility subsidiaries operate regulate many aspects of our
utility operations including siting and construction of facilities, customer
service and the rates that we can charge customers.

The
profitability of our utility operations is dependent on our ability to recover
costs related to providing energy and utility services to our customers.  Our public utility subsidiaries currently
provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  These rates are generally regulated based on
an analysis of the utility’s expenses incurred in a test year.  Thus, the rates a utility is allowed to
charge may or may not match its expenses at any given time.  While rate regulation is premised on
providing a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on
invested capital, there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory
commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that
the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in
rates that will produce full recovery of our costs.   Although we believe that the current
regulatory environment applicable to our business would permit us to recover
the costs of our utility services, it is possible that there could be changes
in the regulatory environment that would impair our ability to recover costs
historically collected from our customers.

State utility
commissions generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the
utility customers are being met. The state utility commissions also may seek to
impose restrictions on the ability of our utility subsidiaries to pay dividends
to us. If successful, this could materially and adversely affect our ability to
meet our financial obligations, including paying dividends on our common stock.

The FERC has
jurisdiction over wholesale rates for electric transmission service, electric
energy sold at wholesale in interstate commerce, hydro facility licensing and
certain other activities of our utility subsidiaries. Federal, state and local
agencies also have jurisdiction over many of our other activities, including
regulation of retail rates and environmental matters.

We are unable
to predict the impact on our operating results from the future regulatory
activities of any of these agencies. Changes in regulations or the imposition
of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of
operations and hence could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet
our financial obligations, including paying dividends on our common stock.

We are subject to commodity price risk, credit risk and other risks
associated with energy markets.

We engage in
wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity, energy and energy-related
products and, accordingly, are subject to commodity price risk, credit risk and
other risks associated with these activities.

We are exposed to
market and credit risks in our generation, distribution, commodity acquisition,
short-term wholesale and commodity trading activities.  To minimize the risk of market price
fluctuations and product availability, we enter into physical and financial
contracts to hedge both price and availability risk associated with purchase
and sale commitments, fuel requirements and inventories of coal, natural gas,
fuel oil and energy and energy-related products.  However, these contracts do not completely
eliminate risks, including commodity price changes, market supply shortages, credit
risk and interest rate changes. The impact of these variables could result in
our inability to fulfill contractual obligations, significantly higher energy
or fuel costs relative to corresponding sales commitments or increased interest
expense.

Credit and
performance risk includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or
product will breach their obligations. Should the counterparties to these
arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative
arrangements. In that event, our financial results could be adversely affected
and we could incur losses.

We mark
commodity trading derivatives to estimated fair market value on a daily basis
(mark-to-market accounting), which causes earnings variability. Quoted market
prices are utilized in determining the value of these derivative commodity
instruments.  For positions for which
market prices are not available, we utilize models based on forward price
curves. These


models incorporate
estimates and assumptions as to a variety of factors such as pricing
relationships between various energy commodities and geographic locations.
Actual experience can vary significantly from these estimates and assumptions.

Our subsidiary, PSCo, has received a notice from the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) proposing to disallow certain interest expense deductions that
PSCo claimed in 1993 through 1999. Should the IRS ultimately prevail on this
issue, our liquidity position and financial results could be materially
adversely affected.

PSCo’s wholly
owned subsidiary PSR Investments, Inc. (PSRI) owns and manages permanent
life insurance policies on some of PSCo’s employees, known as corporate-owned
life insurance (COLI). At various times, borrowings have been made against the
cash values of these COLI policies and deductions taken on the interest expense
on these borrowings. The IRS has challenged the deductibility of such interest
expense deductions and has disallowed the deductions taken in tax years 1993
through 1999.

We believe
that the tax deduction of interest expense on the COLI policy loans is in full
compliance with the law. Accordingly, PSRI has not recorded any provision for
income tax or related interest or penalties that may be imposed by the IRS and
has continued to take deductions for interest expense related to policy loans
on its income tax returns for subsequent years.

In April 2004,
Xcel Energy filed a lawsuit against the government in the U.S. District Court
for the District of Minnesota to establish its right to deduct the policy loan
interest expense that had accrued during tax years 1993 and 1994 on policy
loans related to its COLI policies.

After Xcel Energy had filed this suit, the IRS sent it two statutory
notices of proposed deficiency of tax, penalty, and interest for taxable years
1995 through 1999.  Xcel Energy then
timely filed two Tax Court petitions challenging those notices.  Xcel Energy anticipates that the dispute
relating to its claimed interest expense deductions for tax years 1993 and
later will be resolved in the refund suit that is pending in the Minnesota
federal district court and that the two Tax Court petitions will be held in
abeyance pending the outcome of the refund litigation.

On
Oct. 12, 2005, the district court denied Xcel Energy’s motion for summary
judgment on the grounds that there were disputed issues of material fact that
required a trial for resolution.  At the
same time, the district court denied the government’s motion for summary
judgment that was based on its contention that PSCo had lacked an insurable
interest in the lives of the employees insured under the COLI policies.  However, the district court granted Xcel
Energy’s motion for partial summary judgment on the grounds that PSCo did have
the requisite insurable interest.  The
case is expected to proceed to trial and the litigation could take another two
or more years.

Xcel Energy believes that the tax deduction for interest expense on the
COLI policy loans is in full compliance with the tax law. Accordingly, PSRI has
not recorded any provision for income tax or related interest or penalties that
may be imposed by the IRS and has continued to take deductions for interest
expense related to policy loans on its income tax returns for subsequent years.  As discussed above, the litigation could
require several years to reach final resolution.  Defense of Xcel Energy’s position may require
significant cash outlays, which may or may not be recoverable in a court
proceeding.  Although the ultimate resolution
of this matter is uncertain, it could have a material adverse effect on Xcel
Energy’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Should the IRS
ultimately prevail on this issue, tax and interest payable through Dec. 31,
2005, would reduce retained earnings by an estimated $361 million.  In 2004, Xcel Energy received formal
notification that the IRS will seek penalties. If penalties (plus associated
interest) also are included, the total exposure through Dec. 31, 2005, is
approximately $428 million.  Xcel Energy
annual earnings for 2006 would be reduced by approximately $44 million, after
tax, which represents 10 cents per share, if COLI interest expense deductions
were no longer available.

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations, compliance with
which could be difficult and costly.

We are subject to
a number of environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our
past, present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality,
wastewater discharges and the management of wastes and hazardous
substances.  These laws and regulations
generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental
registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals.  Environmental laws and regulations can also
require us to perform environmental remediations and to install pollution
control equipment at our facilities. 
Both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce the
applicable environmental laws and regulations against us.  We must pay all or a portion of the cost to
remediate sites where our past activities, or the activities of certain other
parties, caused environmental


contamination.  At December 31, 2005, these sites
included:

•

the site of a former federal
uranium enrichment facility;

•

the sites of former manufactured
gas plants operated by our subsidiaries or predecessors; and

•

third party sites, such as
landfills, to which we are alleged to be a potentially responsible party that
sent hazardous materials and wastes.

In addition, we
cannot assure you that existing environmental laws or regulations will not be
revised or that new laws or regulations seeking to protect the environment will
not be adopted or become applicable to us or that we will not identify in the
future conditions that will result in obligations or liabilities under existing
environmental laws and regulations. 
Revised or additional laws or regulations which result in increased
compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, or currently
unanticipated costs or restrictions under existing laws or regulations,
particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

For further discussion see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Our subsidiary, NSP-Minnesota, is subject to the risks of nuclear
generation.

NSP-Minnesota’s
two nuclear stations, Prairie Island and Monticello, subject it to the risks of
nuclear generation, which include:

•

the risks associated with storage,
handling and disposal of radioactive materials and the current lack of a
long-term disposal solution for radioactive materials;

•

limitations on the amounts and types of insurance
commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with
nuclear operations; and

•

uncertainties with respect to the
technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the
end of their licensed lives.

The Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) has broad authority under federal law to impose
licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear
generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the
authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its
assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.
Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate
substantial capital expenditures at NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear plants. In
addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident,
if an incident did occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial condition. Furthermore, the non-compliance
of other nuclear facilities operators with applicable regulations or the
occurrence of a serious nuclear incident at other facilities could result in
increased regulation of the industry as a whole, which could then increase
NSP-Minnesota’s compliance costs and impact the results of operations of its
facilities.

Recession, grid disturbances, acts of war or terrorism could negatively
impact our business.

The
consequences of a prolonged recession and adverse market conditions may include
the continued uncertainty of energy prices and the capital and commodity
markets. We cannot predict the impact of any economic slowdown or fluctuating
energy prices. However, such impact could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

Also, because
our generation and transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional
grid, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption or
black-out caused by an event (severe storm, generator or transmission facility
outage) on a neighboring system or the actions of a neighboring utility,
similar to the Aug. 14, 2003 black-out in portions of the eastern U.S. and
Canada. Any such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues
and significant additional costs to repair assets, which could have a material
adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

The conflict
in Iraq and any other military strikes or sustained military campaign may
affect our operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance
markets, force us to increase security measures and cause disruptions of fuel
supplies and markets, particularly with respect to natural gas and purchased
energy. The possibility that infrastructure facilities, such as electric
generation, transmission and distribution facilities, would be direct targets
of, or indirect casualties of, an act of war may affect our operations. War and
the possibility of further war may have an adverse impact on the economy in
general. A lower level of economic activity might result in a decline in energy
consumption, which may adversely affect our revenues and future growth.
Instability in the financial markets as a result of war may also affect our
ability to raise capital.


Further, like
other operators of major industrial facilities, our generation plants, fuel
storage facilities and transmission and distribution facilities may be targets
of terrorist activities that could result in disruption of our ability to
produce or distribute some portion of our energy products. Any such disruption
could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional
costs to repair and insure our assets, which could have a material adverse
impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  The potential for terrorism has subjected our
operations to increased risks and could have a material adverse effect on our
business.  While we have already incurred
increased costs for security and capital expenditures in response to these
risks, we may experience additional capital and operating costs to implement
security for our plants, including our nuclear power plants under the NRC’s
design basis threat requirements, such as additional physical plant security
and additional security personnel.

The insurance
industry has also been affected by these events.  To date, we have been able to obtain
insurance at satisfactory levels and terms; however, the availability of
insurance covering risks we and our competitors typically insure against may
decrease.  In addition, the insurance we
are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more
restrictive policy terms.

Reduced coal
availability could negatively impact our business.

Xcel Energy’s coal generation portfolio is heavily dependent on coal
supplies located in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.  Approximately 70 percent of our annual coal
requirement comes from this area. Coal generation comprises approximately 60
percent to 85 percent of our annual generation for the operating
utilities.  In the first half of 2005, we
began experiencing disruptions in our coal deliveries from the Powder River
Basin, which continued throughout the year and are expected to continue at
least through part of 2006.  In response
to these disruptions Xcel Energy mitigated the impact of reduced coal
deliveries, by modifying the dispatch of certain facilities to conserve coal
inventories. In addition to the mitigation efforts, Xcel Energy negotiated for
the acquisition of additional, higher capacity rail cars and is working to
upgrade certain coal handling facilities with completion anticipated in the
first half of 2006.  Despite, these
efforts, coal inventories have declined to below target levels. While we have
secured, under contract, approximately 99 percent of our anticipated 2006 coal
requirements, we cannot predict with any certainty the likelihood of receiving
the required coal.  This factor, combined
with the currently low inventory levels, has led us to continue coal mitigation.  While we are planning to rebuild inventories
during 2006, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so.   The ultimate impact of coal availability
cannot be fully assessed at this time, but could impact our future
results.

Rising energy prices could negatively impact our business.

A variety of
market factors have contributed to higher natural gas prices.  The direct impact of these higher costs is
generally mitigated for Xcel Energy through recovery of such costs from
customers through various fuel cost recovery mechanisms.  However, higher fuel costs could
significantly impact the results of operations, if requests for recovery are
unsuccessful.  In addition, the higher
fuel costs could reduce customer demand or increase bad debt expense, which
could also have a material impact on Xcel Energy’s results of operations.  Delays in the timing of the collection of
fuel cost recoveries as compared with expenditures for fuel purchases are
expected to have an impact on the cash flows of Xcel Energy.  Xcel Energy is unable to predict the future
natural gas prices or the ultimate impact of such prices on its results of
operations or cash flows.

Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis
and can be adversely affected by milder weather.

Our electric
and natural gas utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns
can have a material impact on our operating performance. Demand for electricity
is often greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and
heating. Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial
heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon weather patterns
throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas
revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating
season. Accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenues
and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the
summer. We expect that unusually mild winters and summers would have an adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our natural gas distribution activities involve numerous risks that may
result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.

There are
inherent in our natural gas distribution activities a variety of hazards and
operating risks, such as leaks, explosions and mechanical problems, that could
cause substantial financial losses.  In
addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to
property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial
losses to us.  In accordance with
customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all,
of these risks and losses.


The occurrence
of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material
adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.  For our distribution lines located near
populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers,
industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the level of damages
resulting from these risks is greater.

Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans,
health care plans and other employee-related benefits may adversely affect our
results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

We have
defined benefit and postretirement plans that cover substantially all of our
employees.  Assumptions related to future
costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions
have a significant impact on our earnings and funding requirements.  Based on our assumptions at Dec. 31,
2005 and assuming continuation of the current federal interest rate relief
beyond 2005, in order to maintain required funding levels for our pension
plans, we do not expect to make required future contributions.  However, it is our practice to make voluntary
contributions to maintain more prudent funding levels than minimally
required.  These amounts are estimates
and may change based on actual stock market performance, changes in interest
rates and any changes in governmental regulations.  Therefore, contributions could be required in
the future.

In addition to
the costs of our retirement plans, the costs of providing health care benefits
to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent
years.  We believe that our employee
benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees
and former employees, will continue to rise. 
The increasing costs and funding requirements with our defined benefit
retirement plan, health care plans and other employee benefits may adversely
affect our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Risks
Associated with Our Holding Company Structure

We must rely on cash from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments.

We are a
holding company and thus our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary
assets. Substantially all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries.
Consequently, our operating cash flow and our ability to service our
indebtedness and pay dividends, depends upon the operating cash flow of our
subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends.
Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any
amounts due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that
purpose or for dividends on our common stock, whether by dividends or
otherwise. In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us
depends on any statutory and/or contractual restrictions that may be applicable
to such subsidiary, which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels
of equity ratios, working capital or other assets.

Our utility
subsidiaries are regulated by various state utility commissions which generally
possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are
being met. To the extent that the state commissions attempt to impose
restrictions on the ability of our utility subsidiaries to pay dividends to us,
it could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and
preferred stock or otherwise meet our financial obligations.

Our utility subsidiaries are 
subject to regulatory restrictions on accessing capital.

Financings by
our utility subsidiaries are subject to prior approval by the applicable state
regulatory commission and, possibly, by the FERC.  The state utility commissions generally
posses broad powers to ensure the needs of the utility customers are being met
and there is no assurance they will authorize financings in amounts requested
by our utility subsidiaries.

For additional
information regarding our liquidity and capital resources, see Item 7 –
Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

Any reductions in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs
and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships.

We cannot
assure you that any of our current ratings or our subsidiaries’ ratings will
remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be
lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. 
Any future downgrade could increase the cost of short-term borrowings
but would not result in any defaults or accelerations as a result of the rating
changes.  Any downgrade could lead to
higher borrowing costs.


Certain provisions of law, as well as provisions in our bylaws and
shareholder rights plan, may make it more difficult for others to obtain
control of us, even though some shareholders might consider this favorable.

We are a
Minnesota corporation and certain anti-takeover provisions of Minnesota law
apply to us and create various impediments to the acquisition of control of us
or to the consummation of certain business combinations with us.  In addition, our shareholder rights plan
contains provisions which may make it more difficult to effect certain business
combinations with us without the approval of our board of directors.  Finally, certain federal and state utility
regulatory statutes may also make it difficult for another party to acquire a
controlling interest in us.  These
provisions of law and of our corporate documents, individually or in the
aggregate, could discourage a future takeover attempt which individual
shareholders might deem to be in their best interests or in which shareholders
would receive a premium for their shares over current prices.

Legal Contingencies

Nuclear Waste
Disposal Litigation

— The federal government has the responsibility to dispose of
domestic spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive substances. The
Nuclear Waste Policy Act (the Act) requires the DOE to implement this disposal
program. This includes the siting, licensing, construction and operation of a
permanent repository for domestically produced spent nuclear fuel from civilian
nuclear power reactors and other high-level radioactive substances.   The Act and contracts between DOE and
domestic utilities obligated DOE to begin to dispose of these materials by Jan. 31,
1998.  The federal government has
designated the site as Yucca Mountain in Nevada. The nuclear waste disposal program
has resulted in extensive litigation.

On June 8, 1998, NSP-Minnesota filed a complaint in the U.S. Court
of Federal Claims against the United States requesting  breach of contract damages in excess of $1
billion for the DOE’s failure to meet the 1998 deadline.  NSP-Minnesota has demanded damages consisting
of the added costs of storage of spent nuclear fuel at the Prairie Island and
Monticello nuclear generating plants, costs related to the Private Fuel Storage,
LLC and certain costs relating to the 1994 and 2003 state legislation relating
to the storage of spent nuclear fuel at Prairie Island.  On July 31, 2001, the Court granted
NSP-Minnesota’s motion for partial summary judgment on liability.  The Court has set the start of the trial on Oct. 23,
2006.

On July 9, 2004, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision in consolidated
cases challenging regulations and decisions on the federal nuclear waste
program. The Court of Appeals rejected challenges by the state of Nevada and
other intervenors with respect to most of the NRC’s challenged repository
licensing regulations, the congressional resolution approving Yucca Mountain as
the site of the permanent repository, and the DOE and presidential actions
leading to the approval of the Yucca Mountain site. The Court of Appeals
vacated the 10,000 year compliance period adopted by EPA regulations governing
spent nuclear fuel disposal at Yucca Mountain and incorporated in the NRC
regulations. Xcel Energy has not ascertained the impact of the decision on its
nuclear operations and storage of spent nuclear fuel; however, the decision may
result in additional delay and uncertainty around disposal of spent nuclear
fuel.

Lamb County Electric
Cooperative (SPS)

— On July 24, 1995, LCEC petitioned the PUCT for a cease
and desist order against SPS alleging that SPS was unlawfully providing service
to oil field customers in LCEC’s certificated area.  On May 23, 2003, the PUCT issued an
order denying LCEC’s petition based on its determination that SPS was granted a
certificate in 1976 to serve the disputed customers.  LCEC appealed the decision to the District
Court in Travis County, Texas and on Aug. 12, 2004, the District Court
affirmed the decision of the PUCT.  On
Sept. 9, 2004, LCEC appealed the District Court’s decision to the Court of
Appeals for the Third Supreme Judicial District of the state of Texas, which
appeal is currently pending.  Oral
arguments in the case were heard March 23, 2005.  SPS is awaiting the Court of Appeals
decision.

On Oct. 18, 1996, LCEC filed a suit for damages against SPS in the
District Court in Lamb County, Texas, based on the same facts alleged in the
petition for a cease and desist order at the PUCT. This suit has been dormant
since it was filed, awaiting a final determination at the PUCT of the legality
of SPS providing electric service to the disputed customers.  The PUCT order of May 23, 2003, found
that SPS was legally serving the disputed customers, thus collaterally
determining the issue of liability contrary to LCEC’s position in the
suit.  An adverse ruling on the appeal of
May 23, 2003 PUCT order could result in a re-determination of the legality
of SPS’ service to the disputed customers.

Manufactured Gas Plant Insurance
Coverage Litigation (NSP-Wisconsin)

—

In
October 2003, NSP-Wisconsin initiated discussions with its insurers
regarding the availability of insurance coverage for costs associated with the
remediation of four former MGP sites located in Ashland, Chippewa Falls, Eau
Claire, and LaCrosse, Wis. In lieu of participating in discussions, on Oct. 28,
2003, two of NSP-Wisconsin’s insurers, St. Paul Fire & Marine
Insurance Co. and St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co., commenced litigation against
NSP-Wisconsin in Minnesota state district court. On Nov. 12, 2003,
NSP-Wisconsin commenced suit in Wisconsin state circuit court against St. Paul
Fire & Marine Insurance Co. and its other insurers. Subsequently, the
Wisconsin court denied the insurers’ motion to stay the Wisconsin case pending
resolution of the Minnesota action.  On Jan. 6,
2005, the Minnesota court issued an injunction prohibiting NSP-Wisconsin from
prosecuting the Wisconsin action.  On Dec. 27,
2005, the Minnesota Court of Appeals upheld the issuance of the anti-suit
injunction.  On January 26, 2006,
NSP-Wisconsin submitted for filing its petition for review with the Minnesota
Supreme Court.  On January 13, 2006,
the Minnesota trial court extended its stay of the anti-suit injunction until February 28,
2006, or until the Minnesota Supreme Court denies NSP-Wisconsin’s petition for
review, whichever occurs first.  If the
petition for review is accepted


after February 28,
2006, the parties may seek leave to re-instate the stay.  Trial in the Minnesota action is scheduled to
commence on November 6, 2006.  A
status conference in the Wisconsin action is scheduled for February 23,
2006.  Trial in the Wisconsin action is
scheduled to begin in January 2007.

On January 10, 2006, NSP-Wisconsin, entered into a confidential
settlement agreement with St. Paul Mercury Insurance Company, St. Paul Fire and
Marine Insurance Company and The Phoenix Insurance Company (“St. Paul Companies”),
and the St. Paul Companies have been dismissed from the Minnesota and Wisconsin
actions.   The settlement with the St.
Paul Companies will not have a material effect on NSP-Wisconsin shareholders.

On Feb. 10, 2006, NSP-Wisconsin filed with the Minnesota court a
renewed motion for dismissal under the doctrine of forum non conveniens and a
motion for dissolution of the anti-suit injunction.  These motions were based upon the changed
circumstances resulting from the dismissal of the St. Paul Companies.  The St. Paul Companies were the only
Minnesota-based insurers and provided what the trial court viewed as a pivotal
Minnesota connection supporting its issuance of the anti-suit injunction and
denial of NSP-Wisconsin’s February 2004 motion to dismiss under the
doctrine of forum non conveniens.  These
motions are currently set for hearing on March 13, 2006.

The PSCW has
established a deferral process whereby clean-up costs associated with the
remediation of former MGP sites are deferred and, if approved by the PSCW,
recovered from ratepayers. Carrying charges associated with these clean-up
costs are not subject to the deferral process and are not recoverable from
ratepayers. Any insurance proceeds received by NSP-Wisconsin will operate as a
credit to ratepayers, therefore, these lawsuits should not have an impact on shareholders,
and no accruals have been made.

Hill et al. vs. PSCo
et al.

- In October 2003, there were two
wildfires in Colorado, one in Boulder County and the other in Douglas
County.  There was no loss of life, but
there was property damage associated with these fires. Parties have asserted
that trees falling into Xcel Energy distribution lines may have caused one or
both fires.  On Jan. 14, 2004, an
action against PSCo relating to the fire in Boulder County was filed in Boulder
County District Court. There are now 46 plaintiffs, including individuals and
insurance companies, and three co-defendants, including PSCo.  The plaintiffs asserted damages in excess of
$35 million.  In June 2005, PSCo
reached a confidential settlement with all parties, as well as the United
States Forest Service and the Denver Public Schools, settling claims in
connection with the fire in Boulder County. 
The financial impact of the settlement was not material to Xcel Energy.

SchlumbergerSema, Inc. vs. Xcel Energy
Inc. (NSP-Minnesota)

-

Under a 1996 data services agreement, as amended,
SchlumbergerSema, Inc. (SLB) provided automated meter reading,
distribution automation and other data services to NSP-Minnesota. In September 2002,
NSP-Minnesota issued written notice that SLB committed events of default under
the agreement, including SLB’s nonpayment of approximately $7.4 million for
distribution automation assets. In November 2002, SLB demanded arbitration
and asserted various claims against NSP-Minnesota totaling approximately $24 million
for alleged breach of an expansion contract and a meter purchasing contract. In
the arbitration, NSP-Minnesota asserted counterclaims against SLB, including
those related to SLB’s failure to meet performance criteria, improper billing,
failure to pay for use of NSP-Minnesota owned property and failure to pay $7.4
million for NSP-Minnesota distribution automation assets, for total claims of
approximately $41 million. NSP-Minnesota also sought a declaratory judgment
from the arbitrators that would terminate SLB’s rights under the data services
agreement. In August 2004, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware ruled that claims related to use of certain equipment are barred
unless NSP-Minnesota can establish a basis for the claims in SLB’s conduct
subsequent to the time of the assumption of this contract by SLB in May 2000.  In June 2005, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
ruled that NSP-Minnesota is barred from asserting any claim or defense against
SLB that is based, in whole or in part, on any pre-May 2000 act or
omission, including, but not limited to, any act or omission resulting in
design or performance defects, by Cellnet Data Systems Inc., the party with
which NSP-Minnesota originally contracted and from which SLB assumed the
relevant agreements, which act or omission could have been a basis for
NSP-Minnesota to assert a breach of contract against Cellnet Data Systems
Inc.  On Oct. 31, 2005, the parties
submitted this dispute to mediation, and reached a confidential settlement that
did not have a material financial impact on Xcel Energy.

Quarterly Stock Data

Xcel
Energy’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the
Chicago Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange. The trading symbol is
XEL. The following are the reported high and low sales prices based on the NYSE
Composite Transactions for the quarters of 2005 and 2004 and the dividends
declared per share during those quarters.

Book
value per share at Dec. 31, 2005, was $13.37. The number of common
shareholders of record as of Dec. 31, 2005 was 115,000.

Xcel
Energy’s Restated Articles of Incorporation provide for certain restrictions on
the payment of cash dividends on common stock. At Dec. 31, 2005 and 2004,
the payment of cash dividends on common stock was not restricted.  For further discussion of Xcel Energy’s
dividend policy, see Liquidity and Capital Resources under Item 7.

Item 12 for information concerning securities authorized for issuance under
equity compensation plans.

Item 6 — Selected Financial Data


(a)   Operating
revenues and expenses for 2001 through 2004 include reclassifications to
conform to the 2005 presentation. These reclassifications relate to reporting
electric and natural gas trading revenues and costs on a net basis, reporting
fees collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies net of the
related payments made to the agencies and to presenting the results of
discontinued operations separately. These reclassifications had no effect on
net income.

(b)   Excludes
undistributed equity income and includes allowance for funds used during
construction.

(c)   Total
assets for 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002 reflect the classification of accrued
future plant removal costs as a component of regulatory liabilities.  In 2001, accrued future plant removal costs
are reflected as a component of accumulated depreciation. Accrued future
removal costs were $896 million, $891 million, $852 million and $800 million in
2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(d)  Long-term
debt includes only debt of continuing operations.

(e)           The 2002 average number of common and potentially dilutive
shares has been restated to include the effect of dilutive securities, which
were excluded in 2002 due to Xcel Energy’s loss from continuing operations.
Including these securities would have been antidilutive, or would have reduced
the reported loss per share. In 2002, the loss from continuing operations that
was caused by NRG made some securities “antidilutive” or would have reduced the
reported loss per share. In 2003, NRG’s results were reclassified to
discontinued operations.


Item
7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

BUSINESS
SEGMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW

Xcel Energy Inc. (Xcel
Energy), a Minnesota corporation, is a public utility holding company. In 2005,
Xcel Energy continuing operations included the activity of four utility
subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in 10 states. These
utility subsidiaries are Northern States Power Co., a Minnesota corporation
(NSP-Minnesota); Northern States Power Co., a Wisconsin corporation
(NSP-Wisconsin); Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo); and Southwestern
Public Service Co. (SPS). These utilities serve customers in portions of
Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin.  Along
with WestGas InterState Inc. (WGI), an interstate natural gas pipeline, these
companies comprise our continuing regulated utility operations.

Xcel Energy’s nonregulated
subsidiaries reported in continuing operations include Eloigne Co. (investments
in rental housing projects that qualify for low-income housing tax reported
credits).

Discontinued utility
operations include Viking Gas Transmission Co. (Viking), an interstate natural
gas pipeline company that was sold in January 2003; Black Mountain Gas Co.
(BMG), a regulated natural gas and propane distribution company that was sold
in October 2003; and Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Co. (Cheyenne), a
regulated electric and natural gas utility that was sold in January 2005.

During
2003, Planergy International, Inc. (Planergy) (energy management
solutions) closed, with final dissolution completed in 2004.  Several nonregulated subsidiaries are
presented as a component of discontinued operations.  They include Utility Engineering (UE), an
engineering, design and construction management firm; Quixx Corp., a former
subsidiary of UE that partners in cogeneration projects; Seren Innovations, Inc.
(Seren), a broadband communications services company; NRG Energy, Inc.
(NRG), an independent power producer; Xcel Energy International, Inc., an
international independent power producer; and e prime inc. (e prime), a natural
gas marketing and trading company.

Discontinued operations
classifications are the result of sales or plans to sell by management.  See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations.

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2005.

MANAGEMENT’S
STRATEGIC PLAN

Xcel Energy’s strategy, which we call Building the Core, is to invest
in our core utility businesses and earn the return authorized by our regulatory
commissions.  We plan to invest
approximately $7 billion over the next five years in our core operations to
grow our business in response to an increase in customer demand.  We anticipate a need for additional energy
supply in both Colorado and Minnesota during the next 15 years.  Additionally, we continue to focus on
enhancing the reliability of our electrical system, which includes making
significant investment in our transmission and distribution systems.

Over the past five years, we’ve divested 10 businesses or subsidiaries
that were not closely linked to our core electric and natural gas businesses,
realizing cash proceeds of nearly $440 million. 
Today, we’re a vertically integrated utility and we intend to stay that
way.


Our strategy of Building the Core has three phases.  The first phase is obtaining legislative and
regulatory support for our large investment initiatives prior to making the
investment.  To avoid excessive risk for
the company, it is critical to reduce regulatory uncertainty before making
large capital investments.  We accomplished
this for both the Metropoliton Emission Reduction Project (MERP) in Minnesota
and the Comanche 3 coal plant in Colorado. 
Transmission legislation has been passed in Minnesota, allowing that
state’s regulatory commission to approve recovery for transmission investments
without filing a general rate case.  In
Texas, the legislature authorized annual recovery for transmission
infrastructure improvements.  Both pieces
of legislation will support necessary new investment in our transmission
system.

The second phase is making
those investments.  In a normal year, we
spend approximately $1 billion on capital projects.  In addition to our base level of capital
investment, we expect to spend approximately $1 billion on MERP and $1 billion
on Comanche 3 through 2010.  As a result
of these investments, as well as continued investments in our transmission and
distribution system, to ensure continued reliability and to meet our customer
growth requirements, we expect that our rate base, or the amount on which we
earn a return, will grow annually by slightly more than 4 percent on average.  Finally, such investments will always be made
with a clear focus on optimizing environmental protection, a significant
priority for Xcel Energy.

The third phase is earning a
fair return on our investments.  To
ensure that we earn a fair return, our regulatory strategy is to receive
regulatory approval for rate riders as well as general rate cases.  A rate rider is a mechanism that allows us to
recover certain costs and returns on investments without the costs and delays
of filing a rate case.  These riders
allow for timely revenue recovery and are good mechanisms to recover the costs
of large projects or other costs that vary over time.  As an example, a rider for MERP went into
effect in January 2006, allowing us to earn a return on the project while
the facility is being constructed.

We also are filing
general rate cases to increase revenue recovery in most of the states in which
we operate.  In 2005, we filed several
rate cases as part of our regulatory strategy. 
These rate cases, and others that we plan to file in 2006, are some of
the building blocks of our earnings growth plan.  Following is the current status of these
initiatives:

•

We reached constructive decisions in the
Colorado natural gas case and Wisconsin electric and natural gas cases, which
will increase revenue in 2006 (see Factors Affecting Results of Continuing
Operations for further discussion).

•

We are on track with the Minnesota
electric case, where interim rates, subject to refund, went into effect in January 2006.  We expect a decision in the third quarter of
this year.

•

Later in the year we plan to file electric
cases in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, and possibly North Dakota and South
Dakota.  If we are successful, these
cases should increase revenue and earnings in 2007.

Our regulatory
strategy is based on filing reasonable rate requests designed to provide
recovery of legitimate expenses and a return on our utility investments.  We believe that our commissions will provide
us with reasonable recovery, and it’s important to note that our financial
plans include this assumption.  Recent
constructive results, along with past rulings, are evidence of reasonable
regulatory treatment and give us confidence that we are pursuing the right
strategy.

With any strategic plan, there are goals and objectives. We feel the
following financial objectives are both realistic and achievable:

•

Annual
earnings-per-share growth rate target of 5 percent to 7 percent from 2005-2009;

•

Annual
dividend increases of 2 percent to 4 percent; and

•

Senior
unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range.

Successful execution of our Building the Core strategic plan should
allow us to achieve our financial objectives, which in turn should provide
investors with an attractive total return on a low-risk investment.

FINANCIAL
REVIEW

The following discussion and
analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on
Xcel Energy’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during
the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future.
It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements and Notes. All note references refer to the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Summary of
Financial Results

The following table
summarizes the earnings contributions of Xcel Energy’s business segments on the
basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Continuing operations
consist of the following:

•

Regulated
utility subsidiaries, operating in the electric and natural gas segments; and

•

Several
nonregulated subsidiaries and the holding company, where corporate financing
activity occurs.


Discontinued operations
consist of the following:

•

Quixx
Corp., which was classified as held for
sale in the third quarter of 2005 based on a decision to divest this
investment;

•

Utility
Engineering Corp., which was sold in April 2005;

•

Seren,
a portion of which was sold in November 2005 with the remainder sold in January 2006;

•

Viking
and BMG, which were sold in 2003;

•

Cheyenne,
which was sold in January 2005;

•

NRG,
which emerged from bankruptcy and was divested in late 2003; and

•

Xcel
Energy International and e prime, which were classified as held for sale in
late 2003 based on the decision to divest them.

Certain items in the
statements of operations have been reclassified from prior-period presentation
to conform to the 2005 presentation.  See
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of
discontinued operations.

(a) Not a reportable
segment. Included in All Other segment results in Note 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

(b) Includes tax
benefit related to NRG. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Earnings from continuing
operations for 2005 were lower than in 2004. 
The 2005 results had higher operating margins, which were offset by
higher operating and maintenance expenses, including scheduled nuclear plant
outages in 2005, higher employee benefit costs, higher uncollectible receivable
expense and higher depreciation expense. 
In addition, tax expense recorded in 2005 was higher than 2004,
primarily attributable to tax benefits recorded in 2004 related to the
successful resolution of various income tax audit issues.

While earnings from
continuing operations

for 2004 were flat compared with 2003, 2004
results were favorably impacted by electric sales growth, short-term wholesale
markets and lower depreciation, offset by the negative impact of unfavorable
weather, legal settlement costs and the impact of certain regulatory accruals,
compared with the same period in 2003.

Income from discontinued
operations in 2005 includes the positive impact of a $17 million tax benefit
recorded to reflect the final resolution of Xcel Energy’s divested interest in
NRG.  This was partially offset by
Seren’s operating losses during 2005.


The loss from discontinued
operations in 2004 is largely due to an after-tax impairment charge of $143
million, or 34 cents per share, related to Seren. In addition, the loss from
discontinued operations in 2004 is attributable in part to an after-tax loss of
$13 million, or 3 cents per share, associated with the disposition of Cheyenne.

The earnings in 2003 from
discontinued operations are primarily due to an adjustment to previously
estimated tax benefits related to Xcel Energy’s write-off of its investment in
NRG. Results from discontinued operations are discussed in the Discontinued
Operations section later.

Weather —

Xcel
Energy’s earnings can be significantly affected by weather. Unseasonably hot
summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, but also can
increase expenses. Unseasonably mild weather reduces electric and natural gas
sales, but may not reduce expenses.  The
impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature
variances and the amount of natural gas or electricity the average customer
historically has used per degree of temperature.

The following summarizes the
estimated impact on the earnings of the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy due
to temperature variations from historical averages:

•

Weather in 2005 increased earnings by an
estimated 3 cents per share;

•

Weather in 2004 decreased earnings by an
estimated 8 cents per share; and

•

Weather in 2003 was close to normal and had
minimal impact on earnings per share.

Statement
of Operations Analysis — Continuing Operations

The following discussion
summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items
reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Electric
Utility, Short-Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margins

Electric fuel
and purchased power expenses tend to vary with changing retail and wholesale
sales requirements and unit cost changes in fuel and purchased power. Due to
fuel and purchased energy cost-recovery mechanisms for retail customers in
several states, most fluctuations in these costs do not materially affect
electric utility margin.

Xcel Energy
has two distinct forms of wholesale sales: short-term wholesale and commodity
trading.  Short-term wholesale refers to
energy-related purchase and sales activity, and the use of certain financial
instruments associated with the fuel required for, and energy produced from,
Xcel Energy’s generation assets or the energy and capacity purchased to serve
native load.  Commodity trading is not
associated with Xcel Energy’s generation assets or the energy and capacity
purchased to serve native load. 
Short-term wholesale and commodity trading activities are considered
part of the electric utility segment.

Short-term
wholesale and commodity trading margins reflect the estimated impact of
regulatory sharing, if applicable. 
Commodity trading revenues

are reported net of related costs
(i.e., on a margin basis) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Commodity trading costs include purchased power, transmission, broker fees and
other related costs.


The following table details
the revenue and margin for base electric utility, short-term wholesale and
commodity trading activities:

The following summarizes the
components of the changes in base electric utility revenue and base electric
utility margin for the years ended Dec. 31:

Base Electric Utility Revenue

2005 Comparison with 2004

— Base electric revenues increased due to higher fuel and purchased
power costs, which are largely recovered from customers; weather-normalized
retail sales growth of approximately 1.4 percent; higher sales attributable to
warmer than normal summer temperatures in 2005; higher revenues from firm
wholesale customers and lower regulatory accruals related to the Texas fuel
reconciliation settlement.


2004 Comparison with 2003

— Base electric utility revenues increased due to higher fuel and
purchased power costs, which are largely recovered from customers;
weather-normalized retail sales growth of approximately 1.8 percent; and higher
revenues from firm wholesale customers. 
Partially offsetting the higher revenues was the impact of significantly
cooler summer temperatures in 2004, compared with the summer of 2003, as well
as estimated customer refunds related to quality-of-service obligations in
Colorado and the estimated Texas fuel reconciliation settlement.

Base Electric Utility Margin

2005 Comparison to 2004 —

Base electric utility margin increased due to the impact of weather,
weather-normalized sales growth, higher firm wholesale margins, higher
conservation and non-fuel rider revenues and lower accruals related to the fuel
reconciliation proceedings in Texas, partially offset by higher amortization
expense and lower regulatory accruals associated with potential customer
refunds related to service-quality obligations in Colorado.  These increases were partially offset by
higher fuel and purchased energy costs not recovered through direct
pass-through recovery mechanisms.

2004 Comparison to 2003 —

Base electric utility margin decreased due to the impact of weather,
higher fuel and purchased energy costs not recovered through direct
pass-through recovery mechanisms, and regulatory accruals associated with
potential customer refunds related to service-quality obligations in Colorado
and fuel-reconciliation proceedings in Texas.  
These decreases were partially offset by weather-normalized sales
growth.

Short-Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margin

2005 Comparison to 2004 —

Short-term wholesale and commodity trading margins decreased $25 million for
2005 compared with 2004.  The higher 2004
results reflect the impact of more favorable market conditions and higher
levels of surplus generation available to sell. 
In addition, a preexisting contract contributed $17 million of margin in
the first quarter of 2004 and expired at that time.

2004 Comparison to 2003 —

Short-term wholesale and commodity trading margins increased
approximately $33 million in 2004 compared with 2003.  The increase reflects a number of market
factors, including higher market prices and additional resources available for
sale and the pre-existing contract described above.

Natural Gas
Utility Margins

The following table details
the changes in natural gas utility revenue and margin. The cost of natural gas
tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of wholesale
natural gas purchases. However, due to purchased natural gas cost-recovery
mechanisms for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the wholesale cost of
natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin.  See further discussion under Factors
Affecting Results of Continuing Operations.


The following summarizes the
components of the changes in natural gas revenue and margin for the years ended
Dec. 31:

Natural Gas Revenue

2005 Comparison to 2004 —

Natural gas revenue increased primarily due to higher natural gas costs
in 2005, which are recovered from customers. 
Retail natural gas weather-normalized sales were flat when compared to
2004, largely due to the rising cost of natural gas and its impact on customer
usage.

2004 Comparison to 2003 —

Natural gas revenue increased primarily due to higher natural gas costs
in 2004, which are recovered from customers. 
Retail natural gas weather-normalized sales declined in 2004, largely
due to the rising cost of natural gas and its impact on customer usage.

Natural Gas Margin

2005 Comparison to 2004 —

Natural gas margin increased due to rate changes in Minnesota and North
Dakota, and higher transportation margins, partially offset by the impact of
warmer winter temperatures in 2005 compared with 2004.

2004 Comparison to 2003 —

Natural gas margin decreased due to a full year of a base rate decrease
in Colorado, which was effective July 1, 2003, and the impact of warmer
winter temperatures in 2004 compared with 2003.

Nonregulated
Operating Margins

The following table details
the changes in nonregulated revenue and margin included in continuing
operations:

2004 Comparison to 2003 —

Nonregulated revenue decreased in 2004, due primarily to the
discontinued consolidation of an investment in an independent power-producing
entity that was no longer majority owned.

Non-Fuel
Operating Expenses and Other Items

Other Utility Operating and
Maintenance Expenses —

Other operating and maintenance
expenses for 2005 increased by approximately $87 million, or 5.5 percent,
compared with 2004.  An outage at the
Monticello nuclear plant and higher outage costs at Prairie Island in 2005
increased costs by approximately $26 million. 
Employee benefit costs were higher in 2005, primarily due to increased
pension benefits and long-term disability costs.  Also contributing to the increase was higher
uncollectible receivable costs, attributable in part, to modifications to the
bankruptcy laws, higher fuel prices and certain changes in the credit and
collection process.


Other operating and maintenance expenses for 2004 increased by
approximately $21 million, or 1.4 percent, compared with 2003.  Of the increase, $12 million was incurred to
assist with the storm damage repair in Florida and was offset by increased
revenue.  The remaining increase of $9
million is primarily due to higher electric service reliability costs, higher
information technology costs, higher plant-related costs, higher costs related
to a customer billing system conversion and increased costs primarily related
to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The higher costs were partially offset by
lower employee benefit and compensation costs and lower nuclear plant outage
costs.

Other Nonregulated Operating and Maintenance Expenses —

Other nonregulated operating and maintenance
expenses decreased $16 million, or 35.4 percent, in 2005 compared with 2004,
primarily due to the accrual of $18 million in 2004 for a settlement agreement
related to shareholder lawsuits.

Other nonregulated operating
and maintenance expenses decreased $9 million, or 17.5 percent, in 2004
compared with 2003.  This decrease
resulted from the dissolution of Planergy International and the discontinued
consolidation of an investment in an independent power producing entity that
was no longer majority owned after the divestiture of NRG.

Depreciation and
Amortization

— Depreciation and amortization
expense for 2005 increased by approximately $61 million, or 8.7 percent,
compared with 2004.  The changes were
primarily due to the installation of new steam generators at Unit 1 of the Prairie
Island nuclear plant and software system additions, both of which have
relatively short depreciable lives compared with other capital additions.  The Prairie Island steam generators are being
depreciated over the remaining life of the plant operating license, which
expires in 2013.  In addition, the
Minnesota Renewable Development Fund and renewable cost-recovery amortization,
which is recovered in revenue as a non-fuel rider and does not have an impact
on net income, increased over 2004.  The
increase was partially offset by the changes in useful lives and net salvage
rates approved by Minnesota regulators in August 2005.

Depreciation and amortization expense for 2004 decreased by $21
million, or 2.9 percent, compared with 2003. 
The reduction is largely due to several regulatory decisions.  In 2004, as a result of a Minnesota Public
Utilities Commission (MPUC) order, NSP-Minnesota modified its decommissioning
expense recognition, which served to reduce decommissioning accruals by
approximately $18 million in 2004 compared with 2003.

In addition, effective July 1, 2003, the Colorado Public Utilities
Commission (CPUC) lengthened the depreciable lives of certain electric utility
plant at PSCo as a part of the general Colorado rate case, reducing annual
depreciation expense by $20 million.  PSCo
experienced the full impact of the annual reduction in 2004, resulting in a
decrease in depreciation expense of $10 million for 2004 compared with 2003.  These decreases were partially offset by
plant additions.

Interest and Other Income (Expense) Net —

Interest
and other income (expense) net decreased $8 million in 2005 compared with
2004.  The decrease is due to interest
income related to the finalization of prior-period IRS audits of $10.5 million
in 2004, partially offset by a $2.2 million gain on the sale of water rights in
2005.

Interest and other
income, net of nonoperating expenses increased $15 million in 2004 compared
with 2003.

The increase is due mostly to interest income
related to the finalization of prior-period IRS audits of $10.5 million.

Interest and Financing Costs —

The 2005 interest
charges and financing costs increased approximately $8 million, or 1.9 percent
when compared with 2004, primarily due to increased short term borrowing
levels.

The 2004
interest charges and financing costs decreased approximately $17 million, or
3.7 percent when compared with 2003.  The
decrease for the year reflects savings from refinancing higher coupon debt
during 2003 and lower credit line fees, partially offset by interest expense
related to prior-period IRS audits.


Income Tax Expense —

The effective income tax rate for continuing
operations was 25.8 percent for 2005, compared with 23.7 percent in 2004.  Income taxes recorded in 2005 reflect tax
benefits of $10.0 million, primarily from increased research credits and a net
operating loss carry back.  Excluding the
tax benefits, the effective rate for 2005 would have been 27.3 percent.

In 2004,
income tax benefits of $37.1 million were recorded, which included $22.3
million related to the successful resolution of various audit issues and other
adjustments to current and deferred taxes.  The effective income tax rate for
continuing operations was 23.7 percent for 2004, compared with 24.6 percent for
the same period in 2003.

Excluding the tax benefits, the effective rate
for 2004 would have been 29.1 percent.

See Note 8 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Holding
Company and Other Results

The following tables
summarize the net income and earnings-per-share contributions of the continuing
operations of Xcel Energy’s nonregulated businesses and holding company
results:

Financing Costs and Preferred Dividends —

Nonregulated results include interest expense
and the earnings-per-share impact of preferred dividends, which are incurred at
the Xcel Energy and intermediate holding company levels, and are not directly
assigned to individual subsidiaries.

The earnings-per-share
impact of financing costs and preferred dividends for 2005, 2004 and 2003
included above reflects dilutive securities, as discussed further in Note 9 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of the dilutive securities,
if converted, is a reduction of interest expense resulting in an increase in
net income of approximately $14 million, or 3 cents per share, in 2005; $15
million, or 4 cents per share, in 2004; and $11 million, or 3 cents per share,
in 2003.


Statement
of Operations Analysis — Discontinued Operations (Net of Tax)

A summary of the various
components of discontinued operations is as follows for the years ended Dec.
31:

Regulated
Utility Results — Discontinued Operations

In January 2004, Xcel Energy agreed to sell Cheyenne.  Consequently, Xcel Energy reported Cheyenne
results as a component of discontinued operations for all periods
presented.  The sale was completed in
January 2005 and resulted in an after-tax loss of approximately $13 million, or
3 cents per share, which was accrued in December 2004.

During 2003, Xcel Energy
sold Viking and BMG. After-tax disposal gains of $23.3 million, or 6 cents per
share, were recorded, primarily related to the sale of Viking.

Xcel Energy recorded

minimal income related to Viking in 2003, due
to its sale in January of that year.

NRG Results
— Discontinued Operations

Xcel Energy’s share of NRG
results for 2003 is shown as a component of discontinued operations due to NRG’s
emergence from bankruptcy in December 2003 and Xcel Energy’s corresponding
divestiture of its ownership interest in NRG.

Xcel
Energy financial statements do not contain any results of NRG operations in
2005 and 2004.


NRG’s results included in
Xcel Energy’s earnings for 2003 were as follows:

*

These represent NRG losses incurred in the
first and second quarters of 2003 that were in excess of the amounts recordable
by Xcel Energy under the equity method of accounting limitations.

As of the bankruptcy filing
date (May 14, 2003), Xcel Energy had recognized $263 million of NRG’s
impairments and related charges as these charges were recorded by NRG prior to
May 14, 2003. Consequently, Xcel Energy recorded its equity in NRG results in
excess of its financial commitment to NRG under the settlement agreement
reached in March 2003 among Xcel Energy, NRG and NRG’s creditors. These excess
losses were reversed upon NRG’s emergence from bankruptcy in December 2003.

Other
Nonregulated Results — Discontinued Operations

In April 2005, Zachry Group, Inc. acquired all of the outstanding shares
of UE, a nonregulated subsidiary.  In
August 2005, Xcel Energy’s board of directors approved management’s plan to
pursue the sale of Quixx Corp., a former subsidiary of UE that partners in
cogeneration projects that was not included in the sale of UE to Zachry.  As a result, Xcel Energy is reporting UE and
Quixx as components of discontinued operations for all periods presented.

In September 2004, Xcel Energy’s board of directors approved management’s
plan to pursue the sale of Seren.  As a
result of the decision, Seren is accounted for as discontinued operations.  In November 2005, Xcel Energy sold Seren’s
California assets to WaveDivision Holdings, LLC.  In January 2006, Xcel Energy sold Seren’s

Minnesota assets to Charter Communications.

During 2003, Xcel Energy’s board of directors approved management’s
plan to exit businesses conducted by e prime and Xcel Energy
International.  e prime ceased conducting
business in 2004.  Also during 2004, Xcel
Energy completed the sales of the Argentina subsidiaries of Xcel Energy
International.

2005 Nonregulated Results Compared with
2004 —

Results of
discontinued nonregulated operations in 2005 include the impact of a $5 million
reduction to the original asset
impairment for Seren and the positive impact of a $17 million tax benefit
recorded to reflect the final resolution of Xcel Energy’s divested interest in
NRG.  In 2004, the NRG tax basis study was updated
and previously recognized tax benefits were reduced by $13 million.

2004 Nonregulated Results Compared with
2003 —

Results of
discontinued nonregulated operations in 2004 include the impact of the
sales of the Argentina subsidiaries of Xcel Energy International.  The sales were completed in three
transactions, with a total sales price of approximately $31 million.  In addition to the sales price, Xcel Energy
also received approximately $21 million at the closing of one transaction as
redemption of its capital investment. 
The sales resulted in a gain of approximately $8 million, including
approximately $7 million of income tax benefits realizable upon the sale of the
Xcel Energy International assets.

In addition, 2004 results from discontinued operations include the
impact of an after-tax impairment charge for Seren, of $143 million, or 34
cents per share.  The impairment charge
was recorded based on operating results, market conditions and preliminary
feedback from prospective buyers.

Tax Benefits Related to Investment in NRG —

Xcel Energy has recognized tax benefits
related to the divestiture of NRG.  Since
these tax benefits are related to Xcel Energy’s investment in discontinued NRG
operations, they are reported as discontinued operations.

During 2002, Xcel Energy
recognized an initial estimate of the expected tax benefits of $706
million.  Based on the results of a 2003
preliminary tax basis study of NRG, Xcel Energy recorded $404 million of
additional tax benefits in 2003.  In
2004, the NRG basis study was updated and previously recognized tax benefits
were reduced by $13 million.  In 2005, a
$17 million tax benefit was recorded to reflect the final federal income tax resolution
of Xcel Energy’s divested interest in NRG.


Based on current forecasts
of taxable income and tax liabilities, Xcel Energy expects to realize
approximately $1.1 billion of cash savings from these tax benefits through a
refund of taxes paid in prior years and reduced taxes payable in future years.
In 2005, 2004 and 2003, Xcel Energy used $24 million, $345 million, and $116
million, respectively, of these tax benefits, and expects to use $180 million
in 2006. The remainder of the tax benefit carry forward is expected to be used
over subsequent years.

Factors
Affecting Results of Continuing Operations

Xcel Energy’s utility revenues
depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions, general
business conditions and the cost of energy services. Various regulatory
agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their
respective jurisdictions and affect Xcel Energy’s ability to recover its costs
from customers. The historical and future trends of Xcel Energy’s operating
results have been, and are expected to be, affected by a number of factors,
including the following:

General Economic Conditions

Economic conditions may
have a material impact on Xcel Energy’s operating results. The United States
economy continues to grow as measured by projected growth in the gross domestic
product. Management cannot predict the impact of a future economic slowdown,
fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war.
However, Xcel Energy could experience a material adverse impact to its results
of operations, future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a
general slowdown in future economic growth or a significant increase in
interest rates.

Sales Growth

In addition to the impact of
weather, customer sales levels in Xcel Energy’s utility businesses can vary
with economic conditions, energy prices, customer usage patterns and other factors.
Weather-normalized sales growth for retail electric utility customers was 1.4
percent in 2005 compared with 2004, and 1.8 percent in 2004 compared with 2003.
Weather-normalized sales growth for firm natural gas utility customers was
approximately 0.2 percent in 2005 compared with 2004, and (1.9) percent in 2004
compared with 2003. Projections indicate that weather-normalized sales growth
in 2006 compared with 2005 will range between 1.3 percent and 1.7 percent for
retail electric utility customers and 0.0 percent to 1.0 percent for firm
natural gas utility customers.

Fuel Supply and Costs

Coal Deliverability-

Xcel
Energy’s operating utilities have varying dependence on coal-fired
generation.  At the utilities, coal-fired
generation comprises between 60 percent and 85 percent of the total annual
generation.  Approximately 70 percent of
the annual coal requirements are supplied from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. 
Delivery of coal from the Powder River Basin has been disrupted
by train derailments and other operational problems purportedly caused by
deteriorated rail track beds of approximately 140 miles in length in Wyoming.
The BNSF Railway Co. (BNSF) and the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) jointly own
the rail line.  The BNSF operates and
maintains the rail line.

The coal delivery issues began in the first half of 2005.  Based on discussions with the railroads, Xcel
Energy expects that disrupted coal deliveries will continue at least through
the first part of 2006.  Xcel Energy has
taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact of the reduced coal
deliveries.  These steps include modifying
the dispatch of certain generation facilities to conserve coal inventories.
This modified dispatch was in place during the second half of 2005 and has
continued in 2006 to date.  In response
to this reduced coal dispatch, Xcel Energy has increased purchases from third
parties and has increased the use of natural gas for electric generation.  In addition, Xcel Energy negotiated for the
acquisition of additional, higher capacity rail cars and is working to upgrade
certain coal –handling facilities. 
Delivery of the new cars began in January 2006 and will continue over
the course of the year.  The upgrades to
the coal handling facilities are expected to be completed in the first half of
2006.

Despite
these efforts, coal inventories have declined to below target levels. While Xcel
Energy has secured, under contract, approximately 99 percent of anticipated
2006 coal requirements, it cannot predict the likelihood of receiving the
required coal.  While Xcel Energy is planning
to rebuild inventories during the year, there is no guarantee that it will be
able to do so.  The ultimate impact of
coal availability cannot be fully assessed at this time, but could impact
future financial results.

The cost of purchased power and natural gas for electric generation is higher
than for coal-fired electric generation. 
The use of these sources to replace coal-fired electric generation
increased the price of electricity for retail and wholesale customers.


Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries have discussed this situation with
their respective state regulatory commissions.

In Colorado, PSCo is subject to a retail electric adjustment clause
that recovers fuel, purchased energy and resource costs.  The Electric Commodity Adjustment (ECA) is an
incentive adjustment mechanism that compares actual fuel and purchased energy
expenses in a calendar year to a benchmark formula.  The benchmark formula increases with natural
gas prices, but not necessarily with increased volumes of natural gas usage due
to coal supply disruption.  Therefore,
any disruption in coal supply could adversely affect fuel cost recovery.  For 2005, PSCo recorded an incentive accrual
of $8.5 million.  The ECA provides for an
$11.25 million cap on any cost sharing over or under the allowed ECA formula
rate.  Any cost in excess of the $11.25
million cap is completely recovered from customers, while any savings in excess
of the $11.25 million cap is completely refunded to customers.  Subject to the terms of the ECA, PSCo
anticipates it would recover any increased fuel and purchased energy costs
greater than the cap from its customers.

Natural gas prices in 2005 were higher than projected when the ECA
tariff rates were set in January 2005. 
On Oct. 5, 2005, PSCo filed an application to adjust the ECA rate for
November and December 2005 to reduce the ECA deferred balance and to update its
projection of natural gas prices.  This
application was granted, which resulted in an increase to 2005 electric revenue
of approximately $70 million, including unbilled revenues.  As of Dec. 31, 2005, PSCo was carrying a
deferred ECA balance, including unbilled revenue, of approximately $15 million.

In Texas, fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered through a fixed
fuel and purchased energy recovery factor, which is part of SPS’ retail
electric rates.  If SPS will materially
over-recover or under-recover these costs, the factor may be revised upon
application by SPS or action by the Public Utility Commission of Texas
(PUCT).  The regulations require
surcharging of under-recovered amounts, including interest, when they exceed 4
percent of SPS’ annual fuel and purchased energy costs, as allowed by the PUCT,
if the condition is expected to continue. 
On Dec. 21, 2005 SPS reached a settlement with various parties that set
the fuel surcharge request at $76.9 million, to be recovered over a 15-month
period.  The PUCT approved this
settlement on Feb. 9, 2006, and the surcharge went into effect Feb. 13, 2006.

In New Mexico, increases and decreases in fuel and purchased energy
costs, including deferred amounts, are recovered through a monthly fuel and
purchased power clause with a two-month lag. 
Wholesale customers, under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) jurisdiction also pay a monthly fuel cost adjustment calculated on
actual fuel and purchased power costs in accordance with the FERC’s fuel clause
regulations.

While SPS believes that it should be allowed to recover these higher
costs, the ultimate success of recovery could significantly impact the future
of SPS and possibly Xcel Energy.

NSP-Minnesota’s
retail electric rate schedules in the Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota
jurisdictions include a fuel clause adjustment (FCA) to billings and revenues
for changes in prudently incurred cost of fuel, fuel-related items and
purchased energy.  NSP-Minnesota is
permitted to recover these costs through FCA mechanisms individually approved
by the regulators in each jurisdiction. 
The FCA mechanisms allow NSP-Minnesota to bill customers for the cost of
fuel and fuel-related items used to generate electricity at its plants and
energy purchased from other suppliers. 
In general, capacity costs are not recovered through the FCA.  NSP-Minnesota’s electric wholesale customers
also have a FCA provision in their contracts. 
NSP-Minnesota anticipates it will recover increased costs resulting from
its mitigation plan through the FCA.

In Wisconsin,
NSP-Wisconsin does not have an automatic electric fuel clause adjustment for
Wisconsin retail customers. 
NSP-Wisconsin may seek deferred accounting treatment and future rate
recovery of increased costs due to an “emergency” event, if that event causes
fuel and purchased power costs to exceed the amount included in rates on an
annual basis by more than 2 percent. 
Coal deliverability has not resulted in an emergency event to date.

Natural Gas Costs

-
A variety of market factors have contributed to significantly higher natural
gas prices.  The direct impact of these
higher costs is generally mitigated for Xcel Energy through recovery of such
costs from customers through various fuel cost-recovery mechanisms.  However, higher fuel costs could
significantly impact the results of operations, if requests for recovery are
unsuccessful.  In addition, the higher
fuel costs could reduce customer demand or increase bad debt expense, which
could also have a material impact on Xcel Energy’s results of operations.  Delays in the timing of the collection of
fuel cost recoveries as compared with expenditures for fuel purchases are
expected to have an impact on the cash flows of Xcel Energy.  Xcel Energy is unable to predict the future
natural gas prices or the ultimate impact of such prices on its results of
operations or cash flows.


Pension Plan Costs and Assumptions

Xcel Energy’s pension costs
are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of key
assumptions, most notably the annual return level that pension investment
assets will earn in the future and the interest rate used to discount future
pension benefit payments to a present value obligation for financial reporting.
In addition, the actuarial calculation uses an asset-smoothing methodology to
reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. Note 10 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the rate of return and discount
rate used in the calculation of pension costs and obligations in the
accompanying financial statements.

Pension costs have been
increasing in recent years, and are expected to increase further over the next
several years, due to lower-than-expected investment returns experienced in
prior years and decreases in interest rates used to discount benefit
obligations. While investment returns exceeded the assumed level of 8.75
percent in 2005, 9.0 percent in 2004 and 9.25 percent in 2003, investment
returns in 2002 and 2001 were below the assumed level of 9.5 percent, and
discount rates have declined from the 7.25-percent to 8-percent levels used in
the 1999 through 2002 cost determinations, to 6.0 percent used in 2005. Xcel
Energy continually reviews its pension assumptions and, in 2006, expects to
maintain the investment return assumption at 8.75 percent and to lower the
discount rate assumption to 5.75 percent.

The investment gains or
losses resulting from the difference between the expected pension returns
assumed on asset levels and actual returns earned are deferred in the year the
difference arises and recognized over the subsequent five-year period. This
gain or loss recognition occurs by using a five-year, moving-average value of
pension assets to measure expected asset returns in the cost—determination
process, and by amortizing deferred investment gains or losses over the
subsequent five-year period. Based on current assumptions and the recognition
of past investment gains and losses over the next five years, Xcel Energy
currently projects that the pension costs recognized for financial reporting
purposes in continuing operations will increase from a credit, or negative
expense, of  $2.4 million in 2005 to an
expense of $15.3 million in 2006 and $18.7 million in 2007. Pension costs were
a credit in 2005 due to the recognized investment asset returns exceeding the
other pension cost components, such as benefits earned for current service and
interest costs for the effects of the passage of time on discounted
obligations.

Xcel
Energy bases its discount rate assumption on benchmark interest rates from
Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), and has consistently benchmarked the
interest rate used to derive the discount rate to the movements in the
long-term corporate bond indices for bonds rated Aaa through Baa by Moody’s,
which have a period to maturity comparable to our projected benefit
obligations. At Dec. 31, 2005, the annualized Moody’s Baa index rate was 6.21
percent, and the Aaa index rate was 5.26 percent.  Accordingly, Xcel Energy lowered the discount
rate to 5.75 percent as of Dec. 31, 2005. 
This rate was used to value the actuarial benefit obligations at that
date, and will be used in 2006 pension cost determinations.  At Dec. 31, 2004, the annualized Moody’s Baa
index rate was 6.10 percent and the Aaa index rate was 5.43 percent.  The corresponding pension discount rate was
6.00 percent.

If Xcel Energy were to use
alternative assumptions for pension cost determinations, a 1-percent change
would result in the following impact on the estimated pension costs recognized
by Xcel Energy:

•

A 100 basis point higher rate of return, 9.75
percent, would decrease 2006 recognized pension costs by $17.0 million;

•

A 100 basis point lower rate of return, 7.75
percent, would increase 2006 recognized pension costs by $17.0 million;

•

A 100 basis point higher discount rate, 6.75
percent, would decrease 2006 recognized pension costs by $5.4 million; and

•

A 100 basis point lower discount rate, 4.75
percent, would increase 2006 recognized pension costs by $7.1 million.

Alternative Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) funding assumptions would also
change the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plans.
Cash funding requirements can be affected by changes to actuarial assumptions,
actual asset levels and other calculations prescribed by the funding
requirements of income tax and other pension-related regulations. These
regulations did not require cash funding in recent years for Xcel Energy’s
pension plans, and do not require funding in 2006. Assuming that future asset
return levels equal the actuarial assumption of 8.75 percent for the years 2006
and 2007, Xcel Energy projects, under current funding regulations, that no cash
funding would be required for 2006 or 2007. Actual performance can affect these
funding requirements significantly. Current funding regulations are under
legislative review in 2006 and, if not retained in their current form, could
change these funding requirements materially.


Regulation

Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) -

Historically, Xcel Energy has been a
registered holding company under the PUHCA.  As a registered holding
company, Xcel Energy, its utility subsidiaries and certain of its nonutility subsidiaries
have been subject to extensive regulation by the SEC under the PUHCA with
respect to numerous matters, including issuances and sales of securities,
acquisitions and sales of certain utility properties, payments of dividends out
of capital and surplus, and intra-system sales of certain nonpower goods and
services.  In addition, the PUHCA
generally limited the ability of registered holding companies to acquire
additional public utility systems and to acquire and retain businesses
unrelated to the utility operations of the holding company.

On Aug. 8, 2005, President
Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Energy Act), significantly
changing many federal statutes and repealing the PUHCA as of Feb. 8, 2006.  However, as part of the repeal of the PUHCA,
the FERC was given authority to review the books and records of holding
companies and their nonutility subsidiaries to the extent relevant to the
charges of jurisdictional utilities, authority to review service company cost
allocations, and more authority over the merger and acquisition of public
utilities.  With the repeal of PUHCA,
state commissions were given similar authority to review the books and records
of holding companies and their nonutility subsidiaries.  Despite these increases in the FERC’s
authority, Xcel Energy believes that the repeal of the PUHCA will lessen its
regulatory burdens and give it more flexibility in the event it were to choose
to expand its utility or nonutility businesses.

Besides repealing the PUHCA,
the Energy Act is also expected to have substantial long-term effects on energy
markets, energy investment and regulation of public utilities and holding
company systems by the FERC and DOE.  The
FERC and the DOE are in various stages of rulemaking in implementing the Energy
Policy Act.  While the precise impact of
these rulemakings cannot be determined at this time, Xcel Energy generally
views the Energy Act as legislation that will enhance the utility industry
going forward.

Customer
Rate Regulation -

The FERC
and various state regulatory commissions regulate Xcel Energy’s utility
subsidiaries.  Decisions by these
regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energy’s results of operations. Xcel
Energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing energy
market and general economic conditions.

The electric and natural gas
rates charged to customers of Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries are approved
by the FERC and the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate.
The rates are generally designed to recover plant investment, operating costs
and an allowed return on investment. 
Xcel Energy requests changes in rates for utility services through
filings with the governing commissions. Because comprehensive general rate
changes are requested infrequently in some states, changes in operating costs
can affect Xcel Energy’s financial results. In addition to changes in operating
costs, other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales growth,
conservation and demand-side management efforts, and the cost of capital.  In addition, the return on equity authorized
is set by regulatory commissions in rate proceedings.  The most recently authorized electric utility
returns are 11.47 percent for NSP-Minnesota; 11.0 percent for NSP-Wisconsin; 10.75
percent for PSCo; and 11.5 percent for SPS. The most recently authorized
natural gas utility returns are 10.4 percent for

NSP-Minnesota, 11.0
percent for NSP-Wisconsin and 10.5 percent for PSCo.

Wholesale Energy Market Regulation -

In
April 2005, a Day 2 wholesale energy market operated by the Midwest Independent
Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO) was implemented to centrally dispatch
all regional electric generation and apply a regional transmission congestion
management system.  MISO now centrally
issues bills and payments for many costs formerly incurred directly by
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin.  Both
bills and payments from MISO for participation in this centrally dispatched
market are received, resulting in a net cost in serving Xcel Energy’s native
load obligation.  This net result is
recorded as a component of operating and maintenance expenses.  The MPUC issued an interim order in April
2005 allowing MISO Day 2 charges to be recovered through the NSP-Minnesota Fuel
Clause Adjustment (FCA) mechanism.  In
December 2005, the MPUC issued a second interim order approving the recovery of
certain MISO charges through the FCA mechanism but requiring that additional
charges either be recovered as part of a general rate case or through an annual
review process outside the FCA mechanism, and requiring refunds of non-FCA
costs.  However, the December 2005 MPUC
order also suspended the refund obligation until such time as it could
reconsider the matter.  On Feb. 9, 2006,
the MPUC voted to reconsider its December 2005 order.  The MPUC on reconsideration determined that
parties be directed to determine which charges are appropriately in the FCA and
which are more appropriately established in base rates and report back to the
MPUC in 60 days; to grant deferred accounting treatment for costs ultimately
determined to be included in base rates for a period of 36 months, with
recovery of deferred amounts to be reviewed in a general rate case; and that
amounts collected to date through the FCA under the April and December 2005
interim orders are not subject to refund. 
As a result, NSP-Minnesota will
be allowed to recover its prudently incurred MISO costs either through existing
fuel clause mechanisms or in base rates. 
In March 2005, the PSCW
issued an interim order allowing NSP-Wisconsin deferred accounting treatment of
MISO charges.  However, the PSCW staff
issued an interpretive memorandum in October 2005 asserting that certain MISO
costs may not be recovered through the interim fuel cost mechanism and may not
be deferrable.


NSP-Wisconsin and the other Wisconsin utilities contested the PSCW’s
interpretation in their November comments to the PSCW.  To date, NSP-Wisconsin has deferred
approximately $5.7 million of MISO Day 2 costs as a regulatory asset.

Xcel
Energy has notified MISO that NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin may seek to
withdraw from MISO if rate recovery of Day 2 costs is not allowed.  Withdrawal would require FERC approval and
could require Xcel Energy to pay a withdrawal fee.

In
addition, pursuant to FERC orders, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin are billed
for certain MISO Day 2 charges associated with the loads of certain wholesale
transmission service customers taking service under pre-MISO grandfathered
agreements (GFAs).  In March 2005, Xcel
Energy filed for the FERC’s approval to pass through these charges to GFA
customers.  FERC accepted the filing
subject to refund and hearing procedures. 
In 2005, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin were billed for $1.1 million of
MISO charges, which have not yet been recovered from GFA customers.  The likelihood of full rate-recovery is
uncertain at this time.  In addition,
Xcel Energy has filed an appeal of the FERC orders.

Capital
Expenditure Regulation -

Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in
plant additions to build and upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the
reliability of the energy distribution system. In addition to filing for
increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated
with such investments, in 2003 the CPUC and MPUC approved proposals to recover,
through a rate surcharge, certain costs to upgrade generation plants and lower
emissions in the Denver and Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan areas. These rate
recovery mechanisms are expected to provide significant cash flows to enable
recovery of costs incurred on a timely basis.

Future
Cost Recovery -

Regulated
public utilities are allowed to record as regulatory assets certain costs that
are expected to be recovered from customers in future periods, and to record as
regulatory liabilities certain income items that are expected to be refunded to
customers in future periods. In contrast, nonregulated enterprises would
expense these costs and recognize the income in the current period. If
restructuring or other changes in the regulatory environment occur, Xcel Energy
may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment, and may be
required to eliminate such regulatory assets and liabilities from its balance
sheet. Such changes could have a material effect on Xcel Energy’s results of
operations in the period the write-off is recorded.

At Dec. 31, 2005, Xcel
Energy reported on its balance sheet regulatory assets of approximately $963 million
and regulatory liabilities of approximately $1.7 billion that would be
recognized in the statement of operations in the absence of regulation. In
addition to a potential write-off of regulatory assets and liabilities,
restructuring and competition may require recognition of certain stranded costs
not recoverable under market pricing. See Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of regulatory deferrals.

Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory
Proceedings

NSP-Minnesota Electric Rate Case

—
In November 2005, NSP-Minnesota requested an electric rate increase of $168
million or 8.05 percent.  This increase
was based on a requested 11 percent return on common equity, a projected common
equity ratio to total capitalization of 51.7 percent and a projected electric
rate base of $3.2 billion.  On Dec. 15,
2005, the MPUC authorized an interim rate increase of $147 million, subject to
refund, which became effective on Jan. 1, 2006.

NSP-Wisconsin 2006 General Rate Case

— In
2005, NSP-Wisconsin, requested an electric revenue increase of $58.3 million
and a natural gas revenue increase of $8.1 million, based on a 2006 test year,
an 11.9 percent return on equity and a common equity ratio of 56.32
percent.  On Jan. 5, 2006, the PSCW
approved an electric revenue increase of $43.4 million and a natural gas
revenue increase of $3.9 million, based on an 11.0 percent return on equity and
a 54-percent common equity ratio target. 
The new rates were effective Jan. 9, 2006.  The order authorized the deferral of an
additional $6.5 million in costs related to nuclear decommissioning and
manufactured gas plant site clean up for recovery in the next rate case.  The order also prohibits NSP-Wisconsin from
paying dividends above $42.7 million, if its actual calendar year average
common equity


ratio is or
will fall below 54.03 percent.  It also
imposes an asymmetrical electric fuel clause bandwidth of positive 2 percent to
negative 0.5 percent outside of which NSP-Wisconsin would be permitted to
request or be required to change rates.

PSCo Natural Gas Rate Case

—
In 2005, PSCo filed for an increase of $34.5 million in natural gas base rates
in Colorado, based on a return on equity of 11.0 percent with a common equity
ratio of 55.49 percent.

On Jan. 19, 2006, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement between PSCo
and other parties to the case.  Final
rates became effective Feb. 6, 2006. The terms of the settlement include:

•

Natural gas
revenue increase of $22 million;

•

Return on
common equity of 10.5 percent;

•

Earnings over
10.5 percent return on common equity will be refunded back to customers;

•

Common equity
ratio of 55.49 percent; and

•

Customer charges for the
residential and commercial sales classes of $10 and $20 per month,
respectively.

Tax
Matters

Interest
Expense Deductibility

-
PSCo’s wholly owned subsidiary, PSR Investments, Inc. (PSRI), owns and manages
permanent life insurance policies, known as COLI policies, on some of PSCo’s
employees. At various times, borrowings have been made against the cash values
of these COLI policies and deductions taken on the interest expense on these
borrowings. The IRS has challenged the deductibility of such interest expense
deductions and has disallowed the deductions taken in tax years 1993 through
1999.  Should the IRS ultimately prevail on this issue, tax and interest
payable through Dec. 31, 2005, would reduce earnings by an estimated $361
million.  In 2004, Xcel Energy received
formal notification that the IRS will seek penalties.  If penalties (plus associated interest) are
also included, the total exposure through Dec. 31, 2005, is approximately $428
million.  Xcel Energy estimates its
annual earnings for 2006 would be reduced by $44 million, after tax, which
represents 10 cents per share, if COLI interest expense deductions were no
longer available.  See Note 14 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

COLI Dow Chemical Court Decision

- On Jan. 23,
2006, the 6th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals issued an opinion in a
federal income tax case involving the interest deductions for a COLI program at
Dow Chemical Company.  The 6th Circuit
denied the tax deductions and reversed the decision of the trial court in the
case.

Xcel Energy has analyzed the impact of the Dow decision on its pending
COLI litigation and concluded there are significant factual differences between
its case and the Dow case.  The court’s
opinion in the Dow case outlined three indicators of potential economic
benefits to be examined in a COLI case and noted that the outcome of COLI cases
is very fact determinative.

These indicators are:

•

Positive pre-deduction cash
flows;

•

Mortality gains; and

•

The buildup of cash values.

In a split
decision, the 6th Circuit found that the Dow COLI plans possessed none of these
indicators of economic substance. 
However, in Xcel Energy’s COLI case, the plans were projected to have
sizeable pre-deduction cash flows, based upon the relevant assumptions when
purchased.  Moreover, the plans presented
the opportunity for mortality gains that were not eliminated either
retroactively or prospectively.  Xcel
Energy’s COLI plans had no provision for giving back any mortality gains that
it might realize. In addition, Xcel Energy’s plans had large cash value
increases that were not encumbered by loans during the first seven years of the
policies.  Consequently,

Xcel
Energy believes that the facts and circumstances of its case are stronger than
Dow’s case and

continues to
believe its case has strong merits.

Environmental Matters

Environmental costs include
payments for nuclear plant decommissioning, storage and ultimate disposal of
spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and waste, remediation of
contaminated sites and monitoring of discharges to the environment. A trend of
greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation has
caused, and may continue to cause, higher operating expenses and capital
expenditures for environmental compliance.

In addition to nuclear
decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, costs charged to
operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous
materials and waste were approximately:


•

$147 million in 2005;

•

$133 million in 2004; and

•

$133 million in 2003.

Xcel Energy expects to
expense an average of approximately $176 million per year from 2006 through
2010 for similar costs. However, the precise timing and amount of environmental
costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous
materials, are currently unknown. Additionally, the extent to which
environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates is not
certain.

Capital expenditures placed
in service on environmental improvements at regulated facilities were
approximately:

•

$37.1 million in 2005;

•

$20.9 million in 2004; and

•

$58.5 million in 2003.

The regulated utilities
expect to incur approximately $438 million in capital expenditures for
compliance with environmental regulations and environmental improvements in
2006, and approximately $714 million of related expenditures during the period from
2007 through 2010. Included in these amounts are expenditures to reduce
emissions of generating plants in Minnesota and Colorado. Approximately $347
million and $392 million of these expenditures, respectively, are related to
modifications to reduce the emissions of NSP-Minnesota’s generating plants
located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area pursuant to the MERP,
which are recoverable from customers through cost-recovery mechanisms. Expected
expenditures related to environmental modifications on Comanche Units 1 and 2
are approximately $26 million in 2006 and $62 million during the period from
2007 through 2010. The remaining expected capital expenditures relate to
various other environmental projects. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion of Xcel Energy’s environmental contingencies.

The issue of global
climate change is receiving increased attention.  Debate continues concerning the extent to
which the earth’s climate is warming, the causes of climate variations that
have been observed and the ultimate impact that might result from a changing
climate.  There also is considerable
debate regarding public policy for the approach that the United States should
follow to address the issue.  The United
Nations-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, which establishes greenhouse gas reduction
targets for developed nations, entered into force on Feb. 16, 2005.  President Bush has declared that the United
States will not ratify the protocol and is opposed to legislative mandates,
preferring a program based on voluntary efforts and research on new
technologies.  Xcel Energy is closely
monitoring the issue from both scientific and policy perspectives.  While it is not possible to know the eventual
outcome, Xcel Energy believes the issue merits close attention and is taking
actions it believes are prudent to be best positioned for a variety of possible
outcomes.  Xcel Energy is participating
in a voluntary carbon management program and has established goals to reduce
its volume of carbon dioxide emissions by 12 million tons by 2009, and to
reduce carbon intensity by 7 percent by 2012. 
In certain regulatory jurisdictions, the evaluation process for future
generating resources incorporates the risk of future carbon limits through the
use of a carbon cost adder or externality costs.  Xcel Energy also is involved in other
projects to improve available methods for managing carbon.

Impact of Nonregulated Investments

In the past, Xcel Energy’s
investments in nonregulated operations have had a significant impact on its
results of operations. As a result of the divestiture of NRG and other
nonregulated operations, Xcel Energy does not expect that its investments in
nonregulated operations will continue to have such a significant impact on its
results. Xcel Energy does not expect to make any material investments in
nonregulated projects.

Inflation

Inflation at its current
level is not expected to materially affect Xcel Energy’s prices or returns to
shareholders.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

Preparation of the
Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in compliance with
GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and
guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies
necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the
likelihood of success of particular projects,


legal and regulatory
challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of
themselves, could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements and
disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In
addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant
effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported
through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the
Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, even if the nature
of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of
accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of Xcel Energy’s
financial condition and results, and that require management’s most difficult,
subjective or complex judgments. Each of these has a higher potential
likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under
different conditions or using different assumptions. Each critical accounting
policy has been discussed with the audit committee of the Xcel Energy board of
directors.


Xcel Energy continually
makes informed judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting
policy areas, based on an evaluation of the varying assumptions and uncertainties
for each area. For example:


•

Probable outcomes of regulatory proceedings
are assessed in cases of requested cost recovery or other approvals from
regulators.

•

The ability to operate plant facilities and
recover the related costs over their useful operating lives, or such other
period designated by Xcel Energy’s regulators, is assumed.

•

Probable outcomes of reviews and challenges
raised by tax authorities, including appeals and litigation where necessary,
are assessed.

•

Projections are made regarding earnings on
pension investments, and the salary increases provided to employees over their
periods of service.

•

Future cash inflows of operations are
projected in order to assess whether they will be sufficient to recover future
cash outflows, including the impact of product price changes and market
penetration to customer groups.

The information and
assumptions underlying many of these judgments and estimates will be affected
by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time.
This may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect the events
and updated information that becomes available. The accompanying financial
statements reflect management’s best estimates and judgments of the impact of
these factors as of Dec. 31, 2005.

Recently
Implemented Accounting Changes

For a discussion of
significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Pending
Accounting Changes

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004) — “Share Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R)

—

In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 123R related to equity-based compensation.  This statement replaces the original SFAS No.
123 — “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.”

Under SFAS No. 123R, companies are
no longer allowed to account for their share-based payment awards using the
intrinsic value allowed by previous accounting requirements, which did not
require any expense to be recorded on stock options granted with an equal to or
greater than fair market value exercise price. 
Instead, equity-based compensation arrangements will be measured and
recognized based on the grant-date fair value using an option-pricing model
(such as Black-Scholes or Binomial) that considers at least six factors
identified in SFAS No. 123R.  An expense
related to the difference between the grant-date fair value and the purchase
price would be recognized over the vesting period of the options.  Under previous guidance, companies were
allowed to initially estimate forfeitures or recognize them as they actually
occurred.  SFAS No. 123R requires
companies to estimate forfeitures on the date of grant and to adjust that
estimate when information becomes available that suggests actual forfeitures
will differ from previous estimates. 
Revisions to forfeiture estimates will be recorded as a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the revision
occurs.

Previous accounting guidance allowed for compensation expense related
to performance share plans to be reversed if the target was not met.  However, under SFAS No. 123R, compensation
expense for performance share plans that expire unexercised due to the company’s
failure to reach a certain target stock price cannot be reversed.  Any accruals made for Xcel Energy’s
restricted stock unit plan that were granted in 2004 and based on a total
shareholder return could not be reversed if the target was not met.  Implementation of SFAS No. 123R is required
for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005.  Xcel Energy is required to adopt the
provisions in the first quarter of 2006. 
Implementation is not expected to have a material impact on net income
or earnings per share.

Accounting for
Uncertain Tax Positions

— In July 2004, the FASB
discussed potential changes or clarifications in the criteria for recognition
of income tax benefits, which may result in raising the threshold for
recognizing tax benefits that have some degree of uncertainty.  In July 2005, the FASB issued an exposure
draft on accounting for uncertain tax positions under SFAS No. 109 — “Accounting
for Income Taxes.”  As issued, the
exposure draft would have been effective Dec. 31, 2005, and only tax benefits
that meet the “probable” recognition threshold would be recognized or continue
to be recognized on the effective date. 
Initial derecognition amounts would be reported as a cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle.

Subsequent to the comment period that closed in September 2005, the
FASB announced that the effective date of its new interpretation will be
delayed, with a revised pronouncement to be released no earlier than the first
quarter of 2006.

In redeliberations in November 2005, the FASB decided that
the benefit recognition approach in the exposure draft should be retained, but
that the initial recognition threshold should be “more likely than not” rather
than “probable.”  In redeliberations on
Jan. 11, 2006, the FASB addressed the issues of transition and effective date.
For Xcel Energy, the new interpretation, if and when issued, is likely to be
effective beginning Jan. 1, 2007, with any cumulative effect of the change
reflected in retained earnings.


Although Xcel Energy
has not assessed the impact of a new recognition threshold on all of its open
tax positions, based on available information, it believes that its COLI tax
position meets the “more likely than not” threshold, and therefore it plans to
continue to recognize all COLI tax benefits in full.  See “Factors Affecting Results of Continuing
Operations — Tax Matters” for further discussion of this matter.

DERIVATIVES,
RISK MANAGEMENT AND MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are
exposed to a variety of market risks. 
Market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of changes
in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity.  All financial and commodity-related
instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk.  These risks, as applicable to Xcel Energy and
its subsidiaries, are discussed in further detail later.

Commodity Price Risk —

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed
to commodity price risk in their electric and natural gas operations.  Commodity price risk is managed by entering
into both long- and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts for
electric capacity, energy and energy-related products, and for various fuels
used in generation and distribution activities. 
Commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial
derivative instruments.  Xcel Energy’s
risk-management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each
rate-regulated operation to the extent such exposure exists.

Short-Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Risk —

Xcel Energy’s subsidiaries conduct various
short-term wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase
and sale of capacity, energy and energy-related instruments. These marketing
activities are primarily focused on specific regions where market knowledge and
experience have been obtained and are generally less than one year in length.
Xcel Energy’s risk-management policy allows management to conduct these
activities within approved guidelines and limitations as approved by the
Company’s risk management committee, which is made up of management personnel
not directly involved in the activities governed by the policy.

Certain contracts and
financial instruments within the scope of these activities qualify for hedge
accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133 — “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (SFAS No. 133).

The fair value of the
commodity trading contracts as of Dec. 31, 2005, was as follows:

As of Dec. 31, 2005, the
fair values by source for the commodity trading and hedging net asset or
liability balances were as follows:

Commodity
Trading Contracts


Hedge
Contracts

— Prices actively quoted or based on actively quoted prices.

2 — Prices based on models
and other valuation methods. These represent the fair value of positions
calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external
prices or prices derived from external sources are not available. Internal
models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present
value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms. The models reflect
management’s estimates, taking into account observable market prices, estimated
market prices in the absence of quoted market prices, the risk-free market
discount rate, volatility factors, estimated correlations of commodity prices
and contractual volumes. Market price uncertainty and other risks also are
factored into the model.

Normal purchases and sales
transactions, as defined by SFAS No. 133 and certain other long-term power
purchase contracts are not included in the fair values by source tables as they
are not included in the commodity trading operations and are not qualifying
hedges.

At Dec. 31, 2005, a
10-percent increase in market prices over the next 12 months for commodity
trading contracts would decrease pretax income from continuing operations by
approximately $0.7 million, whereas a 10-percent decrease would increase pretax
income from continuing operations by approximately $0.8 million.

Xcel Energy’s short-term
wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk
exposure to price changes on transactions, contracts and obligations that have
been entered into, but not closed, using an industry standard methodology known
as Value-at-Risk (VaR). VaR expresses the potential change in fair value on the
outstanding transactions, contracts and obligations over a particular period of
time, with a given confidence interval under normal market conditions. Xcel
Energy utilizes the variance/covariance approach in calculating VaR. The VaR
model employs a 95-percent confidence interval level based on historical price
movement, lognormal price distribution assumption, delta half-gamma approach
for non-linear instruments and a three-day holding period for both electricity
and natural gas.


As of Dec. 31, 2005, the
VaRs for the commodity trading operations were:

(a)

Comprises transactions for NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS.

As of Dec. 31, 2004, the
VaRs for the commodity trading operations were:

(a)

Comprises transactions for NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS.

Interest Rate Risk —

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are subject
to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of
business.  Xcel Energy’s policy allows
interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating
rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or
call options.

Xcel
Energy engages in hedges of cash flow and fair value exposure.  The fair value of interest rate swaps
designated as cash flow hedges is initially recorded in Other Comprehensive
Income.  Reclassification of unrealized
gains or losses on cash flow hedges of variable rate debt instruments from
Other Comprehensive Income into earnings occurs as interest payments are
accrued on the debt instrument, and generally offsets the change in the
interest accrued on the underlying variable rate debt.  Hedges of fair value exposure are entered
into to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability or firm
commitment.  Changes in the derivative
fair values that are designated as fair value hedges are recognized in earnings
as offsets to the changes in fair values of related hedged assets, liabilities
or firm commitments.  To test the
effectiveness of such swaps, a hypothetical swap is used to mirror all the
critical terms of the underlying debt and regression analysis is utilized to
assess the effectiveness of the actual swap at inception and on an ongoing
basis.  The fair value of interest rate
swaps is determined through counterparty valuations, internal valuations and
broker quotes.  There have been no
material changes in the techniques or models used in the valuation of interest
rate swaps during the periods presented.

At
Dec. 31, 2005 and 2004, a 100-basis-point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel
Energy’s variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense by
approximately $10.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively.  See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a discussion of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries’ interest rate
swaps.

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries also maintain trust funds, as required
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), to fund certain costs of nuclear
decommissioning, which are subject to interest rate risk and equity price
risk.  As of Dec. 31, 2005 and 2004,
these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity
securities and fixed-rate fixed-income securities.  Per NRC mandates, these funds may be used
only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning.  The accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes
that costs are recovered through rates; therefore fluctuations in equity prices
or interest rates do not have an impact on earnings.

Credit Risk —

In addition to the risks discussed previously, Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries are exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of
loss resulting from the nonperformance by a counterparty of its contractual
obligations. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies intended
to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect
changes and scope of operations.

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries
conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties. Xcel Energy employs
additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate, such as letters of
credit, parental guarantees, standardized master netting agreements and
termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative
exposures. The credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the activity
with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided.

At Dec. 31, 2005, a
10-percent increase in prices would have resulted in a net mark-to-market
increase in credit risk exposure of $44.2 million, while a decrease of 10
percent would have resulted in a decrease of $41.1 million.


LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flows

Cash provided by operating
activities for continuing operations was basically unchanged for 2005 and
2004.  Cash provided by operating
activities for discontinued operations increased $368 million during 2005
compared with 2004.  During 2004, Xcel
Energy paid $752 million pursuant to the NRG settlement agreement, which was
partially offset by tax benefits received.

Cash provided by operating
activities for continuing operations increased $22 million during 2004 compared
with 2003 due to the timing of payments made for trade payables partially
offset by increased inventory costs related to higher natural gas costs, which
will be collected from customers in future periods.  Cash provided by operating activities for
discontinued operations decreased $590 million during 2004 compared with
2003.  During 2004, Xcel Energy paid $752
million pursuant to the NRG settlement agreement, which was partially offset by
tax benefits received.

Cash used in investing
activities for continuing operations increased $94 million during 2005 compared
with 2004, primarily due to increased 2005 utility capital expenditures and
restricted cash released in 2004.  Cash
provided by investing activities for discontinued operations increased $99
million during 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due to the receipt of
proceeds from the sale of Cheyenne and Seren in 2005.

Cash used in investing
activities for continuing operations increased $213 million during 2004
compared with 2003, primarily due to increased utility capital
expenditures.  Cash provided by investing
activities for discontinued operations decreased $89 million during 2004
compared with 2003, primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of
Viking in 2003.

Cash flow from financing
activities related to continuing operations increased $222 million during 2005
compared with 2004, primarily due to increased short-term borrowings.

Cash flow from financing
activities related to continuing operations increased $235 million during 2004
compared with 2003, primarily due to increased short-term borrowings partially
offset by a common stock repurchase.

See discussion of trends,
commitments and uncertainties with the potential for future impact on cash flow
and liquidity under Capital Sources.


Capital
Requirements

Utility Capital Expenditures, Nonregulated Investments and Long-Term
Debt

Obligations —

The
estimated cost of the capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries, excluding discontinued operations, and other capital requirements
for the years 2006, 2007 and 2008 are shown in the table below.

The capital expenditure
forecast includes PSCo’s share of the 750-megawatt Comanche 3 coal-fired plant
in Colorado and the MERP project, which will reduce the emissions of three of
NSP-Minnesota’s generating plants.  The
MERP project is expected to cost approximately $1 billion, with major
construction starting in 2005 and finishing in 2009. Xcel Energy began
recovering the costs of the emission-reduction project through customer rate
increases effective Jan. 1, 2006. 
Comanche 3 is expected to cost approximately $1.35 billion, with major
construction starting in 2006 and finishing in 2010.  The CPUC has approved sharing one-third
ownership of this plant with other parties. 
Consequently, Xcel Energy’s capital expenditure forecast includes $1
billion, approximately two-thirds of the total cost.

The capital expenditure
programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification.
Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to
changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, the desired reserve
margin and the availability of purchased power, as well as alternative plans
for meeting Xcel Energy’s long-term energy needs. In addition, Xcel Energy’s
ongoing evaluation of restructuring requirements, compliance with future
requirements to install emission-control equipment, and merger, acquisition and
divestiture opportunities to support corporate strategies may impact actual
capital requirements.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments —

Xcel Energy has contractual obligations and
other commercial commitments that will need to be funded in the future, in
addition to its capital expenditure programs. The following is a summarized
table of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at Dec. 31,
2005. See additional discussion in the Consolidated Statements of
Capitalization and Notes 3, 4, 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

(a) Under some leases, Xcel
Energy would have to sell or purchase the property that it leases if it chose
to terminate before the scheduled lease expiration date. Most of Xcel Energy’s
railcar, vehicle and equipment and aircraft leases have these terms. At Dec.
31, 2005, the amount that Xcel Energy would have to pay if it chose to
terminate these leases was approximately $110.8 million.

(b) Obligations to purchase
fuels for electric generation plants, and electricity and natural gas for
resale.  Certain contractual purchase
obligations are adjusted based on indexes. 
However, the effects of price changes are mitigated through
cost-of-energy adjustment mechanisms.

(c) Xcel Energy also has
outstanding authority under contracts and blanket purchase orders to purchase
up to approximately $600 million of goods and services through the year 2020,
in addition to the amounts disclosed in this table and in the forecasted
capital expenditures.


Common Stock Dividends —

Future dividend levels will be dependent on Xcel Energy’s results of
operations, financial position, cash flows and other factors, and will be
evaluated by the Xcel Energy board of directors. Xcel Energy’s objective is to
deliver the financial results that will enable the board of directors to grant
annual dividend increases in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent per year.  Xcel Energy’s dividend policy balances:

•

Projected cash generation from utility
operations;

•

Projected capital investment in the utility
businesses;

•

A reasonable rate of return on shareholder
investment; and

•

The impact on Xcel Energy’s capital structure
and credit ratings.

In addition, there are
certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels.  Under the PUHCA, unless there was an order
from the SEC, a holding company or any subsidiary could only declare and pay
dividends out of retained earnings. Xcel Energy had $562 million of retained
earnings at Dec. 31, 2005, and expects to declare dividends as scheduled.  With the repeal of the PUHCA, this limitation
on a holding company’s dividends will no longer apply.  Notwithstanding the repeal of the PUHCA,
federal law will still limit the ability of public utilities within a holding
company system to declare dividends.  Specifically,
under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any
funds properly included in a capital account. 
The cash to pay dividends to Xcel Energy shareholders is primarily
derived from dividends received from the utility subsidiaries.  The utility subsidiaries are generally
limited in the amount of dividends allowed by state regulatory commissions to
be paid to the holding company. The limitation is imposed through equity ratio
limitations that range from 30 percent to 60 percent.  Some utility subsidiaries must comply with
bond indenture covenants or restrictions under credit agreements for debt to
total capitalization ratios.

The Articles of
Incorporation of Xcel Energy place restrictions on the amount of common stock
dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding. Under the provisions,
dividend payments may be restricted if Xcel Energy’s capitalization ratio (on a
holding company basis only, i.e., not on a consolidated basis) is less than 25
percent. For these purposes, the capitalization ratio is equal to common stock
plus surplus, divided by the sum of common stock plus surplus plus long-term
debt. Based on this definition, Xcel Energy’s capitalization ratio at Dec. 31,
2005, was 84 percent. Therefore, the restrictions do not place any effective
limit on Xcel Energy’s ability to pay dividends because the restrictions are
only triggered when the capitalization ratio is less than 25 percent or will be
reduced to less than 25 percent through dividends (other than dividends payable
in common stock), distributions or acquisitions of Xcel Energy common stock.

Capital
Sources

Xcel Energy expects to meet
future financing requirements by periodically issuing short-term debt,
long-term debt, common stock and preferred securities to maintain desired
capitalization ratios.

Registered holding companies
and certain of their subsidiaries, including Xcel Energy and its utility
subsidiaries, were limited under PUHCA in their ability to issue
securities.  Registered holding companies
and their subsidiaries could not issue securities unless authorized by an exemptive
rule or order of the SEC. Because Xcel Energy did not qualify for any of the
main exemptive rules, it had received financing authority from the SEC under
the PUHCA for various financing arrangements. Xcel Energy’s current financing
authority permits it, subject to certain conditions, to issue through June 30,
2008, up to $1.8 billion of new long-term debt, common equity and equity-linked
securities, and $1.0 billion of short-term debt securities during the new
authorization period, provided that the aggregate amount of long-term debt,
common equity, and equity-linked and short-term debt securities issued during
the new authorization period does not exceed $2.0 billion.


Xcel Energy’s ability to issue
securities under the financing authority was subject to a number of conditions.
One of the conditions of the financing authority was that Xcel Energy’s
consolidated ratio of common equity to total capitalization be at least 30
percent. As of Dec. 31, 2005, the common equity ratio was approximately 42
percent. Additional conditions require that a security to be issued, must be at
least rated investment grade by one nationally recognized rating agency.
Finally, all outstanding securities that are rated must be rated investment
grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. On Feb. 10, 2006,
Xcel Energy’s senior unsecured debt was considered investment grade by Standard
& Poor’s Ratings Services (Standard & Poor’s), Moody’s and Fitch Ratings
(Fitch).

Upon the repeal of the
PUHCA, these limitations on Xcel Energy’s financings generally will no longer
apply, nor will the PUHCA restrictions generally apply to the financings by the
utility subsidiaries.  However, utility
financings and intra-system financing will become subject to the jurisdiction
of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. 
The FERC has granted a blanket authorization for certain intra-system
financings involving holding companies. 
Requests to the FERC to clarify its rules or grant similar blanket
authorizations are presently pending before the FERC.  Xcel Energy and the utility subsidiaries are
presently evaluating the specific applications that they will need to file with
FERC due to repeal of the PUHCA.

It is possible that in lieu
of requesting authority from the FERC for intra-system financings, Xcel Energy
and the utility subsidiaries may rely in the interim on a transitional savings
clause that would permit such financing transactions to the extent authorized
by the SEC financing order and so long as the conditions in the SEC financing
order continue to be satisfied.

Short-Term Funding Sources —

Historically, Xcel Energy has used a number
of sources to fulfill short-term funding needs, including operating cash flow,
notes payable, commercial paper and bank lines of credit. The amount and timing
of short-term funding needs depend in large part on financing needs for
construction expenditures and working capital. Another significant short-term
funding need is the dividend payment.

As of Feb. 14, 2006, Xcel
Energy and its utility subsidiaries had the following committed credit
facilities available to meet its liquidity needs:

*

Includes direct borrowings, outstanding
commercial paper and letters of credit.

Operating cash flow as a
source of short-term funding is affected by such operating factors as weather;
regulatory requirements, including rate recovery of costs; environmental
regulation compliance and industry deregulation; changes in the trends for
energy prices; and supply and operational uncertainties, all of which are
difficult to predict. See further discussion of such factors under Statement of
Operations Analysis.

Short-term borrowing as a
source of funding is affected by regulatory actions and access to reasonably
priced capital markets. For additional information on Xcel Energy’s short-term
borrowing arrangements, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Access to reasonably priced capital markets is dependent in part on credit
agency reviews and ratings. The following ratings reflect the views of Moody’s,
Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch.  A
security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and is
subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency. As of Feb. 23,
2006, the following represents the credit ratings assigned to various Xcel
Energy companies:


Note: Moody’s highest credit
rating for debt is Aaa and lowest investment grade rating is Baa3. Both
Standard & Poor’s and Fitch’s highest credit rating for debt are AAA and
lowest investment grade rating is BBB-. 
Moody’s prime ratings for commercial paper range from P-1 to P-3.  Standard & Poor’s ratings for commercial
paper range from A-1 to A-3.  Fitch’s
ratings for commercial paper range from F1 to F3.

In the event of a downgrade
of its credit ratings to below investment grade, Xcel Energy may be required to
provide credit enhancements in the form of cash collateral, letters of credit
or other security to satisfy all or a part of its exposures under guarantees
outstanding. See a list of guarantees at Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Xcel Energy has no explicit rating triggers in its debt agreements.

Money Pool

—
Xcel Energy has established a utility money pool arrangement with the utility
subsidiaries and received required state regulatory approvals. The utility
money pool allows for short-term loans between the utility subsidiaries and
from the holding company to the utility subsidiaries at market-based interest
rates. The utility money pool arrangement does not allow loans from the utility
subsidiaries to the holding company. 
NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS participate in the utility money pool
pursuant to approval from their respective state regulatory commissions.  No borrowings or loans were outstanding at
Dec. 31, 2005.  Borrowing limits are $250
million, $250 million and $100 million, respectively.  As a consequence of the repeal of PUHCA and
the recent amendments to section 203 of the Federal Power Act, it may be
necessary for Xcel Energy and the utility subsidiaries to submit its existing
money pool arrangement to FERC for its approval.  Xcel Energy and the utility subsidiaries are
presently evaluating the situation.

Registration Statements —

Xcel Energy’s Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 1
billion shares of common stock. As of Dec. 31, 2005, Xcel Energy had
approximately 403 million shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, Xcel
Energy’s Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 7 million shares
of $100 par value preferred stock. On Dec. 31, 2005, Xcel Energy had
approximately 1 million shares of preferred stock outstanding. Xcel Energy and
its subsidiaries have the following registration statements on file with the
SEC, pursuant to which they may sell, from time to time, securities:

•

In February 2002, Xcel Energy filed a $1
billion shelf registration with the SEC. Xcel Energy may issue debt securities,
common stock and rights to purchase common stock under this shelf registration.
Xcel Energy has approximately $482.5 million remaining under this
registration.  Xcel Energy has approximately
$400 million remaining under the $1 billion unsecured debt shelf registration
filed with the SEC in 2000.

•

On March 22, 2005, NSP-Minnesota filed a
shelf registration statement with the SEC to register an additional $1 billion
of secured or unsecured debt securities, which may be issued from time to time
in the future.  This registration became
effective on April 7, 2005, and supplements the $40 million of debt securities
previously registered with the SEC. 
After issuance of $250 million of first mortgage bonds in July 2005, as
discussed later, $790 million remains available under the currently effective
registration statement.

•

PSCo has an effective shelf registration
statement with the SEC under which $800 million of secured first collateral
trust bonds or unsecured senior debt securities were registered. PSCo has
approximately $225 million remaining under this registration.


Future
Financing Plans

Xcel Energy generally
expects to fund its operations and capital investments primarily through
internally generated funds.  Xcel Energy
plans to refinance existing long-term debt or scheduled long-term debt
maturities at each of the regulated operating utilities based on prevailing
market conditions.  To facilitate
potential long-term debt issuances at the utility subsidiaries, SPS intends to
file a long-term debt shelf registration statement with the SEC for up to $500
million in 2006, and NSP-Wisconsin may file a long-term debt shelf registration
for up to $100 million.

Off-Balance-Sheet
Arrangements

Xcel Energy does not have
any off-balance-sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

MANAGEMENT
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Xcel
Energy is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting.  Xcel
Energy’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance
to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to
be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation.

Xcel Energy management
assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of Dec. 31, 2005.  In making
this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment, we believe that, as
of Dec. 31, 2005, the company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on those criteria.

Xcel Energy’s independent
auditors have issued an audit report on our assessment of the company’s
internal control over financial reporting. 
Their report appears on the following page.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

Board
of Directors and Stockholders

Xcel
Energy Inc.

We
have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying

Management Report On Internal Controls

, that Xcel Energy
Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by,
or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by
the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2005 of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2006
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedules.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board
of Directors and Stockholders

Xcel
Energy Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and consolidated
statements of capitalization of Xcel Energy Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, common stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index
at Item 15.  These financial statements
and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Xcel Energy Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated February 24, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Business and System of Accounts —

Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries are
engaged principally in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and
sale of electricity and in the purchase, transportation, distribution and sale
of natural gas. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries were subject to the regulatory
provisions of the PUHCA. The utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by
the FERC and state utility commissions. All of the utility companies’
accounting records conform to the FERC uniform system of accounts or to systems
required by various state regulatory commissions, which are the same in all
material respects.

On
Aug. 8, 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Act, significantly
changing many federal energy statutes. 
The Energy Act is expected to have a substantial long-term effect on
energy markets, energy investment, and regulation of public utilities and
holding company systems by the FERC, the SEC and the DOE.  The FERC was directed by the Energy Act to
address many areas previously regulated by other governmental entities under
the statutes and determine whether changes to such previous regulations are
warranted.  The issues that the FERC has
been required to consider associated with the repeal of the PUHCA include, but
are not limited to, the expansion of the FERC authority to review mergers and
sales of public utility companies and the expansion of the FERC authority over
the books and records of holding companies and public utility companies
previously governed by the SEC and the appropriate cost standard for the
provision of non-power goods and services by service companies.  The FERC is in various stages of rulemaking
on these and other issues.  Xcel Energy
cannot predict the impact the new rulemakings will have on its operations or
financial results, if any.

Principles of Consolidation —

In 2005, Xcel Energy continuing operations
included the activity of four utility subsidiaries that serve electric and
natural gas customers in 10 states. These utility subsidiaries are
NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS. These utilities serve customers in
portions of Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. 
Along with WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline, these companies
comprise our continuing regulated utility operations.

Xcel Energy’s nonregulated
subsidiaries in continuing operations include Eloigne Co. (investments in
rental housing projects that qualify for low-income housing reported tax
credits).  Xcel Energy owns the following
additional direct subsidiaries, some of which are intermediate holding
companies with additional subsidiaries: Xcel Energy Wholesale Energy Group
Inc., Xcel Energy Markets Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy Ventures Inc., Xcel Energy
Retail Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy Communications Group Inc., Xcel Energy WYCO
Inc. and Xcel Energy O&M Services Inc. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries
collectively are referred to as Xcel Energy.

Discontinued utility
operations include the activity of Viking, an interstate natural gas pipeline
company that was sold in January 2003; BMG, a regulated natural gas and
propane distribution company that was sold in October 2003; and Cheyenne,
a regulated electric and natural gas utility that was sold in January 2005.
See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the
discontinued operations of Viking, BMG and Cheyenne.

During 2005, Xcel Energy’s
board of directors approved management’s plan to pursue the sale of UE
(engineering, construction and design) and Quixx Corp. (a former subsidiary of
UE that partners in cogeneration projects). 
During 2004, Xcel Energy’s board of directors approved management’s plan
to pursue the sale of Seren (broadband telecommunications services).  During 2003, Planergy International, Inc.
(energy management solutions) closed and began selling a majority of its
business operations, with final dissolution occurring in 2004.  During 2003, Xcel Energy also divested its
ownership interest in NRG, an independent power producer. On May 14, 2003,
NRG filed for bankruptcy to restructure its debt.  As a result of the reorganization, Xcel
Energy relinquished its ownership interest in NRG.  During 2003, the board of directors of Xcel
Energy also approved management’s plan to exit businesses conducted by the
nonregulated subsidiaries Xcel Energy International and e prime. NRG, Xcel
Energy International, e prime, Seren, Planergy International, Inc., UE and
Quixx Corp. are presented as components of discontinued operations.   See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In 2004, Xcel Energy began
consolidating the financial statements of subsidiaries in which it has a
controlling financial interest, pursuant to the requirements of FASB
Interpretation No. 46, as revised (FIN No. 46).  Historically, consolidation has been required
only for subsidiaries in which an enterprise has a majority voting
interest.  As a result, Xcel Energy is
required to consolidate a portion of its affordable housing investments made
through Eloigne, which for periods prior to 2004 are accounted for under the
equity method.  As of Dec. 31, 2005,
the assets of the affordable housing investments consolidated as a result of
FIN No. 46, as revised, were approximately $136 million and long-term
liabilities were approximately $75 million, including long-term debt of $72
million.  Investments of $51 million,
previously reflected as a component of investments in unconsolidated
affiliates, have been consolidated with the entities’ assets initially recorded
at their carrying amounts as of


Jan. 1, 2004.  The long-term debt is collateralized by the
affordable housing projects and is nonrecourse to Xcel Energy.

Xcel Energy uses the equity
method of accounting for its investments in partnerships, joint ventures and
certain projects for which it does not have a controlling financial interest.
Under this method, a proportionate share of pretax income is recorded as equity
earnings from investments in affiliates. In the consolidation process, all
significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. Xcel Energy
has investments in several plants and transmission facilities jointly owned
with other utilities. These projects are accounted for on a proportionate
consolidation basis, consistent with industry practice. See Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition —

Revenues related to the sale of energy are generally recorded when
service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers. However, the
determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on the
reading of their meter, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the
month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since
the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled
revenue is estimated.

Xcel Energy’s utility
subsidiaries have various rate-adjustment mechanisms in place that currently
provide for the recovery of certain purchased natural gas and electric fuel and
purchased energy costs. These cost-adjustment tariffs may increase or decrease
the level of costs recovered through base rates and are revised periodically,
as prescribed by the appropriate regulatory agencies, for any difference
between the total amount collected under the clauses and the recoverable costs
incurred. In addition, Xcel Energy presents its revenue net of any excise or
other fiduciary-type taxes or fees. A summary of significant rate-adjustment
mechanisms follows:

•

NSP-Minnesota’s rates include a cost-of-fuel-and-purchased-energy and a
cost-of-gas recovery mechanism allowing dollar-for-dollar recovery of the
respective costs, which are trued-up on a two-month and annual basis,
respectively.

•

NSP-Wisconsin’s rates include a cost-of-gas
adjustment clause for purchased natural gas, but not for purchased electric
energy or electric fuel. In Wisconsin, requests can be made for recovery of
those electric costs prospectively through the rate review process, which
normally occurs every two years, and an interim fuel-cost hearing process.

•

PSCo generally recovers all prudently incurred electric fuel and
purchased energy costs through an electric-commodity adjustment clause.  This fuel mechanism also has in place a
sharing among customers and shareholders of certain fuel and energy costs, with
an $11.25 million maximum on any cost sharing over or under an allowed
electric-commodity adjustment formula rate, and a sharing among shareholders
and customers of certain gains and losses on trading margins.

•

In Texas, SPS may request periodic
adjustments to provide electric fuel and purchased energy cost recovery.  In New Mexico, SPS has a monthly fuel and
purchased power cost-recovery factor.

•

In Colorado, PSCo operates under an electric
performance-based regulatory plan, which provides for an annual earnings test
in which earnings above the authorized return on equity are refunded to
customers.  NSP-Minnesota and PSCo
operate under various service standards in Minnesota and Colorado,
respectively, which could require customer refunds if certain criteria are not
met. NSP-Minnesota and PSCo’s rates in Minnesota and Colorado, respectively,
also include monthly adjustments for the recovery of conservation and
energy-management program costs, which are reviewed annually.

•

NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS
sell firm power and energy in wholesale markets, which are regulated by the
FERC. Certain of these rates include monthly wholesale fuel cost-recovery
mechanisms.

Commodity Trading Operations —

All applicable gains and losses related to
commodity trading activities, whether or not settled physically, are shown on a
net basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Xcel Energy’s commodity
trading operations are conducted by NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS. Commodity
trading activities are not associated with energy produced from Xcel Energy’s
generation assets or energy and capacity purchased to serve native load.
Commodity trading contracts are recorded at fair market value in accordance
with SFAS No. 133, as amended.  In
addition, commodity trading results include the impact of any margin-sharing
mechanisms.

Derivative Financial Instruments —

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries utilize a
variety of derivatives, including commodity forwards, futures and options,
index or fixed price swaps and basis swaps, to mitigate market risk and to
enhance its operations. For further discussion of Xcel Energy’s risk management
and derivative activities, see Note 12 to the


Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation —

Property, plant and equipment is stated at
original cost. The cost of plant includes direct labor and materials,
contracted work, overhead costs and applicable interest expense. The cost of
plant retired is charged to accumulated depreciation and amortization. Removal
costs associated with regulatory obligations are recorded as regulatory
liabilities. Significant additions or improvements extending asset lives are
capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Maintenance and replacement of items determined to be less than units of
property are charged to operating expenses. Property, plant and equipment also
includes costs associated with property held for future use.

Xcel Energy determines the
depreciation of its plant by using the straight-line method, which spreads the original
cost equally over the plant’s useful life. Depreciation expense, expressed as a
percentage of average depreciable property, was approximately 3.2 percent, 3.1
percent and 3.0 percent for the years ended Dec. 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFDC)

—

AFDC represents the cost of capital used to
finance utility construction activity. 
AFDC is computed by applying a composite pretax rate to qualified
construction work in progress.  The
amount of AFDC capitalized as a utility construction cost is credited to other
nonoperating income (for equity capital) and interest charges (for debt
capital). AFDC amounts capitalized are included in Xcel Energy’s rate base for
establishing utility service rates. In addition to construction-related
amounts, AFDC also is recorded to reflect returns on capital used to finance
conservation programs in Minnesota.

Decommissioning —

Xcel Energy accounts for the future cost of decommissioning, or
retirement, of its nuclear generating plants through annual depreciation
accruals using an annuity approach designed to provide for full rate recovery
of the future decommissioning costs. The decommissioning calculation covers all
expenses, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material, and
extends over the estimated lives of the plants. The calculation assumes that
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin will recover those costs through rates. The
fair value of external nuclear decommissioning fund investments are estimated based
on quoted market prices for those or similar investments. Unrealized gains or
losses are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities.  For more information on nuclear
decommissioning, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

PSCo also previously
operated a nuclear generating plant, which has been decommissioned and was
repowered using natural gas. PSCo’s costs associated with decommissioning were
deferred and amortized consistent with regulatory recovery.  These costs were fully recovered through
rates in July 2005.

Nuclear Fuel Expense —

Nuclear fuel expense, which is recorded as the nuclear generating
plants use fuel, includes the cost of fuel used in the current period, as well
as future disposal costs of spent nuclear fuel. In addition, nuclear fuel
expense includes fees assessed by the DOE for NSP-Minnesota’s portion of the
cost of decommissioning the DOE’s fuel-enrichment facility.

Environmental Costs —

Environmental costs are recorded when it is probable Xcel Energy is
liable for the costs and the liability can reasonably be estimated. Costs may
be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that the costs will be
recovered from customers in future rates. Otherwise, the costs are expensed. If
an environmental expense is related to facilities currently in use, such as
emission-control equipment, the cost is capitalized and depreciated over the
life of the plant, assuming the costs are recoverable in future rates or future
cash flow.

Estimated remediation costs,
excluding inflationary increases, are recorded. The estimates are based on
experience, an assessment of the current situation and the technology currently
available for use in the remediation. The recorded costs are regularly adjusted
as estimates are revised and as remediation proceeds. If several designated
responsible parties exist, only Xcel Energy’s expected share of the cost is
estimated and recorded. Any future costs of restoring sites where operation may
extend indefinitely are treated as a capitalized cost of plant retirement. The
depreciation expense levels recoverable in rates include a provision for
removal expenses, which may include final remediation costs. Removal costs
recovered in rates are classified as a regulatory liability.

Legal Costs

— Litigation accruals are recorded when it is probable Xcel Energy is liable
for the costs and the liability can be reasonably estimated.  Legal accruals are recorded net of insurance
recovery.  Legal costs related to
settlements are not accrued, but expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes —

Xcel Energy and its domestic subsidiaries file consolidated federal
income tax returns. Xcel Energy and its domestic subsidiaries file combined and
separate state income tax returns.  NRG
and one or more of its domestic subsidiaries


were included in some state
returns, but not all, of these combined returns in 2003. NRG has not been
consolidated or combined in any of Xcel Energy’s income tax returns since 2003.

Federal income taxes paid by
Xcel Energy, as parent of the Xcel Energy consolidated group, are allocated to
the Xcel Energy subsidiaries based on separate company computations of tax. A
similar allocation is made for state income taxes paid by Xcel Energy in
connection with combined state filings. In accordance with the PUHCA
requirements, the holding company also allocates its own net income tax
benefits to its direct subsidiaries based on the positive tax liability of each
company.

Xcel Energy defers income
taxes for all temporary differences between pretax financial and taxable
income, and between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Xcel
Energy uses the tax rates that are scheduled to be in effect when the temporary
differences are expected to turn around, or reverse.

Due to the effects of past
regulatory practices, when deferred taxes were not required to be recorded, the
reversal of some temporary differences are accounted for as current income tax
expense. Investment tax credits are deferred and their benefits amortized over
the estimated lives of the related property. Utility rate regulation also has
created certain regulatory assets and liabilities related to income taxes,
which are summarized in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of Estimates —

In recording transactions and balances resulting from business
operations, Xcel Energy uses estimates based on the best information available.
Estimates are used for such items as plant depreciable lives, asset retirement
obligations, decommissioning, tax provisions, uncollectible amounts,
environmental costs, unbilled revenues, jurisdictional fuel and energy cost
allocations and actuarially determined benefit costs. The recorded estimates
are revised when better information becomes available or when actual amounts
can be determined. Those revisions can affect operating results. The
depreciable lives of certain plant assets are reviewed or revised annually, if
appropriate.

Cash and Cash Equivalents —

Xcel Energy considers investments in certain
debt instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time
of purchase to be cash equivalents. Those debt instruments are primarily
commercial paper and money market funds.

Inventory —

All inventory is recorded
at average cost.

Regulatory Accounting —

Our regulated utility subsidiaries account for certain income and
expense items in accordance with SFAS No. 71 — “Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation.” Under SFAS No. 71:

•

Certain costs, which would otherwise be
charged to expense, are deferred as regulatory assets based on the expected
ability to recover them in future rates; and

•

Certain credits, which would otherwise be
reflected as income, are deferred as regulatory liabilities based on the
expectation they will be returned to customers in future rates.

Estimates of recovering
deferred costs and returning deferred credits are based on specific ratemaking
decisions or precedent for each item. Regulatory assets and liabilities are
amortized consistent with the period of expected regulatory treatment. See more
discussion of regulatory assets and liabilities at Note 16 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Stock-Based Employee Compensation —

Xcel Energy has several stock-based
compensation plans. Those plans are accounted for using the intrinsic-value
method. Compensation expense is not recorded for stock options because there is
no difference between the market price and the purchase price at grant date.
Compensation expense is recorded for restricted stock and stock units awarded
to certain employees, which are held until the restriction lapses or the stock
is forfeited. For more information on stock compensation impacts, see Note 9 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Deferred Financing Costs

—

Other assets also included deferred financing
costs, net of amortization, of approximately $42 million and $44 million at Dec. 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Xcel Energy is amortizing these financing costs
over the remaining maturity periods of the related debt.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Uncollectibles

—

Accounts receivable are stated at the actual
billed amount net of write-offs and allowance for uncollectibles.  Xcel Energy establishes an allowance for
uncollectibles based on a reserve policy that reflects its expected exposure to
the credit risk of customers.

Reclassifications

—

Certain
items in the statements of operations, balance sheets and the statements of
cash flows have been reclassified from prior-period presentation to conform to
the 2005 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net


income or earnings per
share. The reclassifications were primarily related to the presentation of UE
as discontinued operations following the announcement of its sale in March 2005,
as discussed later.  In addition, fees
collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies were reclassified
to be presented net of the related payments made to the agencies.

2.
Discontinued Operations

Xcel Energy classified and
accounted for certain assets as held for sale at Dec. 31, 2005 and
2004.  Assets held for sale are valued on
an asset-by-asset basis at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less
costs to sell.  In applying those
provisions, management considered cash flow analyses, bids and offers related
to those assets and businesses.  Assets
held for sale are not depreciated.

Results of operations for
divested businesses and the results of businesses held for sale are reported
for all periods presented on a net basis as discontinued operations. In
addition, the assets and liabilities of the businesses divested and held for
sale in 2005 and 2004 have been reclassified to assets and liabilities held for
sale in the accompanying Balance Sheet.

Regulated Utility
Segment

During
January 2004, Xcel Energy reached an agreement to sell its regulated
electric and natural gas subsidiary, Cheyenne. 
Black Hills Corp. purchased all the common stock of Cheyenne, including
the assumption of outstanding debt of approximately $25 million, for
approximately $90 million, plus a working capital adjustment finalized in
2005.  The sale was completed on Jan. 21,
2005, and resulted in an after-tax loss of approximately $13 million, or 3
cents per share, which was accrued at Dec. 31, 2004.

During 2003, Xcel Energy
completed the sale of two subsidiaries in its regulated natural gas utility
segment: Viking and BMG. After-tax disposal gains of $23.3 million, or 6 cents
per share, were recorded for the natural gas utility segment, primarily related
to the sale of Viking.

NRG Segment

Change in Accounting for NRG in 2003

—

Prior to NRG’s bankruptcy filing in May 2003,
Xcel Energy accounted for NRG as a consolidated subsidiary. However, as a
result of NRG’s bankruptcy filing, Xcel Energy no longer had the ability to
control the operations of NRG. Accordingly, effective as of the bankruptcy
filing date, Xcel Energy ceased the consolidation of NRG and began accounting
for its investment in NRG using the equity method in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 18 — “The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock.” After changing to the equity method, Xcel Energy
was limited in the amount of NRG’s losses subsequent to the bankruptcy date
that it was required to record. In accordance with these limitations under the
equity method, Xcel Energy stopped recognizing equity in the losses of NRG
subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2003. These limitations provided
for loss recognition by Xcel Energy until its investment in NRG was written off
to zero, with further loss recognition to continue if its financial commitments
to NRG existed beyond amounts already invested.

Prior to NRG entering
bankruptcy, Xcel Energy recorded more losses than the limitations provided for
as of June 30, 2003. Upon Xcel Energy’s divestiture of its interest in NRG
in December 2003, the NRG losses recorded in excess of Xcel Energy’s
investment in and financial commitment to NRG were reversed. This resulted in
an adjustment of the total NRG losses recorded for the year 2003 to $251
million. Xcel Energy’s share of NRG’s results for all 2003 periods is reported
in a single line item, Equity in Losses of NRG, as a component of discontinued
operations. NRG’s 2003 results do reflect some effects of asset impairments, as
discussed below.

NRG Asset Impairments

—

In
2002, NRG experienced credit-rating downgrades, defaults under numerous credit
agreements, increased collateral requirements and reduced liquidity. These
events resulted in impairment reviews of a number of NRG assets. NRG completed
an analysis of the recoverability of the asset-carrying values of its projects
each period, factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of
action available to NRG, given its financial position and liquidity constraints
at the time of each analysis. This approach was applied consistently to asset
groups with similar uncertainties and cash flow streams. As a result, NRG
determined that many of its construction projects and its operational projects
became impaired during 2002 and 2003 and required being written down to fair
market value. In applying those provisions, NRG management considered cash flow
analyses, bids and offers related to those projects.


Nonregulated
Subsidiaries — All Other Segment

Utility Engineering

— In March 2005, Xcel Energy agreed to
sell its nonregulated subsidiary Utility Engineering Corp. (UE), to Zachry
Group, Inc.  In April 2005,
Zachry acquired all of the outstanding shares of UE.  Xcel Energy recorded an insignificant loss in
the first quarter of 2005 as a result of the transaction.  In August 2005, Xcel Energy’s board of
directors approved management’s plan to pursue the sale of Quixx Corp., a
former subsidiary of UE that partners in cogeneration projects, and was not
included in the sale of UE to Zachry.

Seren

— On Sept. 27, 2004, Xcel Energy’s board of
directors approved management’s plan to pursue the sale of Seren Innovations, Inc.,
a wholly owned broadband subsidiary.

On
May 25, 2005, Xcel Energy reached an agreement to sell Seren’s California
assets to WaveDivision Holdings, LLC, which was completed in November 2005.  In July 2005, Xcel Energy reached an
agreement to sell Seren’s Minnesota assets to Charter Communications, which was
completed in January 2006.  An
estimated after-tax impairment charge, including disposition costs, of $143
million, or 34 cents per share, was recorded in 2004.  Based on the sales agreements entered into in
2005, the estimate was adjusted in 2005 to reflect a total asset impairment of
$140 million.

Xcel Energy International and e
prime

—

In December 2003,
the board of directors of Xcel Energy approved management’s plan to exit the
businesses conducted by its nonregulated subsidiaries Xcel Energy International
and e prime.  The exit of all business
conducted by e prime was completed in 2004.

Results
of discontinued nonregulated operations in 2004 include the impact of the sale
of the Argentina subsidiaries of Xcel Energy International.  The sales took place in a series of three
transactions, with a total sales price of approximately $31 million.  In addition to the sales price, Xcel Energy
also received approximately $21 million at the closing of one transaction as
redemption of its capital investment. 
The sales resulted in a gain of approximately $8 million, including the
realization of approximately $7 million of income tax benefits realizable upon
the sale of the Xcel Energy International assets.

Results of discontinued
nonregulated operations in 2003, other than NRG, include an after-tax loss
expected on the disposal of all Xcel Energy International assets of $59
million, based on the estimated fair value of such assets. The fair value
represents a market bid or appraisal received that is believed to best reflect
the assets’ fair value at Dec. 31, 2003. Xcel Energy’s remaining
investment in Xcel Energy International at Dec. 31, 2003, was
approximately $39 million. Losses from discontinued nonregulated operations in
2003 also include a charge of $16 million for costs of settling a Commodity
Futures Trading Commission trading investigation of e prime.

Tax Benefits Related to Investment in NRG —

With NRG’s emergence from bankruptcy in December 2003,
Xcel Energy divested its ownership interest in NRG.  Xcel Energy has recognized tax benefits
related to the divestiture.  These tax
benefits, since related to Xcel Energy’s investment in discontinued NRG
operations, also are reported as discontinued operations.

During 2002, Xcel Energy
recognized an initial estimate of the expected tax benefits of $706
million.  Based on the results of a 2003
preliminary tax basis study of NRG, Xcel Energy recorded $404 million of
additional tax benefits in 2003.  In
2004, the NRG basis study was updated and previously recognized tax benefits
were reduced by $13 million.  In 2005, a
$17 million tax benefit was recorded to reflect the final federal income tax resolution
of Xcel Energy’s divested interest in NRG.


Summarized
Financial Results of Discontinued Operations


The major classes of assets
and liabilities held for sale and related to discontinued operations as of Dec. 31
are as follows:

3.
Short-Term Borrowings

Notes Payable and Commercial Paper

—

During 2005, Xcel Energy, PSCo and SPS
resumed short-term borrowings in the commercial paper market.  Information regarding notes payable and commercial
paper for the years ended Dec. 31, 2005 and 2004, is presented in the
following table:

Credit Facilities

—

On Dec. 1,
2005, PSCo entered into an agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to provide
PSCo a committed five-month, $50 million seasonal revolving credit facility.  The interest rate is based on either Wells
Fargo Bank’s prime rate or the applicable LIBOR, plus a borrowing margin as
determined by PSCo’s credit worthiness. 
PSCo entered into this agreement to ensure adequate liquidity for rising
natural gas prices during the winter months. 
As of Dec. 31, 2005, PSCo had not borrowed against this facility.

In addition, on Dec. 12,
2005, PSCo entered into a $25 million good-until-canceled uncommitted credit
line with KBC Bank to provide additional short-term seasonal liquidity as a
result of higher natural gas prices.  As
of Dec. 31, 2005, PSCo had not utilized this credit line.

4.
Long-Term Debt

Credit Facilities

—

At
Dec. 31, 2005, Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries had the following
committed credit facilities available:

*
Net of credit facility borrowings, issued and outstanding letters of credit and
commercial paper borrowings


The
lines of credit provide short-term financing in the form of notes payable to
banks, letters of credit and back-up support for commercial paper
borrowings.  Each credit facility has one
financial covenant requiring that the debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of
each entity be less than or equal to 65 percent with which all were in compliance.  The interest rates under these lines of
credit are based on either the agent bank’s prime rate or the applicable London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a borrowing margin as determined by each
entity’s credit worthiness.

Xcel Energy has a $700
million, five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in November 2009.  Xcel Energy has the right to request an
extension of the final maturity date by one year.  The maturity extension is subject to majority
bank group approval.  As of Dec. 31,
2005, Xcel Energy had no direct borrowings on this line of credit, however the
credit facility was used to provide backup for $325.5 million of commercial
paper outstanding and $18.5 million of letters of credit.  As discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, $35.2 million of letters of credit were outstanding at Dec. 31,
2005, of which $18.5 million were supported by the Xcel Energy credit facility
and are included in the above table.

Xcel Energy’s 2007 and 2008
series convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of Xcel Energy
common stock at a conversion price of $12.33 per share. Conversion is at the
option of the holder at any time prior to maturity.  In addition, Xcel Energy must make additional
payments of interest, referred to as protection payments, on the notes in an
amount equal to any portion of regular quarterly per share dividends on common
stock that exceeds $0.1875 that would have been payable to the holders of the
notes if such holders had converted their notes on the record date for such
dividend.  On May 25, 2005, the
board of directors of Xcel Energy voted to raise the quarterly dividend on its
common stock from $0.2075 to $0.2150. 
Consequently, as of Dec. 31, 2005, a total of $2.4 million in
additional interest expense has been recorded.

All property of
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin and the electric property of PSCo are subject
to the liens of their first mortgage indentures.  In addition, certain SPS payments under its
pollution-control obligations are pledged to secure obligations of the Red
River Authority of Texas.

Maturities of long-term debt
are:

5.
Preferred Stock

Xcel Energy has authorized
7,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a $100 par value.  At Dec. 31, 2005, Xcel Energy had six
series of preferred stock outstanding, redeemable at its option at prices
ranging from $102.00 to $103.75 per share plus accrued dividends.  Under the PUHCA, unless there was an order
from the SEC, a holding company or any subsidiary could declare and pay
dividends only out of retained earnings. 
With the repeal of the PUHCA, restrictions on the ability of holding
companies or utility subsidiaries to declare dividends set out in that statute
no longer apply.

The holders of the $3.60
series preferred stock are entitled to three votes per each share held. The
holders of the other series of preferred stock are entitled to one vote per
share. In the event dividends payable on the preferred stock of any series
outstanding is in arrears in an amount equal to four quarterly dividends, the
holders of preferred stocks, voting as a class, are entitled to elect the
smallest number of directors necessary to constitute a majority of the board of
directors. The holders of common stock, voting as a class, are entitled to
elect the remaining directors.

The charters of some of Xcel
Energy’s subsidiaries also authorize the issuance of preferred stock. However,
at Dec. 31, 2005, there are no preferred shares outstanding.

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trusts

NSP Financing I, a wholly
owned, special-purpose subsidiary trust of NSP-Minnesota, had $200 million of
7.875-percent


trust preferred securities
issued and outstanding that were originally scheduled to mature in 2037.  The preferred securities were redeemable at
NSP Financing I’s option at $25 per share, beginning in 2002. On July 31,
2003, NSP-Minnesota redeemed the $200 million of trust preferred securities. A
certificate of cancellation was filed to dissolve NSP Financing I on Sept. 15,
2003.

PSCo Capital Trust I, a
wholly owned, special-purpose subsidiary trust of PSCo, had $194 million of
7.60-percent trust preferred securities issued and outstanding that were
originally scheduled to mature in 2038. 
The securities were redeemable at the option of PSCo after May 2003,
at 100 percent of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest. On June 30,
2003, PSCo redeemed the $194 million of trust preferred securities. A
certificate of cancellation was filed to dissolve PSCo Capital Trust I on Dec. 29,
2003.

Southwestern Public Service
Capital I, a wholly owned, special-purpose subsidiary trust of SPS, had $100
million of 7.85-percent trust preferred securities issued and outstanding that
were originally scheduled to mature in 2036. 
The securities were redeemable at the option of SPS after October 2001,
at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued interest. On Oct. 15,
2003, SPS redeemed the $100 million of trust preferred securities. A
certificate of cancellation was filed to dissolve SPS Capital I on Jan. 5,
2004.

Distributions paid to
preferred security holders were reflected as a financing cost in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations, along with interest charges.

7.
Generating Plant Ownership and Operation

Joint Plant Ownership

— Following are the investments by Xcel
Energy’s subsidiaries in jointly owned plants and the related ownership
percentages as of Dec. 31, 2005:

NSP-Minnesota is part owner
of Sherco 3, an 860-megawatt, coal-fueled electric generating unit.
NSP-Minnesota is the operating agent under the joint ownership agreement.
NSP-Minnesota’s share of operating expenses and construction expenditures are
included in the applicable utility accounts. PSCo’s current operational assets
include approximately 320 megawatts of jointly owned generating capacity. PSCo’s
share of operating expenses and construction expenditures are included in the
applicable utility accounts.  PSCo began
major construction on a new jointly owned 750-megawatt, coal-fired unit in
Pueblo, Colo. in January 2006. 
Major construction on the new unit, Comanche 3, is expected to be
completed in 2010.  PSCo is the operating
agent under the joint ownership agreement. 
Each of the respective owners is responsible for the issuance of its own
securities to finance its portion of the construction costs.

Nuclear Plant Operation

— The Nuclear Management Company (NMC) is an
operating company that manages the operations, maintenance and physical
security of several nuclear generating units on five sites, including three
units / two sites owned by NSP-Minnesota. 
NSP-Minnesota continues to own the plants, controls all energy produced
by the plants and retains responsibility for nuclear property and liability
insurance and decommissioning costs.  The
Wisconsin Public Service Corporation is no longer participating in NMC after
the sale of its Kewaunee nuclear power plant in July 2005.  In January 2006, Florida Power &
Light purchased the majority interest in the Duane Arnold plant from Alliant
Energy and announced it will assume management of the plant.  As a result, NSP-Minnesota’s ownership
interest in NMC has increased to 25 percent. 
In accordance with the Nuclear Power


Plant Operating Services
Agreement, NSP-Minnesota also pays its proportionate share of the operating
expenses and capital improvement costs incurred by NMC.  NSP-Minnesota paid NMC $257.1 million in
2005, $314.7 million in 2004 and $227.0 million in 2003.

8. Income
Taxes

Xcel Energy’s federal net
operating loss and tax credit carry forwards are estimated to be $1.4 billion
and $107.6 million, respectively.  A
portion of the net operating loss in the amount of $1.1 billion and a portion
of the tax credit carry forward in the amount of $28.8 million are accounted
for in discontinued operations.  The
carry forward periods expire in 2023 and 2024. Xcel Energy also has net
operating loss and tax credit carry forwards in some states. The state carry forward
periods expire between 2014 and 2024.  A
valuation allowance was recorded against deferred tax assets for capital loss
carry forwards related to discontinued operations.  The valuation allowance was $44 million as of
Dec. 31, 2005, and $46 million as of Dec. 31, 2004.  The net reduction in valuation allowance of
$2 million was due to capital gains.  The
capital loss carry forward period expires in 2009.

Total income tax expense
from continuing operations differs from the amount computed by applying the
statutory federal income tax rate to income before income tax expense. The
following is a table reconciling such differences for the years ending Dec. 31:

Income taxes comprise the
following expense (benefit) items for the years ending Dec. 31:


The components of Xcel
Energy’s net deferred tax liability from continuing operations (current and
noncurrent portions) at Dec. 31 were:

9. Common
Stock and Stock-Based Compensation

Common Stock and Equivalents

—

Xcel Energy has common stock equivalents
consisting of convertible senior notes, restricted stock units and stock
options, as discussed later.

In 2005, 2004 and
2003, Xcel Energy has 13.3 million, 14.3 million and 15.6 million options
outstanding, respectively that were antidilutive and therefore excluded from
the earnings per share calculation.  The
dilutive impact of common stock equivalents affected earnings per share as
follows for the years ending Dec. 31:

Stock-Based Compensation —

Xcel Energy has incentive compensation plans
under which stock options and other performance incentives are awarded to key
employees. The weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive
shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy’s earnings per share include
the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock awards based on the
treasury stock method. The options normally have a term of 10 years and
generally become exercisable from three to five years after grant date or upon
specified circumstances. The tables below include awards made by Xcel Energy
and some of its predecessor companies, adjusted for the merger stock exchange
ratio, and are presented on an Xcel Energy share basis.


Activity in stock
options was as follows for the years ended Dec. 31:

Certain employees also may
elect to receive shares of common or restricted stock under the Xcel Energy
Inc. Executive Annual Incentive Award Plan. 
Restricted stock vests in equal annual installments over a three-year
period from the date of grant.  Xcel
Energy reinvests dividends on the restricted stock it holds while restrictions
are in place.  Restrictions also apply to
the additional shares of restricted stock acquired through dividend
reinvestment.  Restricted stock has a
value equal to the market-trading price of Xcel Energy’s stock at the grant
date.  Xcel Energy granted 28,626 shares
of restricted stock in 2005 when the grant-date market price was $17.81.  Xcel Energy granted 65,090 shares of
restricted stock in 2004 when the grant-date market price was $17.40.  Xcel Energy did not grant any shares of
restricted stock in 2003.  Compensation
expense related to these awards was not significant.

On March 28, 2003, the
governance, compensation and nominating committee of Xcel Energy’s board of
directors granted restricted stock units and performance shares under the Xcel
Energy Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan approved by the shareholders in 2000.  Restrictions on the restricted stock units
lapse upon the achievement of a 27-percent total shareholder return (TSR) for
10 consecutive business days and other criteria relating to Xcel Energy’s
common equity ratio. Under no circumstances will the restrictions lapse until
one year after the grant date.  TSR is
measured using the market price per share of Xcel Energy common stock, which at
the grant date was $12.93, plus common dividends declared after grant date.  The TSR was met in the fourth quarter of
2003, and approximately $31 million of compensation expense was recorded at Dec. 31,
2003. The remaining cost of $10 million related to the 2003 restricted stock
units was recorded in the first quarter of 2004.  In January 2004, Xcel Energy’s board of
directors approved the repurchase of up to 2.5 million shares of common stock
to fulfill the requirements of the restricted stock unit exercise.   On March 29, 2004, the restricted stock
units lapsed, and Xcel Energy issued approximately 1.6 million shares of common
stock.

The
performance share award is entirely dependent on a single measure, the TSR.
Xcel Energy’s TSR will be measured over a three-year period. Xcel Energy’s TSR
is compared to the TSR of other companies in the Edison Electric Institute’s
Electrics Index. At the end of the three-year period, potential payouts of the
performance shares range from 0 percent to 200 percent, depending on Xcel
Energy’s TSR compared to the peer group.

On Dec. 9, 2003, the
governance, compensation and nominating committee of Xcel Energy’s board of
directors approved restricted stock units and performance shares under the Xcel
Energy Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan.  On Jan. 2,
2004, Xcel Energy granted 836,186 restricted stock units and performance
shares.  The grant-date market price used
to calculate the TSR for this grant is $17.03.

On
Dec. 14, 2004, the governance, compensation and nominating committee of
Xcel Energy’s board of directors granted restricted stock units under the Xcel
Energy Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
Payout of the units and the lapsing of restrictions on the transfer of
units are based on two separate performance criteria. A portion of the awarded
units plus associated earned


dividend
equivalents will be settled, and the restricted period will lapse after Xcel
Energy achieves a specified earnings per share growth (adjusted for
corporate-owned life insurance) measured against year-end earnings per share
(adjusted for corporate-owned life insurance). Additionally, Xcel Energy’s
annual dividend paid on its common stock must remain at $0.83 per share or
greater. Earnings per share growth will be measured annually at the end of each
fiscal year. However, in no event will the restrictions lapse prior to two
years after the date of grant.  The
remaining awarded units plus associated earned dividend equivalents will be
settled, and the restricted period will lapse after the average of actual
performance results (adjusted for actual megawatt hours) for the three
components of an environmental index measured as a percentage of target
performance meets or exceeds 100 percent. The environmental index will be
measured annually at the end of each fiscal year. However, in no event will the
restrictions lapse prior to two years after the date of grant. If the
performance criteria have not been met within four years of the date of grant,
all associated units shall be forfeited.  
On Jan. 1, 2005, Xcel Energy granted 519,362 restricted stock
units.

On
Dec. 14, 2004, the governance, compensation and nominating committee of
Xcel Energy’s board of directors approved performance shares under the Xcel
Energy Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan.  On Jan. 1,
2005, Xcel Energy granted 323,889 
performance shares.

On Dec. 13, 2005, the
governance, compensation and nominating committee of Xcel Energy’s board of
directors approved restricted stock units and performance shares under the Xcel
Energy Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan.  On Jan. 1,
2006, Xcel Energy granted approximately 653,000 restricted stock units and performance
shares.

Compensation expense related
to restricted stock units and performance shares of approximately $14.9
million, $16.8 million and $35.0 million was recorded in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Xcel Energy
applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 — “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees” in accounting for stock-based compensation and,
accordingly, no compensation cost is recognized for the issuance of stock
options, as the exercise price of the options equals the fair-market value of
Xcel Energy’s common stock at the date of grant. In December 2002, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 148 — “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure,” amending SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair-value-based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation, and requiring disclosure in
both annual and interim Consolidated Financial Statements about the method used
and the effect of the method used on results. The pro forma impact of applying
SFAS No. 148 is as follows at Dec. 31:

Common Stock Dividends Per Share —

Historically, Xcel Energy has paid quarterly
dividends to its shareholders.  Dividends
on common stock are paid as declared by the board of directors.   Dividends paid per share for the quarters of
2005, 2004 and 2003 are:


Dividend and Other Capital-Related Restrictions

—

Formerly, under PUHCA, unless there was an
order from the SEC, a holding company or any subsidiary could declare and pay
dividends only out of retained earnings. In May 2003, Xcel Energy received
authorization from the SEC to pay an aggregate amount of $152 million of common
and preferred dividends out of capital and unearned surplus. Xcel Energy used
this authorization to declare and pay approximately $150 million for its first-
and second-quarter dividends in 2003. At Dec. 31, 2005, Xcel Energy’s
retained earnings were approximately $562.1 million.  With the repeal of the PUHCA, restrictions on
the ability of holding companies or utility subsidiaries to declare dividends
set out in that statute will no longer apply. 
However, utility dividends will be subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction
under the Federal Power Act, which prohibits the payment of utility dividends
out of capital accounts.

The Articles of
Incorporation of Xcel Energy place restrictions on the amount of common stock
dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding. Under the provisions,
dividend payments may be restricted if Xcel Energy’s capitalization ratio (on a
holding company basis only and not on a consolidated basis) is less than 25
percent. For these purposes, the capitalization ratio is equal to (i) common
stock plus surplus divided by (ii) the sum of common stock plus surplus
plus long-term debt. Based on this definition, the capitalization ratio at Dec. 31,
2005, was 84 percent. Therefore, the restrictions do not place any effective
limit on Xcel Energy’s ability to pay dividends because the restrictions are
only triggered when the capitalization ratio is less than 25 percent or will be
reduced to less than 25 percent through dividends (other than dividends payable
in common stock), distributions or acquisitions of Xcel Energy common stock.

In addition, NSP-Minnesota’s
first mortgage indenture places certain restrictions on the amount of cash
dividends it can pay to Xcel Energy, the holder of its common stock. Even with
these restrictions, NSP-Minnesota could have paid more than $854 million in
additional cash dividends on common stock at Dec. 31, 2005.

Registered holding companies
and certain of their subsidiaries, including Xcel Energy and its utility
subsidiaries, were limited, under the PUHCA, in their ability to issue
securities. Such registered holding companies and their subsidiaries could not
issue securities unless authorized by an exemptive rule or order of the
SEC. Because Xcel Energy did not qualify for any of the main exemptive rules,
it sought and received financing authority from the SEC under the PUHCA for
various financing arrangements. Xcel Energy’s current financing authority
permits it, subject to certain conditions, to issue through June 30, 2008,
up to $1.8 billion of new long-term debt, common equity and equity-linked
securities and $1.0 billion of short-term debt securities during the new
authorization period, provided that the aggregate amount of long-term debt,
common equity, and equity-linked and short-term debt securities issued during
the new authorization period does not exceed $2.0 billion.

Xcel Energy’s ability to
issue securities under the financing authority was subject to a number of
conditions. One of the conditions of the financing authority was that Xcel
Energy’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization, on a consolidated
basis, be at least 30 percent. As of Dec. 31, 2005, such common equity
ratio was approximately 42 percent. Additional conditions require that a
security to be issued that is rated, must be at least rated investment grade by
one nationally recognized rating agency. Finally, all outstanding securities
that are rated must be rated investment grade by at least one nationally
recognized rating agency.  On Feb. 10,
2006, Xcel Energy’s senior unsecured debt was considered investment grade by
Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch.

Upon the repeal of the
PUHCA, these limitations on Xcel Energy’s financings generally will no longer
apply, nor will the PUHCA restrictions generally apply to the financings by the
utility subsidiaries.  However, utility
financings and intra-system financings will become subject to the jurisdiction
of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. 
The FERC by rule has granted a blanket authorization under certain
intra-system financings involving holding companies.  Requests to the FERC to clarify its rules or
grant similar blanket authorizations filed by other entities are presently
pending before the FERC.  Xcel Energy


and the utility subsidiaries
are presently evaluating the specific applications that they will need to file
with the FERC due to the repeal of the PUHCA. 
It is possible that in lieu of requesting authority from the FERC for
intra-system financings, Xcel Energy and the utility subsidiaries may rely in
the interim on a transitional savings clause that would permit such financing
transactions to the extent authorized by the SEC financing order and so long as
the conditions in the SEC financing order continue to be satisfied.

Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement

—

In June 2001, Xcel Energy adopted a Stockholder
Protection Rights Agreement. Each share of Xcel Energy’s common stock includes
one shareholder protection right. Under the agreement’s principal provision, if
any person or group acquires 15 percent or more of Xcel Energy’s outstanding
common stock, all other shareholders of Xcel Energy would be entitled to buy,
for the exercise price of $95 per right, common stock of Xcel Energy having a
market value equal to twice the exercise price, thereby substantially diluting
the acquiring person’s or group’s investment. The rights may cause substantial
dilution to a person or group that acquires 15 percent or more of Xcel Energy’s
common stock. The rights should not interfere with a transaction that is in the
best interests of Xcel Energy and its shareholders because the rights can be
redeemed prior to a triggering event for $0.01 per right.

10. Benefit
Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

Xcel Energy offers various
benefit plans to its benefit employees. Approximately 56 percent of benefiting
employees are represented by several local labor unions under several
collective-bargaining agreements. At Dec. 31, 2005, NSP-Minnesota had
2,144 and NSP-Wisconsin had 417 bargaining employees covered under a
collective-bargaining agreement, which expires at the end of 2007. PSCo had
2,165 bargaining employees covered under a collective-bargaining agreement,
which expires in May 2006. SPS had 733 bargaining employees covered under
a collective-bargaining agreement, which expires in October 2008.

Pension
Benefits

Xcel Energy has several
noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all employees.
Benefits are based on a combination of years of service, the employee’s average
pay and Social Security benefits.

Xcel Energy’s policy is to
fully fund into an external trust the actuarially determined pension costs
recognized for ratemaking and financial reporting purposes, subject to the
limitations of applicable employee benefit and tax laws.

Pension Plan Assets

—

Plan
assets principally consist of the common stock of public companies, corporate
bonds and U.S. government securities. In 2004, Xcel Energy completed a review
of its pension plan asset allocation and adopted revised asset allocation
targets.  The target range for our
pension asset allocation is 60 percent in equity investments, 20 percent in
fixed income investments and 20 percent in nontraditional investments, such as
real estate, timber ventures, private equity and a diversified commodities
index.

The actual
composition of pension plan assets at Dec. 31 was:

Xcel Energy bases its
investment-return assumption on expected long-term performance for each of the
investment types included in its pension asset portfolio. Xcel Energy considers
the actual historical returns achieved by its asset portfolio over the past
20-year or longer period, as well as the long-term return levels projected and
recommended by investment experts. The historical weighted average annual
return for the past 20 years for the Xcel Energy portfolio of pension
investments is 12.0 percent, which is greater than the current assumption
level. The pension cost determinations assume the continued current mix of
investment types over the long term. The Xcel Energy portfolio is heavily
weighted toward equity securities and includes nontraditional investments that
can provide a higher-than-average return. 
As is the experience in recent years, a higher weighting in equity
investments can increase the volatility in the return levels achieved by
pension assets in any year. Investment returns in 2005,2004 and 2003 exceeded
the assumed level of 8.75, 9.0 and 9.25 percent, respectively.  Xcel Energy continually reviews its pension
assumptions.  In 2006, Xcel Energy will
continue to use an investment-return


assumption of 8.75 percent.

Benefit Obligations

—

A
comparison of the actuarially computed pension-benefit obligation and plan
assets, on a combined basis, is presented in the following table:

(a)

$22.1 million of the 2005 prepaid pension
asset and $23.9 million of the 2004 prepaid pension asset relates to Xcel
Energy’s remaining obligation for companies that are now classified as
discontinued operations.

During 2002, one of Xcel
Energy’s pension plans became underfunded, and at Dec. 31, 2005, had
projected benefit obligations of $739.5 million, which exceeded plan assets of
$609.8 million. All other Xcel Energy plans in the aggregate had plan assets of
$2.5 billion and projected benefit obligations of $2.1 billion on Dec. 31,
2005. A minimum pension liability of $88.3 million was recorded related to the
underfunded plan as of that date. A corresponding reduction in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income, a component of Stockholders’ Equity, also was
recorded, as previously recorded prepaid pension assets were reduced to record
the minimum liability.  Net of the
related deferred income tax effects of the adjustments, total Stockholders’
Equity was reduced by $123.3 million at Dec. 31, 2005, due to the minimum
pension liability for the underfunded plan.

Cash Flows

—

Cash
funding requirements can be impacted by changes to actuarial assumptions,
actual asset levels and other pertinent calculations prescribed by the funding
requirements of income tax and other pension-related regulations. These
regulations did not require cash funding in the years 2003 through 2005 for
Xcel Energy’s pension plans, and are not expected to require cash funding in
2006. PSCo elected to make voluntary contributions to its pension plan for
bargaining employees of $9 million in 2004 and $14.7 million in 2005, Cheyenne
voluntarily contributed $0.9 million to its pension plan


for bargaining employees in
2004 and $0.3 million in 2005 and Xcel Energy voluntarily contributed $5.0
million to the NCE non-bargaining plan in 2005. 
PSCo expects to voluntarily contribute between $15 million and $30
million during 2006 to the pension plan for bargaining employees.

Benefit Costs —

The components of net periodic pension cost (credit) are:

(a)

Includes pension credits related to
discontinued operations of $1.3 million for 2005, $4.7 million for 2004 and
$19.0 million for 2003. The 2003 credit is largely due to a $20.0 million
curtailment gain related to termination of NRG employees as a result of the
divestiture of NRG in December 2003.

Pension costs include an
expected return impact for the current year that may differ from actual
investment performance in the plan. The return assumption used for 2006 pension
cost calculations will be 8.75 percent. The cost calculation uses a
market-related valuation of pension assets, which reduces year-to-year
volatility by recognizing the differences between assumed and actual investment
returns over a five-year period.

Xcel Energy also maintains
noncontributory, defined benefit supplemental retirement income plans for
certain qualifying executive personnel. Benefits for these unfunded plans are
paid out of Xcel Energy’s operating cash flows.

Defined
Contribution Plans

Xcel Energy maintains 401(k)
and other defined contribution plans that cover substantially all employees.
Total contributions to these plans were approximately $19.6 million in
2005,  $21.9 million in 2004 and $15.9
million in 2003.

Postretirement
Health Care Benefits

Xcel Energy has a
contributory health and welfare benefit plan that provides health care and
death benefits to most Xcel Energy retirees. The former NSP discontinued
contributing toward health care benefits for nonbargaining employees retiring
after 1998 and for bargaining employees of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin who
retired after 1999. Xcel Energy discontinued contributing toward health care
benefits for former New Century Energies, Inc. (NCE) nonbargaining employees
retiring after June 30, 2003. Employees of the former NCE who retired in
2002 continue to receive employer-subsidized health care benefits.
Nonbargaining employees of the former NSP who retired after 1998, bargaining
employees of the former NSP who retired after 1999 and nonbargaining employees
of the former NCE who retired after June 30, 2003, are eligible to
participate in the Xcel Energy health care program with no employer subsidy.

In conjunction with the 1993
adoption of SFAS No. 106 — “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pension,” Xcel Energy elected to amortize the unrecognized
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) on a straight-line basis
over 20 years.


Regulatory agencies for
nearly all of Xcel Energy’s retail and wholesale utility customers have allowed
rate recovery of accrued benefit costs under SFAS No. 106.  The Colorado jurisdictional SFAS No. 106
costs deferred during the transition period are being amortized to expense on a
straight-line basis over the 15-year period from 1998 to 2012.  NSP-Minnesota also transitioned to full
accrual accounting for SFAS No. 106 costs, with regulatory differences
fully amortized prior to 1997.

Plan Assets

—

Certain state agencies that regulate Xcel
Energy’s utility subsidiaries also have issued guidelines related to the
funding of SFAS No. 106 costs. SPS is required to fund SFAS No. 106
costs for Texas and New Mexico jurisdictional amounts collected in rates, and
PSCo is required to fund SFAS No. 106 costs in irrevocable external trusts
that are dedicated to the payment of these postretirement benefits.  In 2004, the investment strategy for the
union asset fund was changed to increase the investment mix in equity
funds.  Also, a portion of the assets
contributed on behalf of nonbargaining retirees has been funded into a
sub-account of the Xcel Energy pension plans. 
These assets are invested in a manner consistent with the investment
strategy for the pension plan.

The actual composition of
postretirement benefit plan assets at Dec. 31 was:

Xcel Energy bases its
investment-return assumption for the postretirement health care fund assets on
expected long-term performance for each of the investment types included in its
postretirement health care asset portfolio. 
Investment-return volatility is not considered to be a material factor
in postretirement health care costs.

Benefit Obligations

—

A
comparison of the actuarially computed benefit obligation and plan assets for
Xcel Energy postretirement health care plans that benefit employees of its
utility subsidiaries is presented in the following table:


(a)

$3.1 million of the 2005 accrued benefit
liability and $1.7 million of the 2004 accrued benefit liability relate to Xcel
Energy’s remaining obligation for companies that are now classified as
discontinued operations.

Effective Dec. 31,
2004, Xcel Energy raised its initial medical trend assumption from 6.5 percent
to 9.0 percent and lowered the ultimate trend assumption from 5.5 percent to 5.0
percent.  The period until the ultimate
rate is reached also was increased from two years to six years.  Xcel Energy bases its medical trend
assumption on the long-term cost inflation expected in the health care market,
considering the levels projected and recommended by industry experts, as well
as recent actual medical cost increases experienced by Xcel Energy’s retiree
medical plan.

A 1-percent change in the
assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

Plan Changes -

The employer subsidy for retiree medical coverage was eliminated for
former New Century Energies, Inc. nonbargaining employees who retire after
July 1, 2003.

Xcel Energy’s subsidiary
Viking was sold on Jan. 17, 2003. The sale created a one-time curtailment
gain of $0.8 million. NRG participants withdrew from the retiree life plan,
resulting in a $1.3 million one-time curtailment gain in 2003.

NRG employees’ participation
in the Xcel Energy postretirement health care plan ended when NRG emerged from
bankruptcy on Dec. 5, 2003. A settlement gain of $0.9 million was
recognized.

Cash Flows

—

The
postretirement health care plans have no funding requirements under income tax and
other retirement-related regulations other than fulfilling benefit payment
obligations, when claims are presented and approved under the plans. Additional
cash funding requirements are prescribed by certain state and federal rate
regulatory authorities, as discussed previously.  Xcel Energy expects to contribute
approximately $75 million during 2006.

Benefit Costs

—

The
components of net periodic postretirement benefit costs are:

(a)

Includes amounts related to discontinued
operations of $1.1 million of cost in 2005, $1.3 million of cost in 2004 and
$(1.7) million of cost in 2003.


Projected Benefit Payments

The
following table lists Xcel Energy’s projected benefit payments for the pension
and postretirement benefit plans:

12.
Derivative Instruments

In
the normal course of business, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to
a variety of market risks.  Market risk
is the potential loss that may occur as a result of changes in the market or
fair value of a particular instrument or commodity.  Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries utilize, in
accordance with approved risk management policies, a variety of derivative
instruments to mitigate market risk and to enhance our operations.  The use of these derivative instruments is
discussed in further detail below.

Utility Commodity Price Risk —

Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries are
exposed to commodity price risk in their electric and natural gas
operations.  Commodity price risk is
managed by entering into both long- and short-term physical purchase and sales
contracts for electric capacity, energy and other energy-related products, and
for various fuels used for generation of electricity and in the natural gas
utility operations.  Commodity risk also
is managed through the use of financial derivative instruments.  Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries utilize
these derivative instruments to reduce the volatility in the cost of
commodities acquired on behalf of our retail customers even though regulatory
jurisdiction may provide for a dollar-for-dollar recovery of actual costs.  In these instances, the use of derivative instruments
is done consistently with the state regulatory cost-recovery mechanism.  Xcel Energy’s risk-management policy allows
it to manage market price risk within each rate-regulated operation to the
extent such exposure exists.

Short-Term Wholesale and Commodity
Trading Risk —

Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries conduct various short-term wholesale and
commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of electric
capacity, energy and other energy-related instruments.  These activities are primarily focused on
specific regions where market knowledge and experience have been obtained and
are generally less than one year in length. 
Xcel Energy’s risk-management policy allows management to conduct the
marketing activity within approved guidelines and limitations as approved by
our risk-management committee, which is made up of management personnel not
directly involved in the activities governed by this policy.

Interest Rate Risk —

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are subject
to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of
business.  Xcel Energy’s risk-management
policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed-rate
debt, floating-rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps,
collars and put or call options.


Foreign Currency Exchange Risk —

Due to the discontinuance of NRG and Xcel
Energy International’s operations in 2003, as discussed in Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, Xcel Energy no longer has material foreign
currency exchange risk.

Types of and Accounting for Derivative Instruments

Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries use a number of different derivative instruments in
connection with its utility commodity price, interest rate, short-term
wholesale and commodity trading activities, including forward contracts,
futures, swaps and options.  All
derivative instruments not qualifying for the normal purchases and normal sales
exception, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, are recorded at fair
value. The classification of the fair value for these derivative instruments is
dependent on the designation of a qualifying hedging relationship.  The fair values of derivative instruments not
designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are reflected in current
earnings.  This includes certain
instruments used to mitigate market risk for the utility operations and all
instruments related to the commodity trading operations.  The designation of a cash flow hedge permits
the classification of fair value to be recorded within Other Comprehensive
Income, to the extent effective.  The
designation of a fair value hedge permits a derivative instrument’s gains or
losses to offset the related results of the hedged item in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations, to the extent effective.

SFAS
No. 133, as amended, requires that the hedging relationship be highly
effective and that a company formally designate a hedging relationship to apply
hedge accounting.  Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries formally document hedging relationships, including, among other
factors, the identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged
transaction, as well as the risk-management objectives and strategies for
undertaking the hedged transaction.  Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries also formally assess, both at inception and on an
ongoing basis, if required, whether the derivative instruments being used are
highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows
of the hedged items.

Gains
or losses on hedging transactions for the sales of energy or energy-related
products are primarily recorded as a component of revenue; hedging transactions
for fuel used in energy generation are recorded as a component of fuel costs;
hedging transactions for natural gas purchased for resale are recorded as a
component of natural gas costs; and interest rate hedging transactions are
recorded as a component of interest expense. Certain utility subsidiaries are
allowed to recover in electric or natural gas rates the costs of certain
financial instruments purchased to reduce commodity cost volatility.

Qualifying
hedging relationships are designated as either a hedge of a forecasted
transaction or future cash flow (cash flow hedge), or a hedge of a recognized
asset, liability or firm commitment (fair value hedge).  The types of qualifying hedging transactions
that Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are currently engaged in are discussed
below.

Cash Flow Hedges

The
effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument
qualifying as a cash flow hedge is recognized in Other Comprehensive Income,
and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings.  The
ineffective portion of a derivative instrument’s change in fair value is
recognized in current earnings.

Commodity Cash Flow Hedges

—

Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries enter
into derivative instruments to manage variability of future cash flows from
changes in commodity prices.  These derivative
instruments are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.  At Dec. 31, 2005, Xcel Energy had
various commodity-related contracts classified as cash flow hedges extending
through 2009.  The fair value of these
cash flow hedges is recorded in either Other Comprehensive Income or deferred
as a regulatory asset or liability. This classification is based on the
regulatory recovery mechanisms in place.  Amounts deferred in these
accounts are recorded in earnings as the hedged purchase or sales transaction
is settled. This could include the purchase or sale of energy or energy-related
products, the use of natural gas to generate electric energy or gas purchased
for resale.

As
of Dec. 31, 2005, Xcel Energy had no amounts in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income related to commodity cash flow hedge contracts that are
expected to be recognized in earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged
transactions settle.

Xcel
Energy had no ineffectiveness related to commodity cash flow hedges during the
years ended Dec. 31, 2005 and 2004.

Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges

—

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries enter into interest
rate swap instruments that effectively


fix the interest payments on certain floating-rate debt
obligations.  These derivative
instruments are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.

As of Dec. 31,
2005, Xcel Energy had net losses related to interest rate swaps of
approximately $0.8 million in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income that it
expects to recognize in earnings during the next 12 months.

Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries also enter into interest rate lock agreements,
including treasury-rate locks and forward starting swaps, that effectively fix
the yield or price on a specified treasury security for a specific period.  These derivative instruments are designated
as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.

As
of Dec. 31, 2005, Xcel Energy had net gains related to settled interest
rate lock agreements of approximately $1.4 million in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income that it expects to recognize in earnings during the next
12 months.

Xcel Energy had no
ineffectiveness related to interest rate cash flow hedges during the years
ended Dec. 31, 2005 and 2004.

Financial Impact of Qualifying Cash Flow Hedges

—

The impact of qualifying cash flow hedges on Xcel
Energy’s Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, included in the Consolidated
Statements of Stockholders’ Equity, is detailed in the following table:

Fair Value Hedges

The effective
portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument qualifying
as a fair value hedge is offset against the change in the fair value of the
underlying asset, liability or firm commitment being hedged.  That is, fair value hedge accounting allows
the gains or losses of the derivative instrument to offset, in the same period,
the gains and losses of the hedged item. 
The ineffective portion of a derivative instrument’s change in fair
value is recognized in current earnings.

Interest Rate Fair Value Hedges

—

Xcel Energy enters into interest rate swap
instruments that effectively hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt.  The fair market value of Xcel Energy’s
interest rate swaps at Dec. 31, 2005, was a liability of approximately
$14.1 million.

Normal
Purchases or Normal Sales Contracts

Xcel Energy’s
utility subsidiaries enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of various
commodities for use in their business operations.  SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires a
company to evaluate these contracts to determine whether the contracts are
derivatives.  Certain contracts that
literally meet the definition of a derivative may be exempted from SFAS No. 133,
as amended, as normal purchases or normal sales.  Normal purchases and normal sales are
contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of something other than a
financial instrument or derivative instrument that will be delivered in
quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal
course of business.  In addition, normal
purchases and normal sales contracts must have a price based on an underlying
that is clearly and closely related to the asset being purchased or sold.  An underlying is a specified interest rate,
security price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or
rates, or other variable, including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a
specified event, such as a scheduled payment under a contract.

Xcel Energy
evaluates all of its contracts when such contracts are entered to determine if
they are derivatives and, if so, if they qualify to meet the normal designation
requirements under SFAS No. 133, as amended.  None of the contracts entered into within the
commodity trading operations qualify for a normal designation.


Normal purchases
and normal sales contracts are accounted for as executory contracts as required
under GAAP.

The following
discussion briefly describes the use of derivative commodity and financial
instruments at Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, and discloses the respective
fair values at Dec. 31, 2005 and 2004.

Commodity Trading Instruments

— At Dec. 31, 2005 and 2004, the
fair value of commodity trading contracts was $3.9 million and $0.0 million,
respectively.

Hedging Contracts

— The fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges at Dec. 31,
2005 and 2004 was $4.1 million and $(24.6) million, respectively.

Financial Instruments

—

Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries had interest rate swaps outstanding with a fair
value that was a liability of approximately $44.7 million at Dec. 31,
2005.  On Dec. 31, 2004, subsidiaries
of Xcel Energy had interest rate swaps outstanding with a fair value that was a
liability of approximately $30 million.

13.  Financial Instruments

The estimated Dec. 31
fair values of Xcel Energy’s financial instruments, separately identifying
amounts that are within continuing operations and within discontinued
operations, are as follows:

The fair value of cash and
cash equivalents, notes and accounts receivable and notes and accounts payable
are not materially different from their carrying amounts because of the
short-term nature of these instruments or because the stated rates approximate
market rates.  The fair values of Xcel
Energy’s debt securities in an external nuclear decommissioning fund and other
investments are estimated based on quoted market prices for those or similar
investments. The fair values of Xcel Energy’s long-term debt is estimated based
on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues, or the current
rates for debt of the same remaining maturities and credit quality.

The fair value estimates
presented are based on information available to management as of Dec. 31,
2005 and 2004. These fair value estimates have not been comprehensively
revalued for purposes of these Consolidated Financial Statements since that
date, and current estimates of fair values may differ significantly.

The following tables provide
the external decommissioning fund’s approximate gains, losses and proceeds from
the sale of securities for the years ended Dec. 31:

guarantees issued by Xcel Energy guarantee payment or performance by its
subsidiaries under specified agreements or transactions. As a result, Xcel
Energy’s exposure under the guarantees is based upon the net liability of the
relevant subsidiary under the specified agreements or transactions. Most of the
guarantees issued by Xcel Energy limit the exposure of Xcel Energy to a maximum


amount stated in the
guarantee. Unless otherwise indicated below, the guarantees require no
liability to be recorded, contain no recourse provisions and require no
collateral.

On Dec. 31, 2005, Xcel
Energy had the following amount of guarantees and exposure under these
guarantees, including those related to Seren and Xcel Energy Argentina, which
are components of discontinued operations:

(a)

The total exposure of this indemnification
cannot be determined.  Xcel Energy
believes the exposure to be significantly less than the total amount of the
outstanding bonds.

(b)

Nonperformance and/or nonpayment.

(c)

Losses caused by default in performance of
covenants or breach of any warranty or representation in the purchase
agreement.

(d)

Includes one performance bond with a notional
amount of $11.1 million that guarantees the performance of Planergy Housing
Inc., a subsidiary of Xcel Energy that was sold to Ameresco Inc. on Dec. 12,
2003. Ameresco Inc. has agreed to indemnify Xcel Energy for any liability
arising out of any surety bond.

(e)

Failure of Xcel Energy or one of its
subsidiaries to perform under the agreement that is the subject of the relevant
bond. In addition, per the indemnity agreement between Xcel Energy and the
various surety companies, the surety companies have the discretion to demand
that collateral be posted.

(f)

Non-timely payment of the obligations or at
the time the debtor becomes the subject of bankruptcy or other insolvency
proceedings.

(g)

Security interest in underlying receivable
agreements.

(h)

Xcel Energy agreed to indemnify an insurance
company in connection with surety bonds they may issue or have issued for
Utility Engineering up to $80 million. The Xcel Energy indemnification will be
triggered only in the event that Utility Engineering has failed to meet its
obligations to the surety company.


Letters of
Credit

Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries use letters of credit, generally with terms of one year, to
provide financial guarantees for certain operating obligations. At Dec. 31,
2005, there was $35.2 million of letters of credit outstanding. The contract
amounts of these letters of credit approximate their fair value and are subject
to fees determined in the marketplace.

Commitments and
Contingencies

Commitments

Legislative Resource Commitments —

In 1994, NSP-Minnesota received Minnesota
legislative approval for on-site temporary spent-fuel storage facilities at its
Prairie Island nuclear power plant, provided NSP-Minnesota satisfies certain
requirements.  Commitments related to the
17 dry cask storage containers approved in 1994 have been fulfilled.  As the result of legislative amendments in
2003, NSP-Minnesota is authorized to use as many dry cask storage containers as
necessary to operate the plant through 2014. 
Current estimates indicate that this will require 29 dry cask storage
containers.  As of Dec. 31, 2005,
NSP-Minnesota had filled and placed 20 dry cask containers in storage at
Prairie Island.

The 2003 legislation
transfers the primary authority concerning future spent-fuel storage issues
from the Legislature to the MPUC.  In January 2005,
NSP-Minnesota filed an application with the MPUC for a certificate of need for
up to 30 dry cask storage containers at the Monticello nuclear plant so that it
can continue to operate beyond 2010. 
Xcel Energy expects a decision from the MPUC later this year.  NSP-Minnesota also filed its request with the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on March 24, 2005, for a 20-year
extension to Monticello’s operating license. 
If a certificate of need is granted, it is stayed until the following June to
provide the Minnesota Legislature the opportunity to review the MPUC’s action
if it is determined appropriate.  The
2003 legislation also requires NSP-Minnesota to add at least 300 megawatts of
additional wind power by 2010, with an option to own 100 megawatts of this
power.

Furthermore, payments during
the remaining operating life of the Prairie Island plant are required. These
payments include: $2.25 million per year to the Prairie Island Tribal Community
beginning in 2004; 5 percent of NSP-Minnesota’s conservation program
expenditures (estimated at $2 million per year) to the University of Minnesota
for renewable energy research; and an increase in funding commitments to the
previously established Renewable Development Fund to $16 million per year
beginning in 2003.  All of the cost
increases to NSP-Minnesota from these required payments and funding commitments
are expected to be recoverable in Minnesota retail customer rates, mainly
through existing cost-recovery mechanisms. Funding commitments to the Renewable
Development Fund would terminate after the Prairie Island plant discontinues
operation unless the MPUC determines that NSP-Minnesota failed to make a good
faith effort to store or dispose of the spent fuel out of state, in which case
NSP-Minnesota would have to make payments in the amount of $7.5 million per
year.

Capital Commitments —

The estimated cost as of Dec. 31, 2005, of the capital expenditure
programs and other capital requirements of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries is
approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, $1.6 billion in 2007 and $1.4 billion in
2008.

The capital expenditure
programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification.
Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to
changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, the desired reserve
margin and the availability of purchased power, as well as alternative plans
for meeting Xcel Energy’s long-term energy needs. In addition, Xcel Energy’s
ongoing evaluation of compliance with future requirements to install
emission-control equipment, and merger, acquisition and divestiture
opportunities to support corporate strategies may impact actual capital requirements.

Leases —

Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries lease a variety of equipment and facilities used in
the normal course of business. Two of these leases qualify as capital leases
and are accounted for accordingly.  The
capital leases contractually expire in 2025 and 2029.  The assets and liabilities acquired under
capital leases are recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present
value of future lease payments, and are depreciated over their actual contract
term in accordance with practices allowed by regulators.  Depreciation of assets under capital leases
is included in depreciation expense for 2005 and 2004.


Following is a summary of
property held under capital leases:

The remainder of the leases,
primarily for office space, railcars, trucks, cars and power-operated
equipment, are accounted for as operating leases. Rental expense under
operating lease obligations for continuing operations was approximately $57.2
million, $57.5 million and $65.0 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Future commitments under
operating and capital leases for continuing operations are:

Technology Agreement —

Xcel Energy has a contract that extends through 2015 with International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) for information technology services. The contract
is cancelable at our option, although there are financial penalties for early
termination. In 2005, Xcel Energy paid IBM $137.7 million under the contract
and $3.5 million for other project business. The contract also has a committed
minimum payment each year from 2006 through September 2015.

Fuel Contracts —

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries have contracts providing for the
purchase and delivery of a significant portion of its current coal, nuclear
fuel and natural gas requirements. These contracts expire in various years
between 2006 and 2027. In total, Xcel Energy is committed to the minimum
purchase of approximately $2.8 billion of coal, $117.6 million of nuclear fuel
and $2.7 billion of natural gas, including $1.0 billion of natural gas storage
and transportation, or to make payments in lieu thereof, under these contracts.
In addition, Xcel Energy is required to pay additional amounts depending on
actual quantities shipped under these agreements. Xcel Energy’s risk of loss,
in the form of increased costs from market price changes in fuel, is mitigated
through the use of natural gas and energy cost rate adjustment mechanisms,
which provide for pass-through of most fuel, storage and transportation costs
to customers.

Purchased Power Agreements —

The utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy have
entered into agreements with utilities and other energy suppliers for purchased
power to meet system load and energy requirements, replace generation from
company-owned units under maintenance and during outages, and meet operating
reserve obligations. NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS have various
pay-for-performance contracts with expiration dates through the year 2033. In
general, these contracts provide for capacity payments, subject to meeting
certain contract obligations, and energy payments based on actual power taken
under the contracts. Certain contractual payment obligations are adjusted based
on indexes.  However, the effects of
price adjustments are mitigated through cost-of-energy rate adjustment
mechanisms.

At Dec. 31, 2005, the
estimated future payments for capacity that the utility subsidiaries of Xcel
Energy are obligated to purchase, subject to availability, are as follows:


Environmental
Contingencies

Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries have been, or are currently involved with, the cleanup of
contamination from certain hazardous substances at several sites. In many
situations, the subsidiary involved is pursuing or intends to pursue insurance
claims and believes it will recover some portion of these costs through such
claims. Additionally, where applicable, the subsidiary involved is pursuing, or
intends to pursue, recovery from other potentially responsible parties and
through the rate regulatory process.  New
and changing federal and state environmental mandates can also create added
financial liabilities for Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, which are normally
recovered through the rate regulatory process. 
To the extent any costs are not recovered through the options listed
above, Xcel Energy would be required to recognize an expense for such
unrecoverable amounts in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Site Remediation —

Xcel Energy must pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate sites
where past activities of its subsidiaries and some other parties have caused
environmental contamination. 
Environmental contingencies could arise from various situations,
including the following categories of sites:

•

The site of a former federal uranium enrichment
facility;

•

Sites of former manufactured gas plants
(MGPs) operated by Xcel Energy subsidiaries or predecessors; and

•

Third-party
sites, such as landfills, to which Xcel Energy is alleged to be a potentially
responsible party (PRP) that sent hazardous materials and wastes.

Xcel Energy records a
liability when enough information is obtained to develop an estimate of the
cost of environmental remediation and revises the estimate as information is
received. The estimated remediation cost may vary materially.

To estimate the cost to
remediate these sites, assumptions are made when facts are not fully known. For
instance, assumptions may be made about the nature and extent of site
contamination, the extent of required cleanup efforts, costs of alternative
cleanup methods and pollution-control technologies, the period over which
remediation will be performed and paid for, changes in environmental
remediation and pollution-control requirements, the potential effect of
technological improvements, the number and financial strength of other PRPs and
the identification of new environmental cleanup sites.

Estimates are revised as
facts become known.  At Dec. 31,
2005, the liability for the cost of remediating these sites was estimated to be
$27.8 million, of which $8.8 million was considered to be a current liability.
Some of the cost of remediation may be recovered from:

•

Insurance coverage;

•

Other parties that have contributed to the
contamination; and

•

Customers.

Neither the total
remediation cost nor the final method of cost allocation among all PRPs of the
unremediated sites has been determined. 
Estimates have been recorded for Xcel Energy’s future costs for these
sites.

Federal Uranium Enrichment
Facility

Approximately $0.5 million
of the long-term liability and $4.8 million of the current liability relate to
a DOE assessment to NSP-Minnesota and PSCo for decommissioning a federal
uranium enrichment facility. These environmental liabilities do not include
accruals recorded and collected from customers in rates for future nuclear fuel
disposal costs or decommissioning costs related to NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear
generating plants. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion of nuclear obligations.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

Ashland Manufactured Gas Plant Site

— NSP-Wisconsin was named a PRP for creosote
and coal tar contamination at a site in Ashland, Wis. The Ashland site includes
property owned by NSP-Wisconsin, which was previously an MGP facility, and two
other properties: an adjacent city lakeshore park area, on which an
unaffiliated third party previously operated a sawmill, and an area of Lake
Superior’s Chequemegon Bay adjoining the park.


As an interim action,
NSP-Wisconsin proposed, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
(WDNR) approved, a coal tar removal and groundwater treatment system for one
area of concern at the site for which NSP-Wisconsin has accepted
responsibility.  The groundwater treatment
system began operating in the fall of 2000. 
In 2002, NSP-Wisconsin installed additional monitoring wells in the deep
aquifer under the former MGP site to better characterize the extent and degree
of contaminants in that aquifer while the coal tar removal system is
operational.  In 2002, a second interim
response action was also implemented.  As
approved by the WDNR, this interim response action involved the removal and
capping of a seep area in a city park. 
Surface soils in the area of the seep were contaminated with tar
residues.  The interim action also
included the diversion and ongoing treatment of groundwater that contributed to
the formation of the seep.

On Sept. 5, 2002, the
Ashland site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL).  The NPL is intended primarily to guide the
United States EPA in determining which sites require further
investigation.  On Dec. 7, 2004, the
EPA approved, with minor contingencies, NSP-Wisconsin’s proposed work plan to
complete the remedial investigation and feasibility study.  On Feb. 1, 2005, NSP-Wisconsin submitted
its revised work plan to the EPA addressing all of the contingencies raised
with the previous proposal.  The final
approval results in specific delineation of the investigative fieldwork and
scientific assessments that must be performed.  A determination of the scope and cost of the
remediation of the Ashland site is not currently expected until 2007 or
2008.  NSP-Wisconsin continues to work
with the WDNR to access state and federal funds to apply to the ultimate
remediation cost of the entire site.  In
2005, NSP-Wisconsin spent $2.8 million in the development of the work plan, the
interim response action and other matters related to the site.

The WDNR and NSP-Wisconsin
have each developed several estimates of the ultimate cost to remediate the
Ashland site.  The estimates vary
significantly, between $4 million and $93 million, because different methods of
remediation and different results are assumed in each.  The EPA and WDNR have not yet selected the
method of remediation to use at the site. 
Until the EPA and the WDNR select a remediation strategy for the entire
site and determine NSP-Wisconsin’s level of responsibility, NSP-Wisconsin’s
liability for the cost of remediating the Ashland site is not
determinable.  NSP-Wisconsin has recorded
a liability of $19.7 million for its potential liability for remediating the
Ashland site.  Since NSP-Wisconsin cannot
currently estimate the cost of remediating the Ashland site, the recorded
liability is based upon the minimum of the estimated range of remediation
costs, using information available to date and reasonably effective remedial
methods.

On July 2, 2004, the
WDNR sent NSP-Wisconsin an invoice for recovery of past costs incurred at the
Ashland site between 1994 and March 2003 in the amount of $1.4
million.  On Oct. 19, 2004, the
WDNR, represented by the Wisconsin Department of Justice, filed a lawsuit in
Wisconsin state court for reimbursement of the past costs.  This lawsuit has been stayed until further
action by either party.  NSP-Wisconsin is
reviewing the invoice to determine whether all costs charged are appropriate
and has recorded an estimate of its potential liability.  All appropriate insurance carriers have been
notified of the WDNR’s invoice and the lawsuit, and will be invited to
participate in any future efforts to address the WDNR’s actions.  All costs paid to the WDNR are expected to be
recoverable in rates.

In addition to potential
liability for remediation and WDNR oversight costs, NSP-Wisconsin may have
liability for natural resource damages, including the assessment thereof
(collectively NRDA) at the Ashland site. 
Section 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended, provides that a natural
resource damages trustee may recover for injury to, destruction or loss of
natural resources, including the reasonable costs of assessment, resulting from
releases of hazardous substances. 
Similarly, Section 311 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
(or Clean Water Act) provides the federal and state governments with the
ability to recover costs incurred in the restoration or replacement of natural
resources damaged or destroyed as a result of a hazardous substance discharge.  In addition to liability for injuries to or
loss of services caused by a release from the Ashland site, NSP-Wisconsin could
face exposure for additional indirect injuries that could result from the
implementation of various remedial technologies during the cleanup phase of the
project.  NSP-Wisconsin has indicated to
the relevant natural resource trustees its intent to pursue a cooperative
assessment approach to the NRDA for the Ashland site whereby the question of
natural resource damages is assessed and resolved in tandem with the studies
required for selection of a cleanup remedy or remedies.  It is, however, unknown at this time whether
a cooperative assessment NRDA approach will be adopted at the Ashland site.  Therefore, NSP-Wisconsin is not able to
estimate its potential exposure for natural resource damages at the site, but
has recorded an estimate of its potential liability based upon the minimum of
its estimated range of potential exposure.

NSP-Wisconsin has deferred,
as a regulatory asset, the costs accrued for the Ashland site based on an
expectation that the PSCW will continue to allow NSP-Wisconsin to recover
payments for environmental remediation from its customers.  The PSCW has consistently authorized recovery
in NSP-Wisconsin rates of all remediation costs incurred at the Ashland site,
and has authorized recovery of similar remediation costs for other Wisconsin
utilities.  External MGP remediation
costs are subject to deferral in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction and are
reviewed for prudence as part of the Wisconsin biennial retail rate case
process.  Once approved by the PSCW,
deferred MGP remediation costs, less carrying costs, are historically amortized
over four or six years.  Carrying costs
vary directly with the balance in the deferred account and for the period
1995-2005 are estimated to total approximately $1.8 million.


In
addition, in 2003, the Wisconsin Supreme Court rendered a ruling that reopens
the possibility that NSP-Wisconsin may be able to recover a portion of the
remediation costs from its insurance carriers.  
Any insurance proceeds received by NSP-Wisconsin will operate as a
credit to ratepayers.

Fort Collins Manufactured Gas Plant Site

—

Prior to 1926, Poudre Valley Gas Co., a
predecessor of PSCo, operated an MGP in Fort Collins, Colo., not far from the
Cache la Poudre River. In 1926, after acquiring the Poudre Valley Gas Co., PSCo
shut down the MGP site and has sold most of the property.  An oily substance similar to MGP byproducts was
discovered in the Cache la Poudre River. 
On Nov. 10, 2004, PSCo entered into an agreement with the EPA, the
city of Fort Collins and Schrader Oil Co., under which PSCo performed
remediation and monitoring work.  PSCo
has substantially completed work at the site, with the exception of ongoing
maintenance and monitoring.  In May 2005,
PSCo filed a natural gas rate case with the CPUC requesting recovery of cleanup
costs at the Fort Collins MGP plant spent through March 2005, which
amounted to $6.2 million to be amortized over four years.  Xcel Energy reached a settlement agreement
with the parties in the case.  The CPUC
approved the settlement agreement on Jan. 19, 2006 and the final order
became effective on Feb. 3, 2006, with rates effective Feb. 6, 2006.

In
April 2005, PSCo brought a contribution action against Schrader Oil Co.
and related parties alleging Schrader Oil Co. released hazardous substances
into the environment and these releases increased the migration and
environmental impact of the MGP byproducts at the site.  PSCo requested damages, including a portion
of the costs PSCo incurred to investigate and remove contaminated sediments
from the Cache la Poudre River.  On Dec. 14,
2005, the court denied Schrader’s request to dismiss the PSCo suit.  On Jan. 3, 2006, Schrader filed a
response to the PSCo complaint and a counterclaim against PSCo for its response
costs under the CERCLA and under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA).  Schrader has alleged as part of
its counterclaim an “imminent and substantial endangerment” of its property as
defined by RCRA.  PSCo believes the
allegations with respect to PSCo are without merit and will vigorously defend
itself.

Third Party and Other Environmental
Site Remediation

Asbestos Removal

—

Some of our facilities contain asbestos. Most
asbestos will remain undisturbed until the facilities that contain it are
demolished or renovated.  Xcel Energy has
recorded an estimate for final removal of the asbestos as an asset retirement
obligation.  See additional discussion of
asset retirement obligations elsewhere in Note 14.  It may be necessary to remove some asbestos
to perform maintenance or make improvements to other equipment. The cost of
removing asbestos as part of other work is immaterial and is recorded as
incurred as operating expenses for maintenance projects, capital expenditures
for construction projects or removal costs for demolition projects

Leyden Gas Storage Facility

— In February 2001, the CPUC approved
PSCo’s plan to abandon the Leyden natural gas storage facility (Leyden) after
40 years of operation.  In July 2001,
the CPUC decided that the recovery of all Leyden costs would be addressed in a
future rate proceeding when all costs were known.  In 2003, PSCo began flooding the facility with
water, as part of an overall plan to convert Leyden into a municipal water
storage facility owned and operated by the city of Arvada, Colo.  In August 2003, the Colorado Oil and Gas
Conservation Commission (COGCC) approved the closure plan, the last formal
regulatory approval necessary before conversion.  On Dec. 31, 2005, PSCo’s leases of the
Leyden properties were terminated and the city of Arvada took custody of the
facility.  PSCo is obligated to monitor
the site for two years after closure. As of Dec. 31, 2005, PSCo has
incurred approximately $5.7 million of costs associated with engineering buffer
studies, damage claims paid to landowners and other initial closure costs.  PSCo has accrued an additional $0.2 million
of costs expected to be incurred through 2006 to complete the decommissioning
and closure of the facility.  PSCo has
deferred these costs as a regulatory asset. 
In May 2005, PSCo filed a natural gas rate case with the CPUC
requesting recovery of the Leyden costs totaling $4.8 million to be amortized
over four years.  Xcel Energy has reached
a settlement agreement with the parties in the case.  The CPUC approved the settlement agreement on
Jan. 19, 2006, and the final order became effective on Feb. 3,
2006.  Xcel Energy believes that the additional
$0.9 million of costs incurred may be recovered in a future case.

In
December 2003, a homeowners’ association petitioned the EPA to assess the
threat of a natural gas release from the Leyden facility pursuant to Section 105(d) of
the CERCLA.  The EPA completed its review
in October 2004 and concluded that the risk to nearby residents is
relatively low.  The EPA referred the
matter to its RCRA program.  On Nov. 24,
2004, the EPA sent a letter to the COGCC requesting that the COGCC contact Xcel
Energy and request certain information concerning the closure.  To date no formal request has been received
by PSCo.

On
Aug. 17, 2005, the EPA requested information from PSCo regarding the
compliance status of the Leyden facility under the federal Clean Air Act
(CAA).  On Sept. 19, 2005, PSCo responded
to the requests for information. PSCo believes the


Leyden
facility is in compliance with the CAA and other applicable state and federal
environmental laws.  Xcel Energy cannot
predict the ultimate outcome of this inquiry, however, any consequence is not
expected to have a material impact.

Polychlorinated
Biphenyl (PCB) Storage and Disposal

—

In August 2004,
SPS received notice from the EPA contending SPS violated PCB storage and
disposal regulations with respect to storage of a drained transformer and
related solids. The EPA contends the fine for the alleged violation is
approximately $1.2 million. SPS is contesting the fine and is in discussions
with the EPA.

Cunningham Station
Groundwater

— Cunningham Station is a natural
gas-fired power plant constructed in the 1960s by SPS and has 28 water wells
installed on its water rights.  The well
field provides water for boiler makeup, cooling water and potable water.  Following an acid release in 2002,
groundwater samples revealed elevated concentrations of inorganic salt
compounds not related to the release. The contamination was identified in wells
located near the plant buildings.  The
source of contamination is thought to be leakage from ponds that receive blow
down water from the plant.  In response
to a request by the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED), SPS prepared a
corrective action plan to address the groundwater contamination.  Under the plan submitted to the NMED, SPS
agreed to control leakage from the plant blow down ponds through construction
of a new lined pond, additional irrigation areas to minimize percolation, and
installation of additional wells to monitor groundwater quality.  On June 23, 2005, NMED issued a letter
approving the corrective action plan. 
The action plan is subject to continued compliance with New Mexico
regulations and oversight by the NMED. 
These actions, which are considered future improvements, are estimated
to cost approximately $3.8 million through 2008 and will be capitalized or
expensed as incurred.

Other Environmental
Requirements

Clean Air Interstate
and Mercury Rules

- In March 2005, the
EPA issued two significant new air quality rules.  The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR)
further regulates sulfur dioxide (SO


) and
nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, and the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) regulates
mercury emissions from power plants for the first time.

The objective of the CAIR is to cap emissions of SO


and NOx in the
eastern United States, including Minnesota, Texas and Wisconsin, which are
within Xcel Energy’s service territory. 
Xcel Energy generating facilities in other states are not affected.  When fully implemented, CAIR will reduce SO


emissions in 28
eastern states and the District of Columbia by over 70 percent, and NOx
emissions by over 60 percent from 2003 levels. It is designed to address the
transportation of fine particulates, ozone and emission precursors to
nonattainment downwind states.  CAIR has
a two-phase compliance schedule, beginning in 2009 for NOx and 2010 for SO


, with a final compliance deadline in 2015 for both
emissions.  Under CAIR, each affected
state will be allocated an emissions budget for SO


and NO

X

that will result in significant emission
reductions.  It will be based on
stringent emission controls and forms the basis for a cap-and-trade program.   State emission budgets or caps decline over
time.  States can choose to implement an
emissions reduction program based on the EPA’s proposed model program, or they
can propose another method, which the EPA would need to approve.

On July 11,
2005, SPS, the City of Amarillo, Texas and Occidental Permian LTD filed a
lawsuit against the EPA and a request for reconsideration with the agency to
exclude West Texas from the CAIR.  El
Paso Electric Co. joined in the request for reconsideration.

Xcel Energy and SPS advocated that West Texas should
be excluded from CAIR because it does not contribute significantly to
nonattainment with the fine particulate matter National Ambient Air Quality
Standard in any downwind jurisdiction. 
They argued that:

•

Emissions
from plants located in the Texas panhandle are more than 1,000 kilometers away
from cities like Chicago, St. Louis and Indianapolis and have no measurable
impact on their air quality.

•

The
EPA should not arbitrarily include the entire state of Texas in the rule. As a
result of its size, there are significant differences in the air quality impact
of plants in the different regions of Texas.

•

The
EPA has precedent for dividing the state into two regions.  As part of the Texas Air Quality strategy,
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality split the state and imposed
different requirements on West Texas. 
The Bush administration adopted a similar approach in its proposed Clear
Skies Act.

•

The
EPA excluded Oklahoma and Kansas from CAIR, but imposes CAIR’s burdens on
plants in West Texas.  Emissions from
West Texas must pass through Oklahoma and Kansas — and over power plants in
those states that are not subject to the rule — before reaching the
downwind cities the rule is designed to protect.

Under CAIR’s cap-and-trade structure, SPS can comply through capital
investments in emission controls or purchase of emission “allowances” from
other utilities making reductions on their systems.  Based on the preliminary analysis of various


scenarios of capital investment and allowance purchase, capital
investments could range from $30 million to $300 million, and allowance
purchases or increased operating and maintenance expenses could range from $20
million to $30 million per year, beginning in 2011 based on the cost of
allowance on Feb. 15, 2006.  This
does not include other costs that SPS will have to incur to comply with the EPA’s
new mercury emission control regulations, which will apply to SPS’ plants.

In addition, Minnesota and Wisconsin will be included in CAIR, and Xcel
Energy has generating facilities in these states that will be impacted.  Preliminary estimates of capital expenditures
associated with compliance with CAIR in Minnesota and Wisconsin range from $30
million to $40 million.  Xcel Energy is
not challenging CAIR in these states.

These cost
estimates represent one potential scenario on complying with CAIR, if West
Texas is not excluded.  There is
uncertainty concerning implementation of CAIR. 
States are required to develop implementation plans within 18 months of
the issuance of the new rules and have a significant amount of discretion
in the implementation details.  Legal
challenges to CAIR rules could alter their requirements and/or
schedule.  The uncertainty associated with
the final CAIR rules makes it difficult to project the ultimate amount and
timing of capital expenditures and operating expenses.

While Xcel Energy
expects to comply with the new rules through a combination of additional
capital investments in emission controls at various facilities and purchases of
emission allowances, it is continuing to review the alternatives.  Xcel Energy believes the cost of any required
capital investment or allowance purchases will be recoverable from customers.

The EPA’s CAMR also uses a national cap-and-trade system and is
designed to achieve a 70 percent reduction in mercury emissions.  It affects all coal- and oil-fired generating
units across the country that are greater than 25 megawatts.  Compliance with this rule also occurs in
two phases, with the first phase beginning in 2010 and the second phase in
2018.  States will be allocated mercury
allowances based on coal type and their baseline heat input relative to other
states.  Each electric generating unit
will be allocated mercury allowances based on its percentage of total coal heat
input for the state.  Similar to CAIR,
states can choose to implement an emissions reduction program based on the EPA’s
proposed model program, or they can propose another method, which the EPA would
need to approve.

Under CAMR, Xcel Energy can comply through capital investments in
emission controls or purchase of emission “allowances” from other utilities
making reductions on their systems. Estimating the cost of compliance with CAMR
is difficult because technologies specifically designed for control of mercury
are in the early stages of development and there is no established market on
which to base the cost of mercury allowances. 
Xcel Energy’s preliminary analysis for phase I compliance suggests
capital costs of approximately $20 million and increased operating and
maintenance expense ranging between $10 million and $20 million, beginning in
2010.  Further testing is planned during
2006 to confirm these costs or determine whether different measures will be
necessary, which could result in higher costs. 
Additional costs will be incurred to meet phase II requirements in
2018.

The Minnesota Legislature is expected to consider
legislation in the 2006 session that could require up to a 90 percent reduction
in mercury emissions from coal-fueled power plants provided the MPUC determines
that it is technically feasible and economically reasonable to do so.  The cost impact of this potential legislation
is unknown.  The legislation is expected
to allow for cost recovery by the utility.

Regional Haze Rules

—
On June 15, 2005, the EPA finalized amendments to the July 1999
regional haze rules. These amendments apply to the provisions of the regional
haze rule that require emission controls, known as best available retrofit
technology (BART), for industrial facilities emitting air pollutants that
reduce visibility by causing or contributing to regional haze.  Xcel Energy generating facilities in several
states will be subject to BART requirements. 
Some of these facilities are located in regions where CAIR is
effective.  CAIR has precedence over
BART.  Therefore, BART requirements will
be deemed to be met through compliance with CAIR requirements.

States must develop their implementation plans by December 2007.
States will identify the facilities that will have to reduce emissions under
BART and then set BART emissions limits for those facilities.  Colorado is the first state in Xcel Energy’s
region to earnestly begin its BART rule development as the first step
toward the December 2007 deadline. 
Xcel Energy is actively involved in the stakeholder process in Colorado
and will also be involved as other states begin their process.  Due to the uncertainties of the many
decisions involved in this process, Xcel Energy is not able to estimate the
cost impact at this time.

Federal Clean Water Act

—
The federal Clean Water Act addresses the environmental impact of cooling water
intakes. In July 2004, the EPA published phase II of the rule that
applies to existing cooling water intakes at steam-electric power plants. The rule will
require Xcel Energy to perform additional environmental studies at several
power plants in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Colorado to determine the impact the
facilities may be having on aquatic organisms vulnerable to injury. If


the studies determine the plants are not
meeting the new performance standards established by the phase II rule,
physical and/or operational changes may be required at these plants. It is not
possible to provide an accurate estimate of the overall cost of this rulemaking
at this time due to the many uncertainties involved, including unresolved third-party
legal challenges to the federal rule. Preliminary cost estimates range from
less than $1 million at some plants to more than $10 million at others,
depending on site-specific circumstances. Based on the limited information
available, total capital and operating and maintenance costs to Xcel Energy are
estimated at approximately $30 million over the next five to 10 years. Actual
costs may be higher or lower depending on the final resolution of legal
challenges to the rule, as well as pending state and federal decisions
regarding interpretation of specific rule requirements.

PSCo Notice of Violation

—On July 1, 2002, PSCo received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA
alleging violations of the New Source Review (NSR) requirements of the CAA at
the Comanche and Pawnee plants in Colorado. The NOV specifically alleges that
various maintenance, repair and replacement projects undertaken at the plants
in the mid- to late-1990s should have required a permit under the NSR
process.  PSCo believes it has acted in
full compliance with the CAA and NSR process. It believes that the projects
identified in the NOV fit within the routine maintenance, repair and
replacement exemption contained within the NSR regulations or are otherwise not
subject to the NSR requirements. PSCo also believes that the projects would be
expressly authorized under the EPA’s NSR equipment replacement rulemaking
promulgated in October 2003. On Dec. 24, 2003, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit stayed this rule while it
considers challenges to it. PSCo disagrees with the assertions contained in the
NOV and intends to vigorously defend its position. As required by the CAA, the
EPA met with Xcel Energy in September 2002 to discuss the NOV.

On March 10, 2005, the Rocky Mountain Environmental Labor
Coalition (RMELC) provided notice to PSCo of its intent to sue PSCo for alleged
violations of the CAA at the Comanche plant. 
The notice of intent to sue alleges PSCo has violated the CAA’s
Prevention of Significant Deterioration regulations based on allegations that
maintenance, repair and replacement projects undertaken at the plants in the
mid- to late-1990s should have required a permit under the NSR process.  The allegations are the same as those
presented in the NOV.  On June 9,
2005, Citizens for Clean Air and Water in Pueblo/Southern Colorado (CCAP) and
Leslie Glustrom provided notice of intent to sue PSCo for alleged violations of
the CAA at the Comanche Plant.  The
allegations in the notice of intent to sue by CCAP and Ms. Glustrom are
substantially identical to those of RMELC. 
PSCo believes the allegations with respect to PSCo are without merit and
will vigorously defend itself in any suit which may be filed.  Currently, Xcel Energy is not able to estimate
any potential loss.

Asset
Retirement Obligations

Xcel Energy
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 143 – “Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations” (SFAS No. 143) effective Jan. 1,
2003.  Xcel Energy records future
plant removal obligations as a liability at fair value with a corresponding
increase to the carrying values of the related long-lived assets. This
liability will be increased over time by applying the interest method of
accretion to the liability, and the capitalized costs will be depreciated over
the useful life of the related long-lived assets.  The recording of the obligation for regulated
operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the
adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset pursuant to SFAS No. 71.

In March 2005,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 47–
“Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” (FIN No. 47) to
clarify the scope and timing of liability recognition for conditional asset
retirement obligations pursuant to SFAS No. 143.  The interpretation requires that a liability
be recorded for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, if the fair
value is estimable, even when the obligation is dependent on a future
event.  FIN No. 47 further clarified
that uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement of the
obligation should be factored into the measurement of the conditional asset
retirement obligation rather than affect whether a liability should be
recognized.  Xcel Energy implemented FIN No. 47
as of Dec. 31, 2005.  Included in
these financial statements is the recognition of a cumulative change in
accounting and disclosure of the liability on a pro forma basis.

Recorded Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) —

Asset retirement obligations have been recorded for nuclear
production, steam production, electric transmission and distribution system,
natural gas distribution system and office buildings.  The steam production obligation includes
asbestos, ash-containment facilities and decommissioning.  The asbestos recognition associated with the
steam production includes certain plants at NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS.   NSP-Minnesota also recorded asbestos
recognition for its general office building. 
Generally, this asbestos abatement removal obligation originated in 1973
with the Clean Air Act, which applied to the demolition of buildings or removal
of equipment containing asbestos that can become airborne on removal.  Asset retirement obligations also have been
recorded for NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS steam production related to
ash-containment facilities such as bottom ash ponds, evaporation ponds and
solid waste landfills. The origination date on the ARO recognition for
ash-containment facilities at steam plants was the in-service date of various
facilities.


Xcel Energy
recognized an ARO for the retirement costs of natural gas mains at
NSP-Minnesota, NSP- Wisconsin and PSCo. 
In addition, an ARO was recognized for the removal of electric
transmission and distribution equipment at NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo
and SPS.  The electric transmission and
distribution ARO consists of many small potential obligations associated with
PCBs, mineral oil, storage tanks, treated poles, lithium batteries, mercury and
street lighting lamps.  These electric
and natural gas assets have many in-service dates for which it is difficult to
assign the obligation to a particular year. 
Therefore, the obligation was measured at Dec. 31, 2005.  The asset retirement cost was set to this recognized
obligation and no cumulative effect adjustment was shown.

A liability
has also been recorded in previous years for nuclear decommissioning of an
NSP-Minnesota steam production plant. 
This plant began operating as a nuclear production facility in 1964
before being converted to a steam production peaking facility in 1969.  For the nuclear assets, the asset retirement
obligation is associated with the decommissioning of two NSP-Minnesota nuclear
generating plants, Monticello and Prairie Island, originates with the
in-service date of the facility. 
Monticello began operation in 1971. 
Prairie Island units 1 and 2 began operation in 1973 and 1974,
respectively.  See Note 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of nuclear obligations.

A reconciliation of the
beginning and ending aggregate carrying amounts of Xcel Energy’s asset
retirement obligations is shown in the table below for the 12 months ended Dec. 31,
2005 and 2004:

The fair value
of NSP-Minnesota assets legally restricted, for purposes of settling the
nuclear asset retirement obligation is $1.1 billion as of Dec. 31, 2005,
including external nuclear decommissioning investment funds and internally
funded amounts.

Cumulative Effect of FIN No. 47 —

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN No. 47.  The interpretation clarified the term “conditional
asset retirement obligation” as used in SFAS No. 143.  The recording of the obligation for regulated
operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the
adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset pursuant to SFAS No. 71.
If Xcel Energy had implemented FIN No. 47 at Jan. 1, 2004, the liability for
asset retirement obligations would have increased by $52.2 million.  The same liability at Dec. 31, 2004 would
have increased by $55.2 million.  A
summary of the accounting for the initial adoption of FIN No. 47, as of Dec. 31,
2005, is as follows:


Indeterminate Asset Retirement Obligations —

PSCo has underground gas storage facilities
that have special closure requirement for which the final removal date cannot
be determined.

Removal Costs

—

Xcel
Energy accrues an obligation for plant removal costs for other generation,
transmission and distribution facilities of its utility subsidiaries.  Generally, the accrual of future non-ARO
removal obligations is not required. 
However, long-standing ratemaking practices approved by applicable state
and federal regulatory commissions have allowed provisions for such costs in
historical depreciation rates. These removal costs have accumulated over a
number of years based on varying rates as authorized by the appropriate
regulatory entities. Given the long periods over which the amounts were accrued
and the changing of rates through time, the utility subsidiaries have estimated
the amount of removal costs accumulated through historic depreciation expense
based on current factors used in the existing depreciation rates.

Accordingly, the recorded
amounts of estimated future removal costs are considered Regulatory Liabilities
under SFAS No. 71. Removal costs by entity are as follows at Dec. 31:

Nuclear Insurance —

NSP-Minnesota’s public liability for claims resulting from any nuclear
incident is limited to $10.8 billion under the 1988 Price-Anderson amendment to
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. NSP-Minnesota has secured $300 million of
coverage for its public liability exposure with a pool of insurance companies.
The remaining $10.5 billion of exposure is funded by the Secondary Financial
Protection Program, available from assessments by the federal government in case
of a nuclear accident. NSP-Minnesota is subject to assessments of up to $100.6
million for each of its three licensed reactors, to be applied for public
liability arising from a nuclear incident at any licensed nuclear facility in
the United States. The maximum funding requirement is $15 million per reactor
during any one year.

NSP-Minnesota purchases
insurance for property damage and site decontamination cleanup costs from
Nuclear Electric Insurance Ltd. (NEIL). The coverage limits are $2.1 billion
for each of NSP-Minnesota’s two nuclear plant sites. NEIL also provides
business interruption insurance coverage, including the cost of replacement
power obtained during certain prolonged accidental outages of nuclear
generating units. Premiums are expensed over the policy term. All companies
insured with NEIL are subject to retroactive premium adjustments if losses
exceed accumulated reserve funds. Capital has been accumulated in the reserve
funds of NEIL to the extent that NSP-Minnesota would have no exposure for
retroactive premium assessments in case of a single incident under the business
interruption and the property damage insurance coverage. However, in each
calendar year, NSP-Minnesota could be subject to maximum assessments of
approximately $14.8 million for business interruption insurance and $26.5
million for property damage insurance if losses exceed accumulated reserve
funds.

Legal
Contingencies

In the normal
course of business, Xcel Energy is subject to claims and litigation arising
from prior and current operations. Xcel Energy is actively defending these
matters and has recorded a reasonable liability related to the probable cost of
settlement or other disposition when it can be reasonably estimated.  The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently
be determined. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters could have
a material adverse effect on Xcel Energy’s financial position and results of
operations.

Bender et al. vs. Xcel Energy

—
On July 2, 2004, five former NRG officers filed a lawsuit against Xcel
Energy in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. The lawsuit
alleges, among other things, that Xcel Energy violated the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by refusing to make certain deferred compensation
payments to the plaintiffs. The complaint also alleges interference with ERISA
benefits, breach of contract related to the nonpayment of certain stock options
and unjust enrichment. The complaint alleges damages of approximately $6
million. Xcel Energy believes the suit is without merit.  On Jan. 19, 2005, Xcel Energy filed a
motion for summary judgment.  On July 26,
2005, the court issued an order granting Xcel Energy’s motion for summary
judgment in part with respect to claims for interference with ERISA benefits,
breach of contract for nonpayment of stock options and unjust enrichment. The
court denied Xcel Energy’s motion in part with respect to the allegations of
nonpayment of deferred compensation benefits. 
Plaintiffs and Xcel Energy have filed additional cross motions for
summary judgment, with oral arguments presented on Feb. 24, 2006.  The court has also ordered this lawsuit to be
trial-ready by Feb. 1, 2006.

Carbon Dioxide Emissions Lawsuit

—
On July 21, 2004, the attorneys general of eight states and New York City,
as well as several environmental groups, filed lawsuits in U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York against five utilities, including Xcel
Energy, to force reductions in carbon dioxide (CO


)
emissions.  The other utilities include
American Electric Power Co., Southern


Co., Cinergy
Corp. and Tennessee Valley Authority.  CO


is emitted
whenever fossil fuel is combusted, such as in automobiles, industrial operations
and coal- or gas-fired power plants.  The
lawsuits allege that CO


emitted by each company is a public nuisance
as defined under state and federal common law because it has contributed to
global warming.  The lawsuits do not
demand monetary damages.  Instead, the
lawsuits ask the court to order each utility to cap and reduce its CO


emissions.  In October 2004, Xcel Energy and four
other utility companies filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, contending,
among other reasons, that the lawsuit is an attempt to usurp the policy-setting
role of the U.S. Congress and the president. 
On Sept. 19, 2005, the judge granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss
on constitutional grounds.  Plaintiffs
have filed a notice of appeal.

Department of Labor Audit —

In
2001, Xcel Energy received notice from the Department of Labor (DOL) Employee
Benefit Security Administration that it intended to audit the Xcel Energy
pension plan. After multiple on-site meetings and interviews with Xcel Energy
personnel, the DOL indicated on Sept. 18, 2003, that it is prepared to take the
position that Xcel Energy, as plan sponsor and through its delegate, the
Pension Trust Administration Committee, breached its fiduciary duties under
ERISA with respect to certain investments made in limited partnerships and
hedge funds in 1997 and 1998.  The DOL
has offered to conclude the audit if Xcel Energy is willing to contribute to
the plan the full amount of losses from the questioned investments, or approximately
$7 million.  On July 19, 2004, Xcel
Energy formally responded with a letter to the DOL that asserted no fiduciary
violations have occurred and extended an offer to meet to discuss the matter
further.  In 2005, the DOL submitted two
additional requests for information related to the investigation and has not
indicated that they are prepared to close the file, or in the alternative to
assert charges against Xcel Energy or the pension plan.

Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc. vs. Centerpoint
Energy et al.

—

On Nov. 19, 2003, a class
action complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
California by Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc. was served on Xcel Energy naming e
prime as a defendant. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a purported class of
large wholesale natural gas purchasers, alleges that e prime falsely reported
natural gas trades to market trade publications in an effort to artificially
raise natural gas prices in California. The case has been conditionally
transferred by the Multi-District Litigation (MDL) Panel to U.S. District Judge
Pro, in Nevada, who is the judge assigned to western area wholesale natural gas
marketing litigation.  In an order
entered April 8, 2005, Judge Pro granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss
based on the filed rate doctrine.  On May 9,
2005, plaintiffs filed an appeal of this decision to the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals.

Cornerstone Propane Partners, L.P. et al. vs.
e prime inc. et al.

—

On Feb. 2, 2004, a
purported class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York against e prime and three other defendants by
Cornerstone Propane Partners, L.P., Robert Calle Gracey and Dominick Viola on
behalf of a class who purchased or sold one or more New York Mercantile
Exchange natural gas futures and/or options contracts during the period from Jan. 1,
2000, to Dec. 31, 2002. The complaint alleges that defendants manipulated
the price of natural gas futures and options and/or the price of natural gas
underlying those contracts in violation of the Commodities Exchange Act. In February 2004,
the plaintiff requested that this action be consolidated with a similar suit
involving Reliant Energy Services. In February 2004, defendants, including
e prime, filed motions to dismiss. In September 2004, the U.S. District
Court denied the motions to dismiss.  On Jan. 25,
2005, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, which defendants
opposed.   On Sept. 30, 2005, the U.S.
District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On Oct. 17,
2005, defendants filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit challenging the class certification. 
On Dec. 5, 2005, e prime reached a tentative settlement with the
plaintiffs that will require court approval. 
The settlement will be paid by e prime and is not expected to have a
material financial impact on Xcel Energy.

Fairhaven Power
Company vs. Encana Corporation et al.

—

On Sept.
14, 2004, a class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of California by Fairhaven Power Co. and subsequently served
on Xcel Energy. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a purported class of natural
gas purchasers, alleges that Xcel Energy falsely reported natural gas trades to
market trade publications in an effort to artificially raise natural gas prices
in California and engaged in a conspiracy with other sellers of natural gas to
inflate prices.  This case has been
consolidated with Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc. vs Centerpoint Energy

et al

. and assigned to U.S. District Judge
Pro.  Defendants filed a motion to
dismiss, which was granted on December 19, 2005.  The plaintiffs subsequently appealed.

- On July 18, 2005,
Sinclair Oil Corporation filed a lawsuit against Xcel Energy and its former
subsidiary e prime.  In the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma,


alleging liability
and damages for purported misreporting of price information for natural gas to
trade publications in an effort to artificially increase natural gas
prices.  The complaint also alleges that
e prime and Xcel Energy engaged in a conspiracy with other gas sellers to
inflate prices through alleged false reporting of gas prices.  In response, e prime and Xcel Energy filed a
motion with the MDL Panel to have the matter transferred to U.S. District Judge
Pro and filed a second motion to dismiss the lawsuit.  In response to this motion, this

matter has been conditionally transferred to
U.S. District Court Judge Pro.  Sinclair
subsequently filed a motion with the MDL Panel to vacate this transfer.  The MDL Panel has yet to issue an order.  e prime and Xcel Energy also filed a motion
to dismiss with the District Court in Oklahoma based upon the filed rate
doctrine.  This motion is being held in
abeyance pending a ruling from the MDL Panel.

Kansas.  This case is in the early
stages; no discovery has been conducted and e prime and Xcel Energy intend to
vigorously defend against these claims.

J.P. Morgan Trust
Company vs. e prime and Xcel Energy Inc. et al.

–
On Oct. 17, 2005, J.P. Morgan, in its capacity as the liquidating trustee
for Farmland Industries Liquidating Trust, filed an amended complaint in Kansas
state court adding defendants, including Xcel Energy and e prime, to a
previously filed complaint alleging that the defendants inaccurately reported
natural gas trades to market trade publications in an effort to artificially
raise natural gas prices.  The lawsuit
was removed to the U.S. District Court in Kansas and subsequently transferred
to U.S. District Court Judge Pro, in Nevada pursuant to an order from the MDL
Panel.  A motion to remand to state court
has been filed by plaintiffs and that motion is currently pending.  This case is in the early stages, there has
been no discovery and e prime and Xcel Energy intend to vigorously defend

Payne et al. vs. PSCo et al.

-
In late October 2003, there was a wildfire in Boulder County, Colo.  There was no loss of life, but there was
property damage associated with this fire. On Oct. 28, 2005, an action
against PSCo related to this fire was filed in Boulder County District Court.
There are 28 plaintiffs, including individuals, the City of Jamestown and one
private corporation, and three co-defendants, including PSCo. Plaintiffs have
asserted that a tree falling into PSCo distribution lines may have caused the
fire. This lawsuit is in the early stages and PSCo intends to vigorously defend
itself against the claim. This lawsuit is not expected to have a material
financial impact and PSCo believes that its insurance coverage will cover any
liability in this matter.

Comanche 3 Permit Litigation -

On
Aug. 4, 2005, CCAP and Clean Energy Action filed suit against the Air
Pollution Control Division, Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment in state district court in Pueblo, Colo.  The suit alleges the issuance of
environmental permits for the proposed Comanche 3 generating station by the
Department violates the Colorado Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act.  The plaintiffs have sought judicial review of
the issuance of the permits.  The
plaintiffs have not sought a stay of the permits or an injunction on construction
pending judicial review.  On Aug. 19,
2005, the Colorado attorney general, on behalf of the Department, filed an
answer in the suit.  On the same date,
PSCo filed a motion to intervene and an answer in the suit.  On Nov. 20, 2005, the Division submitted
the formal record which was entered by the Court.  The plaintiff’s brief was filed on Feb. 2,
2006, and the government and PSCo will have 60 days to respond.

Fru-Con Construction
Corporation vs. Utility Engineering et al.

— On March 28,
2005, Fru-Con Construction Corporation (Fru-Con) commenced a lawsuit in U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of California against UE and the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) for damages allegedly suffered
during the construction of a natural gas-fired, combined-cycle power plant in
Sacramento County.  Fru-Con’s complaint
alleges that it entered into a contract with SMUD to construct the power plant
and further alleges that UE was negligent with regard to the design services it
furnished to SMUD.  UE denies this claim
and intends to vigorously defend itself. 
Because this lawsuit was commenced prior to the April 8, 2005,
closing of the sale of UE to Zachry Group, Inc., Xcel Energy is obligated
to indemnify Zachry up to $17.5 million. 
Pursuant to the terms of its professional liability policy, UE is
insured up to $35 million.  On June 1,
2005, UE filed a motion to


dismiss Fru-Con’s complaint.  A
hearing concerning this motion was held on July 18, 2005, with the court
taking the matter under advisement.  On Aug. 4,
2005, the court granted UE’s motion to dismiss. 
Because SMUD remains a defendant in this action, the court has not
entered a final judgment subject to an appeal with respect to its order to
dismiss UE from the lawsuit.

Metropolitan Airports Commission vs. Northern States Power Company

—

On Dec. 30, 2004, the Metropolitan
Airports Commission (MAC) filed a complaint in Minnesota state district court
asserting that NSP-Minnesota is required to relocate facilities on MAC property
at the expense of NSP-Minnesota.  MAC
claims that approximately $7.1 million charged by NSP-Minnesota over the past
five years for relocation costs should be repaid.  Both parties have asserted cross motions for
partial summary judgment concerning legal obligations associated with rent
payments allegedly due and owing by NSP-Minnesota to MAC for the use of its
property for a substation that serves the MAC. 
This hearing was held in January 2006; the judge has not yet issued
his decision.  Both sides have scheduled
depositions of key witnesses to take place in February and March of
2006.  Trial has been set for May 2006,
additional summary judgment motions are likely prior to trial.

Siewert  vs. Xcel Energy

—
Plaintiffs, the owners and operators of a Minnesota dairy farm, brought an
action against NSP-Minnesota alleging negligence in the handling, supplying,
distributing and selling of electrical power systems; negligence in the
construction and maintenance of distribution systems; and failure to warn or
adequately test such systems.  Plaintiffs
allege decreased milk production, injury, and damage to a dairy herd as a
result of stray voltage resulting from NSP-Minneosta’s distribution
system.  Plaintiffs’ expert report on the
economic damage to their dairy farm states that the total present value of plaintiffs’
loss is $6.8 million.  Trial is scheduled
to commence in March 2007. 
NSP-Minnesota denies these allegations and will vigorously defend itself
in this matter.

Other Contingencies

Tax Matters —

In April 2004, Xcel Energy filed a lawsuit against the government
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota to establish its right
to deduct the policy loan interest expense that had accrued during tax years
1993 and 1994 on policy loans related to its company-owned life insurance
(COLI) policies that insured certain lives of employees of PSCo.  These policies are owned and managed by PSR
Investments, Inc. (PSRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of PSCo.

After
Xcel Energy filed this suit, the IRS sent it two statutory notices of proposed
deficiency of tax, penalty and interest for taxable years 1995 through
1999.  Xcel Energy then filed two Tax
Court petitions challenging those notices. 
Xcel Energy anticipates that the dispute relating to its claimed
interest expense deductions for tax years 1993 and later will be resolved in
the refund suit that is pending in the Minnesota federal district court and
that the two Tax Court petitions will be held in abeyance pending the outcome
of the refund litigation.

On
Oct. 12, 2005, the district court denied Xcel Energy’s motion for summary
judgment on the grounds that there were disputed issues of material fact that
required a trial for resolution.  At the
same time, the district court denied the government’s motion for summary
judgment that was based on its contention that PSCo had lacked an insurable
interest in the lives of the employees insured under the COLI policies.  However, the district court granted Xcel
Energy’s motion for partial summary judgment on the grounds that PSCo did have
the requisite insurable interest.  The
case is expected to proceed to trial and the litigation could take another two
or more years.

Xcel
Energy believes that the tax deduction for interest expense on the COLI policy
loans is in full compliance with the tax law. Accordingly, PSRI has not
recorded any provision for income tax or related interest or penalties that may
be imposed by the IRS, and has continued to take deductions for interest
expense related to policy loans on its income tax returns for subsequent years.  As discussed above, the litigation could
require several years to reach final resolution.  Defense of Xcel Energy’s position may require
significant cash outlays, which may or may not be recoverable in a court
proceeding.  Although the ultimate
resolution of this matter is uncertain, it could have a material adverse effect
on Xcel Energy’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Should
the IRS ultimately prevail on this issue, tax and interest payable through Dec. 31,
2005, would reduce retained earnings by an estimated $361 million.  In 2004, Xcel Energy received formal
notification that the IRS will seek penalties. If penalties (plus associated
interest) also are included, the total exposure through Dec. 31, 2005, is
approximately $428 million.  Xcel Energy
annual earnings for 2006 would be reduced by approximately $44 million, after
tax, or 10 cents per share, if COLI interest expense deductions were no longer
available.


15.          Nuclear Obligations

Fuel Disposal —

NSP-Minnesota is responsible for temporarily storing used or spent
nuclear fuel from its nuclear plants. The DOE is responsible for permanently
storing spent fuel from NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear plants as well as from other
U.S. nuclear plants. NSP-Minnesota has funded its portion of the DOE’s
permanent disposal program since 1981. The fuel disposal fees are based on a
charge of 0.1 cent per kilowatt-hour sold to customers from nuclear generation.
Fuel expense includes DOE fuel disposal assessments of approximately $12
million in 2005, $13 million in 2004 and $13 million in 2003. In total,
NSP-Minnesota had paid approximately $346 million to the DOE through Dec. 31,
2005. However, it is not determinable whether the amount and method of the DOE’s
assessments to all utilities will be sufficient to fully fund the DOE’s
permanent storage or disposal facility.

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act
required the DOE to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel no later than Jan. 31,
1998. In 1996, the DOE notified commercial spent-fuel owners of an anticipated
delay in accepting spent nuclear fuel by the required date and conceded that a
permanent storage or disposal facility will not be available until at least
2010. NSP-Minnesota and other utilities have commenced lawsuits against the DOE
to recover damages caused by the DOE’s failure to meet its statutory and
contractual obligations.

NSP-Minnesota has its own
temporary on-site storage facilities for spent fuel at its Monticello and
Prairie Island nuclear plants, which consist of storage pools and a dry cask
facility. With the dry cask storage facility licensed by the NRC, approved in
1994 and again in 2003, management believes it has adequate storage capacity to
continue operation of its Prairie Island nuclear plant until at least the end
of its license terms in 2013 and 2014. The Monticello nuclear plant has storage
capacity in the pool to continue operations until 2010. Storage availability to
permit operation beyond these dates is not known at this time. All of the
alternatives for spent fuel storage are being investigated until a DOE facility
is available, including pursuing the establishment of a private facility for
interim storage of spent nuclear fuel as part of a consortium of electric
utilities.

Nuclear fuel expense
includes payments to the DOE for the decommissioning and decontamination of the
DOE’s uranium-enrichment facilities. In 1993, NSP-Minnesota recorded the DOE’s
initial assessment of $46 million, which is payable in annual installments from
1993 to 2008. NSP-Minnesota is amortizing each installment to expense on a
monthly basis. The most recent installment paid in 2005 was $4.7 million;
future installments are subject to inflation adjustments under DOE rules.
NSP-Minnesota is obtaining rate recovery of these DOE assessments through the
cost-of-energy adjustment clause as the assessments are amortized. Accordingly,
the unamortized assessment of $8.3 million at Dec. 31, 2005, is deferred
as a regulatory asset.

Regulatory Plant Decommissioning Recovery —

Decommissioning of NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear
facilities, as last approved by the MPUC, is planned for the period from
cessation of operations through 2040, assuming the prompt dismantlement method.
NSP-Minnesota is currently accruing the costs for decommissioning over the
MPUC-approved cost-recovery period and including the accruals in Accumulated
Depreciation. Upon implementation of SFAS No. 143, the decommissioning
costs in Accumulated Depreciation and ongoing accruals are reclassified to a
regulatory liability account. The total decommissioning cost obligation is
recorded as an asset retirement obligation in accordance with SFAS No. 143.


Monticello began operation
in 1971 and is licensed to operate until 2010. Prairie Island units 1 and 2
began operation in 1973 and 1974, respectively, and are licensed to operate
until 2013 and 2014, respectively. In 2003, the Minnesota Legislature changed a
law that had limited expansion of on-site storage.

On Aug. 25, 2004, the Xcel Energy
board of directors authorized the pursuit of renewal of the operating licenses
for the Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants.  NSP-Minnesota filed its application for
Monticello with the MPUC in January 2005, seeking a certificate of need
for dry spent-fuel storage, and filed an application in March 2005 with
the NRC for an operating license extension of up to 20 years.  A decision regarding Monticello relicensing
is expected in 2007. Plant assessments and other work for the Prairie Island
applications are planned in the next two or three years.

The
Prairie Island license renewal process has not yet begun.

Consistent with cost
recovery in utility customer rates, NSP-Minnesota records annual
decommissioning accruals based on periodic site-specific cost studies and a
presumed level of dedicated funding. Cost studies quantify decommissioning
costs in current dollars. Current authorized funding presumes that costs will
escalate in the future at a rate of 4.19 percent per year. The total estimated
decommissioning costs that will ultimately be paid, net of income earned by
external trust funds, is currently being accrued using an annuity approach over
the approved plant-recovery period. This annuity approach uses an assumed rate
of return on funding, which is currently 5.5 percent, net of tax, for external
funding and approximately 8 percent, net of tax, for internal funding. The net unrealized
gain on nuclear decommissioning investments is deferred as a Regulatory
Liability based on the assumed offsetting against decommissioning costs in
current ratemaking treatment.

The MPUC last approved
NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear decommissioning study request in December 2003,
using 2002 cost data.

In October 2005, NSP-Minnesota filed with the
MPUC a nuclear decommissioning study using 2005 cost data.  Xcel Energy’s recommendation is to reduce the
2006 funding if approved by the MPUC. 
Xcel Energy expects the MPUC to approve a new funding amount in 2006.

Internal
funding for all retail jurisdictions was transferred to the external funds by
the end of 2005.  Based on the
last MPUC approval requiring the acceleration of the internal fund transfer,
there is a step change in the level of the overall decommissioning expense at
the expiration of the transfer beginning Jan. 1, 2006. Expecting to
operate Prairie Island through the end of each unit’s licensed life, the
approved capital recovery will allow for the plant to be fully depreciated,
including the accrual and recovery of decommissioning costs, in 2014. Xcel
Energy believes future decommissioning cost accruals will continue to be
recovered in customer rates.

The total obligation for
decommissioning currently is expected to be funded 100 percent by external
funds, as approved by the MPUC. Contributions to the external fund started in
1990 and are expected to continue until plant decommissioning begins. The
assets held in trusts as of Dec. 31, 2005, primarily consisted of
investments in fixed income securities, such as tax-exempt municipal bonds and
U.S. government securities that mature in one to 20 years, and common stock of
public companies. NSP-Minnesota plans to reinvest matured securities until
decommissioning begins.

At Dec. 31, 2005,
NSP-Minnesota had recorded and recovered in rates cumulative decommissioning
accruals of $816 million. The following table summarizes the funded status of
NSP-Minnesota’s decommissioning obligation based on approved regulatory
recovery parameters.  These amounts are
not those recorded in the financial statements for the asset retirement
obligation in accordance with SFAS No. 143.


Decommissioning expenses
recognized include the following components:

Decommissioning and interest
accruals are included with Regulatory Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Interest costs and trust earnings associated with externally funded
obligations are reported in Other Nonoperating Income on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Negative accruals for
internally funded portions in 2003, 2004 and 2005 reflect the impact of the
2002 decommissioning study, which approved an assumption of 100-percent
external funding of future costs.

The
2005 nuclear decommissioning filing has not been used for the regulatory
presentation because it is effective for 2006. 
However, the filing and all the updated parameters were used for a new
ARO layer for SFAS No. 143 recognition.

16.          Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

Xcel Energy’s regulated
businesses prepare their Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 71, as discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Under SFAS No. 71, regulatory assets and liabilities
can be created for amounts that regulators may allow to be collected, or may
require to be paid back to customers in future electric and natural gas rates.
Any portion of Xcel Energy’s business that is not regulated cannot use SFAS No. 71
accounting. If changes in the utility industry or the business of Xcel Energy
no longer allow for the application of SFAS No. 71 under GAAP, Xcel Energy
would be required to recognize the write-off of regulatory assets and
liabilities in its statement of operations.  The components of unamortized regulatory
assets and liabilities of continuing operations shown on the balance sheet at Dec. 31
were:


(a)   Earns a return on investment
in the ratemaking process. These amounts are amortized consistent with recovery
in rates.

(b)   These costs do not relate to
NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear plants. They relate to DOE assessments, as discussed
previously in Note 15. In 2004, these costs also included unamortized costs for
PSCo’s Fort St. Vrain nuclear plant decommissioning.

(c)   Excludes current portion
expected to be returned to customers within 12 months of $16.3 million and
$12.4 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively.

(d)   In 2004, excluded the
current portion expected to be recovered within the next 12 months of $16.1
million.

(e)   Includes
the fair value of certain long-term contracts used to meet native energy
requirements.

17.          Segments and Related Information

Xcel Energy has the
following reportable segments: Regulated Electric Utility, Regulated Natural
Gas Utility and All Other.

•

Xcel Energy’s Regulated Electric Utility
segment generates, transmits and distributes electricity in Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico,
Kansas and Oklahoma. In addition, this segment includes sales for resale and
provides wholesale transmission service to various entities in the United
States. Regulated Electric Utility also includes commodity trading operations.

•

Xcel Energy’s Regulated Natural Gas Utility
segment transports, stores and distributes natural gas primarily in portions of
Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Michigan and Colorado.

Revenues from
operating segments not included above are below the necessary quantitative
thresholds and are therefore included in the All Other category.  Those primarily include steam revenue,
appliance repair services, nonutility real estate activities, revenues
associated with processing solid waste into refuse-derived fuel and investments
in rental housing projects that qualify for low-income housing tax credits.

To report income
from continuing operations for Regulated Electric and Regulated Natural Gas
Utility segments, Xcel Energy must assign or allocate all costs and certain
other income. In general, costs are:

•

directly assigned wherever applicable;

•

allocated based on cost causation
allocators wherever applicable; and

•

allocated based on a general allocator for
all other costs not assigned by the above two methods.

The accounting policies of
the segments are the same as those described in Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

These segments are managed separately because the
revenue streams are dependent upon regulated rate recovery, which are
separately determined for each segment.

Xcel Energy evaluates performance by each legal entity based on profit
or loss generated from the product or service provided.


18.          Summarized Quarterly Financial Data
(Unaudited)

Summarized
quarterly unaudited financial data is as follows:


(a)  2005 results
include unusual items as follows:

•

Third-quarter
results from continuing operations were decreased by the accrual of legal
settlements incurred by the holding company in the amount of $5 million.

•

Second-quarter
results from discontinued operations were increased by $7.7 million due to a
true-up on the estimated impairment expected to result from the disposal of
Seren, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

•

Fourth-quarter
results from discontinued operations include the positive impact of a $17.2 million tax benefit recorded to reflect
the final resolution of Xcel Energy’s divested interest in NRG.

•

First
quarter revenuehas been reduced by $6.1 million as compared to the amount
previously reported in the Quarterly Report filed on Form 10-Q with the
SEC for the first quarter of 2005.  This
adjustment is a result of fees collected from customers on behalf of
governmental agencies that were reclassified to be presented net of the related
payments made to the agencies.

(b)  2004 results
include special charges in the fourth quarter and unusual items as follows:

•

Fourth
quarter results from continuing operations were decreased by the accrual of
legal settlements incurred by the holding company in the amount of $17.6
million.

•

Third-quarter
results from discontinued operations were decreased by $112 million, or 27
cents per share, due to the estimated impairment expected to result from the
disposal of Seren, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.  During the fourth quarter,
an adjustment increasing the impairment by $31 million, or 7 cents per share,
was recorded.

•

Fourth-quarter
results from discontinued operations were decreased by $15.7 million, or 4
cents per share, related to a reduction of the NRG tax benefits previously
booked, after completion of an NRG tax basis study.

•

Fourth-quarter
results from continuing operations were increased by $33.8 million, or 8 cents
per share, due to the accrual of income tax benefits which included $22.3
million related to the successful resolution of various issues and other
adjustments to current and deferred taxes.

•

Fourth-quarter results from
continuing operations were decreased by a $19.7 million accrual recorded to
reflect SPS’ best estimate of any potential liability for the impact of its
retail fuel cost-recovery proceeding in Texas.

•

First-quarter
revenue has been reduced by $10.4 million as compared to the amount previously
reported in the Quarterly Report filed on Form 10-Q with the SEC for the first
quarter 2005.  Revenue for the quarter
ended Dec. 31, 2004 has been reduced by $10.3 million as compared to the
amount previously reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2004.  These adjustments are a result of fees
collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies that were
reclassified to be presented net of the related payments made to the agencies.


Item 9 — Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on
Accounting and

Financial Disclosure

During 2004 and 2005, and
through the date of this report, there were no disagreements with the
independent public accountants on accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosures, or auditing scope or procedures.

Item 9A — Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Xcel
Energy maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in reports that it files or submits
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. As
of Dec. 31, 2005, based on an evaluation carried out under the supervision
and with the participation of Xcel Energy’s management, including the chief
executive officer (CEO) and the chief financial officer (CFO), of the
effectiveness of its disclosure controls and the procedures, the CEO and CFO
have concluded that Xcel Energy’s disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting

No
change in Xcel Energy’s internal control over financial reporting has occurred
during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, Xcel Energy’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Xcel
Energy maintains internal control over financial reporting to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting. Xcel
Energy has evaluated and documented its controls in process activities, in
general computer activities, and on an entity-wide level. During the fourth
quarter and in preparation for issuing its report for the year ended Dec. 31,
2005 on internal controls under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, Xcel Energy conducted testing and monitoring of its internal control over
financial reporting.  Based on the
control evaluation, testing and remediation performed, Xcel Energy did not
identify any material control weaknesses, as defined under the standards and rules issued
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and as approved by the
SEC and as indicated in Management Report on Internal Controls herein.  Xcel Energy has concluded that the internal
control over financial reporting was effective.

Item 9B —
Other Information

Departure of Directors or
Principal Officers: Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers

On February
22, 2006, Richard H. Anderson, 50, a member of the Xcel Energy Inc. Board of
Directors since May 2004 conveyed to the Governance, Compensation and
Nominating Committee of the Board that he did not wish to stand for election by
shareholders at the Annual Meeting of the Company on May 17, 2006.  He stated that due to his responsibilities as
Executive Vice President of UnitedHealth Group, Inc. (UHG) and Chief Executive
Officer of UHG’s Ingenix Division, he did not have sufficient time to prepare
and participate in the Board and Committee meetings of Xcel Energy.  Mr. Anderson will continue to serve as a
director until his term expires on May 16, 2006.

PART III

Item 10 — Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant

Information required under
this Item with respect to directors is set forth in Xcel Energy’s Proxy
Statement for its 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which is incorporated by
reference. Information with respect to Executive Officers is included in Item 1
to this report.

Item 11 — Executive Compensation

Except as set forth below,
information required under this Item is set forth in Xcel Energy’s Proxy
Statement for its 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which is incorporated by
reference.

On Feb. 22, 2006, the Governance, Compensation &
Nominating Committee of the Xcel Energy board of directors approved payouts of
annual incentive awards for 2005, pursuant to the Xcel Energy Annual Incentive
Award Program.  Target annual incentive
awards, expressed as a percentage of salary, were set by the Committee under the
2000 Annual Incentive Plan at the end of 2004 except for


Mr. Richard C. Kelly as later described.   Payouts
of annual incentive awards were dependent on the level of achievement of
corporate financial and operational goals and business unit operational goals
approved by the Committee, with each individual having the opportunity to earn
from 0 percent to approximately 150 percent of his or her target annual
incentive award based on the level of achievement in 2005 of the goals
applicable to such individual. Corporate goals included targeted earnings per
share, a customer satisfaction measurement, an environmental measurement
related to air emissions and operations measurements related to generation
availability, system availability, a measure of employee engagement and safety.
Business unit goals included customer service, reliability, safety, environmental
responsibility, reliability, safety and management to budgeted financial
results, measured at a business unit level.

Target annual incentive awards
(as a percent of base salary) were set for all Xcel Energy officers, ranging
from 100 percent of salary for Mr. Brunetti to 55 percent of salary for
the other Named Executive Officers. With the approval of the Committee, an
award could be multiplied by a leadership rating factor from zero to two.  Mr. Kelly’s target annual incentive award was
set at 70 percent of salary for his time as President and Chief Operating
Officer and set at 100 percent of salary for his time as President and Chief
Executive Officer.

Payouts of the annual incentive
awards for Mr. Brunetti and Mr. Kelly were dependent entirely on attaining
corporate goals. For the other Named Executive Officers, the formula was
weighted 67 percent to attaining corporate goals and 33 percent to attaining
business unit operational goals.

In order to encourage increased
share ownership by executive officers, the 2000 Annual Incentive Plan provides
the option for executives to receive their payments in shares of common stock
or shares of restricted common stock (which vests in equal annual installments
over a three-year period) in lieu of cash. A 5 percent premium is added to
amounts paid in shares of common stock, and a 20 percent premium is added to
amounts paid in shares of restricted common stock.

Based on corporate performance
during 2005, payouts under the corporate performance component were 29 percent
of the corporate target. Business unit performance resulted in payouts ranging
from 23 percent to 53 percent of the target for the business unit goals. As a
result, and taking into account adjustments for individual leadership factor
ratings the executive officers received from 27 percent to 59 percent of their
targeted annual incentive awards. 
Adjustments for individual leadership factor ratings were not applied to
any Named Executive Officers.  Based on
performance during 2005, the payouts to the Named Executives of Xcel Energy
were as follows:

On Feb. 22, 2006, the
Governance, Compensation & Nominating Committee of the Xcel Energy board of
directors approved payouts of long-term incentive awards pursuant to the Xcel
Energy Omnibus Incentive Plan for the three-year measurement cycle that ended in
2005.  These performance share awards
were granted effective January 1, 2003 for the three-year measurement cycle
ended December 31, 2005 and were made in shares, each of which represents the
value of one share of Xcel Energy common stock. The target number of shares
granted was calculated by dividing the executive’s target award by the fair
market value of Xcel Energy common stock on the date of the grant. Payout of
the performance share award was dependent entirely on a single measure, total
shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR of a peer group consisting of
other companies in the EEI Electrics Index. 
The performance shares provide for payout at the target level if Xcel
Energy’s TSR at the end of such three-year period is at the 50

th

percentile of the peer group and at 200 percent of the target level for
performance at or above the 75

th

percentile of the peer group. The
performance shares provide smaller payouts for performance below the 50

th

percentile. No payout would be made for


performance below the 35

th

percentile.

For the measurement cycle that
ended in 2005 (representing awards granted effective January 1, 2003), the TSR
was at 76

th

percentile resulting in a 200 percent payout.  Accordingly, the payouts to the Named
Executives of Xcel Energy were as follows:

Payments to the Named Executive
Officers were made in a combination of cash and shares.  Mr. Brunetti received $1,000,000 in cash and
384,184 pre-tax shares.  Mr. Kelly
received $1,000,000 in cash and 83,170 pre-tax shares. Mr. Johnson received
$754,768 in cash and 39,527 pre-tax shares. 
Ms. Vincent received $657,995 in cash and 34,459 pre-tax shares.  Mr. Fowke received $212,241 in cash and
11,115 pre-tax shares.  Mr. Bonavia
received $745,087 in cash and 39,020 pre-tax shares.
