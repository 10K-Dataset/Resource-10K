ITEM 1—BUSINESS

COMPANY OVERVIEW

On Aug. 18, 2000, New Century Energies, Inc. (NCE) and Northern States Power Co. (NSP) merged and formed Xcel Energy Inc. Xcel Energy, a
Minnesota corporation, is a registered holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA). Each share of NCE common stock was exchanged for 1.55 shares of Xcel Energy common stock.
NSP shares became Xcel Energy shares on a one-for-one basis. The merger was structured as a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange for
shareholders of both companies (except for fractional shares), and accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. As part of the merger, NSP transferred its existing utility
operations that were being conducted directly by NSP at the parent company level to a newly formed subsidiary of Xcel Energy named Northern States Power Company.

Xcel
Energy directly owns six utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in 12 states. These six utility subsidiaries are Northern States Power Company, a
Minnesota corporation (NSP-Minnesota), Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation (NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo), Southwestern Public
Service Company (SPS), Black Mountain Gas Company (BMG) and Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Company (Cheyenne). Their service territories include portions of Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Michigan,
Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Xcel Energy's regulated businesses also include Viking Gas Transmission Company and WestGas
InterState Inc. (WGI), both interstate natural gas pipeline companies.

Xcel
Energy also owns or has an interest in a number of nonregulated businesses, the largest of which is NRG Energy, Inc., a publicly traded independent power producer. At
Dec. 31, 2000, Xcel Energy indirectly owned 82 percent of NRG. Xcel Energy owned 100 percent of NRG until the second quarter of 2000, when NRG completed its initial public
offering. During March 2001, NRG issued an additional 18.4 million shares of common stock, which caused Xcel Energy's ownership interest in NRG to decline to approximately
75 percent. For more information, see NRG Initial Public Offering discussed under Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7.

In
addition to NRG, Xcel Energy's nonregulated subsidiaries include Seren Innovations, Inc. (broadband telecommunications services), e prime, inc. (natural gas marketing
and trading), Planergy International Inc. (energy management, consulting and demand-side management services) and Eloigne Company (acquisition of rental housing projects that
qualify for low-income housing tax credits). Xcel Energy also reports in its nonregulated activities its 50-percent stake in Yorkshire Power, a regional electricity company in
the United Kingdom. Subsequent to year-end, Xcel Energy has agreed to sell a substantial portion of this investment. For more information, see Note 11 to the Financial Statements
under Item 8.

Xcel
Energy owns the following additional direct subsidiaries, some of which are intermediate holding companies with additional subsidiaries: Xcel Energy Wholesale Group, Inc.,
Xcel Energy Markets Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy International Inc., Xcel Energy Ventures Inc., Xcel Energy Retail Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy Communications
Group Inc., Xcel Energy WYCO Inc., Xcel Energy O&M Services Inc. and Xcel Energy Services Inc. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as Xcel Energy.

Xcel
Energy was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in 1909. Its executive offices are located at 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401.

For
information on the nonregulated subsidiaries of Xcel Energy, see Nonregulated Subsidiaries under Item 1. For information regarding Xcel Energy's segments and foreign revenues, see
Note 18 to the Financial Statements under Item 8.

UTILITY REGULATION

Ratemaking Principles

The Xcel Energy system is subject to the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under PUHCA. The rules and regulations under PUHCA
generally limit the operations of a registered holding company to a single integrated public utility system, plus additional energy-related businesses. PUHCA rules require that transactions between
affiliated companies in a registered holding company system be performed at cost, with limited exceptions.

The
FERC has jurisdiction over wholesale rates for electric transmission service and electric energy sold in interstate commerce, hydro facility licensing, the wholesale gas
transportation rates of Viking, the siting and construction of facilities by Viking and certain other activities of Xcel Energy's utility subsidiaries. Federal, state and local agencies also have
jurisdiction over many of Xcel Energy's other activities.

Xcel
Energy is unable to predict the impact on its operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies. Xcel Energy strives to comply with all rules and
regulations issued by the various agencies.

NSP-Minnesota

Retail rates, services and other aspects of NSP-Minnesota's operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission
(MPUC), the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC) and the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (SDPUC) within their respective states. The MPUC also possesses regulatory authority over
aspects of NSP-Minnesota's financial activities, including security issuances, certain property transfers, mergers with other utilities and transactions between NSP-Minnesota
and its affiliates. In addition, the MPUC reviews and approves NSP-Minnesota's electric resource plans and gas supply plans for meeting customers' future energy needs.

The
Minnesota Environmental Quality Board (MEQB) is empowered to select and designate sites for new power plants with a capacity of 50 megawatts or more and wind energy conversion
plants with a capacity of five megawatts or more. It also designates routes for electric transmission lines with a capacity of 200 kilovolts (kv) or more. No power plant or transmission line may be
constructed in Minnesota except on a site or route designated by the MEQB.

NSP-Wisconsin

NSP-Wisconsin is subject to regulation of similar scope by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) and the Michigan Public Service
Commission (MPSC). In addition, each of the state commissions certifies the need for new generating plants and electric and retail gas transmission lines of designated capacities to be located within
the respective states before the facilities may be sited and built.

The
PSCW has a biennial filing requirement. By June of each odd-numbered year, NSP-Wisconsin must submit rate filings for calendar years beginning the
following January. The filing procedure and


review generally allow the PSCW sufficient time to issue an order effective with the start of the test year.

PSCo

PSCo is subject to the jurisdiction of the Colorado Public Utility Commission (CPUC) with respect to its facilities, rates, accounts, services and issuance of
securities. PSCo is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to its wholesale electric operations and accounting practices and policies. PSCo has received authorization from the FERC to
act as a power marketer. Also, PSCo holds a FERC certificate that allows it to transport natural gas in interstate commerce without PSCo becoming subject to full FERC jurisdiction.

SPS

The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) has jurisdiction over SPS' Texas operations as an electric utility and original and appellate jurisdiction over
its retail rates and services. The New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission (NMPRC) has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities and accounting. The NMPRC, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission and
the Kansas Corporation Commission have jurisdiction with respect to retail rates and services in their respective states. The FERC has jurisdiction over SPS' rates for sales for resale and the
transmission of electricity in interstate commerce.

Cheyenne

Cheyenne is subject to the jurisdiction of the Wyoming Public Service Commission (WPSC) with respect to its facilities, rates, accounts, services and issuance
of securities. All electric demand and purchased power costs are recoverable through an energy adjustment clause. Differences in costs incurred from costs recovered in rates are deferred and recovered
through prospective adjustments to rates. However, rate changes for cost recovery require WPSC approval before going into effect. Historically, customers have been provided carrying costs on
overcollected costs, but Cheyenne has not been allowed to collect carrying charges for under recovered costs.

Other

Viking and WGI are subject to FERC jurisdiction and each holds a FERC certificate, which allows them to transport natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant
to the provisions of the Natural Gas Act.. BMG is subject to the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC).

Fuel, Purchased Gas and Resource Adjustment Clauses

NSP-Minnesota

NSP-Minnesota's retail electric rate schedules provide for adjustments to billings and revenues for changes in the cost of fuel and purchased
energy. NSP-Minnesota is permitted to recover option costs through a fuel clause adjustment, a mechanism that allows NSP-Minnesota to bill customers for the actual cost of fuel
used to generate electricity at its plants and energy purchased from other suppliers. Changes in capacity charges are not recovered through the fuel clause. NSP-Minnesota's electric
wholesale customers do not have a fuel clause provision in their contracts. Instead, the contracts have an escalation factor.

Gas
rate schedules for NSP-Minnesota include a purchased gas adjustment (PGA) clause that provides for rate adjustments for changes in the current unit cost of purchased
gas compared with the last costs included in rates. The PGA factors in Minnesota are calculated for the current month based on the estimated purchased gas costs for that month.

By
September of each year, NSP-Minnesota is required to submit to the MPUC an annual report of the PGA factors used to bill each customer class by month for the previous
year commencing July 1


and ending June 30. The report verifies whether the utility is calculating the adjustments properly and implementing them in a timely manner. In addition, the MPUC reviews procurement policies,
cost-minimizing efforts, rule variances, retail transportation gas volumes, independent auditors' reports and the impact of market forces on gas costs for the coming year. The MPUC has the
authority to disallow certain costs if it finds the utility was not prudent in its gas procurement activities.

NSP-Minnesota
is required by Minnesota law to spend a minimum of 2 percent of Minnesota electric revenue and 0.5 percent of Minnesota gas revenue on
conservation improvement programs (CIP). These costs are recovered through an annual recovery mechanism for electric and gas conservation and energy management program expenditures.
NSP-Minnesota is required to request a new cost recovery level annually.

NSP-Wisconsin

NSP-Wisconsin does not have an automatic electric fuel adjustment clause for Wisconsin retail customers. Instead, it has a procedure that compares
actual monthly and anticipated annual fuel costs with those costs that were included in the latest retail electric rates. If the comparison results in a difference outside a prescribed range, the PSCW
may hold hearings limited to fuel costs and revise rates. Any revised rates would be effective until the next rate case. The adjustment approved is calculated on an annual basis, but applied
prospectively. Most of NSP-Wisconsin's wholesale electric rate schedules provide for adjustments to billings and revenues for changes in the cost of fuel and purchased energy.

During
1999, the PSCW approved a new gas cost recovery mechanism to replace the PGA. The financial impact of the gas cost recovery mechanism is substantially the same as with the
former PGA.

NSP-Wisconsin's
gas and retail electric rate schedules for Michigan customers include gas cost recovery factors and power supply cost recovery factors, which are based on
12-month projections. After each 12-month period, a reconciliation is submitted whereby over-collections are refunded and any under-collections are collected from
the customers.

PSCo

PSCo has five adjustment clauses: the incentive cost adjustment (ICA), the gas cost adjustment (GCA), the steam cost adjustment (SCA), the demand side
management cost adjustment (DSMCA) and the qualifying facilities capacity cost adjustment (QFCCA). These adjustment clauses allow certain costs to be passed through to retail customers. PSCo is
required to file applications with the CPUC for approval of adjustment mechanisms in advance of the proposed effective dates. The applications must be acted upon before becoming effective.

The
ICA allows for an equal sharing between customers and shareholders of certain fuel and energy cost increases. PSCo, through its GCA, is allowed to recover its actual costs of
purchased gas. The GCA rate is revised annually in October, and otherwise as needed, to coincide with changes in
purchased gas costs. Purchased gas costs and revenues received to recover such gas costs are compared on a monthly basis and differences are deferred. PSCo, through its SCA, is allowed to recover the
difference between its actual cost of fuel and the amount of these costs recovered under its base rates. The SCA rate is revised annually in January, and otherwise as needed, to coincide with changes
in fuel costs. The QFCCA provides for recovery of purchased capacity costs from certain QF projects not otherwise reflected in base electric rates.

The
DSMCA clause currently permits PSCo to recover DSM costs over five years while non-labor incremental expenses and carrying costs associated with deferred DSM costs are
recovered on an annual basis. PSCo also has implemented a low-income energy assistance program. The costs of this energy conservation and weatherization program for low-income
customers are recovered through the DSMCA.


SPS

Fuel and purchased power costs are recoverable in Texas through a fixed fuel factor, which is part of SPS' rates. If it appears that SPS will materially
over-recover or under-recover these costs, the factor may be revised upon application by SPS or action by the PUCT. The rule requires refunding and surcharging
under/over-recovery amounts, including interest, when they exceed 4 percent of the utility's annual fuel and purchased power costs, as allowed by the PUCT, if this condition is
expected to continue. PUCT regulations require periodic examination of SPS fuel and purchased power costs, the efficiency of the use of such fuel and purchased power, fuel acquisition and management
policies and purchase power commitments. Under the PUCT's regulations, SPS is required to file an application for the PUCT to retrospectively review at least every three years the operations of SPS'
electric generation and fuel management activities.

The
NMPRC regulations provide for a fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause and a fixed annual fuel factor for SPS' New Mexico retail jurisdiction. SPS files monthly and
annual reports of its fuel and purchased power costs with the NMPRC, which include the current over/under fuel collection calculation, plus interest. In addition, SPS revises its fixed fuel factor
annually to recover projected fuel and purchased power costs as well as any over/under cost balance for the current year. SPS is required to petition for a change in the fixed fuel factor if the
over/under recovery balance reaches $5 million.

Regulatory Matters

NSP-Minnesota

Conservation Recovery

—NSP-Minnesota had a 4.1 percent conservation rate
surcharge in place since 1998, pending resolution of the conservation incentive recovery issue. On July 31, 2000, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota's request to prospectively reduce
the surcharge level to 0.68 percent (consistent with current costs to be recovered) and to refund cumulative overcollections of approximately $24 million. The refund occurred during
December 2000. Although cash flows were reduced, NSP-Minnesota did not have any earnings impact from these actions due to accruals previously recorded. For more information, see
Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7.

Fuel Clause Adjustment—

In June 2000, the MPUC approved a change under which bills received by
NSP-Minnesota's electricity customers will more accurately reflect energy costs on a timely basis. Previously, the adjustment reflected prior period costs, and it would take approximately
three months for customer bills to reflect higher, or lower, fuel costs incurred by NSP-Minnesota. Under the new method, NSP-Minnesota bases the customer billing adjustment on
projected energy costs for the current month, and corrects, in a subsequent month, any differences between projected costs and actual costs incurred. This improved matching between costs and usage
should encourage customers to take appropriate steps to reduce energy use during peak periods—when costs are at their highest—while giving appropriate price signals when costs
are lower during off-peak periods. NSP-Minnesota implemented the revised fuel clause adjustment with July 2000 billings.

Energy Cost Recovery

—In April 2000, the Minnesota Office of Attorney General (OAG) filed a petition with the MPUC
asking the MPUC to initiate an investigation of NSP-Minnesota's fuel and purchased energy cost recoveries under the FCA provisions of NSP's tariffs. The OAG alleged
NSP-Minnesota could be improperly diverting low-cost NSP-Minnesota generation supplies to the wholesale market to increase profits, while recovering
higher-cost energy purchases through the FCA. NSP-Minnesota contends that it has followed the appropriate FCA rules and regulations. In July 2000, the MPUC issued an
order in which it indicated that the record before the MPUC did not reflect any specific allegations of wrongdoing. However, the MPUC instructed NSP-Minnesota and the OAG to resolve any
concerns and file a report with the MPUC. The report is pending.


North Dakota Rate Case

—In October 2000, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the NDPSC to increase natural
gas rates by approximately 3.3 percent, or $1.4 million, annually. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled for April 2001 with an order likely during the second quarter of 2001.

NSP-Wisconsin

Temporary Fuel Cost Surcharge

—

In May 2000, the PSCW issued an order
granting a fuel surcharge to increase electric rates to recover higher fuel costs. The increase was primarily the result of higher purchased power costs than were anticipated in base rates. The
surcharge factor increased revenues by approximately $6.4 million in 2000 and represented an average increase for all customer classes of approximately 2 percent. The surcharge factor is
expected to be effective through Dec. 31, 2001.

PSCo

Gas Rate Case

—In July 2000, PSCo filed a retail rate case with the CPUC requesting an annual
increase in its gas revenues of approximately $40 million. The request for a rate increase reflects revenues for additional plant investment, a 12.5-percent return on equity, new
depreciation rates and recovery of the dismantlement costs associated with the Leyden Gas Storage facility. In February 2001, the CPUC granted an increase in gas revenues of
$14.2 million and authorized an 11.25-percent return on equity. The CPUC did not grant the new depreciation rates proposed by PSCo, but rather granted new depreciation rates
proposed by the CPUC staff. The CPUC denied recovery of the dismantlement costs associated with the Leyden Gas Storage facility in this case and recommended PSCo request recovery in a later case.

SPS

Fuel Recovery

—

At least every three years, SPS is required to file an
application for the PUCT to retrospectively review the operations of a utility's electricity generation and fuel management activities. In June 2000, SPS filed an application for the PUCT to
retrospectively review the operations of the utility's electricity generation and fuel management activities. In this application, SPS filed its reconciliation for generation and fuel management
activities totaling approximately $419 million, for the period from January 1998 through December 1999. SPS expects to be granted recovery of these costs. Final approval is
pending.

SPS
filed an application in July 2000 seeking to increase its fixed fuel factors as a result of recent increases in natural gas costs. In August 2000, SPS filed a second
application seeking authority to surcharge approximately $26 million in fuel under-recoveries and related interest accrued through the June 2000 billing cycle over the eight months
ending May 2001. In August 2000, the PUCT consolidated these two filings into one docket. SPS reached a unanimous stipulation with all parties to the case resolving all outstanding
issues. This stipulation was approved by the PUCT in September 2000, which allowed the new fuel factors and surcharge factors to become effective in the October 2000 billing cycle.

In
October 2000, SPS filed an unopposed motion with the NMPRC, seeking to change the date for the implementation of its next fixed annual fuel factor. SPS was approximately
$12.8 million under-collected in fuel and purchased power costs through August 2000 and projected that these under-collections would continue based on recent increases in natural gas
costs. In October 2000, the NMPRC approved SPS' revised fixed annual fuel factor to be effective in the November 2000 billing cycle.

In
November 2000, SPS filed an application with the PUCT seeking authority to surcharge approximately $43 million in fuel under recoveries and related interest accrued
during July 2000 through September 2000. SPS reached a unanimous stipulation with all parties to the case resolving all outstanding issues. In January 2001, the PUCT approved the
surcharge and required amounts be applied to customers bills over an eleven-month period starting February 2001.


Cheyenne

On March 15, 2001, Cheyenne filed an application with the WPSC requesting approval to pass through to electric customers an increase in the cost of
electricity and transmission of $36 million for the remainder of 2001. The increase is requested to be effective April 15, 2001. The application follows a dramatic increase in Cheyenne's
contractual electric purchase costs. Normally, the full cost of these increases are passed through to customers on a dollar-for-dollar basis. However, as part of its
application, Cheyenne has requested approval to defer recovery of approximately $61 million of increased power costs for a period of five years. The WPSC has opened an investigation into the
proposed rate increased with hearings scheduled to begin April 2001. For more information on the increase in Cheyenne's purchase power costs, see Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7.

more information on regulatory matters, see Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7.

ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS

Competition and Industry Restructuring

Retail competition and the unbundling of regulated energy service could have a significant financial impact on Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, due to an
impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins and increased costs of capital. The total impacts of restructuring may have a significant financial impact on the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of Xcel Energy. Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries cannot predict when they will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can they
predict the impacts of such changes on their financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Xcel Energy believes that the prices its utility subsidiaries charge for electricity and the
quality and reliability of their service currently place them in a position to compete effectively in the energy market.

Retail Business Competition—

The retail electric business faces increasing competition as industrial and large commercial
customers have some ability to own or operate facilities to generate their own electric energy. In addition, customers may have the option of substituting other fuels, such as natural gas for heating,
cooling and manufacturing purposes, or the option of relocating their facilities to a lower cost environment. While each of Xcel Energy's utility subsidiaries face these challenges, these subsidiaries
believe their rates are competitive with currently available alternatives. Xcel Energy's utility subsidiaries are taking actions to lower operating costs and are working with their customers to
analyze energy efficiency, load management and cogeneration in order to better position Xcel Energy's utility subsidiaries to more effectively operate in a competitive environment.

Wholesale Business Competition—

The wholesale electric business faces increasing competition in the supply of bulk power,
due to federal and state initiatives to provide open access to utility transmission systems. Under current FERC rules, utilities are required to provide wholesale open-access transmission
services and to unbundle wholesale merchant and transmission operations. Xcel Energy's utility subsidiaries are operating under a joint tariff in compliance with these rules. To date, these provisions
have not had a material impact on the operations of Xcel Energy's utility subsidiaries.

NSP-Minnesota

Minnesota Restructuring

—During the summer of 2000, the Commerce Commissioner, Attorney General,
Senate Majority Leader and House Speaker all publicly identified the potential shortage in electric supply as a critical issue for the coming legislative session. Each of these leaders expressed
hesitation about adopting a comprehensive restructuring proposal, but they acknowledged the need for reforms in our power supply regulatory system. The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce still intends to
push for a comprehensive restructuring bill. Based on the recommendations made by the Department of Commerce in their report "Keeping the Lights On," it is likely that reform of utility taxation and
generation and transmission siting will be two of the issues debated by the 2001 Legislature.


North Dakota Restructuring

—In 1997, the North Dakota Legislature established an Electric Utility Committee charged with
studying the impact of competition on the electric industry. The committee has six years to study the impact of competition on the electric energy industry in the state. During 2000, the committee
began the study of the current tax structure on the industry. The committee was also given the responsibility for assessing the need for modifications to the Territorial Integrity Act, a law governing
distribution service territories within the state. The final report presented to the legislative council made no recommendations to change the current tax structure at the present time. The committee
will resume its work after the 2001 legislative session.

In
December 2000, the NDPSC approved Xcel Energy's "PLUS" Performance Based Regulation proposal, effective January 2001 for its electric operations in the state. The plan
establishes performance standards for reliability, customer service, price and employee safety. The company's performance determines its allowed return on equity. The plan also includes revenue
sharing and a price cap mechanism. The plan will remain in effect through 2005.

NSP-Wisconsin

Wisconsin Restructuring

—

During 1999, Wisconsin state lawmakers passed
"Reliability 2000" legislation, which included steps necessary to further progress toward a restructured industry, eventually including allowing retail customers to choose their electric supplier. One
of the provisions of the legislation establishes a public benefits fund, to be administered by the State of Wisconsin, which will use money collected from Wisconsin utilities' customers to pay for
low-income assistance, conservation programs and renewable energy and environmental research programs. NSP-Wisconsin began collecting the public benefits surcharge from its
Wisconsin customers in October 2000.

In
April 1998, Wisconsin state legislators enacted a law that includes provisions that require the PSCW to order a public utility that owns transmission facilities in Wisconsin
to transfer control of its transmission facilities to an independent system operator (ISO) or divest its interest in its transmission facilities to an independent transmission company (ITC) by
June 2000. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin joined the Midwest ISO (MISO) in 1999 and filed for PSCW and FERC approval in March 2000. The MISO is not expected to
be operational until November 2001. In June 2000, the PSCW issued an order that effectively waived the deadline for the state's five major utilities, including NSP-Wisconsin,
to relinquish transmission system control. In October 2000, the PSCW issued an order authorizing NSP-Wisconsin's transfer of operating control of its transmission system to the
MISO.

Michigan Restructuring

—

In June 2000, Michigan's "Customer Choice and Electricity Reliability
Act," became law. The passage of the Act means there will be customer choice for all customers in Michigan,
including NSP-Wisconsin's customers in the Upper Peninsula, starting January 2002. Key elements of the law include developing distribution reliability and performance standards and
environmental and fuel disclosure standards, codes of conduct, customer and employee education programs and an Upper Peninsula Market Power Study. The Act also contains a number of consumer protection
provisions dealing with cramming, slamming and low-income energy assistance. NSP-Wisconsin filed its preliminary restructuring plan in October 2000 and revisions to the
preliminary restructuring plan in February 2001. NSP-Wisconsin expects to file its unbundled rates by June 2001. The five-percent rate reduction and rate freeze
ordered in the Act does not apply to NSP-Wisconsin or other utilities with less than 1 million customers in Michigan.

PSCo

Colorado Restructuring

—

During 1998, a bill was passed in Colorado that
established an advisory panel to conduct an evaluation of electric industry restructuring and customer choice. During 1999, this panel concluded that Colorado would not significantly benefit from
opening its markets to retail competition.


SPS

New Mexico Restructuring—

In April 1999, New Mexico enacted the Electric Utility
Restructuring Act of 1999, which provides for customer choice. The legislation provides for recovery of no less than 50 percent of stranded costs for all utilities. Transition costs must be
approved by the NMPRC prior to being recovered through a non-bypassable wires charge, which must be included in transition plan filings. SPS must separate its utility operations into at
least two entities: energy generation and competitive services, and transmission and distribution utility services, either by the creation of separate affiliates that may be owned by a common holding
company or by the sale of assets to one or more third parties. A regulated company, in general, is prohibited from providing unregulated services. In May 2000, the NMPRC approved:

•

customer
choice for residential, small commercial and educational customers by January 2002;

•

customer
choice for commercial and industrial customers by July 2002; and

•

completion
of SPS corporate separation by August 2001.

The
NMPRC has reopened its electric restructuring rulemakings to consider the impacts on New Mexico electricity markets arising from the volatile California electricity market
conditions. In addition, in February 2001, the New Mexico Senate approved a bill that would delay the implementation of restructuring and retail choice until 2007. The House has yet to act on
the proposal to delay. We cannot predict the changes that may result from reconsideration of the restructuring legislation or the NMPRC's reconsideration of its regulations as a result of the
continuing and significant conditions in the California markets.

Texas Restructuring—

In June 1999, an electric utility restructuring act (SB-7) was passed in Texas,
which provides for the implementation of retail competition for most areas of the state, including SPS' service area, beginning January 2002. The PUCT can delay the date for full retail
competition if a power region is unable to offer fair competition and reliable service during the 2001 pilot projects. The legislation requires:

•

a
rate freeze for all customers until January 2002;

•

an
annual earnings test through 2001;

•

a
6-percent rate reduction for those residential and small commercial customers who choose not to switch suppliers at the start of retail
competition;

•

the
unbundling of business activities, costs and rates relating to generation, transmission and distribution, and retail services;

•

reductions
in nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions; and

•

the
recovery of stranded costs.

SB-7
requires each utility to unbundle its business activities into three separate legal entities: a power generation company, a regulated transmission and distribution
company, and a retail electric provider. SB-7 limits the market share that a single generation provider can control to 20 percent of the generating capacity within a qualified power
region. The establishment of a qualified power region with multiple generation suppliers is required under SB-7 in order to implement full retail competition. SPS
must return any excess earnings indicated in the annual earnings tests above its last allowed rate of return for 1999, 2000 and 2001 or alternatively may direct any excess earnings to improvements in
transmission and distribution facilities, to capital expenditures to improve air quality or to accelerate the amortization of regulatory assets, subject to PUCT approval.

The
Texas Legislature is currently considering amendments to SB-7 that would delay the implementation of business separation and customer choice in SPS' market area for
five years.


For more information on restructuring in Texas and New Mexico, see Note 12 to the Financial Statements under Item 8.

Kansas Restructuring

—In 1999, the Kansas Corporation Commission investigated the adequacy of generation capacity of Kansas
utilities. The Commission ordered the staff to continually monitor the generation capacity situation in Kansas, ensure the regular filing of information by utilities to meet their responsibility to
provide electric service to retail customers and consider the opening of a new docket for conservation appeals.

Oklahoma Restructuring

—The Electric Restructuring Act of 1997 was enacted in Oklahoma during 1997. This legislation directs
a series of studies, which will define the orderly transition to consumer choice of electric energy supplier by July 1, 2002. The Electric Restructuring Act was modified during 1998 to clarify
terms used in the original bill, as well as advance timelines for studies of the Joint Electric Utility Task Force in order to meet the stated implementation date. In 1998, this task force began the
formation of groups, which will examine numerous restructuring issues. A report was issued in 1999. The 2001 legislative session will consider the task force's findings as it considers issues related
to implementing customer choice in 2002.

Other

Wyoming Restructuring

—There were no electric industry restructuring legislation proposals
introduced in the Legislature during 2000. No action with respect to electric restructuring is anticipated in 2001.

Capacity and Demand

Assuming normal weather during 2001, system peak demand and the net dependable system capacity for Xcel Energy's electric utility subsidiaries are projected
below. The electric production and transmission system of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin are managed as an integrated system (referred to as the NSP System). The system peak
demand for each of the last three years and the forecast for 2001 is listed below.

The
peak demand for the NSP System, PSCo and SPS all typically occurs in the summer. The 2000 system peak demand for the NSP System occurred on Aug. 14, 2000. The 2000 system
peak demand for PSCo occurred on Aug. 9, 2000. The 2000 system peak demand for SPS occurred on Aug. 3, 2000. The system peak demand for the Cheyenne system occurs in the winter.

Energy Sources

Xcel Energy's utility subsidiaries expect to use the following resources to meet their net dependable system capacity requirements: 1) Xcel Energy's
electric generating stations, 2) purchases from other utilities, independent power producers and power marketers, 3) demand-side management options and 4) phased
expansion of existing generation at select power plants.

Purchased Power

Xcel Energy's electric utility subsidiaries have contractual arrangements to purchase power from other utilities and nonregulated energy suppliers. Capacity,
typically measured in kilowatts or megawatts, is the measure of the rate at which a particular generating source produces electricity.


Energy, typically measured in kilowatt-hours or megawatt-hours, is a measure of the amount of electricity produced from a particular generating source over a period of time. Purchase power contracts
typically provide for a charge for the capacity from a particular generating source and a charge for the associated energy actually purchased from such generating source.

The
utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy also make short-term and non-firm purchases to replace generation from company owned units that is unavailable due to
maintenance and unplanned outages, to provide each utility's reserve obligation, to obtain energy at a lower cost than that which could be produced by other resource options, including company owned
generation and/or long-term purchase power contracts, and for various other operating requirements.

NSP System Resource Plan

During 2000, NSP-Minnesota filed an electric resource plan for the NSP System with the MPUC for the period 2000 to 2015. The plan describes how
Xcel Energy intends to meet the energy needs of the NSP System and includes an approximate schedule of the timing of resource solicitation to meet such needs. The plan contains conservation programs
to reduce the NSP System's peak demand and conserve overall electricity use, an approximate schedule of power purchase solicitations to meet increasing demand and programs and plans to maintain the
reliable operation of existing resources. In summary, the plan:

•

forecasts
1.6-percent annual growth in the NSP System's energy and peak demand requirements;

•

outlines
NSP System's demand side management and conservation programs;

•

shows
new capacity needs of up to 600 megawatts by 2005 and 4,200 megawatts by 2015;

•

describes
the programs for achieving the mandated renewable energy sources of 425 megawatts of wind and 125 megawatts of biomass (NSP-Minnesota
contracted for all 125 megawatts of biomass energy, but 80 megawatts of wind energy remains to be contracted); and

•

updates
the status of spent nuclear fuel at the Prairie Island plant and describes how it can continue to operate through the end of its license given
different alternatives for storing spent nuclear fuel.

The
resource plan proposes to satisfy the NSP System resource needs through the following energy source options:

•

continued
use of existing generation facilities, including the repowering of Black Dog Units 1 and 2;

•

demand
reduction of an additional 910 megawatts by 2015 through conservation and load management;

•

megawatts of wind energy and 125 megawatt of biomass energy under contract by 2002; and

•

acquisition
of competitively priced resources through competitive bidding.

The
MPUC is currently reviewing this resource plan. Key issues are the amount of demand side management investment, nuclear spent fuel storage and its impact on future resource needs
and assumptions made regarding unaccounted for operating costs of wind. NSP-Minnesota expects the MPUC to issue an order about this resource plan in mid-2001.

PSCo Resource Plan

PSCo estimates it will purchase approximately 37 percent of its total electric system energy input for 2001. Approximately 36 percent of the
total system capacity for the summer 2001 system peak demand for PSCo will be provided by purchased power.


To meet the demand and energy needs of the rapidly growing economy in Colorado, PSCo recently completed a solicitation process that will add approximately 1,800 megawatts of resources
to its system over the 2002-2005 time period. PSCo expects that purchased capacity will continue to meet a significant portion of system requirements at least through 2016.

Purchased Transmission Services

Xcel Energy's electric utility subsidiaries have contractual arrangements with regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to the
subsidiaries' native load customers (retail and wholesale load obligations with terms of more than one year). Point-to-point transmission services typically include a charge
for the specific amount of transmission capacity being reserved, although some agreements may base charges on the amount of metered energy delivered. Network transmission services include a charge for
the metered demand at the delivery point at the time of the provider's monthly transmission system peak, usually calculated as a 12-month rolling average.

NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin

NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin normally maintain between 20 and 40 days of coal inventory at each plant site.
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have long-term contracts providing for the delivery of up to 100 percent of 2001 coal requirements and up to
70 percent of their 2002 requirements. Coal delivery may be subject to short-term interruptions or reductions due to transportation problems, weather and availability of equipment.

NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin expect that all of the coal they burn in 2001 will have a sulfur content of less than 1 percent.
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contracts for a maximum of 21.4 million tons of low-sulfur coal for the next two years. The contracts are with two
Montana coal suppliers and four Wyoming suppliers. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin could purchase


approximately 5 percent of their coal requirements in the spot market in 2001 and 45 percent of coal requirements in 2002 if spot prices are more favorable than contracted prices.

Estimated
coal requirements at NSP-Minnesota's major coal-fired generating plants and the coal supply for such requirements are approximately 12 million
tons per year, which is covered by contracts with expiration dates that vary between 2001 and 2003.

NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin's current fuel oil inventory is adequate and they have access to additional spot purchase supplies to meet anticipated 2001
requirements. Additional oil may be obtained through spot purchases.

To
operate NSP-Minnesota's nuclear generating plants, NSP-Minnesota secures contracts for uranium concentrates, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment and fuel
fabrication. The contract strategy involves a portfolio of spot purchases and medium- and long-term contracts for uranium, conversion and enrichment. Current contracts are flexible and
cover 100 percent of uranium, conversion and enrichment requirements through the year 2001. These contracts expire at varying times between 2001 and 2005. The overlapping nature of contract
commitments will allow NSP-Minnesota to maintain 50 percent to 100 percent coverage beyond 2001. NSP-Minnesota expects sufficient uranium, conversion and
enrichment to be available for the total fuel requirements of its nuclear generating plants. Fuel fabrication is 100 percent committed through 2004 and 30 percent committed through 2010.

PSCo

PSCo's primary fuel for its steam electric generating stations is low-sulfur western coal. PSCo's coal requirements are purchased primarily under
seven long-term contracts with suppliers operating in Colorado and Wyoming. During 2000, PSCo's coal requirements for existing plants were approximately 9.9 million tons, a
substantial portion of which was supplied pursuant to long-term supply contracts. Coal supply inventories at Dec. 31, 2000, were approximately 33 days usage, based on the
average burn rate for all of PSCo's coal-fired plants.

PSCo
operates the Hayden Station, and has partial ownership in the Craig Station, in Colorado. All of Hayden Station's generating requirements are supplied under a
long-term agreement. More than 75 percent of PSCo's Craig Station coal requirements are supplied under two long-term agreements. Any remaining Craig Station requirements
for PSCo are supplied via spot coal purchases.

PSCo
has secured more than 75 percent of Cameo Station's coal requirements for 2001 and 2002. Any remaining requirements may be purchased from this contract or the spot market.
PSCo has contracted
for long-term coal supplies to supply approximately 40 percent of the Cherokee and Valmont Stations' projected requirements in 2001. In addition, PSCo has contracted for
substantially all of Cherokee's and Valmont's remaining projected 2001 coal needs.

PSCo
has long-term coal supply agreements for the Pawnee and Comanche Stations' projected requirements. Under the long-term agreements, the supplier has
dedicated specific coal reserves at the contractually defined mines to meet the contract quantity obligations. In addition, PSCo has a coal supply agreement to supply approximately 80 percent
of Arapahoe Station's projected requirements for 2001. Any remaining Arapahoe Station requirements will be procured via spot purchases.

PSCo
uses both firm and interruptible natural gas and standby oil in combustion turbines and certain boilers. Natural gas supplies for PSCo's power plants are procured under short-
and intermediate-term contracts to provide an adequate supply of fuel.

SPS

SPS purchases all of its coal requirements for Harrington and Tolk electric generating stations from TUCO Inc., in the form of crushed,
ready-to burn coal delivered to SPS' plant bunkers. For the Harrington station the coal supply contract expires in 2016 and the coal-handling agreement expires in


2004. For the Tolk station, the coal supply contract expires in 2017 and the coal-handling agreement expires in 2005. At Dec. 31, 2000, coal inventories at the Harrington and Tolk
sites were approximately 30 and 32 days supply, respectively. TUCO has a long-term coal supply agreement to supply approximately 55 percent of Harrington's projected
requirements in 2001. TUCO has long term contracts for supply of coal in sufficient quantities to meet the primary needs of the Tolk station.

SPS
has a number of short and intermediate contracts with natural gas suppliers operating in gas fields with long life expectancies in or near its service area. SPS also utilizes firm
and interruptible transportation to minimize fuel costs during volatile market conditions and to provide reliability of supply. SPS maintains sufficient gas supplies under short- and
intermediate-term contracts to meet all power plant requirements; however, due to flexible contract terms, approximately 55 percent of SPS' gas requirements during 2000 were
purchased under spot agreements.

Nuclear Power Operations and Waste Disposal

NSP-Minnesota owns two nuclear generating plants: the Monticello plant and the Prairie Island plant. Monticello began operation in 1971 and is
licensed to operate until 2010. Prairie Island units 1 and 2 began operation in 1973 and 1974 and are licensed to operate until 2013 and 2014, respectively.

Nuclear
power plant operation produces gaseous, liquid and solid radioactive wastes. The discharge and handling of such wastes are controlled by federal regulation.
High-level radioactive waste includes used nuclear fuel. Low-level radioactive waste consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools and
equipment that has become contaminated through use in the plant.

Federal
law places responsibility on each state for disposal of its low-level radioactive waste. Low-level radioactive waste from NSP-Minnesota's
Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants is currently disposed of at the Barnwell facility, located in South Carolina (all classes of low-level waste), and the Clive facility, located
in Utah (class A low-level waste only). Chem Nuclear is the owner and operator of the Barnwell facility, which has been given authorization by South Carolina to accept
low-level radioactive waste from out of state. Envirocare, Inc. operates the Clive facility. NSP-Minnesota and Barnwell currently operate under an annual contract, while
NSP-Minnesota uses the Envirocare facility through various low-level waste processors. NSP-Minnesota has low-level storage capacity available
on-site at Prairie Island and Monticello that would allow both plants to continue to operate until the end of their licensed life, if off-site low-level disposal
facilities were not available to NSP-Minnesota.

The
federal government has the responsibility to dispose of, or permanently store, domestic spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive wastes. The Nuclear Waste
Policy Act requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to implement a program for nuclear waste management. This includes the siting, licensing, construction and operation of a repository for domestically
produced spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors and other high-level radioactive wastes at a permanent storage or disposal facility by 1998. None of
NSP-Minnesota's spent nuclear fuel has yet been accepted by the DOE for disposal. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings and Note 15 to the Financial Statements under Item 8 for
further discussion of this matter.

NSP-Minnesota
has on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel at its Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants. NSP-Minnesota has expanded the used
nuclear fuel storage facilities at its Monticello plant by replacement of the racks in the storage pool and by shipping 1,058 used fuel assemblies to a General Electric storage facility. The
Monticello plant is expected to have sufficient pool storage capacity to the end of its current operating license in 2010.

The
Prairie Island spent fuel pool has undergone two storage rack replacements. The on-site storage pool for spent nuclear fuel at Prairie Island was nearly filled and
adequate space was no longer
available. In 1994, a Minnesota law was enacted authorizing NSP-Minnesota to install 17 spent fuel casks for storage of spent nuclear fuel at Prairie Island. NSP-Minnesota has
determined 17 casks will allow facility operation until 2007. As of Dec. 31, 2000, 12 storage casks were loaded and stored on the


Prairie Island nuclear generating plant site. The Minnesota Legislature established several energy resource requirements and other commitments for NSP-Minnesota to obtain the Prairie
Island temporary nuclear fuel storage facility approval. NSP-Minnesota has implemented programs to meet the legislative commitments.

NSP-Minnesota
is part of a consortium of private parties working to establish a private facility for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. In 1997, Private Fuel Storage
LLC (PFS) filed a license application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a national temporary storage site for spent nuclear fuel. The PFS will undertake the development, licensing,
construction and operation of a storage facility on the Skull Valley Indian Reservation in Utah. The NRC license review process consists of formal evidentiary hearings and opportunity for public
input. Storage cask certification efforts are continuing, with one cask vendor on track to meet the project goals. The interim used fuel storage facility could be operational and able to accept the
first shipment of spent nuclear fuel by 2004. However, due to uncertainty regarding regulatory and governmental approvals, it is possible that this interim storage may be delayed or not available at
all.

In
March 2001, NSP-Minnesota signed a contract with Steam Generator Team Ltd. to perform engineering and construction services for the installation of
replacement generators at the Prairie Island nuclear power plant. NSP-Minnesota is evaluating the economics of replacing two 25-year-old steam generators on unit 1
at the plant. NSP-Minnesota is taking steps to preserve the replacement option for as early as 2004. The total cost of replacing the steam generators is estimated to be approximately
$132 million.

The
NRC has issued a number of regulations, bulletins and orders that require analyses, modification and additional equipment at commercial nuclear power plants. The NRC is engaged in
various ongoing studies and rulemaking activities that may impose additional requirements upon commercial nuclear power plants. Management is unable to predict any new requirements or their impact on
NSP-Minnesota's facilities and operations.

Nuclear Management Company (NMC)

During 1999, NSP-Minnesota, Wisconsin Electric Power Co., Wisconsin Public Service Corp. and Alliant Energy established the NMC. The four companies
operate seven nuclear units at five sites, with a total generation capacity exceeding 3,650 megawatts.

During
the second quarter of 2000, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved requests by NMC's four affiliated utilities to transfer operating authority for their five nuclear
plants to NMC. NMC responsibilities will include oversight of on-site dry storage facilities for used nuclear fuel at the Point Beach and Prairie Island nuclear plants. Utility plant
owners will continue to own the plants, control all energy produced by the plants and retain responsibility for nuclear liability insurance and decommissioning costs. Existing personnel will continue
to provide day-to-day plant operations, with the additional benefit of tapping into ideas from all NMC-operated plants for improved safety, reliability and
operational performance.

During
the third quarter of 2000, NMC and Consumers Energy (CE) reached an agreement for the NMC to operate CE's 789-megawatt Palisades nuclear plant in Covert, Mich. The
addition of Palisades gives NMC 4,500 megawatts of generation, making it the sixth largest operator of nuclear plants in the United States.

For
further discussion of nuclear issues, see Note 14 and Note 15 to the Financial Statements under Item 8.

GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS

Competition and Industry Restructuring

In the early 1990's, the FERC issued Order No. 636, which mandated unbundling interstate natural gas pipeline services—sales,
transportation, storage and ancillary services. The implementation of Order No. 636 has resulted in additional competitive pressure on all local distribution companies (LDC) to keep gas supply
and transmission prices for their large customers competitive. Customers have greater ability to buy gas directly from suppliers and arrange their own pipeline and LDC transportation service. Changes
in regulatory policies and market forces have shifted the industry from traditional bundled gas sales service to an unbundled transportation and market based commodity service.

The
natural gas delivery or transportation business has remained competitive as industrial and large commercial customers have the ability to bypass the local gas utility through the
construction of


interconnections directly with, and the purchase of gas directly from, interstate pipelines, thereby avoiding the delivery charges added by the local gas utility. The gas utility subsidiaries of Xcel
Energy have and will continue to aggressively pursue the retention of all customers on their systems.

NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin provide unbundled transportation service to large customers. Transportation service does not have an adverse effect on earnings
because NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin's sales and transportation rates have been designed to make NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin economically
indifferent to whether gas has been sold and transported or merely transported. However, some transportation customers may have greater opportunities or incentives to physically bypass the LDC
distribution system.

PSCo
provides unbundled transportation service to large customers. and has participated fully in state regulatory and legislative efforts to develop a framework for extending
unbundling down to the residential and small commercial level. PSCo supported a gas unbundling bill, passed by the Colorado Legislature in 1999, that provides the CPUC the authority and responsibility
to approve voluntary unbundling plans submitted by Colorado gas utilities in the future. PSCo has not filed a plan to open its natural gas supply business to competition and continues to evaluate its
business opportunities for doing so.

PSCo
and Cheyenne extend and operate their distribution systems primarily by virtue of non-exclusive franchises granted by the various cities and towns. Their respective
state commissions approve such franchise agreements. Because the franchises are non-exclusive, PSCo and Cheyenne can be faced with the threat of intrusion into their gas territory by third
parties. PSCo holds territorial certificates for a portion of their gas service territory, giving them the exclusive right to extend their distribution system and provide natural gas sales and
transportation service. However, for the majority of their gas service territory, no such territorial certificates exist. PSCo has filed with the CPUC an application to certify its gas service
territory along the front range of Colorado. PSCo is pursuing settlement negotiations and expects a resolution during 2001.

Capability and Demand

NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin

Xcel Energy categorizes its gas supply requirements as firm or interruptible (customers with an alternate energy supply). The maximum daily sendout (firm and
interruptible) for the combined system of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin was 730,026 mmBtu for 2000, which occurred on Dec. 11, 2000.

NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin purchase gas from independent suppliers. The gas is delivered under gas transportation agreements with interstate pipelines.
These agreements provide for firm deliverable pipeline capacity of approximately 630,000 mmBtu/day. In addition, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contracted with providers
of underground natural gas storage services. Using storage reduces the need for firm pipeline capacity. These storage agreements provide storage for approximately 16 percent of annual and
23 percent of peak daily, firm requirements of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin.

NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin also own and operate two liquified natural gas (LNG) plants with a storage capacity of 2.5 bcf equivalent and four
propane-air plants with a storage capacity of 1.4 bcf equivalent to help meet its peak requirements. These peak-shaving facilities have production capacity equivalent to
246,000 mcf of natural gas per day, or approximately 32 percent of peak day firm requirements. LNG and propane-air plants provide a cost-effective alternative to annual
fixed pipeline transportation charges to meet the peaks caused by firm space heating demand on extremely cold winter days and can be used to minimize daily imbalance fees on interstate pipelines.

Gas
utilities in Minnesota are required to file for a change in gas supply contract levels to meet peak demand, to redistribute demand costs among classes, or exchange one form of
demand for another. In July 2000, the MPUC approved NSP's 1999-2000 entitlement levels, which allow NSP-Minnesota to recover the demand entitlement costs associated with
the increase in transportation


and storage levels in its monthly PGA. NSP-Minnesota's filing for approval of its 2000-2001 entitlement levels is pending MPUC action.

PSCo and Cheyenne

PSCo and Cheyenne project peak day gas supply requirements for firm sales and backup transportation (transportation customers contracting for firm supply
backup) to be 1,639,899 mmBtu. In addition, firm transportation customers hold 379,882 mmBtu of capacity without supply backup. Total firm delivery obligations for PSCo and Cheyenne are 2,019,781
mmBtu per day. The maximum daily deliveries for both companies for 2000 (firm and interruptible services) were 1,612,589 mmBtu on Dec. 11, 2000.

PSCo
and Cheyenne purchase gas from independent suppliers. The gas supplies are delivered to the respective delivery systems through a combination of transportation agreements with
interstate pipelines and deliveries by suppliers directly to each company. These agreements provide for firm deliverable pipeline capacity of 1,193,821 mmBtu/day, which includes 731,960 mmBtu of
supplies held under third-party storage agreements. In addition, PSCo operates three company-owned storage facilities, which
provide about 147,980 mmBtu of gas supplies on a peak day. The balance of the quantities required to meet firm peak day sales obligations are primarily purchased at the companies' citygate meter
stations and a small amount received directly from wellhead sources.

PSCo
has received approval to abandon one if its three storage facilities, Leyden Storage Field, beginning October 2001. The field's 110,000 mmBtu peak day capacity will be
replaced in 2001 with additional third-party storage and transportation capacity.

PSCo
is required by CPUC regulations to file a gas purchase plan by June of each year projecting and describing the quantities of gas supplies, upstream services and the costs
of those supplies and services for the period beginning July 1 through June 30 of the following year. PSCo is also required to file a gas purchase report by October of each year
reporting actual quantities and costs incurred for gas supplies and upstream services for the 12-month period ending the previous June 30. PSCo has filed the required Plans with the
CPUC, which is reviewing the gas purchase report for the period July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000.

Gas Supply and Costs

Xcel Energy's gas utilities actively seek gas supply, transportation and storage alternatives to yield a diversified portfolio that provides increased
flexibility, decreased interruption and financial risk, and economical rates. This diversification involves numerous domestic and Canadian supply sources, with varied contract lengths.


The following table summarizes the average cost per mmBtu of gas purchased for resale by Xcel Energy's regulated retail gas distribution business.

The
cost of gas supply, transportation service and storage service is recovered through various cost recovery adjustment mechanisms.

NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin

NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have firm gas transportation contracts with several pipelines, which expire in various years from 2001
through 2013. Approximately 80 percent of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin's retail gas customers are served from the Northern Natural pipeline system.

In
addition to fixed transportation charge obligations, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have entered into firm gas supply agreements that provide for the
payment of monthly or annual reservation charges irrespective of the volume of gas purchased. The total annual obligation is approximately $18 million. These agreements allow
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin to purchase natural gas at a high load factor at rates below the prevailing market price, reducing the total cost per mmBtu.

NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin have certain gas supply and transportation agreements that include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified
volumes of gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery. At Dec. 31, 2000, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin were committed to approximately $221 million in such
obligations under these contracts, which range from the years 2001-2013. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have negotiated market out clauses in their new supply
agreements, which reduce purchase obligations if NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin no longer provide merchant gas service.

NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin purchase firm gas supply from approximately 30 domestic and Canadian suppliers under contracts with durations of one year to
10 years. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin purchase no more than 20 percent of their total daily supply from any single supplier. This diversity of suppliers and
contract lengths allows NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin to maintain competition from suppliers and minimize supply costs.

NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin have completed substantially all of their obligations related to gas supply transportation and storage contracts that resulted
from FERC Order 636.

PSCo and Cheyenne

PSCo and Cheyenne have attempted to maintain low-cost, reliable natural gas supplies by optimizing a balance of long-term and
short-term gas purchases, firm transportation and gas storage contracts. During 2000, PSCo and Cheyenne purchased natural gas from approximately 47 suppliers.

PSCo
and Cheyenne have completed substantially all of their obligations related to gas supply transportation and storage contracts that resulted from FERC Order 636. PSCo and Cheyenne
have entered into new contracts for firm transportation and gas storage services. Adequate supplies of natural gas are currently available for delivery within the region. PSCo and Cheyenne continually
evaluate the natural gas markets and procure supplies, as needed, to meet current and anticipated customer demand.

Viking

During 1999, Viking, WICOR and CMS Energy Corp. announced plans to build an interstate natural gas pipeline to serve the growing needs of the northern Illinois
and southeastern Wisconsin


markets. The three energy companies each own an equal share of the pipeline. The project, called the Guardian Pipeline, will transport natural gas from a hub near Joliet, Ill. to the Ixonia, Wis.,
area. In March 2001, the FERC issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the Guardian pipeline. The estimated cost of the
147-mile pipeline is $230 million and is expected to be in operation by late 2002.

ITEM 3—LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the normal course of business, various lawsuits and claims have arisen against Xcel Energy. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, has recorded
an estimate of the probable cost of settlement or other disposition for such matters.

On
June 8, 1998, NSP-Minnesota filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims against the DOE requesting damages in excess of $1 billion for the DOE's
partial breach of the Standard Contract. NSP-Minnesota requested damages consisting of the costs of storage of spent nuclear fuel at the Prairie Island nuclear generating plant,
anticipated costs related to the Private Fuel Storage, LLC and costs relating to the 1994 state legislation limiting the number of casks that can be used to store spent nuclear fuel at Prairie Island.
On April 6, 1999, the Court of Federal Claims dismissed NSP-Minnesota's complaint. On May 20, 1999, NSP-Minnesota appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit. On Aug. 31, 2000, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and remanded to the Court of Federal Claims. On Dec. 26, 2000, NSP-Minnesota filed a motion
with the Court of Federal Claims to amend its complaint and renew its motion for summary judgment on the DOE's liability. These motions are pending before the Court of Federal Claims. On
Jan. 9, 2001, the DOE filed a motion with the Chief Judge for the Court of Federal Claims asking that all cases against the DOE arising out of alleged breaches of the Standard Contract be
reassigned to one judge. The DOE also asked for the extraordinary remedy of binding parties not currently party to an action before the Court of Claims to a determination in the proposed consolidated
action. This motion is pending before the Court of Federal Claims.

In
April 1997, a fire damaged several buildings in downtown Grand Forks, N. D., during a flood in the city. On July 23, 1998, the St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co.
commenced a lawsuit against NSP-Minnesota for damages in excess of $15 million. The suit was filed in the District Court in Grand Forks County in North Dakota. The insurance company
alleged the fire was electrical in origin and that NSP-Minnesota was legally responsible for the fire because it failed to shut off electrical power to downtown Grand Forks during the
flood and prior to the fire. Seven additional lawsuits were filed against NSP-Minnesota by insurance companies that insured businesses damaged by the fire. One additional lawsuit was filed
by a bank. The total of damages sought by all these lawsuits was in excess of $30 million. NSP-Minnesota denied any liability. On Sept. 8, 2000, the jury returned a defense
verdict in favor of NSP-Minnesota. The plaintiffs did not appeal this verdict.

In
1997, NSP-Wisconsin was served with a summons and complaint on behalf of the owners of Schachtner Farms located in Deer Park, Wis. The complaint alleged that stray
voltage from NSP-Wisconsin's system harmed their dairy herd, resulting in lost milk production, injury to the dairy herd, lost profits and increased veterinary expenses. On Nov. 23,
1999, the jury returned a verdict finding NSP-Wisconsin negligent and awarding Schachtner Farms $850,000 for economic damages and $200,000 for inconvenience, annoyance and loss of use and
enjoyment of their property plus costs and interest. The Court trebled the damages because the jury found that NSP-Wisconsin was willful, wanton or reckless in its failure to provide
adequate service to the farm. NSP-Wisconsin has appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals, Third District, of the State of Wisconsin. The claim was resolved on Dec. 20, 2000, on
a confidential basis. NSP-Wisconsin's contribution to the settlement was reduced by insurance coverage.

For
a discussion of other legal claims and environmental proceedings, see Note 14 to the Financial Statements under Item 8, incorporated by reference. For a discussion of
proceedings involving utility rates, see "Regulatory Matters" under Item 1, and Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7, all incorporated by reference.

ITEM 7—MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

On Aug. 18, 2000, New Century Energies, Inc. (NCE) and Northern States Power Co. (NSP) merged and formed Xcel Energy Inc. Xcel Energy, a
Minnesota corporation, is a registered holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA). Each share of NCE common stock was exchanged for 1.55 shares of Xcel Energy common stock.
NSP shares became Xcel Energy shares on a one-for-one basis. The merger was structured as a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange for
shareholders of both companies (except for fractional shares) and accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. As part of the merger, NSP transferred its existing utility operations that were being
conducted directly by NSP at the parent company level to a newly formed subsidiary of Xcel Energy named Northern States Power Company.

Xcel
Energy directly owns six utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in 12 states. These six utility subsidiaries are Northern States Power Company, a
Minnesota corporation (NSP-Minnesota); Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation (NSP-Wisconsin); Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo); Southwestern Public
Service Company (SPS); Black Mountain Gas Company (BMG); and Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Company (Cheyenne). Their service territories include portions of Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Michigan,
Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Xcel Energy's regulated businesses also include Viking Gas Transmission Company and WestGas
InterState Inc. (WGI), both interstate natural gas pipeline companies.

Xcel
Energy also owns or has an interest in a number of nonregulated businesses, the largest of which is NRG Energy, Inc., a publicly traded, independent power producer. Xcel
Energy indirectly owns 82 percent of NRG. Xcel Energy owned 100 percent of NRG until the second quarter of 2000, when NRG completed its initial public offering. NRG expects to issue
additional common stock during March 2001, which will cause Xcel Energy's ownership interest in NRG to decline. For more information, see NRG Initial Public Offering discussed under Liquidity
and Capital Resources.

In
addition to NRG, Xcel Energy's nonregulated subsidiaries include Seren Innovations, Inc. (broadband telecommunications services), e prime, inc. (natural gas marketing
and trading), Planergy International, Inc. (energy management, consulting and demand-side management services) and Eloigne Company (acquisition of rental housing projects that
qualify for low-income housing tax credits). Xcel Energy also reports in its nonregulated activities its 50-percent stake in Yorkshire Power, a regional
electric company in the United Kingdom. Subsequent to year end, Xcel Energy has agreed to sell a substantial portion of this investment. For more information, see Note 11 to the Financial
Statements.

Xcel
Energy owns the following additional direct subsidiaries, some of which are intermediate holding companies with additional subsidiaries: Xcel Energy Wholesale Energy
Group Inc., Xcel Energy Markets Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy International Inc., Xcel Energy Ventures Inc., Xcel Energy Retail Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy
Communications Group Inc., Xcel Energy WYCO Inc. and Xcel Energy O & M Services Inc. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as Xcel Energy.

XCEL ENERGY'S MISSION AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES

Xcel Energy's mission is to provide energy and service solutions that advance the productivity and lifestyle of our customers, foster growth of our employees
and enhance value for our shareholders.

Xcel
Energy's guiding principles include: focusing on the customer, respecting people, managing with facts, continually improving our business, focusing on the prevention of problems
and promoting a safe and challenging work environment.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

The following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on Xcel Energy's financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows during the periods


presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Financial Statements and Notes.

Except
for the historical statements contained in this report, the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis are forward-looking statements that are subject to
certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Such forward-looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "objective," "outlook,"
"possible," "potential" and similar expressions. Actual results may vary materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: general economic
conditions, including their impact on capital expenditures and the ability of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries to obtain financing on favorable terms; business conditions in the energy industry;
competitive factors, including the extent and timing of
the entry of additional competition in the markets served by Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries; unusual weather; state, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives that affect cost and
investment recovery, have an impact on rate structures and affect the speed and degree to which competition enters the electric and natural gas markets; the higher risk associated with Xcel Energy's
nonregulated businesses compared with its regulated businesses; currency translation and transaction adjustments; risks associated with the California power market; the items described under "Factors
Affecting Results of Operations;" and the other risk factors listed from time to time by Xcel Energy in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Exhibit 99.04
to Xcel Energy's Report on Form 8-K dated Aug. 21, 2000.

significant factors that had an impact on earnings, see below.

Significant Factors that Impacted 2000 Results

Special Charges

Xcel Energy's earnings for 2000 were reduced by 52 cents per share for special charges related to the
merger to form Xcel Energy. During the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2000, Xcel Energy expensed pretax special charges of $241 million, or 52 cents per share, for costs related to the
merger between NSP and NCE. Of these special charges, approximately 44 cents per share were associated with the costs of merging regulated operations and 8 cents per share were associated with merger
impacts on nonregulated activities. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements for more information on these charges.

Xcel
Energy has completed the majority of its merger-related transition and integration activities in 2000 and expects to fully realize in 2001 and future years the operating
synergies anticipated from the merger of NSP and NCE. Xcel Energy does not expect to incur any additional merger costs after 2000.

Extraordinary Items—Electric Utility Restructuring

Xcel Energy's earnings for 2000 were reduced by 6 cents
per share for two extraordinary items related to the discontinuation of regulatory accounting for SPS' generation business. During the second quarter of 2000, SPS wrote off its generation-related
regulatory assets and other deferred costs for an extraordinary charge of approximately $19.3 million


before tax, or $13.7 million after tax. During the third quarter of 2000, SPS recorded an additional extraordinary charge of $8.2 million before tax, or $5.3 million after tax,
related to the tender offer and defeasance of approximately $295 million of first mortgage bonds. For more information, see Note 12 to the Financial Statements.

Significant Factors that Impacted 1999 Results

Conservation Incentive Recovery

Earnings for 1999 were reduced by 7 cents per share due to the disallowance of 1998
conservation incentives for NSP-Minnesota. In June 1999, the Minnesota Public
Utilities Commission (MPUC) denied NSP-Minnesota recovery of 1998 lost margins, load management discounts and incentives associated with state-mandated programs for electric energy
conservation. Xcel Energy recorded a $35 million charge in 1999 based on this action. NSP-Minnesota appealed the MPUC decision and in December 2000, the Minnesota Court of
Appeals reversed the MPUC decision.

In
January 2001, the MPUC appealed the lower court decision to the Minnesota Supreme Court. On Feb. 23, 2001, the Minnesota Supreme Court declined to hear the MPUC's
appeal. NSP-Minnesota is awaiting an order from the MPUC regarding the implementation of the appeals court decision before adjusting any liabilities recorded for this matter. As of
Dec. 31, 2000, NSP-Minnesota had recorded a liability of $40 million, including carrying charges, for potential refunds to customers pending the final resolution of this
matter.

In
addition, based on the 1999 change in MPUC policy on conservation incentives and regulatory uncertainty, beginning in 1999 management discontinued the accrual of conservation
incentives other than those approved by the MPUC.

Special Charges

During 1999, Xcel Energy expensed pretax special charges of $31 million, or 7 cents per share,
stemming from asset impairments related to goodwill and marketable securities associated with nonregulated activities. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements for more information on these
charges.

NRG's
earnings for 2000 in this report exclude earnings of approximately 8 cents per share related to minority interests.

NRG

NRG's earnings for 2000 benefited from increased electric revenues resulting from recently acquired generation
assets. During 2000, NRG increased its megawatt ownership interest in generating facilities in operation by more than 4,000 megawatts. NRG's earnings for 2000 were also influenced by
favorable weather conditions that increased demand for electricity in the northeast and western United States, market dynamics, strong performance from existing assets and higher market prices for
electricity. As a consequence of the dynamics in the electricity markets during 2000, NRG's earnings contribution to Xcel Energy is estimated to have been approximately 8 cents per share more for the
year than would occur under normal circumstances, and there can be no assurance that such dynamics will occur again. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a description of recent lawsuits
against


NRG and other power producers and marketers involving the California electricity markets and a discussion of NRG's receivables related to the California power market.

e prime

e prime's results for 2000 were reduced by special charges, recorded during the third quarter, of 2 cents per
share for contractual obligations and other costs associated with post-merger changes in the strategic operations and related revaluations of e prime's energy marketing business.

Seren Innovations

As expected, Seren's expansion of its broadband communications network in Minnesota and California
resulted in increased losses for 2000.

Planergy International

Planergy's results for 2000 were reduced by special charges of 4 cents per share for the
write-offs of goodwill and project development costs. During the third quarter of 2000, Planergy and Energy Masters International (EMI), both wholly owned subsidiaries of Xcel Energy, were
combined to form Planergy International. As a result of this combination, Planergy reassessed its business model and made a strategic realignment, which resulted in the write-off of
$22 million (before tax) of goodwill and project development costs.

In
addition, Planergy's results for 1999 were reduced by a special charge of 4 cents per share to write off goodwill that was recorded for EMI's acquisitions of Energy Masters Corp.
in 1995 and Energy Solutions International in 1997. EMI wrote off approximately $17 million of goodwill (before tax) during the fourth quarter of 1999.

Financing Costs and Preferred Dividends

Nonregulated results include interest expense and preferred dividends, which
are incurred at the Xcel Energy and intermediate holding company levels and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries.

Other

Other nonregulated results for 2000 were reduced by special charges of 2 cents per share recorded during the
third quarter. These special charges include $10 million in asset write-downs and losses resulting from various other nonregulated business ventures that are no longer being pursued.

In
addition, other nonregulated results for 1999 were reduced by special charges of 3 cents per share for a valuation write-down of Xcel Energy's investment in the
publicly traded common stock of CellNet Data Systems, Inc.

Income Statement Analysis

Electric Utility Margins

The following table details the changes in electric utility revenue and margin. Electric production expenses tend to vary with changing retail and wholesale
sales requirements and unit cost changes in fuel and purchased power. Due to fuel clause cost recovery mechanisms for retail customers in several states, most fluctuations in energy costs do not
materially affect electric margin. However, the fuel cost recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions do not allow for complete recovery of all variable production expenses and, therefore, higher
costs can result in an adverse margin and earnings impact.

Electric
revenue increased by approximately $758 million, or 15.4 percent, in 2000. Electric margin increased by approximately $149 million, or
5.0 percent, in 2000. Electric margins reflect the impact of
customer sharing due to the incentive cost adjustment (ICA). Weather normalized retail sales increased by 3.6 percent in 2000, increasing retail revenue by approximately $153 million and
retail margin by approximately $88 million. More favorable temperatures during 2000 increased retail revenue by approximately $36 million and retail margin by approximately
$22 million. These retail margin increases were partially offset by regulatory adjustments, relating to the earnings test in Texas and system reliability and availability in Colorado.
Short-term wholesale revenue and margin increased due to the expansion of Xcel Energy's wholesale marketing operations and favorable market conditions.

Electric
revenue decreased by approximately $62 million, or 1.2 percent, and electric margin decreased by approximately $48 million, or 1.6 percent, in
1999. Retail revenue and margin also decreased due to the disallowance of 1998 conservation incentives in Minnesota, which reduced retail revenue and margin by $78 million compared with 1998.
The disallowance of 1998 conservation incentives was recorded during 1999, as a result of the timing of an MPUC decision.

Despite
customer growth, retail sales increased only 0.5 percent, largely due to mild weather in Colorado and Texas. In addition, retail margin was reduced by approximately
$19 million in 1999 due to higher purchased power costs in Minnesota and Wisconsin not recoverable in rates. Electric revenue decreased due to lower short-term wholesale revenue
reflecting market conditions.

Gas Utility Margins

The following table details the changes in gas utility revenue and margin. The cost of gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of
gas purchases. However, due to purchased gas cost recovery mechanisms for retail customers, fluctuations in the cost of gas have little effect on gas margin.

Gas
revenue increased by approximately $328 million, or 28.7 percent, in 2000, primarily due to increases in the cost of natural gas, which are largely
recovered through various adjustment clauses in most of the jurisdictions in which Xcel Energy operates. Gas margin increased by approximately $63 million, or 13.8 percent, in 2000. More
favorable temperatures during 2000 increased gas revenue by approximately $82 million and gas margins by approximately $33 million.

Gas
revenue increased by approximately $31 million, or 2.8 percent, and margin increased by approximately $7 million, or 1.6 percent, in 1999, largely due
to increased retail sales, which increased 3.2 percent compared with 1998. In addition, gas revenue and margin in 1999 increased due to higher base rates resulting from PSCo's 1998 rate case,
which became effective in July 1999.

Electric and Gas Trading Margins

Xcel Energy's trading operations are conducted mainly by PSCo and e prime. Trading revenues and costs of goods sold do not include the revenue and production
costs associated with energy produced from generation assets or results from NRG. The following table details the changes in electric and gas trading revenue and margin.

Nonregulated
and other revenue increased by approximately $1.5 billion in 2000, largely due to NRG's acquisition of generation facilities during 2000 and the
full-year impact of generating assets acquired during 1999. Earnings from equity investments increased by approximately $71 million in 2000, primarily due to increased equity
earnings from NRG projects. The increase in NRG equity earnings is primarily due to increased earnings from its investments in West Coast Power LLC and Rocky Road LLC, which benefited from warmer
weather conditions and market dynamics. Nonregulated margin increased by approximately $861 million in 2000, largely due to NRG's acquisition of generation facilities during 2000. NRG's revenue
and margin also increased as a consequence of the dynamics in the electricity markets in which NRG operated in during 2000, and there can be no assurance that such dynamics will occur again. For more
information, see Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a description of recent lawsuits against NRG and other power producers and marketers involving the California electricity markets and a
discussion of NRG's receivables related to the California power market.

Nonregulated
and other revenue increased by approximately $307 million in 1999, largely due to NRG's acquisition of generation facilities during 1999 in the Northeast region of
the United States. Earnings from equity investments decreased by approximately $4 million, or 3.4 percent, in 1999, primarily due to lower earnings from NRG's West Coast power generating
affiliate as a result of cool summer weather during 1999 compared with the summer of 1998. Nonregulated margin increased by approximately $184 million in 1999, largely due to NRG's acquisition
of generation facilities during 1999 in the Northeast region of the United States.

Non-Fuel Operating Expense and Other Items

Other utility operating and maintenance expense for 2000 increased by approximately $71 million, or 5.3 percent, compared with 1999. The increase
is largely due to the timing of outages at the Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants and at the Sherco coal-fired power plant, increased bad debt reserves related to wholesale and
retail customers, increased transmission costs in the Southwest Power Pool, start-up costs to establish the Nuclear Management Co. and higher employee-related costs. Other utility
operation and maintenance expense decreased approximately $27 million, or 2.0 percent, in 1999, primarily due to lower benefit costs and cost-control efforts.

Nonregulated
other operation and maintenance expense increased by approximately $354 million in 2000 and $79 million in 1999. These increases are primarily due to costs
of operations acquired, increased business development activities and legal, technical and accounting expenses resulting from NRG's expanding operations. In addition, costs also increased due to
Seren's expansion of its broadband communications network in Minnesota and California.


Depreciation and amortization expense increased $113 million, or 16.6 percent, in 2000 and $52 million, or 8.4 percent, in 1999, primarily due to
acquisitions of generating facilities by NRG and increased additions to utility plant.

During
1998, NRG recorded gains of approximately $26 million on the partial sale of NRG's interest in the Enfield project and approximately $2 million on the sale of
NRG's interest in the Mid-Continent Power facility.

Interest
expense increased $243 million, or 58.7 percent, in 2000 and $70 million, or 20.2 percent, in 1999, primarily due to increased debt levels to
finance several asset acquisitions by NRG.

Weather

Xcel Energy's earnings can be significantly affected by weather. Unseasonably hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, but can also
increase expenses, which may not be fully recoverable. Unseasonably mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The following summarizes the estimated impact on the earnings of the utility
subsidiaries of Xcel Energy due to temperature variations from historical averages.

•

Weather
in 2000 increased earnings by an estimated 1 cent per share.

•

Weather
in 1999 decreased earnings by an estimated 9 cents per share.

•

Weather
in 1998 decreased earnings by an estimated 4 cents per share.

Factors Affecting Results of Operations

Xcel Energy's utility revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions, general business conditions and the cost of energy services.
Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and gas service within their respective jurisdictions. In addition, Xcel Energy's nonregulated businesses are becoming a more significant
factor in Xcel Energy's earnings. The historical and future trends of Xcel Energy's operating results have been and are expected to be affected by the following factors:

Competition and Industry Restructuring

The structure of the electric and natural gas utility industry continues to change rapidly. Many states are implementing retail competition with an unbundling
of regulated energy services. Merger and acquisition activity over the past few years has been significant as utilities combine to capture economies of scale and/or establish a strategic niche in
preparing for the future. Some regulated utilities are divesting generation assets. All utilities are required to provide non-discriminatory access to the use of their transmission
systems. The transition to this competitive environment will be extremely challenging during the next few years and will most likely have significant impacts on the industry.

Some
states have begun to allow retail customers to choose their electricity supplier, and many other states are considering retail access proposals. Four states in our service
territory—Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Michigan—currently are expected to allow customers to choose their electricity supplier in 2002. In Texas, a pilot restructuring
program is scheduled to begin in June 2001, with expanded retail competition beginning January 2002. In New Mexico, retail competition is scheduled to begin in January 2002 for
some customers and July for the rest. In Oklahoma, a 1997 restructuring law provides for customer choice by July 2002, pending further action from the Oklahoma Legislature. In Michigan,
customer choice is expected to begin in January 2002. Following the supply and price disruptions in California, restructuring initiatives may be delayed or modified in some of the states in
which we operate.

Major
issues that must be addressed include mitigating market power, divestiture of generation capacity, transmission constraints, legal separation, the refinancing of securities,
modification of mortgage indentures, implementation of procedures to govern affiliate transactions, investments in information technology and the pricing of unbundled services, all of which have
significant financial


implications. Xcel Energy cannot predict the outcome of its restructuring proceedings at this time. The resolution of these matters may have a significant impact on the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of Xcel Energy. For more information on restructuring in Texas and New Mexico, see Note 12 to the Financial Statements.

With
respect to Xcel Energy's other primary regulatory jurisdictions, the Minnesota Legislature continues to study industry restructuring issues, but has determined that further study
is necessary before any action can be taken. During 1998, an electric restructuring bill was passed in Colorado that established an advisory panel to conduct an evaluation of restructuring. During
1999, this panel concluded that Colorado should not open its markets to competition. The Wisconsin Legislature has been focusing its efforts on improving electric reliability by requiring utility
infrastructure improvements prior to addressing customer choice.

California Power Market

NRG operates in and sells to the wholesale power market in California. During the fourth quarter of 2000, the inability of certain California utilities to
recover rising energy costs through regulated prices charged to retail customers created financial difficulties. The California utilities have appealed to state agencies and regulators for the
opportunity to be reimbursed for costs incurred that are not currently recoverable through the existing rate structure. Absent such relief, some of the utilities have indicated they may be unable to
continue to service their debt and/or otherwise pay obligations, or would consider discontinuing energy service to customers to avoid incurring costs that are not recoverable. Due to these
circumstances, various bond rating agencies have lowered the credit rating of the California utilities to below investment grade. California state agencies and regulators, along with federal agencies
such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) have characterized the situation as a national emergency. Although changes may be necessary in the California utility regulatory model to
address the problem in the long run, in the short term the alternatives being discussed include financial support for distressed utilities to ensure continued energy service to California customers.
However, at this time it is unknown whether or when such financial support will be made available to California utilities.

As
of Dec. 31, 2000, approximately 11 percent of NRG's net megawatts of operating projects and construction were located in California. NRG expects this percentage of
net megawatts in California to
decline to 7 percent by the end of 2001. In addition, Xcel Energy's wholesale trading operation sells power to California. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a description of
recent lawsuits against NRG and other power producers and marketers involving the California electricity markets and a discussion of Xcel Energy and NRG's receivables related to the California power
market.

Cheyenne Purchase Power Agreement

For the past 37 years, Cheyenne has purchased all energy requirements from PacifiCorp. Cheyenne's full-requirements power purchase agreement
with PacifiCorp expired in December 2000. During 2000, Cheyenne issued a request for proposal and conducted negotiations with PacifiCorp and other wholesale power suppliers. During 2000, as
contract details for a new agreement were being finalized, supply conditions and market prices in the western United States dramatically changed. Cheyenne was unable to execute an agreement with
PacifiCorp for the prices and terms Cheyenne had been negotiating. Additionally, PacifiCorp failed to provide the FERC and Cheyenne a 60-day notice to terminate service, as required by the
Federal Power Act. Cheyenne filed a complaint with the FERC, requesting that PacifiCorp continue providing service under the existing tariff through the 60-day notice period. On
Feb. 7, 2001, the FERC issued an order requiring PacifiCorp to provide service under the terms of the old contract through Feb. 24, 2001.

Cheyenne
has begun implementing the changes required to transition from a full-requirements customer to an operating utility as the best means of providing energy supply.
In February 2001, PSCo filed an agreement with the FERC to provide a portion of Cheyenne's service. Cheyenne has also


entered into agreements with other producers to meet both short term and long term energy supply needs and continues to negotiate with suppliers to meet its load requirements for the summer of 2001.

Total
purchased power costs are projected to increase approximately $80 million in 2001 with costs anticipated to fall each year thereafter. Purchased power and natural gas
costs are recoverable in Wyoming. Cheyenne is required to file applications with the Wyoming Public Service Commission (WPSC) for approval of adjustment mechanisms in advance of the proposed effective
date. Cheyenne expects to make its request for an electric cost adjustment increase in March 2001.

The
filing is expected to mitigate customer impacts through a pricing plan that would defer certain first-year costs. In addition, Cheyenne expects to make other filings
to create new options for customers to move load to off-peak hours and to provide additional conservation opportunities. While the precise outcome of this matter cannot be predicted,
management believes that it will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial conditions.

Regulation

Following the merger of NSP and NCE, Xcel Energy became a registered holding company under the PUHCA. As a result, Xcel Energy, its utility subsidiaries and
certain of its non-utility subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by the SEC under PUHCA with respect to issuances and sales of securities, acquisitions and sales of certain
utility properties and intra-system sales of certain goods and services. In addition, PUHCA generally limits the ability of registered holding companies to acquire additional public utility systems
and to acquire and retain businesses unrelated to the utility operations of the holding company. Xcel Energy believes that it has adequate authority (including financing authority) under existing SEC
orders and regulations for it and its subsidiaries to conduct their businesses as proposed during 2001 and will seek additional authorization when necessary.

The
electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of Xcel Energy's utility subsidiaries are approved by the FERC and the regulatory commissions in the states in which they
operate. The rates are generally designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. Xcel Energy requests changes in rates for utility services through filings
with the governing commissions. Because comprehensive rate changes are requested infrequently in some states, changes in operating costs can affect Xcel Energy's financial results. In addition to
changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate filings are sales growth, conservation and demand-side management efforts and the cost of capital.

Except
for Wisconsin electric operations, most of the retail rate schedules for Xcel Energy's utility subsidiaries provide for periodic cost-of-energy and
resource adjustments to billings and revenues for changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation, purchased energy, purchased natural gas and, in Minnesota and Colorado, conservation and energy
management program costs. In Minnesota, changes in electric capacity costs are not recovered through the fuel clause. For Wisconsin electric operations, where cost-of-energy
adjustment clauses are not used, the biennial retail rate review process and an interim fuel cost hearing process provide the opportunity for rate recovery of changes in electric fuel and purchased
energy costs in lieu of a cost-of-energy adjustment clause. In Colorado, PSCo has an ICA, which allows for an equal sharing among customers and shareholders of certain fuel and
energy costs and certain gains and losses on trading margins.

Regulated
public utilities are allowed to record as assets certain costs that would be expensed by nonregulated enterprises and to record as liabilities certain gains that would be
recognized as income by nonregulated enterprises. If restructuring or other changes in the regulatory environment occur, Xcel Energy may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment and
may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets and liabilities from its balance sheet. Such changes could have a material, adverse affect on Xcel Energy's results of operations in the period the
write-off is recorded. As discussed in Note 12 to the Financial Statements, SPS' generation business no longer follows SFAS 71.


At Dec. 31, 2000, Xcel Energy reported on its balance sheet regulatory assets of approximately $365 million and regulatory liabilities of approximately
$204 million that would be recognized in the income statement in the absence of regulation. In addition to a potential write-off of regulatory assets and liabilities, restructuring
and competition may require recognition of certain stranded costs not recoverable under market pricing. Xcel Energy currently does not expect to write off any stranded costs unless market price levels
change or cost levels increase above market price levels. See Notes 1 and 16 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of regulatory deferrals.

As
of Dec. 31, 2000, SPS had approximately $104 million of unrecovered energy costs, largely due to increases in the cost of natural gas for generating electricity.
These costs would typically be recovered through SPS' filings with state commissions. As part of restructuring in Texas, the fuel cost recovery mechanism will not be in effect after 2001. Consistent
with past practices, SPS has requested recovery of these costs. Management is confident that these unrecovered energy costs were prudent and will ultimately be recovered from customers.

Merger Rate Agreements

As part of the merger approval process, Xcel Energy agreed to reduce its rates in several jurisdictions. The discussion below summarizes the rate reductions in
Colorado, Minnesota, Texas and New Mexico.

As
part of the merger approval process in Colorado, PSCO agreed to:

•

Reduce
its retail electric rates by $11 million annually through June 2002;

•

File a
combined electric and natural gas rate case in 2002, with new rates effective January 2003;

•

Cap
merger costs associated with the electric operations at $30 million and amortize the merger costs for rate-making purposes through
2003; and

•

Continue
the Performance Based Regulatory Plan (PBRP) and the Quality Service Plan (QSP) currently in effect through 2006 with modifications to cap
electric earnings at a 10.5-percent return on equity for 2002, no earnings sharing in 2003 since new base rates would have recently been established and increase potential refunds if
quality standards are not met, including a QSP for natural gas operations.

As
part of the merger approval process in Minnesota, NSP-Minnesota agreed to:

•

Reduce
its Minnesota electric rates by $10 million annually for 2001-2005;

•

Not
increase its electric rates through 2005, except under limited circumstances; and

•

Not
seek the recovery of certain merger costs from customers and meet various quality standards.

As
part of the merger approval process in Texas, SPS agreed to:

•

Guarantee
annual merger savings credits of approximately $4.8 million and amortize merger costs through 2005;

•

Retain
the current fuel-recovery mechanism to pass along fuel cost savings to retail customers through 2001; and

•

Comply
with various service quality and reliability standards covering service installations and upgrades, light replacements, customer service call
centers and electric service reliability.

As
part of the merger approval process in New Mexico, SPS agreed to:

•

Guarantee
annual merger savings credits of approximately $780,000 and amortize merger costs beginning July 2000 through December 2004;

•

Share
net non-fuel operating and maintenance savings equally among retail customers and shareholders;


•

Retain
the current fuel recovery mechanism to pass along fuel cost savings to retail customers; and

•

Not
pass along any negative rate impacts of the NCE/NSP merger.

PSCo Performance-Based Regulatory Plan

The Colorado Public Utility Commission (CPUC) established an electric PBRP under which PSCo operates. The major components of this regulatory plan include:

•

An
annual electric earnings test with the sharing of earnings in excess of an 11-percent return on equity for 1997-2001;

•

An
annual electric earnings test with the sharing between customers and shareholders of earnings in excess of a 10.50-percent return on equity
for 2002;

•

No
earnings sharing for 2003;

•

An
annual electric earnings test with the sharing of earnings in excess of the return on equity set in the 2002 rate case for 2004-2006;

•

A
Quality Service Plan (QSP) that provides for refunds to customers if PSCo does not achieve certain performance measures relating to electric reliability
and customer service; and

•

An
ICA that provides for the sharing of energy costs and savings relative to an annual target cost per delivered kilowatt-hour.

PSCo
regularly monitors and records as necessary an estimated customer refund obligation under the earnings test. In April of each year following the measurement period, PSCo files
its proposed rate adjustment under the PBRP. The CPUC conducts proceedings to review and approve these rate adjustments annually. PSCo has recorded an estimated customer refund obligation for 2000 of
approximately $12.2 million. PSCo has also recorded an estimated customer refund obligation for 2000 under the QSP electric reliability performance measure of approximately $6.7 million.
In November 2000, the CPUC ruled on the unresolved issues related to the 1998 earnings test. PSCo filed to reduce customer rates by $5.1 million effective January 2001, in
compliance with the CPUC decision for both the 1998 and 1999 earnings test years. The procedural schedule for the 1999 earnings test has been established, with hearings set for April 2001.

SPS Earnings Test

In Texas, SPS operates under an earnings test in which excess earnings are returned to the customer. In May 2000, SPS filed its 1999 Earnings Report
with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUCT), indicating no excess earnings. In September 2000, the PUCT staff and the Office of Public Utility Counsel (OPUC) filed a Notice of
Disagreement with the PUCT, indicating adjustments to SPS' calculations, which would result in excess earnings. During 2000, SPS recorded an estimated obligation of approximately $11.4 million
for 1999 and 2000. In February 2001, the PUCT ruled on the disputed issues. These adjustments will not materially affect the estimated obligation previously booked.

Environmental Matters

Xcel Energy incurs several types of environmental costs, including nuclear plant decommissioning; storage and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel; disposal
of hazardous materials and wastes; remediation of contaminated sites; and monitoring of discharges into the environment. Because of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent
regulation, Xcel Energy has experienced increasing environmental costs. This trend has caused, and may continue to cause, slightly higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental
compliance. In addition, NRG's acquisition of existing generation facilities will tend to increase nonutility costs for environmental compliance.


In
addition to nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, costs charged to Xcel Energy's operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of
hazardous materials and wastes were approximately:

•

$64 million
in 2000

•

$55 million
in 1999

•

$56 million
in 1998

Xcel
Energy expects to spend approximately $72 million per year for 2001-2005. However, the precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for
site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are currently unknown.

Capital
expenditures on environmental improvements at its utility facilities, which include the costs of constructing spent nuclear fuel storage casks, were approximately:

•

$57 million
in 2000

•

$126 million
in 1999

•

$101 million
in 1998

Xcel
Energy expects to incur approximately $132 million in capital expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations in 2001 and approximately $297 million for
2001-2005. See Notes 14 and 15 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of Xcel Energy's environmental contingencies.

Impact of Nonregulated Investments

Xcel Energy's earnings from nonregulated operations have increased significantly due to acquisitions. Xcel Energy expects to continue investing in nonregulated
projects, including domestic and international power production projects through NRG, international projects through Xcel Energy International, natural gas trading and marketing through e prime,
construction projects through Utility Engineering and broadband communications systems through Xcel Communications. Xcel Energy's nonregulated businesses may carry a higher level of risk than its
traditional utility businesses due to a number of factors, including:

•

Competition,
operating risks, dependence on certain suppliers and customers, and domestic and foreign environmental and energy regulations;

•

Partnership
and government actions and foreign government, political, economic and currency risks; and

•

Development
risks, including uncertainties prior to final legal closing.

Some
of Xcel Energy's nonregulated subsidiaries have project investments (as listed in Note 11 to the Financial Statements) consisting of minority interests, which may limit
the financial risk, but may also limit the ability to control the development or operation of the projects. In addition, significant expenses may be incurred for projects pursued by Xcel Energy's
subsidiaries that do not materialize. The aggregate effect of these factors creates the potential for volatility in the nonregulated component of Xcel Energy's earnings. Accordingly, the historical
operating results of Xcel Energy's nonregulated businesses may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results.

Subsequent Event

In late February 2001, Xcel Energy reached an agreement in principle to sell at book value all
of its investment in Yorkshire Power except for an interest of approximately 5 percent. Xcel Energy is retaining this interest to comply with pooling-of-interests accounting requirements
associated with the merger of NSP and NCE in 2000. Following completion of the transaction, proceeds of the sale will be used by Xcel Energy to pay down short-term debt and eliminate an
equity issuance planned for the second half of 2001.


Inflation

Inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect Xcel Energy's prices or returns to shareholders.

Accounting Changes

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has proposed new accounting standards that would require the full accrual of nuclear plant decommissioning and
certain other site exit obligations. Material adjustments to Xcel Energy's balance sheet would occur upon implementation of the FASB's proposal, which would be no earlier than 2002. However, the
effects of regulation are expected to minimize or eliminate any impact on operating expenses and earnings from this future accounting change. For further discussion of the expected impact of this
change, see Note 15 to the Financial Statements.

In
June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." In
June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an Amendment to FASB Statement No. 133."

SFAS 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be
recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. SFAS 133 requires that changes in the derivative instrument's fair value be recognized currently in
earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met or specific exclusions are applicable. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative instrument's gains and losses to offset
related results on the hedged item in the income statement, to the extent effective, and requires that a company must formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that
receive hedge accounting.

SFAS 133
will apply to Xcel Energy's accounting for commodity futures and options contracts, index or fixed price swaps and basis swaps used to hedge price volatility in the
markets. SFAS 133 will also apply to Xcel Energy's accounting for interest rate swaps used to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency hedges. Xcel Energy may apply
hedge accounting to account for these derivative instruments, provided they meet specific hedge accounting criteria.

Xcel
Energy plans to adopt SFAS 133 in 2001, as required. Xcel Energy expects the following:

•

An
initial gain or loss recorded in the first quarter of 2001 related to the cumulative effect of applying the new accounting method to periods prior to
2001, which will be reported as a separate after-tax gain or loss based on market pricing levels in effect at Jan. 1, 2001;

•

Increased
volatility in future earnings due to the impact of market fluctuations on derivative instruments used by Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries; and

•

Potential
changes in Xcel Energy's business practices.

Xcel
Energy has completed its implementation of SFAS 133 in January 2001. Based on market prices as of Dec. 31, 2000, there was no material impact from the
cumulative effect reported in earnings and a net loss of approximately $42 million reported in other comprehensive income (equity) due to implementation of SFAS 133.

Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk

Xcel Energy is exposed to market and credit risks in its generation, retail distribution and energy trading operations. To minimize the risk of market price
and volume fluctuations, Xcel Energy enters into financial derivative instrument contracts to hedge purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements and inventories of its natural gas, distillate fuel
oil, electricity and coal business, and emission allowances. The primary objective of Xcel Energy's trading operations is to maximize asset


value, while minimizing the related exposure to changes in commodity prices and counterparty default. These operations include wholesale power trading and natural gas marketing and trading activities.

Xcel
Energy monitors its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange and may execute swaps, forward exchange contracts or other financial derivative instruments to
manage these exposures. Xcel Energy manages all of its market risks through various policies and procedures that allow for the use of various derivative instruments in the energy and financial
markets.

Commodity Price Risk

Xcel Energy has continued to develop and expand its gas and power marketing and trading
activities, and management expects to continue the growth of these activities during 2001. As a result, Xcel Energy's exposure to changes in commodity prices may increase and earnings may experience
volatility. To manage exposure to price volatility in the natural gas and electricity markets, Xcel Energy uses a variety of energy contracts, both financial and physical. These contracts consist
mainly of commodity forward contracts and options, index or fixed price swaps and basis swaps.

Xcel
Energy measures its open exposure to commodity price changes using the Value-at-Risk (VaR) methodology. VaR expresses the potential loss in fair value of
all open forward contract and option positions over a particular period of time, with a given confidence interval under normal market conditions. Xcel Energy utilizes the variance/covariance approach
in calculating VaR, which assumes that all price returns/profitability are normally and independently distributed. The model employs a 95 percent confidence interval level based on historical
price movement, normal price distribution and a holding period of 21 days.

NRG
has developed a 12-month rolling VaR based on generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions. This model encompasses the
following generating regions: Entergy, NEPOOL and NYPP. NRG is in the process of expanding the model into other geographical areas. The VaR for NRG reflects its merchant strategy and calculated
estimated earnings variability over the next three days based on a confidence factor of 95 percent. The volatility estimate is based on a lognormal calculation of the latest 30-day
closes for forward markets where NRG has an exposure.

As
of Dec. 31, 2000, the calculated VaRs were:

Xcel
Energy does not use VaR to measure the commodity risk inherent in its regulated generation and retail sales operations. In its major regulatory jurisdictions, Xcel Energy has
limited exposure to commodity risk due to fuel-cost recovery adjustment mechanisms. In Minnesota, fuel cost increases may be passed along in full to retail consumers.

In
Colorado, a sharing mechanism between shareholders and customers exists that utilizes an established benchmark per unit cost for energy. Consequently, changes in any eligible costs
collected under this benchmark approach have a resultant market risk. The impact of eligible production and fuel cost volatility on Colorado jurisdiction retail business shows that as of
Dec. 31, 2000, a 15-percent increase in eligible production and fuel costs would result in a loss in income from these contracts of approximately $18 million. Conversely, a
15-percent decrease in eligible production and fuel costs would result in a positive income gain from these contracts of approximately $39 million. This analysis assumes
that there were no changes in energy consumption, customer growth, operations, energy dispatch, regulatory guidelines or market conditions. This analysis is solely focused on the change in fuel
eligible production and fuel costs and the resultant market risk due to the ICA mechanism in the


state of Colorado. The market risk caused by change in eligible production and fuel costs, under the ICA mechanism, is affected by margins earned on certain trading activities. Generally, these
margins serve to mitigate the impact of market risk on Xcel Energy and the customer.

Interest Rate Risk

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries have both long-term and short-term debt
instruments that subject Xcel Energy and certain of its subsidiaries to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. This risk is limited for Xcel Energy's regulated companies,
primarily due to cost-based rate regulation. In the future, management anticipates utilizing financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. These instruments
may include interest rate swaps, caps, collars, exchange-traded futures contracts and put or call options on U.S. Treasury securities.

At
Dec. 31, 2000, a 100-basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energy's variable debt would impact net income by approximately $15.8 million. As a
result of interest rate swaps, which converted floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt, NRG did not have material interest rate exposure as of Dec. 31, 2000.

Currency Exchange Risk

Xcel Energy's investment in Yorkshire Power, a foreign currency-denominated joint venture, and
various NRG foreign projects also expose Xcel Energy to currency translation rate risk. NRG has an investment in the Kladno project located in the Czech Republic. SFAS
No. 52—"Foreign Currency Translation" requires foreign currency gains and losses to flow through the income statement if settlement of an obligation is in a currency other than the
local currency of the entity. A portion of the Kladno project debt is in non-local currency (U.S. dollars and German deutsche marks). As of Dec. 31, 2000, if the value of the Czech
koruna decreased by 10 percent in relation to the U.S. dollar and the German deutsche mark, NRG would have recorded a $3.6 million loss (after tax) on the currency transaction
adjustment. If the value of the Czech koruna increased by 10 percent, NRG would have recorded a $3.6 million gain (after tax) on the currency transaction adjustment.

At
Dec. 31, 2000, Xcel Energy's exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through its investment in Yorkshire Power is not material to its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Credit Risk

In addition to the risks discussed previously, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to credit risk
in its risk management activities. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations. As Xcel Energy continues to expand
its natural gas and power marketing and trading activities, its exposure to credit risk and counterparty default may increase. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies intended to
minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations.

Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all of its counterparties. Xcel Energy employs additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate, such as
letters of credit, parental guarantees and standardized master netting agreements that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures. The credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary,
the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of NRG's receivable related to the California
power market.

The
capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification. Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes
in electric and natural gas projected load growth, the desired reserve margin and the availability of purchased power, as well as alternative plans for meeting Xcel Energy's long-term
energy needs. In addition, Xcel
Energy's ongoing evaluation of merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities to support corporate strategies, address restructuring requirements and comply with future requirements to install
emission control equipment may impact actual capital requirements. For more information, see Notes 12 and 14 to the Financial Statements.

Xcel
Energy's subsidiaries expect to invest significant amounts in nonregulated projects in the future. Financing requirements for nonregulated project investments will vary depending
on the success, timing and level of involvement in projects currently under consideration. These investments could cause significant changes to the capital requirement estimates for nonregulated
projects and property. Long-term financing may be required for such investments.

NRG
expects to invest approximately $3.1 billion in 2001 for nonregulated projects and property, which include acquisitions and project investments. NRG's future capital
requirements may vary


significantly. For 2001, NRG's capital requirements reflect expected acquisitions of existing generation facilities, including the Conectiv fossil assets, North Valmy, LS Power, Clark
gas-fired assets, Reid Gardner coal-fired assets and the Bridgeport and New Haven Harbor coal-fired facilities.

Common Stock Dividend

Xcel Energy initially adopted a dividend of $1.50 per share on an annual basis for 2000. Future dividend levels will be dependent upon Xcel Energy's results of
operations, financial position, cash flows and other factors, and will be evaluated by the Xcel Energy board of directors.

Capital Sources

Xcel Energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing long-term debt, short-term debt, common stock and
preferred securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios. Over the long term, Xcel Energy's equity investments in and acquisitions of nonregulated projects are expected to be financed at the
nonregulated subsidiary level from internally generated funds or the issuance of subsidiary debt. Financing requirements for the nonregulated projects, in excess of equity contributions from partners,
are expected to be fulfilled through project or subsidiary debt and in the case of NRG, additional common equity or preferred offerings to the public. The financing needs are subject to continuing
review and can change depending on market and business conditions and changes, if any, in the construction programs and other capital requirements of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries.

NRG Initial Public Offering (IPO)

During the second quarter of 2000, NRG completed an IPO of approximately
32.4 million shares priced at $15 per share. Upon completion of the IPO, Xcel Energy owns approximately 147.6 million Class A shares of NRG common stock, or 82 percent of
NRG's outstanding shares. Management has concluded that this offering of NRG stock did not affect Xcel Energy's ability to use the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for
the merger of NSP and NCE. The offering's net proceeds of approximately $454 million were used exclusively by NRG for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of NRG's project
investments and other capital requirements for 2000. No proceeds of this offering were received by Xcel Energy. A portion of the proceeds was accounted for as a gain on the sale of 18 percent
of Xcel Energy's ownership in NRG. This gain of $216 million was not recorded in earnings, but is consistent with Xcel Energy's accounting policy, which was recorded as an increase in the
common stock premium component of stockholders' equity.

During
2000, Xcel Energy's board of directors authorized NRG to raise up to $600 million of equity through a follow-on offering. NRG expects to issue up to
18.4 million shares of common stock in March 2001. If all 18.4 million shares of common stock are issued, Xcel Energy's ownership interest in NRG will decline to approximately
75 percent. In addition, NRG expects to issue 8 million equity units in March 2001. Each equity unit comprises a debenture and an obligation to acquire one share of NRG common
stock no later than 2004. The ultimate issuance of common stock, number of shares issued and amount of capital raised will be dependent upon market conditions. No proceeds of any such offering would
be received by Xcel Energy.

If
Xcel Energy's ownership interest in NRG declines to less than 80 percent, then NRG will no longer be included in Xcel Energy's federal consolidated income tax return. We do
not expect this to have a material impact on our earnings.

NRG Revolving Credit Facility

During the first quarter of 2001, NRG entered into a $2.5 billion revolving
funding program, which will be used to finance a significant portion of NRG's U.S. acquisitions and development projects over the next five years. This revolving credit facility will allow NRG to
procure temporary funding for both the non-recourse debt portion as well as equity contributions for new projects through an expedient and simplified review and approval process. NRG is
permitted under the revolver to repay borrowed funds, thus making them available to be borrowed again. NRG plans to do that by refinancing projects in the long-term capital or bank markets
when construction projects reach commercial operation or the market conditions are favorable. Any unutilized borrowing capacity may be redeployed for future projects.


Registration Statements

Xcel Energy's Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 1 billion shares of
common stock. As of Dec. 31, 2000, Xcel Energy had approximately 341 million shares of common
stock outstanding. In addition, Xcel Energy's Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 7 million shares of $100 par value preferred stock. On Dec. 31, 2000, Xcel Energy had
approximately 1 million shares of preferred stock outstanding.

During
2000, Xcel Energy filed a $1 billion universal debt shelf registration with the SEC. During the fourth quarter of 2000, Xcel Energy issued $600 million of
unsecured debt under this shelf registration.

PSCo
has an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC under which $300 million of senior debt securities are available for issuance.

During
2000, NRG filed a shelf registration with the SEC. Based on this registration, NRG can issue up to $1.65 billion of an indeterminate amount of debt securities, preferred
stock, common stock, depository shares, warrants and convertible securities. This registration includes $150 million of securities that are being carried forward from a previous NRG shelf
registration.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Merger Basis of Presentation

On Aug. 18, 2000, following receipt of all required regulatory approvals, NSP and NCE merged and formed Xcel Energy Inc. Each share of NCE common
stock was exchanged for 1.55 shares of Xcel Energy common stock. NSP shares became Xcel Energy shares on a one-for-one basis. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares of
Xcel Energy common stock. The merger was structured as a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange for shareholders of both companies (except for fractional shares) and
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. At the time of the merger, Xcel Energy registered as a holding company under the PUHCA.

Pursuant
to the merger agreement, NCE was merged with and into NSP. NSP, as the surviving legal corporation, changed its name to Xcel Energy. Also, as part of the merger, NSP
transferred its existing utility operations that were being conducted directly by NSP at the parent company level to a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy, which was renamed
NSP-Minnesota.

Consistent
with pooling accounting requirements, results and disclosures for all periods prior to the merger have been restated for consistent reporting with post-merger
organization and operations. All earnings per share amounts previously reported for NSP and NCE have been restated for presentation on an Xcel Energy share basis.

Business and System of Accounts

Xcel Energy's domestic utility subsidiaries are engaged principally in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and in the
purchase, transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The utility subsidiaries are subject to
regulation by the FERC and state utility commissions. All of the utility companies' accounting records conform to the FERC uniform system of accounts or to systems required by various state regulatory
commissions, which are the same in all material aspects.

Principles of Consolidation

Xcel Energy directly owns six utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in 12 states. These six utility subsidiaries are
NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo, SPS, BMG and Cheyenne. Their service territories include portions of Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Xcel Energy's regulated businesses also include Viking and WGI.

Xcel
Energy also owns or has an interest in a number of nonregulated businesses, the largest of which is NRG Energy, Inc., a publicly traded independent power producer. Xcel
Energy indirectly owns 82 percent of NRG. Xcel Energy owned 100 percent of NRG until the second quarter 2000, when NRG completed its initial public offering.

In
addition to NRG, Xcel Energy's nonregulated subsidiaries include Seren Innovations, Inc., e prime, inc., Planergy International, Inc. and Eloigne
Company. Xcel Energy also reports in its nonregulated activities its 50-percent stake in Yorkshire Power.

Xcel
Energy owns the following additional direct subsidiaries, some of which are intermediate holding companies with additional subsidiaries: Xcel Energy Wholesale Energy
Group Inc., Xcel Energy Markets Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy International Inc., Xcel Energy Ventures Inc., Xcel Energy Retail Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy
Communications Group Inc., Xcel Energy WYCO Inc. and Xcel Energy O & M Services Inc. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as Xcel Energy.


Xcel Energy uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in partnerships, joint ventures and certain projects. We record our portion of earnings from international
investments after subtracting
foreign income taxes, if applicable. In the consolidation process, we eliminate all significant intercompany transactions and balances.

Revenue Recognition

Xcel Energy records utility revenues based on a calendar month, but reads meters and bills customers according to a cycle that doesn't necessarily correspond
with the calendar month's end. To compensate, we estimate and record unbilled revenues from the monthly meter-reading dates to the month's end.

Xcel
Energy's utility subsidiaries have adjustment mechanisms in place that currently provide for the recovery of certain purchased natural gas and electric energy costs. These cost
adjustment tariffs may increase or decrease the level of costs recovered through base rates and are revised periodically, as prescribed by the appropriate regulatory agencies, for any difference
between the total amount collected under the clauses and the recoverable costs incurred.

PSCo's
electric rates in Colorado are adjusted under the ICA, which takes into account changes in energy costs and certain trading gains and losses that are shared with the customer.
SPS' rates in Texas and New Mexico have periodic fuel filing and reporting requirements, which can provide cost recovery. NSP-Wisconsin's rates include a
cost-of-energy adjustment clause for purchased natural gas, but not for purchased electricity or electric fuel. In Wisconsin, we can request recovery of those electric costs
prospectively through the rate review process, which normally occurs every two years, and an interim fuel cost hearing process.

In
Colorado, PSCo operates under an electric PBRP, which results in an annual earnings test with the sharing of excess earnings between customers and shareholders. The sharing
threshold is earnings in excess of an 11-percent return on equity for 2001 and a 10.50-percent return on equity for 2002. In Texas, SPS operates under an earnings tests, in
which excess earnings above a certain level are returned to the customer.

NSP-Minnesota
and PSCo's rates include monthly adjustments for the recovery of conservation and energy management program costs, which are reviewed annually.

Trading Operations

Effective with year-end 2000 reporting, Xcel Energy changed its policy for the presentation of energy trading operating results. Previously,
trading margins were recorded net of costs in electric and natural gas revenues. After the merger, Xcel Energy elected to report trading revenues separately from trading costs. Prior years' results
have been reclassified for consistency with 2000 reporting.

Xcel
Energy's trading operations are conducted mainly by PSCo and e prime. Trading revenues and costs of goods sold do not include the revenue and production costs associated with
energy produced from generation assets or results from NRG.

Property, Plant, Equipment and Depreciation

Property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost. The cost of plant includes direct labor and materials, contracted work, overhead costs and applicable
interest expense. The cost of plant retired, plus net removal cost, is charged to accumulated depreciation and amortization. Significant additions or improvements extending asset lives are
capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Maintenance and replacement of items determined to be less than units of property are charged to operating expenses.

Xcel
Energy determines the depreciation of its plant by spreading the original cost equally over the plant's useful life. Depreciation expense, expressed as a percentage of average
depreciable property, was approximately 3.3 percent for the years ended Dec. 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.


Property, plant and equipment includes approximately $18 million and $25 million, respectively, for costs associated with the engineering design of the future Pawnee 2
generating station and certain water rights located in southeastern Colorado, also obtained for a future generating station. PSCo is earning a return on these investments based on its weighted average
cost of debt in accordance with a CPUC rate order.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFDC)

AFDC, a noncash item, represents the cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity. AFDC is computed by applying a composite pretax rate to
qualified construction work in progress. The amount of AFDC capitalized as a utility construction cost is credited to other income and expense (for equity capital) and interest charges (for debt
capital). AFDC amounts capitalized are included in Xcel Energy's rate base for establishing utility service rates. In addition to construction-related amounts, AFDC also is recorded to reflect returns
on capital used to finance conservation programs in Minnesota. Interest capitalized as AFDC was approximately $20 million in 2000, $19 million in 1999 and $25 million in 1998.

Decommissioning

Xcel Energy accounts for the future cost of decommissioning—or permanently retiring—its nuclear generating plants through annual
depreciation accruals using an annuity approach designed to provide for full-rate recovery of the future decommissioning costs. Our decommissioning calculation covers all expenses,
including decontamination and removal of radioactive material, and extends over the estimated lives of the plants. The calculation assumes that NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin
will recover those costs through rates. For more information on nuclear decommissioning, see Note 15 to the Financial Statements.

Nuclear Fuel Expense

Nuclear fuel expense, which is recorded as the plant uses fuel, includes the cost of nuclear fuel used and future spent nuclear fuel disposal, based on fees
established by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and NSP-Minnesota's portion of the cost of decommissioning or shutting down the DOE's fuel enrichment facility.

Environmental Costs

We record environmental costs when it is probable Xcel Energy is liable for the costs and we can reasonably estimate the liability. We may defer costs as a
regulatory asset based on our expectation that we will recover these costs from customers in future rates. Otherwise, we expense the costs. If an environmental expense is related to facilities we
currently use, such as pollution control equipment, we capitalize and depreciate the costs over the life of the plant, assuming the costs are recoverable in future rates or future cash flows.

We
record estimated remediation costs, excluding inflationary increases and possible reductions for insurance coverage and rate recovery. The estimates are based on our experience,
our assessment of the current situation and the technology currently available for use in the remediation. We regularly adjust the recorded costs as we revise estimates and as remediation proceeds. If
we are one of several designated responsible parties, we estimate and record only our share of the cost. We treat any future costs of restoring sites where operation may extend indefinitely as a
capitalized cost of plant retirement. The depreciation expense levels we can recover in rates include a provision for these estimated removal costs.

Income Taxes

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal and combined and separate state income tax returns. Income taxes for consolidated or combined
subsidiaries are allocated to the subsidiaries based on separate company computations of taxable income or loss. Xcel Energy defers income taxes


for all temporary differences between pretax financial and taxable income, and between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We use the tax rates that are scheduled to be in effect when
the temporary differences are expected to turn around, or reverse.

Due
to the effects of past regulatory practices, when deferred taxes were not required to be recorded, we account for the reversal of some temporary differences as current income tax
expense. We defer investment tax credits and spread their benefits over the estimated lives of the related property. Utility rate regulation also has created certain regulatory assets and liabilities
related to income taxes, which we summarize in Note 16 to the Financial Statements. We discuss our income tax policy for international operations in Note 8 to the Financial Statements.

Foreign Currency Translation

Xcel Energy's foreign operations generally use the local currency as their functional currency in translating international operating results and balances to
U.S. currency. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the end of a reporting period. Income, expense and cash flows are translated at
weighted-average exchange rates for the period. We accumulate the resulting currency translation adjustments and report them as a component of Other Comprehensive Income. When we convert cash
distributions made in one currency to another currency, we include those gains and losses in the results of operations as a component of other income.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries utilize a variety of derivatives, including interest rate swaps and locks, foreign currency hedges and energy contracts. The
energy contracts are both financial- and commodity-based, in the energy trading and energy non-trading operations, to reduce exposure to commodity price risk. These contracts consist
mainly of commodity futures and options, index or fixed price swaps and basis swaps.

Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 98-10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," effective Jan. 1,
1999. EITF 98-10 requires gains or losses resulting from market value changes on energy trading contracts to be recorded in earnings. The initial adoption of EITF 98-10 had an
immaterial impact on Xcel Energy's net income.

Energy
contracts also are utilized by Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries in non-trading operations to reduce commodity price risk. Hedge accounting is applied only if the
contract reduces the price risk of the underlying hedged item and is designated as a hedge at its inception. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated
transactions are deferred and recognized as a component of purchased power or cost of gas sold when settlement occurs. If, subsequent to the inception of the hedge, the underlying transactions are no
longer likely to occur, the related gains and losses are recognized currently in income.

While
NRG is not currently hedging investments involving foreign currency, NRG will hedge such investments when it believes that preserving the U.S. dollar value of the investment is
appropriate. NRG is not hedging currency translation adjustments related to future operating results. NRG does not speculate in foreign currencies. Xcel Energy is not currently hedging its foreign
currency exposure associated with its investment in Yorkshire Power.

From
time to time, NRG also uses interest rate hedging instruments to protect it from an increase in the cost of borrowing. Gains and losses on interest rate hedging instruments are
reported as part of the asset Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates when the hedging instrument relates to a project that has financial statements that are not consolidated into NRG's financial
statements. Otherwise, they are reported as a part of debt.

A
final derivative instrument used by Xcel Energy is the interest rate swap. The cost or benefit of the interest rate swap agreements is recorded as a component of interest expense.
None of these derivative financial instruments are reflected on Xcel Energy's balance sheet. For further discussion of Xcel Energy's risk management and derivative activities, see Note 13 to
the Financial Statements.


Use of Estimates

In recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations, Xcel Energy uses estimates based on the best information available. We use estimates
for such items as plant depreciable lives, tax provisions, uncollectible amounts, environmental costs, unbilled revenues and actuarially determined benefit costs. We revise the recorded estimates when
we get better information or when we can determine actual amounts. Those revisions can affect operating results. Each year we also review the depreciable lives of certain plant assets and revise them
if appropriate.

Cash Equivalents

Xcel Energy considers investments in certain debt instruments—with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of
purchase—to be cash equivalents. Those debt instruments are primarily commercial paper and money market funds.

Inventory

All inventory is recorded at average cost, with the exception of natural gas in underground storage at PSCo, which is recorded using
last-in-first-out (LIFO) pricing.

Regulatory Accounting

Xcel Energy's regulated utility subsidiaries account for certain income and expense items using SFAS No. 71—"Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation." As discussed in Note 12 to the Financial Statements, SPS' generation business no longer follows SFAS 71. Under SFAS 71:

•

We
defer certain costs, which would otherwise be charged to expense, as regulatory assets based on our expected ability to recover them in future rates;
and

•

We
defer certain credits, which would otherwise be reflected as income, as regulatory liabilities based on our expectation they will be returned to
customers in future rates.

We
base our estimates of recovering deferred costs and returning deferred credits on specific rate-making decisions or precedent for each item. We amortize regulatory
assets and liabilities consistent with the period of expected regulatory treatment.

Stock-Based Employee Compensation

Xcel Energy has several stock-based compensation plans. We account for those plans using the intrinsic value method. We do not record compensation expense for
stock options because there is no difference between the market price and the purchase price at grant date. We do, however, record compensation expense for restricted stock that we award to certain
employees, but hold until the restrictions lapse or the stock is forfeited. We do not use the optional accounting under SFAS No. 123—"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." If we
had used the SFAS 123 method of accounting, earnings would have been reduced by approximately 2 cents per share for 2000 and approximately 1 cent per share per year for 1999 and 1998.

NRG Development Costs

As NRG develops projects, it expenses the development costs it incurs until a sales agreement or letter of intent is signed and the project has received NRG
board approval. NRG capitalizes additional costs incurred at that point. When a project begins to operate, NRG amortizes the capitalized costs over either the life of the project's related assets or
the revenue contract period, whichever is less. If a project is terminated without becoming operational, NRG expenses the capitalized costs in the period of the termination.


Intangible Assets and Deferred Financing Costs

Goodwill results when Xcel Energy purchases an entity at a price higher than the underlying fair value of the net assets. We amortize the goodwill and other
intangible assets over periods consistent with the economic useful life of the assets. Our intangible assets are currently amortized over a range of 5 to 40 years. We periodically evaluate the
recovery of goodwill based on an analysis of estimated
undiscounted future cash flows. At Dec. 31, 2000, Xcel Energy's intangible assets included approximately $66 million of goodwill, net of $7 million of accumulated amortization.

Intangible
and other assets also included deferred financing costs, net of amortization, of approximately $94 million at Dec. 31, 2000. We are amortizing these financing
costs over the remaining maturity periods of the related debt.

Reclassifications

We reclassified certain items in the 1998 and 1999 income statements and the 1999 balance sheet to conform to the 2000 presentation. These reclassifications
had no effect on net income or earnings per share. Reported amounts for periods prior to the merger have been restated to reflect the merger as if it had occurred as of Jan. 1, 1998.

2.  MERGER COSTS AND SPECIAL CHARGES

Special Charges 2000

Upon consummation of the merger in 2000, Xcel Energy expensed pretax special charges totaling $241 million. In the aggregate, these special charges
reduced Xcel Energy's 2000 earnings by 52 cents per share. Of these pretax special charges, $201 million, or 43 cents per share, was recorded during the third quarter of 2000, and
$40 million, or 9 cents per share, was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2000.

The
pretax charges included $52 million related to one-time transaction-related costs incurred in connection with the merger of NSP and NCE. These transaction costs
include investment banker fees, legal and regulatory approval costs, and expenses for support of and assistance with planning and completing the merger transaction.

Also
included were $147 million of pretax charges pertaining to incremental costs of transition and integration activities associated with merging NSP and NCE to begin
operations as Xcel Energy. These transition costs include approximately $77 million for severance and related expenses associated with staff reductions of 721 employees, 661 of whom were
released through February 2001. The staff
reductions were non-bargaining positions mainly in corporate and operations support areas. Other transition and integration costs include amounts incurred for facility consolidation,
systems integration, regulatory transition, merger communications and operations integration assistance.

In
addition, the pretax charges include $42 million of asset impairments and other costs resulting from the post-merger strategic alignment of Xcel Energy's
nonregulated businesses. These special charges, which were recorded in the third quarter, include: $22 million of write-offs of goodwill and project development costs for Planergy
and Energy Masters International (EMI) energy services operations due to a change in their business focus and direction after the merger; $10 million of contractual obligations and other costs
associated with post-merger changes in the strategic operations and related revaluations of e prime's energy marketing business; and $10 million in asset write-downs and losses
resulting from various other nonregulated business ventures that would not be pursued after the merger. The write-downs were based on fair value estimates, consisting mainly of future cash flow
projections.

The
pretax special charges recognized for merger transaction, transition and integration activities include approximately $66 million in costs incurred prior to third quarter
2000, which had been deferred prior to merger consummation. Consistent with pooling accounting requirements, upon


consummation of the merger to form Xcel Energy in the third quarter of 2000, Xcel Energy expensed all merger-related costs incurred up to that point.

Special Charges 1999

EMI Goodwill

In December 1999, Xcel Energy recorded a pretax charge (reported in special charges) of
approximately $17 million, or 4 cents per share, to write off all goodwill that was recorded by its subsidiary EMI for its acquisitions of Energy Masters Corp. in 1995 and Energy Solutions
International in 1997. This charge reflected a revised business outlook based on the levels of contract signings by EMI.

Loss on Marketable Securities

During 1999, Xcel Energy recorded pretax charges (reported in special charges) of
approximately $14 million, or 3 cents per share, for valuation write-downs on its investment in the publicly traded common stock of CellNet Data Systems, Inc. In October 1999,
CellNet announced it was experiencing financial difficulties and was contemplating restructuring its capital financing. In February 2000, CellNet filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
CellNet's assets were subsequently acquired by another company.

Bank Lines of Credit and Compensating Bank Balances

At Dec. 31, 2000, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries had approximately $3.0 billion in unsecured revolving credit facilities with several banks.
Arrangements by Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries for committed lines of credit are maintained by a combination of fee payments and compensating balances.

In
November 2000, Xcel Energy closed on two revolving credit facilities totaling $800 million. These facilities are comprised of a $400 million,
364-day maturity and a $400 million, five-year maturity. They are available for Xcel's general corporate purposes, primarily supporting commercial paper borrowings.

In
July 2000, NSP-Minnesota closed on a $300 million, 364-day revolving credit facility. This facility provides short-term financing
in the form of bank loans and letters of credit, but its primary purpose is support for commercial paper borrowings.

In
July 2000, PSCo and its subsidiary, Public Service of Colorado Credit Corporation (PSCCC), entered into a $600 million, 364-day revolving credit agreement
that provides for direct borrowings, but whose primary purpose is to support the issuance of commercial paper by PSCo and PSCCC.

In
July 2000, SPS entered into a $500-million credit agreement that is effective through January 2002. This credit facility was initially used as support for
the issuance of commercial paper to fund open market purchases, tender and defeasance of SPS' outstanding first mortgage bonds and other related restructuring costs. SPS is the initial borrower under
this credit agreement; however, at the time of separation of the generation assets, the obligations under this credit agreement will be assumed by a newly formed generation company. See Note 12
to the Financial Statements for more information on restructuring.

In
February 2001, SPS renewed a $300 million, 364-day revolving credit facility. This facility provides for direct borrowings, but its primary purpose is to
support the issuance of commercial paper.

In
January 2001, NRG entered into a $600-million bridge credit facility to provide financing for its LS Power acquisition. It is expected to be repaid with the
proceeds of NRG's planned common stock and equity unit offerings. The credit facility expires Dec. 31, 2001.

NRG
has a $500-million revolving credit facility under a commitment fee arrangement that matures in March 2001. This facility provides short-term
financing in the form of bank loans. At Dec. 31, 2000, NRG had $8 million outstanding under this facility.

NRG
has a $125-million syndicated letter of credit facility that matures in November 2003. At Dec. 31, 2000, NRG had $58 million outstanding under
this facility.

4.  LONG-TERM DEBT

Except for SPS and other minor exclusions, all property of Xcel Energy's utility subsidiaries is subject to the liens of its first mortgage indentures, which
are contracts between the companies and their bond holders. In addition, certain SPS payments under its pollution control obligations are pledged to secure obligations of the Red River Authority of
Texas.

The
annual sinking-fund requirements of Xcel Energy's utility subsidiaries' first mortgage indentures are the amounts necessary to redeem 1 to 1.5 percent of the
highest principal amount of each series of first mortgage bonds at any time outstanding, excluding series issued for pollution control and resource recovery financings and certain other series
totaling $2 billion.

NSP-Minnesota,
NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and Cheyenne expect to satisfy substantially all of their sinking-fund obligations in accordance with the terms
of their respective indentures through the application of property additions. SPS has no significant sinking-fund requirements.

NSP-Minnesota's
2011 and 2019 series first mortgage bonds have variable interest rates, which currently change at various periods up to 270 days, based on
prevailing rates for certain commercial paper securities or similar issues. The 2011 series bonds are redeemable upon seven-days notice at the


option of the bondholder. NSP-Minnesota also is potentially liable for repayment of the 2019 series when the bonds are tendered, which occurs each time the variable interest rates change.
The principal amount of all of these variable rate bonds outstanding represents potential short-term obligations and, therefore, is reported under current liabilities on the balance
sheets.

5.  PREFERRED STOCK

At Dec. 31, 2000, Xcel Energy had various preferred stock series, which were callable at prices per share ranging from $102 to $103.75, plus accrued
dividends.

PSCo
has 10 million shares of cumulative preferred stock, $0.01 par value, authorized. At Dec. 31, 2000 and 1999, PSCo had no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

SPS
has 10 million shares of cumulative preferred stock, $1 par value, authorized. At Dec. 31, 2000 and 1999, SPS had no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

6.  MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS

In 1996, SPS Capital I, a wholly owned, special-purpose subsidiary trust of SPS, issued $100 million of 7.85 percent trust preferred securities
that mature in 2036. Distributions paid by the subsidiary trust on the preferred securities are financed through interest payments on debentures issued by SPS and held by the subsidiary trust, which
are eliminated in consolidation. The securities are redeemable at the option of SPS after October 2001, at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Distributions and
redemption payments are guaranteed by SPS.

In
1997, NSP Financing I, a wholly owned, special-purpose subsidiary trust of NSP-Minnesota, issued $200 million of 7.875 percent trust preferred securities
that mature in 2037. Distributions paid by the subsidiary trust on the preferred securities are financed through interest payments on debentures issued by NSP-Minnesota and held by the
subsidiary trust, which are eliminated in consolidation. The preferred securities are redeemable at $25 per share beginning in 2002. Distributions and redemption payments are guaranteed by
NSP-Minnesota.

In
1998, PSCo Capital Trust I, a wholly owned, special-purpose subsidiary trust of PSCo, issued $194 million of 7.60 percent trust preferred securities that mature in
2038. Distributions paid by the subsidiary trust on the preferred securities are financed through interest payments on debentures issued by PSCo and held by the subsidiary trust, which are eliminated
in consolidation. The securities are redeemable at the option of PSCo after May 2003, at 100 percent of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest. Distributions and
redemption payments are guaranteed by PSCo.

Distributions
paid to preferred security holders are reflected as a financing cost in the Consolidated Income Statements along with interest expense.

Xcel
Energy management intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from NRG's foreign operations. Accordingly, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on
a cumulative amount of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $238 million and $195 million at Dec. 31, 2000 and 1999. The additional U.S. income tax and
foreign withholding tax on the unremitted foreign earnings, if repatriated, would be offset in part by foreign tax credits. Thus, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be
payable.

Xcel
Energy does not intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings from its investment in Yorkshire Power and, therefore, has provided deferred taxes of $20 million on unremitted
earnings of $55 million at Dec. 31, 2000. Prior to 2000, management did intend to reinvest Yorkshire Power earnings indefinitely, and thus no taxes were provided on unremitted earnings
of $11 million at Dec. 31, 1999.

9.  COMMON STOCK AND INCENTIVE STOCK PLANS

Incentive Stock Plans

We and some of our subsidiaries have incentive compensation plans under which stock options and other performance incentives are awarded to key employees. The
weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate our earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock awards based on the
treasury stock method. The tables below include awards made by us and some of our predecessor companies. Stock options issued under NCE, PSCo and SPS plans before the merger have been adjusted for the
merger stock exchange ratio and are presented on an Xcel Energy share basis.

There
were also 8,259 other awards outstanding at Dec. 31, 2000.

Certain
employees also may be awarded restricted stock under Xcel Energy's incentive plans. We hold restricted stock until restrictions lapse; 50 percent of the stock vests one
year from the date of the award and the other 50 percent vests two years from the date of the award. We reinvest dividends on the shares we hold while restrictions are in place. Restrictions
also apply to the additional shares acquired through dividend reinvestment. We granted 58,690 restricted shares in 2000, 52,688 restricted shares in 1999 and 49,651 restricted shares in 1998.
Compensation expense related to these awards was immaterial.

The
NCE/NSP merger was a "change in control" under the NSP incentive plan, so all stock option and restricted stock awards under that plan became fully vested and exercisable as of
the merger date. The NCE/NSP merger did not constitute a change in control under the NCE incentive plans, so there was no accelerated vesting of stock options issued under them. When NCE and NSP
merged, each outstanding NCE stock option was converted to 1.55 Xcel Energy options.

We
apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its stock-based compensation and, accordingly, no compensation cost is recognized for the issuance of
stock options as the exercise price of the options equals the fair-market value of our common stock at the date of grant. If we had used the SFAS 123 method of accounting, earnings
would have been reduced by approximately 2 cents per share for 2000 and approximately 1 cent per share per year for 1999 and 1998.


The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes Option-Pricing Model with the following assumptions:




Expected option life

3-5 years

5-10 years

5-10 years

Stock volatility

15%

5.4-7.5%

5.4%

5.2-5.4%

Dividend Restrictions

The Articles of Incorporation of both NSP-Minnesota and Xcel Energy place restrictions on the amount of common stock dividends they can pay when
preferred stock is outstanding. NSP-Minnesota has no outstanding preferred stock, so these restrictions would not apply. Xcel Energy has outstanding preferred stock. It could have paid
approximately $2.75 billion in additional common stock dividends before restrictions would apply.

In
addition, NSP-Minnesota's first mortgage indenture places certain restrictions on the amount of cash dividends it can pay to Xcel Energy, the holder of its common
stock. Even with these restrictions,
NSP-Minnesota could have paid more than $800 million in additional cash dividends on common stock at Dec. 31, 2000.

Shareholder Rights

In 2000, Xcel Energy adopted a shareholder protection rights plan. This rights plan is subject to approval by the SEC. The plan is designed to protect
shareholders' interests in the event we are ever confronted with an unfair or inadequate acquisition proposal. Pursuant to this plan and assuming SEC approval, each share of common stock has one right
entitling the holder to purchase a share of Xcel Energy common stock under certain circumstances. The rights become exercisable if any person or group acquires 15 percent or more of Xcel
Energy's common stock. Under certain circumstances, the holders of the rights will be entitled to purchase either shares of Xcel Energy common stock or common stock of any acquirer of Xcel Energy at a
reduced percentage of market value. The rights are scheduled to expire in 2011.

10. BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Xcel Energy offers various benefit plans to its benefit employees. Approximately 45 percent of benefit employees are represented by several local labor
unions under several collective-bargaining agreements. At Dec. 31, 2000, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin had 2,598 union employees covered under a collective-bargaining
agreement, which expires at the end of 2004. PSCo had 1,969 union employees covered under a collective-bargaining agreement, which expires in May 2003. SPS had 776 union employees covered under
a collective-bargaining agreement, which expires in October 2002.

Pension Benefits

Xcel Energy has several noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all utility employees. Benefits are based on a combination of years of
service, the employee's average pay and Social Security benefits.

Xcel
Energy's policy is to fully fund into an external trust the actuarially determined pension costs recognized for ratemaking and financial reporting purposes, subject to the
limitations of applicable employee benefit and tax laws. Plan assets principally consist of the common stock of public companies, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities.


A comparison of the actuarially computed pension benefit obligation and plan assets at Dec. 31, 2000 and 1999, for all Xcel Energy plans on a combined basis is presented in the
following table.

Additionally,
Xcel Energy maintains noncontributory, defined benefit supplemental retirement income plans for certain qualifying executive personnel. Benefits for these unfunded plans
are paid out of Xcel Energy's operating cash flows.


Defined Contribution Plans

Xcel Energy maintains 401(k) and other defined contribution plans that cover substantially all employees. Total contributions to these plans were approximately
$23 million in 2000 and $21 million annually in 1999 and 1998.

Xcel
Energy has a leveraged ESOP that covers substantially all employees of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin. Xcel Energy makes contributions to this
noncontributory, defined contribution plan to the extent we realize a tax savings from dividends paid on certain ESOP shares. ESOP contributions have no material effect on Xcel Energy earnings because
the contributions are essentially offset by the tax savings provided by the dividends paid on ESOP shares. Xcel Energy allocates leveraged ESOP shares to participants when it repays ESOP loans with
dividends on stock held by the ESOP.

Xcel
Energy's leveraged ESOP held 12.0 million shares of Xcel Energy common stock at the end of 2000 and 11.3 million shares of Xcel Energy common stock at the end of
1999 and 1998. Xcel Energy excluded the following uncommitted leveraged ESOP shares from earnings per share calculations: 0.7 million in 2000, 0.5 million in 1999 and 0.6 million
in 1998.

Postretirement Health Care Benefits

Xcel Energy has contributory health and welfare benefit plans that provide health care and death benefits to most Xcel Energy retirees. The NSP plan was
terminated for nonbargaining employees retiring after 1998 and for bargaining employees after 1999.

In
conjunction with the 1993 adoption of SFAS No.106—"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," Xcel Energy elected to amortize the
unrecognized accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) on a straight-line basis over 20 years.

Regulatory
agencies for nearly all of Xcel Energy's retail and wholesale utility customers have allowed rate recovery of accrued benefit costs under SFAS 106. PSCo transitioned
to full accrual accounting for SFAS 106 costs between 1993 and 1997, consistent with the accounting requirements for rate regulated enterprises. The Colorado jurisdictional SFAS 106
costs deferred during the transition period are being amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the 15-year period from 1998 to 2012. NSP-Minnesota
also transitioned to full accrual accounting for SFAS 106 costs, with regulatory differences fully amortized prior to 1997.

Additionally,
certain state agencies, which regulate Xcel Energy's utility subsidiaries, have issued guidelines related to the funding of SFAS 106 costs. SPS is required to
fund SFAS 106 costs for Texas and New Mexico jurisdictional amounts collected in rates, and PSCo and Cheyenne are required to fund SFAS 106 costs in irrevocable external trusts that are
dedicated to the payment of these postretirement benefits. Minnesota and Wisconsin retail regulators require external funding of accrued SFAS 106 costs to the extent such funding is tax
advantaged. Plan assets held in external funding trusts principally consist of investments in equity mutual funds, fixed income securities and cash equivalents.


A comparison of the actuarially computed benefit obligation and plan assets at Dec. 31, 2000 and 1999, for all Xcel Energy postretirement health care plans is presented in the

The
assumed health care cost trend rate for 2000 is approximately 7.5 percent, decreasing gradually to 5.5 percent in 2004 and remaining level thereafter. A
1-percent increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the estimated total accumulated benefit obligation for Xcel Energy by approximately $49.3 million, and
the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $3.8 million. A 1-percent decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate
would decrease the estimated total accumulated benefit obligation for Xcel Energy by approximately $42.9 million, and the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement
benefit costs by approximately $3.3 million.

11. INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD

Xcel Energy's nonregulated subsidiaries have investments in various international and domestic energy projects, and domestic affordable housing and real estate
projects. We use the equity method of accounting for such investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and partnerships. That's because the ownership structure prevents Xcel Energy from
exercising a controlling influence over the projects' operating and financial policies. Under this method, Xcel Energy records its portion of the earnings or losses of unconsolidated affiliates as
equity earnings. A summary of Xcel Energy's significant equity method investments is listed in the following table.

Subsequent Event

In late February 2001, Xcel Energy reached an agreement in principle to sell at book value all of its investment in Yorkshire Power except for an
interest of approximately 5 percent. Xcel Energy is retaining this interest to comply with pooling-of-interests accounting requirements associated with the merger of NSP and NCE in 2000.
Following completion of the transaction, proceeds of the sale will be used by Xcel Energy to pay down short-term debt and eliminate an equity issuance planned for the second half of 2001.

12. ELECTRIC UTILITY RESTRUCTURING

Restructuring legislation has been enacted in Texas and New Mexico, as summarized below. SPS has made, and continues to make, filings with the PUCT and the New
Mexico Public Regulation
Commission (NMPRC) to address critical issues related to SPS transition plans to implement retail competition.

New Mexico Restructuring

In April 1999, New Mexico enacted the Electric Utility Restructuring Act of 1999, which
provides for customer choice. The legislation provides for recovery of no less than 50 percent of stranded costs for all utilities. Transition costs must be approved by the NMPRC prior to being
recovered through a non-bypassable wires charge, which must be included in transition plan filings. SPS must separate its utility operations into at least two entities: energy generation
and competitive services, and transmission and distribution utility services, either by the creation of separate affiliates that may be owned by a common holding company or by the sale of assets to
one or more third parties. A regulated company, in general, is prohibited from providing unregulated services. In May 2000, the NMPRC approved:

•

Customer
choice for residential, small commercial and educational customers by January 2002;

•

Customer
choice for commercial and industrial customers by July 2002; and

•

Completion
of SPS corporate separation by August 2001.

The
NMPRC has reopened its electric restructuring rulemakings to consider the impacts on New Mexico electricity markets arising from the volatile California electricity market
conditions. In addition, in February 2001, the New Mexico Senate approved a bill that would delay the implementation of restructuring and retail choice until 2007. The House has yet to act on
the proposal to delay. We cannot predict the changes that may result from reconsideration of the restructuring legislation or the NMPRC's reconsideration of its regulations as a result of the
continuing and significant conditions in the California markets.

Texas Restructuring

In June 1999, an electric utility restructuring act (SB-7) was passed in Texas,
which provides for the implementation of retail competition for most areas of the state, including SPS' service area, beginning January 2002. The PUCT can delay the date for full retail
competition if a


power region is unable to offer fair competition and reliable service during the 2001 pilot projects. The legislation requires:

•

A
rate freeze for all customers until January 2002;

•

An
annual earnings test through 2001;

•

A
6-percent rate reduction for those residential and small commercial customers who choose not to switch suppliers at the start of retail
competition;

•

The
unbundling of business activities, costs and rates relating to generation, transmission and distribution, and retail services;

•

Reductions
in NO

X

and SO


emissions; and

•

The
recovery of stranded costs.

SB-7
requires each utility to unbundle its business activities into three separate legal entities: a power generation company, a regulated transmission and distribution
company, and a retail electric provider. SB-7 limits the market share that a single generation provider can control to 20 percent of the generating capacity within a qualified power
region. The establishment of a qualified power region with multiple generation suppliers is required under SB-7 in order to implement full retail competition. SPS must return any excess
earnings above its last allowed rate of return for 1999, 2000 and 2001, or alternatively may direct any excess earnings to improvements in transmission and distribution facilities, to capital
expenditures to improve air quality or to accelerate the amortization of regulatory assets, subject to PUCT approval.

The
Texas legislature is currently considering amendments to SB-7 that would delay the implementation of business separation and customer choice in SPS' market area for
5 years.

Implementation

SPS filed its business separation plan in Texas during the first quarter of 2000 for the unbundling of
power generation, transmission, and distribution and retail electric provider services. In April 2000, the PUCT approved SPS' business separation plan. The plan provides for the separation of
all competitive energy services, the establishment of an Xcel Energy customer care company, which will provide customer services for all of Xcel Energy's operating utilities, and a formal code of
conduct and compliance manual for managing affiliate transactions.

Subject
to all required approvals and indebtedness restrictions, it is anticipated that all generation-related and certain other assets and liabilities will be transferred at net book
value to newly formed affiliates in accordance with SPS' business separation plan. It is expected that SPS and its affiliates will be capitalized consistent with their respective business operations.

In
April 2000, SPS filed with the PUCT a stipulation agreement that specifically addresses SPS' implementation plans to meet the requirements of the Texas restructuring
legislation. The stipulation provides for the implementation of full retail customer choice by SPS in its Texas service region, including the future divestiture of certain SPS generation assets.
Subject to certain market conditions and confirmation by the SEC that the sale would not violate pooling accounting treatment, SPS agreed to divest at least 1,750 megawatts by January 2002, and
specifically identified the plants that it would sell in connection with additional divestitures required to establish a qualified power region under SB-7. In subsequent discussions, the
SEC has indicated that the sale of generation assets prior to August 2002 would violate pooling accounting. For SPS to comply with this qualified power region requirement and to implement full
customer choice in Texas, between 2,843 megawatts and 3,184 megawatts of existing power generation assets or capacity must be sold to third-party non-affiliates. SPS has committed to
complete these divestitures by January 2006. In May 2000, the PUCT issued an order approving the stipulation. SPS has committed to transfer functional control of its electric
transmission system to a regional transmission organization that will operate the transmission systems of multiple owners in the central United States.

SPS
filed a rate case in March 2000 to set the rates for distribution services in Texas, which are to be unbundled and implemented in January 2002. SPS requested
recovery of all jurisdictional costs


associated with restructuring in Texas. Hearings and a final rate order are not expected before August 2001.

In
June 2000, SPS filed its transition plan with the NMPRC. SPS filed to establish rates for the transmission and distribution business in New Mexico, requesting approval of
its corporate restructuring/separation and other associated matters. Hearings were held in October and November 2000. Final approval is not expected until mid-2001.

Financial Impact

With the issuance of a final written order by the PUCT in May 2000, addressing the
implementation of electric utility restructuring, SPS discontinued regulatory accounting under SFAS 71 for the generation portion of its business during the second quarter of 2000. Consistent
with current accounting rules, this resulted in extraordinary charges in the second and third quarters of 2000. During the second quarter of 2000, SPS wrote off its generation-related regulatory
assets and liabilities, totaling approximately $19.3 million before taxes. This resulted in an after-tax extraordinary charge of approximately $13.7 million against the
earnings of Xcel Energy and SPS. During the third quarter of
2000, SPS recorded an extraordinary charge of $8.2 million before tax, or $5.3 million after tax, related to the tender offer and defeasance of approximately $295 million of first
mortgage bonds. The first mortgage bonds were defeased to facilitate SPS' eventual divesture of generation assets.

SPS
transmission and distribution business continues to meet the requirements of SFAS 71, as that business is expected to remain regulated.

Additionally,
there may be other significant financial implications of implementing SB-7 and electric restructuring in New Mexico. These implications include, but are not
limited to, investments in information technology, establishing an independent operation of the electric transmission systems, implementing the procedures to govern affiliate transactions, the pricing
of unbundled energy services and the regulatory recovery of incurred costs related to these issues. These costs could be as much as $75 million. The total impacts of restructuring are unknown
at this time and may have a significant financial impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Xcel Energy and SPS.

current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities and credit quality.

The
fair-value estimates presented are based on information available to management as of Dec. 31, 2000 and 1999. These fair-value estimates have not
been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since that date, and current estimates of fair values may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.


Guarantees

Xcel Energy has entered into a construction contract guarantee that assures Quixx's performance under its engineering, procurement and construction contract
with Borger Energy Associates, LP (BEA). Quixx, which owns 45 percent of BEA, is constructing a 230-megawatt cogeneration facility at a Phillips Petroleum site near Borger, Texas.
The maximum aggregate amount of this guarantee at Dec. 31, 2000, was $88.4 million. This maximum amount decreases to $25 million at commercial operation of the facility and
remains in effect for a period of no longer than 24 months before expiring.

In
July 1999, Xcel Energy entered into a guarantee resulting from non-completion of certain milestone achievements within required dates in connection with the
Quixx Linden cogeneration plant. The guarantee, totaling approximately $7.5 million, is for the benefit of Bank One and all other lenders in Quixx Linden, LP. Once the milestone events are
accomplished, the guarantee is required to remain for six months.

As
of Dec. 31, 2000, Xcel Energy had outstanding approximately $190 million of guarantees relating to e prime. These guarantees were made to facilitate e prime's natural
gas marketing and trading activities.

As
of Dec. 31, 2000, Xcel Energy provided guarantees for EMI of approximately $27 million. Approximately $12 million of these guarantees related to energy
conservation projects in which EMI has guaranteed certain energy savings to the customer. As energy savings are realized each year due to these projects, the value of the guarantee decreases until it
reaches zero in 2017. Approximately $15 million of the guarantees relates to EMI's line of credit with US Bank.

The
Bank of New York has provided a letter of credit, at the request of Xcel Energy, of approximately $1.0 million to fulfill debt service reserve requirements as support for a
Young Gas Storage Co., Ltd. loan. Young Gas Storage entered into a $30.7-million credit agreement with various lending institutions in March 1999 with a maturity of
March 2014. The loan was incurred for the development and construction of an underground natural gas storage facility in northeastern Colorado. Separately, Xcel Energy has guaranteed up to
$4.5 million to cover costs of expenses related to the project.

NSP-Minnesota
has sold a portion of its other receivables to a third party. The portion of the receivables sold consisted of customer loans to local and state government
entities for energy efficiency improvements under various conservation programs offered by NSP-Minnesota. Under the sales agreements, NSP-Minnesota is required to guarantee
repayment to the third party of the remaining loan balances. At Dec. 31, 2000, the outstanding balance of the loans was approximately $18.1 million. Based on prior collection experience
of these loans, NSP-Minnesota believes that losses under the loan guarantees, if any, would have an immaterial impact on the results of operations.

In
connection with an agreement for the sale of electric power, SPS guaranteed certain obligations of a customer totaling approximately $27.8 million at Dec. 31, 2000.
These obligations related to the construction of certain utility property that, in the event of default by the customer, would revert to SPS.

In
June 2000, Xcel Energy entered into a guarantee on behalf of BNP Paribas in connection with a letter of credit provided by BNP Paribas at the request of SPS in the amount of
$5 million, expiring March 2002. The letter of credit is required to indemnify former SPS board of directors.

Derivatives

As of Dec. 31, 2000, NRG had four interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling approximately $533 million. If the swaps had been
discontinued on Dec. 31, 2000, NRG would have owed the counterparties approximately $31 million. NRG believes that its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by the counterparties
to the hedging contracts is insignificant. These swaps are described below.


•

A
swap effectively converts a $16-million issue of non-recourse variable rate debt into fixed-rate debt. The swap
expires in September 2002 and is secured by the Camas Power Boiler assets.

•

A
swap converts $178 million of non-recourse variable rate debt into fixed-rate debt. The swap expires in
December 2014 and is secured by the Crockett Cogeneration assets.

•

A
swap converts £188 million, the equivalent of $281 million, of non-recourse variable rate debt into
fixed-rate debt. The swap expires in June 2019 and is secured by the Killingholme assets.

•

A
swap converts variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The notional amount is AUD 105 million, the equivalent of $59 million as of
Dec. 31, 2000. The swap expires in September 2012 and is secured by the Flinders Power assets.

SPS
has an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $25 million, converting variable rate debt to a fixed-rate. Young Gas Storage and Quixx Linden projects,
which are unconsolidated equity investments of Xcel Energy, have interest rate swaps converting project debt from variable rate to fixed rate. These two amortizing swaps had a total notional amount of
$39.5 million on Dec. 31, 2000. The approximate termination cost of Xcel Energy's portion of these three swaps was $4.5 million at Dec. 31, 2000.

Xcel
Energy's regulated energy marketing operation uses a combination of energy futures and forward contracts, along with physical supply to hedge market risks in the energy market.
At Dec. 31, 2000, the notional value of these contracts was approximately $90.4 million. If these contracts had been terminated on Dec. 31, 2000, Xcel Energy would have realized a
net gain of approximately $18.7 million. Management believes the risk of counterparty nonperformance with regards to any of the hedging transactions is not significant.

NRG's
Power Marketing subsidiary uses energy futures and forward contracts, along with physical supply, to hedge market risk in the energy market. At Dec. 31, 2000, the net
notional amount of these contracts was approximately $309.3 million. If the contracts had been terminated on Dec. 31, 2000, NRG would have received approximately $52.8 million.
Management believes the risk of counterparty nonperformance with regards to any of the hedging transactions is not significant.

e
prime uses various financial instruments as hedging mechanisms against future energy-related contractual obligations. e prime had financial derivatives related to its retail
business with a notional value of $8.3 million at Dec. 31, 2000. If these contracts had been terminated at Dec. 31, 2000, e prime would have realized a net gain of
$3.9 million. In addition, e prime's wholesale portfolio had a net notional value of ($0.5) million, based on a combination of physical and financial transactions. If these contracts had been
terminated on Dec. 31, 2000, e prime would have received $3.3 million from the counterparties. Management believes the risk of counterparty nonperformance with regards to any of the
hedging transactions is not significant.

NRG
had one foreign currency hedge outstanding at Dec. 31, 2000. The contract had a notional value of $8.8 million and hedged expected cash flows from the Killingholme
project in England. The currency hedge expired on Jan. 31, 2001. If the contract had been terminated on Dec. 31, 2000, NRG would have paid the counterparties $0.7 million.
Management believes the risk of counterparty nonperformance with regards to any of the hedging transactions is not significant.

Letters of Credit

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries use letters of credit, generally with terms of one year, to provide financial guarantees for certain operating obligations. In
addition, NRG uses letters of credit for nonregulated equity commitments, collateral for credit agreements, fuel purchase and operating
commitments, and bids on development projects. At Dec. 31, 2000, there were $113 million in letters of credit outstanding, including $58 million related to NRG commitments. The
contract amounts of these letters of credit approximate their fair value and are subject to fees determined in the marketplace.


14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Legislative Resource Commitments

In 1994, NSP-Minnesota received Minnesota legislative approval for additional on-site temporary spent fuel storage facilities at its
Prairie Island nuclear power plant, provided NSP-Minnesota satisfies certain requirements. Seventeen dry cask containers were approved. As of Dec. 31, 2000,
NSP-Minnesota had loaded twelve casks. The Minnesota Legislature established several energy resource and other commitments for NSP-Minnesota to obtain the Prairie Island
temporary nuclear fuel storage facility approval. These commitments can be met by building, purchasing, or in the case of biomass, converting generation resources.

The
1994 legislation requires NSP-Minnesota to have 425 megawatts of wind resources contracted by Dec. 31, 2002. Of this commitment, approximately 80 megawatts
remain to be contracted. During 1999, the MPUC ordered an additional 400 megawatts to be contracted by 2012, subject to least-cost determinations. The 1994 legislation also requires
NSP-Minnesota to contract for 125 megawatts of biomass-fueled energy, which has essentially been fulfilled.

Other
commitments established by the Legislature include a discount for low-income electric customers, required conservation improvement expenditures and various study and
reporting requirements to a legislative electric energy task force. NSP-Minnesota has implemented programs to meet the legislative commitments. NSP-Minnesota's capital
commitments include the known effects of the Prairie Island legislation. The impact of the legislation on future power purchase commitments and other operating expenses is not yet determinable.

Capital Commitments

As discussed in Liquidity and Capital under Management's Discussion and Analysis, the estimated cost, as of Dec. 31, 2000, of the capital expenditure
programs of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries and other capital requirements is approximately $5.0 billion in 2001, $3.0 billion in 2002 and $3.3 billion in 2003.

The
capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification. Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes
in electric and natural gas projected load growth, the desired reserve margin and the availability of purchased power, as well as alternative plans for meeting Xcel Energy's long-term
energy needs. In addition, Xcel Energy's ongoing evaluation of merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities to support corporate strategies, address restructuring requirements and comply with
future requirements to install emission control equipment may impact actual capital requirements.

Xcel
Energy's capital expenditures include approximately $3.1 billion in 2001 for NRG investments and asset acquisitions. NRG's future capital requirements may vary
significantly. For 2001, NRG's capital requirements reflect expected acquisitions of existing generation facilities, including the Conectiv fossil assets, North Valmy, LS Power, Clark
gas-fired assets, Reid Gardner coal-fired assets and the Bridgeport and New Haven Harbor coal-fired facilities.

California Power Market

NRG operates in and sells to the wholesale power market in California. During the fourth quarter of 2000, the inability of certain California utilities to
recover rising energy costs through regulated prices charged to retail customers created financial difficulties. The California utilities have appealed to state agencies and regulators for the
opportunity to be reimbursed for costs incurred that are not currently recoverable through the existing rate structure. Absent such relief, some of the utilities have indicated they may be unable to
continue to service their debt and/or otherwise pay obligations, or would consider discontinuing energy service to customers to avoid incurring costs that are not recoverable. Due to these
circumstances, various bond rating agencies have lowered the credit rating of the California utilities to below investment grade. California state agencies and regulators, along with federal agencies
such as the FERC have characterized the situation as a national emergency. Although


changes may be necessary in the California utility regulatory model to address the problem in the long run, in the short term the alternatives being discussed include financial support for distressed
utilities to ensure continued energy service to California customers. However, at this time it is unknown whether or when such financial support will be made available to California utilities.

At
Dec. 31, 2000, NRG had not yet collected approximately $105 million in revenues from distressed utilities and the independent system operator in California, which are
potentially at risk if financial relief or support is not provided. In addition, Xcel Energy's wholesale trading operation has a receivable from the California Independent System Operator for
approximately $3 million. Although there is uncertainty as to the final resolution of this matter, management believes that its revenue from California utilities and the independent system
operator will ultimately be collected.

Tax Matters

PSR Investments, Inc. (PSRI), a subsidiary of PSCo, owns and manages permanent life insurance policies on certain past and present employees. The IRS
has issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment proposing to disallow interest expense related to corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policy loans taken in tax years 1993-1997. The total
disallowance of interest expense deductions for the five years as proposed by the IRS is approximately $175 million. A request for technical advice from the IRS National Office with respect to
the proposed adjustment is pending. In addition, interest expense deductions for the period 1998 through 2000 totals approximately $168 million.

Management
is vigorously contesting this issue. While the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted, management believes that PSRI's tax deduction of interest expense on life
insurance policy loans was in full compliance with the tax law and believes that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse impact on Xcel Energy's financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. For this reason, PSRI has not recorded any provision for income tax or interest expense related to this matter and has continued to take deductions for interest expense
related to policy loans on its income tax returns for subsequent years.

Postemployment Benefits

PSCo adopted accrual accounting for postemployment benefits under SFAS No. 112—"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" in 1994.
The costs of these benefits were historically recorded on a pay-as-you-go basis and, accordingly, PSCo recorded regulatory assets in anticipation of obtaining
future rate recovery of these costs. PSCo recovered its FERC jurisdictional portion of these costs. PSCo requested approval to recover its Colorado retail natural gas jurisdictional portion in a 1996
retail rate case and its retail electric jurisdictional portion in the electric earnings test filing for 1997. In the 1996 rate case, the CPUC allowed recovery of postemployment benefit costs on an
accrual basis, but denied PSCo's request to amortize the regulatory asset. PSCo appealed this decision to the Denver District Court. In 1998, the CPUC deferred the final determination of the
regulatory treatment of the electric jurisdictional costs pending the outcome of PSCo's appeals on the natural gas rate case. On Dec. 16, 1999, the Denver District Court affirmed the decision
by the CPUC. On Jan. 31, 2000, PSCo filed a Notice of Appeal with the Colorado Supreme Court and expects a final decision on this matter during 2001. PSCo continues to believe that it will
ultimately be allowed to recover this regulatory asset. If PSCo is unsuccessful in its appeal, all unrecoverable amounts totaling approximately $23 million will be written off.

Conservation Incentive Recovery

In June 1999, the MPUC denied NSP-Minnesota recovery of 1998 lost margins, load management discounts and incentives associated with
state-mandated programs for electric energy conservation. Xcel Energy recorded a $35 million charge in 1999 based on this action. NSP-Minnesota appealed the MPUC decision and in
December 2000, the Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed the MPUC decision.

In
January 2001, the MPUC appealed the lower court decision to the Minnesota Supreme Court. On Feb. 23, 2001, the Minnesota Supreme Court declined to hear the MPUC's
appeal. NSP-Minnesota


is awaiting an order from the MPUC regarding the implementation of the appeals court decision before adjusting any liabilities recorded for this matter. As of Dec. 31, 2000,
NSP-Minnesota had recorded a liability of $40 million, including carrying charges, for potential refunds to customers pending the final resolution of this matter.

Leases

Xcel Energy's subsidiaries lease various equipment and facilities used in the normal course of business, some of which are accounted for as capital leases.
Expiration of the capital leases range from 2010 to 2029. The net book value of property under capital leases was approximately $55 million and $57 million at Dec. 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively. Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded as property at the lower of fair-market value or the present value of future lease payments and are amortized over
their actual contract term in accordance with practices allowed by regulators. The related obligation is classified as long-term debt. Executory costs are excluded from the minimum lease
payments.

Rental
expense under operating lease obligations was approximately $56 million, $57 million and $49 million for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Future
commitments under these leases generally decline from current levels.

Nuclear Insurance

NSP-Minnesota's public liability for claims resulting from any nuclear incident is limited to $9.5 billion under the 1988 Price-Anderson
amendment to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. NSP-Minnesota has secured $200 million of coverage for its public liability exposure with a pool of insurance companies.
The remaining $9.3 billion of exposure is funded by the Secondary Financial Protection Program, available from assessments by the federal government in case of a nuclear accident.
NSP-Minnesota is subject to assessments of up to $88 million for each of its three licensed reactors to be applied for public liability arising from a nuclear incident at any
licensed nuclear facility in the United States. The maximum funding requirement is $10 million per reactor during any one year.

NSP-Minnesota
purchases insurance for property damage and site decontamination cleanup costs from Nuclear Electric Insurance Ltd. (NEIL). The coverage limits are
$1.5 billion for each of NSP-Minnesota's two nuclear plant sites. NEIL also provides business interruption insurance coverage, including the cost of replacement power obtained
during certain prolonged accidental outages of nuclear generating units. Premiums are expensed over the policy term. All companies insured with NEIL are subject to retroactive premium adjustments if
losses exceed accumulated reserve funds. Capital has been accumulated in the reserve funds of NEIL to the extent that NSP-Minnesota would have no exposure for retroactive premium
assessments in case of a single incident under the business interruption and the property damage insurance coverage. However, in each calendar year, NSP-Minnesota could be subject to
maximum assessments of approximately $3 million for business interruption insurance and $11 million for property damage insurance if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds.

Fuel Contracts

Xcel Energy has contracts providing for the purchase and delivery of a significant portion of its current coal, nuclear fuel and natural gas requirements.
These contracts expire in various years between 2001 and 2017. In total, Xcel Energy is committed to the minimum purchase of approximately $2.1 billion of coal, $13 million of nuclear
fuel and $706 million of natural gas and related transportation, or to make payments in lieu thereof, under these contracts. In addition, Xcel Energy is required to pay additional amounts
depending on actual quantities shipped under these agreements. Xcel Energy's risk of loss, in the form of increased costs, from market price changes in fuel is mitigated through the
cost-of-energy adjustment provision of the ratemaking process, which provides for recovery of most fuel costs.


Purchase Power Agreements

The utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy have entered into agreements with utilities and other energy suppliers for purchased power to meet system load and
energy requirements, replace generation from company-owned units under maintenance and during outages, and meet operating reserve obligations. NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS have various
pay-for-performance contracts with expiration dates through the year 2033. In general, these contracts provide for capacity payments, subject to meeting certain contract
obligations, and energy payments based on actual power taken under the contracts. Most of the capacity and energy costs are recovered through base rates and other cost recovery mechanisms.
Additionally, NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS have long-term, purchased-power contracts with various regional utilities, expiring through 2025.

NSP-Minnesota
has a 500-megawatt participation power purchase commitment with Manitoba Hydro, which expires in 2005. The cost of this agreement is based on
80 percent of the costs of owning and operating NSP-Minnesota's Sherco 3 generating plant, adjusted to 1993 dollars. In addition, NSP-Minnesota and Manitoba Hydro have
seasonal diversity exchange agreements, and there are no capacity payments for the diversity exchanges. These commitments represent about 17 percent of Manitoba Hydro's system capacity and
account for approximately 10 percent of NSP-Minnesota's 2000 electric system capability. The risk of loss from nonperformance by Manitoba Hydro is not considered significant, and
the risk of loss from market price changes is mitigated through cost-of-energy rate adjustments.

At
Dec. 31, 2000, the estimated future payments for capacity that the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy are obligated to purchase, subject to availability, are as follows:

For
the past 37 years, Cheyenne has purchased all energy requirements from PacifiCorp. Cheyenne's full-requirements power purchase agreement with PacifiCorp expired
in December 2000. During 2000, Cheyenne issued a request for proposal and conducted negotiations with PacifiCorp and other wholesale power suppliers. During 2000, as contract details for a new
agreement were being finalized, supply conditions and market prices in the western United States dramatically changed. Cheyenne was unable to execute an agreement with PacifiCorp for the prices and
terms Cheyenne had been negotiating. Additionally, PacifiCorp failed to provide the FERC and Cheyenne 60-days notice to terminate service, as required by the Federal Power Act. Cheyenne
filed a complaint with the FERC, requesting that PacifiCorp continue providing service under the existing tariff through the 60-day notice period. On Feb. 7, 2001, the FERC issued
an order requiring PacifiCorp to provide service under the terms of the old contract through Feb. 24, 2001.

Cheyenne
has begun implementing the changes required to transition from a full-requirements customer to an operating utility as the best means of providing energy supply.
In February 2001, PSCo filed an
agreement with the FERC to provide a portion of Cheyenne's service. Cheyenne has also entered into agreements with other producers to meet both short-term and long-term energy
supply needs and continues to negotiate with suppliers to meet its load requirements for the summer of 2001.

Total
purchased power costs are projected to increase approximately $80 million in 2001. Purchased power and natural gas costs are recoverable in Wyoming. Cheyenne is required
to file applications with the WPSC for approval of adjustment mechanisms in advance of the proposed


effective date and demonstrate the reasonableness of the costs. Cheyenne expects to make its request for an electric cost adjustment increase in March 2001.

Environmental Contingencies

We are subject to regulations covering air and water quality, the storage of natural gas and the storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic wastes. We
continuously assess our compliance. Regulations, interpretations and enforcement policies can change, which may impact the construction and operation of, and cost of building and operating, our
facilities.

Site Remediation

We must pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate sites where past activities of our subsidiaries and some other parties have caused environmental
contamination. At Dec. 31, 2000, there were three categories of sites:

•

Third-party
sites, such as landfills, to which we are alleged to be a potentially responsible party (PRP) that sent hazardous materials and wastes;

•

The
site of a former federal uranium enrichment facility; and

•

Sites
of former manufactured gas plants (MGPs) operated by our subsidiaries or predecessors.

We
record a liability when we have enough information to develop an estimate of the cost of remediating a site and revise the estimate as information is received. The estimated
remediation cost may vary materially.

To
estimate the cost to remediate these sites, we may have to make assumptions where facts are not fully known. For instance, we might make assumptions about the nature and extent of
site contamination, the extent of required cleanup efforts, costs of alternative cleanup methods and pollution control technologies, the period over which remediation will be performed and paid for,
changes in environmental remediation and pollution control requirements, the potential effect of technological improvements, the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties
and the identification of new environmental cleanup sites.

We
revise our estimates as facts become known, but at Dec. 31, 2000, our liability for the cost of remediating sites for which an estimate was possible was $54 million,
including $14 million in current liabilities.

Some
of the cost of remediation may be recovered from others through:

•

Insurance
coverage;

•

Recovery
from other parties that have contributed to the contamination; and

•

Recovery
from customers.

Neither
the total remediation cost nor the final method of cost allocation among all PRPs of the unremediated sites has been determined. We have recorded estimates of our share of
future costs for these sites. We are not aware of any other parties' inability to pay, nor do we know if responsibility for any of the sites is in dispute.

Federal Uranium Enrichment Facility

Approximately $23 million of the long-term liability and $4 million of the current liability relate to a DOE assessment to
NSP-Minnesota and PSCo for decommissioning a federal uranium enrichment facility. These environmental liabilities do not include accruals recorded and collected from customers in rates for
future nuclear fuel disposal costs or decommissioning costs related to NSP-Minnesota's nuclear generating plants. See Note 15 to Financial Statements for further discussion of
nuclear obligations.


MGP Sites

NSP-Wisconsin was named as one of three PRPs for creosote and coal tar contamination at a site in Ashland, Wis. The Ashland site includes property
owned by NSP-Wisconsin and two other properties: an adjacent city, lakeshore park area and a small area of Lake Superior's Chequemegon Bay adjoining the park.

The
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) and NSP-Wisconsin have each developed several estimates of the ultimate cost to remediate the Ashland site. The
estimates vary significantly, between $4 million and $93 million, because different methods of remediation and different results are assumed in each. The EPA and WDNR are expected to
select the method of remediation to use at the site during late 2001 or early 2002. Until the EPA and the WDNR select a remediation strategy for all operable units at the site and determine the level
of responsibility of each PRP, we are not able to accurately estimate our share of the ultimate cost of remediating the Ashland site.

In
the interim, NSP-Wisconsin has recorded a liability for an estimate of its share of the cost of remediating the portion of the Ashland site that it owns, estimated
using information available to date and using reasonably effective remedial methods. NSP-Wisconsin has deferred, as a regulatory asset, the remediation costs accrued for the Ashland site
because we expect that the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) will continue to allow NSP-Wisconsin to recover payments for environmental remediation from its customers. The PSCW
has consistently authorized recovery in NSP-Wisconsin rates of all remediation costs incurred at the Ashland site, and has authorized recovery of similar remediation costs for other
Wisconsin utilities.

We
proposed, and the EPA and WDNR have approved, an interim action (a groundwater treatment system) for one operable unit at the site for which NSP-Wisconsin has accepted
responsibility. The groundwater treatment system began operating in the fall of 2000. NSP-Wisconsin continues to work
with the WDNR to access state and federal funds to apply to ultimate remediation cost of the entire site. It is probable that, even with outside funding, final remedial costs to be borne by
NSP-Wisconsin will be material.

The
MPUC allowed NSP-Minnesota to defer certain remediation costs of four active remediation sites in 1994. In September 1998, the MPUC allowed the recovery of
these MGP site remediation costs in natural gas rates, with a portion assigned to NSP's electric operations for two sites formerly used by NSP generating facilities. Accordingly,
NSP-Minnesota has recorded an environmental regulatory asset for these costs. NSP-Minnesota may request recovery of costs to remediate other activated sites following the
completion of preliminary investigations.

Other

Some of our facilities contain asbestos. Most asbestos will remain undisturbed until the facilities that contain it are demolished or renovated. Since we
intend to operate most of these facilities indefinitely, we cannot estimate the amount or timing of payments for its final removal. It may be necessary to remove some asbestos to perform maintenance
or make improvements to other equipment. The cost of removing asbestos as part of other work is immaterial and is recorded as incurred as operating expenses for maintenance projects, capital
expenditures for construction projects or removal costs for demolition projects.

In
January 1996, in a lawsuit by PSCo against its insurance providers, the Denver District Court entered final judgment in favor of PSCo in the amount of $5.6 million
for certain cleanup costs at the Barter site in central Denver. In September 1999, the Colorado Supreme Court held that the trial court should have allocated the damages and
self-insured retentions over the entire period the facilities were in operation. Although the Colorado Supreme Court remanded the judgement to the trial court for additional proceedings,
it suggested that its ruling may reduce PSCo's available recovery to approximately $1.4 million. PSCo requested recovery of environmental costs of approximately


$7.7 million related to Barter over four years in its proposed Performance-Based Regulatory Plan for calendar years 1998-2001.

Plant Emissions

In 1996, a conservation organization filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court pursuant to provisions of the Clean Air Act against the joint owners of the
Craig Steam Electric Generating Station, located in western Colorado. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc. is the operator of the Craig station and PSCo owns an
undivided interest in each of two units at the station, totaling approximately 9.7 percent. In October 2000, the parties, the EPA and the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment (CDPHE) reached an agreement in principle resolving all air-quality matters related to the facility. The final agreement was negotiated during the fourth quarter of 2000 and
was filed with the court on Jan. 10, 2001. The final agreement requires the installation of additional emission control equipment at a cost of approximately $105 million (based on an
estimate from Tri-State). The equipment will be installed over a period of several years. In addition, the settlement requires the defendants collectively to pay a civil penalty of
$500,000 and to contribute $1.5 million to fund conservation activities. The contribution to conservation activities will be refunded if the plant achieves a specified level of emissions
control. The agreement will become enforceable after a period for public comment and approval by the court.

In
October 2000, the EPA found that NSP-Wisconsin's French Island electric generating plant should be classified as a "large municipal waste combustor" under
Section 129 of the Clean Air Act. This letter was contrary to a 1997 EPA letter in which it had found that French Island should be classified as a "small combustor." The large combustor
emission limits became enforceable in December 2000. NSP-Wisconsin is attempting to work with the EPA to resolve the dispute regarding the status of the French Island plant. If a
resolution is finalized, it may require, among other things, the installation of additional emission controls on the plant.

NRG
also owns electric generating plants throughout the United States. These plants are subject to federal and state emission standards and other environmental regulations. NRG
continues to study and investigate the methods and costs of complying with these standards and regulations. Although the future financial effect is not yet known, it may be material.

The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts is seeking additional emissions reductions beyond current requirements. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP) has issued
proposed regulations that would require significant emissions reductions from certain coal-fired power plants in the state, including NRG's Somerset facility. The MDEP has proposed that
such facilities comply with stringent limits on emissions of NOx by December 2003; on emissions of SO


commencing in December 2003, with further reductions required by
December 2005; and on emissions of CO


by December 2005. In addition to output-based limits (a standard which limits emissions to a certain rate per net
megawatt-hour), the proposed regulations also would limit, by December 2003, the total emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide at the Somerset facility to no more than
75 percent of the average annual emissions of the Somerset facility for the years 1997 through 1999. Finally, the proposed regulations require the MDEP to evaluate, by December 2002, the
technological and economic feasibility of controlling or eliminating mercury emissions by the year 2010, and to propose mercury emission standards within 18 months of completion of the
feasibility evaluation. Compliance
with these proposed regulations, if such regulations become effective, could have a material impact on the operation of NRG's Somerset facility. The annual average carbon dioxide emission rate
identified in the proposed regulations cannot be met by the Somerset facility.

Legal Claims

In the normal course of business, Xcel Energy is a party to routine claims and litigation arising from prior and current operations. Xcel Energy is actively
defending these matters and has recorded an estimate of the probable cost of settlement or other disposition.


On Dec. 11, 1998, a natural gas explosion in St. Cloud, Minn., killed four people, including two NSP-Minnesota employees, injured approximately 14 people and
damaged several buildings. The accident occurred as a crew from Cable Constructors Inc. (CCI) was installing fiber optic cable for Seren. Seren, CCI and Sirti, an architecture/engineering firm
retained by Seren, are named as defendants in 22 lawsuits relating to the explosion. NSP-Minnesota is a defendant in 19 of the lawsuits. NSP-Minnesota and Seren deny any
liability for this accident. On July 11, 2000, the National Transportation Safety Board issued a report, which determined that CCI's inadequate installation procedures and delay in reporting
the natural gas hit were the proximate cause of the accident. NSP-Minnesota has a self-insured retention deductible of $2 million with general liability coverage limits
of $185 million. Seren's primary insurance coverage is $1 million and its secondary insurance coverage is $185 million. The ultimate cost to Xcel Energy, NSP-Minnesota
and Seren, if any, is presently unknown.

On
or about July 12, 1999, Fortistar Capital, Inc. commenced an action against NRG in Hennepin County (Minnesota) District Court, seeking damages in excess of
$100 million and an order restraining NRG from consummating the acquisition of Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.'s Oswego generating station. Fortistar's motion for a temporary restraining order was
denied. A temporary injunction hearing was held on Sept. 27, 1999. The acquisition was consummated in October 1999. On Jan. 14, 2000, the court denied Fortistar's request for a
temporary injunction. In April and December 2000, NRG filed summary judgment motions to dispose of the litigation respecting both liability and damages, and a hearing on these motions was held
on Jan. 26, 2001. No ruling on the motions has been received to date. A trial date has been scheduled for April 2001. NRG has asserted numerous counterclaims against Fortistar and will
continue to vigorously defend the suit.

NRG
and other power generators and power traders have been named as defendants in certain private plaintiff class actions filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for
the County of San Diego in San Diego, California, on Nov. 27, 2000, and Nov. 29, 2000, and in the Superior Court of the State of California, City and County of San Francisco filed
Jan. 24, 2001. NRG and other power generators and power traders have also been named in another suit filed on Jan. 16, 2001, in the Superior Court of the
State of California for the County of San Diego, brought by three California water districts, as consumers of electricity and in a suit filed on Jan. 18, 2001, in Superior Court of the State of
California, County of San Francisco, brought by the San Francisco City Attorney on behalf of the People of the State of California. Xcel Energy and Northern States Power Company were also named as
defendants in the litigation commenced in San Francisco because of their relationship with NRG. Although the complaints contain a number of allegations, the basic claim is that, by underbidding
forward contracts and exporting electricity to surrounding markets, the defendants, acting in collusion, were able to drive up wholesale prices on the Real Time and Replacement Reserve markets,
through the Western Systems Coordinating Council and otherwise. The complaints allege that the conduct violated California antitrust and unfair competition laws. NRG does not believe that it has
engaged in any illegal activities and intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits.

On
Feb. 3, 2000, Dynegy Engineering Inc. filed a lawsuit against Utility Engineering (UE), a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy, in Harris County, Texas. In its
lawsuit, Dynegy claims it is entitled to recover approximately $9.7 million for damages allegedly caused by UE's late and deficient engineering services performed for the Rocky Road electrical
generating plant in Dundee, Ill. UE denies the merits of Dynegy's lawsuit. UE also maintains that it is insured against this claim pursuant to its professional liability policy. UE's
self-insured retention under this policy is $1 million.

15. NUCLEAR OBLIGATIONS

Fuel Disposal

NSP-Minnesota is responsible for temporarily storing used or spent nuclear fuel from its nuclear plants. The DOE is responsible for permanently
storing spent fuel from NSP's nuclear plants as well as from other U.S. nuclear plants. NSP-Minnesota has funded its portion of the DOE's permanent disposal program since 1981. The fuel
disposal fees are based on a charge of 0.1 cent per kilowatt-hour


sold to customers from nuclear generation. Fuel expense includes DOE fuel disposal assessments of approximately $12 million in 2000, $12 million in 1999 and $11 million in 1998.
In total, NSP-Minnesota had paid approximately $284 million to the DOE through Dec. 31, 2000. However, we cannot determine whether the amount and method of the DOE's
assessments to all utilities will be sufficient to fully fund the DOE's permanent storage or disposal facility.

The
Nuclear Waste Policy Act required the DOE to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel no later than Jan. 31, 1998. In 1996, the DOE notified commercial spent fuel owners of an
anticipated delay in
accepting spent nuclear fuel by the required date and conceded that a permanent storage or disposal facility will not be available until at least 2010. NSP-Minnesota and other utilities
have commenced lawsuits against the DOE to recover damages caused by the DOE's failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations.

NSP-Minnesota
has its own temporary on-site storage facilities at its Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants. With the dry cask storage facilities
approved in 1994, management believes it has adequate storage capacity to continue operation of its Prairie Island nuclear plant until at least 2007. The Monticello nuclear plant has storage capacity
to continue operations until 2010. Storage availability to permit operation beyond these dates is not assured at this time. We are investigating alternatives for spent fuel storage until a DOE
facility is available, including pursuing the establishment of a private facility for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel as part of a consortium of electric utilities. If on-site
temporary storage at Prairie Island reaches approved capacity, we could seek interim storage at this or another contracted private facility, if available.

Nuclear
fuel expense includes payments to the DOE for the decommissioning and decontamination of the DOE's uranium enrichment facilities. In 1993, NSP-Minnesota recorded
the DOE's initial assessment of $46 million, which is payable in annual installments from 1993-2008. NSP-Minnesota is amortizing each installment to expense on a monthly
basis. The most recent installment paid in 2000 was $4 million; future installments are subject to inflation adjustments under DOE rules. NSP-Minnesota is obtaining rate recovery of
these DOE assessments through the cost-of-energy adjustment clause as the assessments are amortized. Accordingly, we deferred the unamortized assessment of $28 million
at Dec. 31, 2000, as a regulatory asset.

Plant Decommissioning

Decommissioning of NSP-Minnesota's nuclear facilities is planned for the years 2010-2022, using the prompt dismantlement method. We are
currently following industry practice by ratably accruing the costs for decommissioning over the approved cost recovery period and including the accruals in Utility Plant—Accumulated
Depreciation. Consequently, the total decommissioning cost obligation and corresponding assets currently are not recorded in Xcel Energy's financial statements.

The
FASB has proposed new accounting standards that, if approved, would require the full accrual of nuclear plant decommissioning and other site exit obligations no sooner than 2002.
Using Dec. 31, 2000, estimates, adoption of the proposed accounting would result in the recording of the total discounted decommissioning obligation of $838 million as a liability, with
the corresponding costs capitalized as plant and other assets and depreciated over the operating life of the plant. We have not yet determined the potential impact of the FASB's proposed changes in
the accounting for site exit obligations, such as costs of removal, other than nuclear decommissioning. However, the ultimate decommissioning and site exit costs to be accrued are expected to be
similar to the current methodology. The effects of
regulation are expected to minimize or eliminate any impact on operating expenses and results of operations from this future accounting change.

Consistent
with cost recovery in utility customer rates, we record annual decommissioning accruals based on periodic site-specific cost studies and a presumed level of
dedicated funding. Cost studies quantify decommissioning costs in current dollars. Funding presumes that current costs will escalate in the future at a rate of 4.5 percent per year. The total
estimated decommissioning costs that will ultimately be paid, net of income earned by external trust funds, is currently being accrued using an annuity approach over the approved plant recovery
period. This annuity approach uses an assumed rate


of return on funding, which is currently 5.5 percent, net of tax, for external funding and approximately 8 percent, net of tax, for internal funding.

The
MPUC last approved NSP-Minnesota's nuclear decommissioning study and related nuclear plant depreciation capital recovery request in April 2000, using 1999 cost
data. Although we expect to operate Prairie Island through the end of each unit's licensed life, the approved capital recovery would allow for the plant to be fully depreciated, including the accrual
and recovery of decommissioning costs, in 2007. This is about seven years earlier than each unit's licensed life. The approved recovery period for Prairie Island has been reduced because of the
uncertainty regarding used fuel storage. We believe future decommissioning cost accruals will continue to be recovered in customer rates.

The
total obligation for decommissioning currently is expected to be funded 100 percent by external funds, as approved by the MPUC. Contributions to the external fund started
in 1990 and are expected to continue until plant decommissioning begins. The assets held in trusts as of Dec. 31, 2000, primarily consisted of investments in fixed-income securities, such as
tax-exempt municipal bonds and U.S. government securities that mature in 1 to 20 years, and common stock of public companies. We plan to reinvest matured securities until
decommissioning begins.

At
Dec. 31, 2000, NSP-Minnesota had recorded and recovered in rates cumulative decommissioning accruals of $583 million. The following table summarizes the
funded status of NSP-Minnesota's decommissioning obligation at Dec. 31, 2000:

16. REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Our regulated businesses prepare their financial statements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 71, as discussed in Note 1 to the Financial
Statements. Under SFAS 71, regulatory assets and liabilities can be created for amounts that regulators may allow us to collect, or may require us to pay back to customers in future electric
and natural gas rates.

SFAS 71
accounting cannot be used by any portion of our business that is not regulated. Efforts to restructure and deregulate the utility industry have already ended our
ability to apply SFAS 71 to the generation business of SPS and may further reduce or end our ability to apply SFAS 71 in the future. Write-offs and material changes to our
balance sheet, income and cash flows may result.

Restructuring
legislation was enacted in the SPS jurisdictions of Texas and New Mexico. See Note 12 to the Financial Statements. When the final PUCT restructuring order was
issued in May 2000, SPS discontinued using SFAS 71 accounting for its electric generation business. In the second quarter of 2000, SPS' generation-related regulatory assets and other
deferred costs were written off. SPS' electric transmission and distribution businesses continue to meet the requirements of SFAS 71 and are expected to remain regulated.

18. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION

Xcel Energy has five reportable segments: Electric Utility, Gas Utility and three of its nonregulated energy businesses, NRG, Xcel International and e prime,
all subsidiaries of Xcel Energy.

•

Xcel
Energy's Electric Utility generates, transmits and distributes electricity in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado,
Texas, New Mexico, Wyoming, Kansas and Oklahoma. It also makes sales for resale and provides wholesale transmission service to various entities in the United States. Electric Utility also
includes electric trading.

•

Xcel
Energy's Gas Utility transmits, transports, stores and distributes natural gas and propane primarily in portions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North
Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming.

•

NRG
develops, builds, acquires, owns and operates several nonregulated energy-related businesses, including independent power production, commercial and
industrial heating and cooling, and energy-related refuse-derived fuel production, both domestically and outside the United States.

•

Xcel
Energy International's most significant holding is Yorkshire Power, a joint venture equally owned by Xcel Energy International and a subsidiary of
American Electric Power Co. Yorkshire's main business is the distribution and supply of electricity and the supply of natural gas in the United Kingdom.

•

e
prime trades and markets natural gas throughout the United States.

Revenues
from operating segments not included above are below the necessary quantitative thresholds and are therefore included in the All Other category. Those primarily include a
company


involved in nonregulated power and natural gas marketing activities throughout the United States; a company that invests in and develops cogeneration and energy-related projects; a company that is
engaged in engineering, design construction management and other miscellaneous services; a company engaged in energy consulting, energy efficiency management, conservation programs and mass market
services; an affordable housing investment company; a broadband telecommunications company; and several other small companies and businesses.

To
report net income for electric and natural gas utility segments, Xcel Energy must assign or allocate all costs and certain other income. In general, costs are:

•

Directly
assigned wherever applicable;

•

Allocated
based on cost causation allocators wherever applicable; and

•

Allocated
based on a general allocator for all other costs not assigned by the above two methods.

The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Xcel Energy evaluates performance by each legal
entity based on profit or loss generated from the product or service provided.
