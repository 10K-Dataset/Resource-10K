PART I
ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
================================================================================


         Northern States Power Company (the Company) was incorporated in 1909
under the laws of Minnesota. Its executive offices are located at 414 Nicollet
Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401. (Phone 612-330-5500). The Company has two
significant subsidiaries, Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation
(the Wisconsin Company) and NRG Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (NRG). The
Company also has several other subsidiaries, including Energy Masters
International, Inc. (EMI) (formerly known as Cenerprise, Inc.), a Minnesota
corporation; Viking Gas Transmission Company, a Delaware corporation (Viking);
and Eloigne Company, a Minnesota corporation (Eloigne). (See "Gas Utility
Operations - Viking Gas Transmission Company" and "Non-Regulated Subsidiaries"
herein for further discussion of these subsidiaries.) The Company and its
subsidiaries collectively are referred to herein as NSP.

         NSP is predominantly an operating public utility engaged in the
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity throughout an
approximately 49,000 square mile service area and the transportation, storage,
and distribution of natural gas in approximately 151 communities within this
area. Viking is a regulated natural gas transmission company that operates a
500-mile interstate natural gas pipeline. NRG operates several non-regulated
energy businesses and is an equity investor in many non-regulated energy
affiliates throughout the world.

         The Company serves customers in Minnesota, North Dakota and South
Dakota. The Wisconsin Company serves customers in Wisconsin and Michigan. Of the
approximately 3 million people served by the Company and the Wisconsin Company,
the majority are concentrated in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. In
1997, about 62 percent of NSP's electric retail revenue was derived from sales
in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area and about 54 percent of retail gas
revenue came from sales in the St. Paul metropolitan area. (For business segment
information, see Note 15 of Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8.)

         NSP's utility businesses are currently experiencing some of the
challenges common to regulated electric and gas utility companies, namely,
increasing competition for customers, increasing pressure to control costs,
uncertainties in regulatory processes and increasing costs of compliance with
environmental laws and regulations. In addition, there are uncertainties related
to permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. (See Management's Discussion and
Analysis under Item 7, Notes 13 and 14 of Notes to Financial Statements under
Item 8 and "Electric Utility Operations - Capability and Demand and Nuclear
Power Plants - Licensing, Operation and Waste Disposal," herein, for further
discussion of this matter.)

         A significant portion of NSP's earnings comes from non-regulated
operations. The non-regulated projects in which NRG has invested carry a higher
level of risk than NSP's traditional utility businesses. (See Management's
Discussion and Analysis under Item 7 herein, for further discussion of this
matter.)

         Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters
discussed in this Form 10-K, are forward looking statements that are subjects to
certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Such forward-looking statements
are intended to be identified in this document by the words "anticipate,"
"estimate," "expect," "objective," "possible," "potential" and similar
expressions. Actual results may vary materially. Factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: general economic
conditions, including their impact on capital expenditures; business conditions
in the energy industry; competitive factors; unusual weather; changes in federal
or state legislation; regulation; and the other risk factors listed from time to
time by the Company in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), including Exhibit 99.01 to this report on Form 10-K.


TERMINATION OF PROPOSED MERGER WITH WISCONSIN ENERGY CORPORATION

         As discussed in the Company's Form 8-K filed on May 19, 1997, NSP and
Wisconsin Energy Corporation (WEC) announced on May 16, 1997 that they mutually
agreed to terminate their plans to merge the two companies. As a result of the
merger termination, NSP charged to expense in the second quarter of 1997 its
share of deferred merger-related costs. (See Management's Discussion and
Analysis under Item 7 herein, for discussion of the financial effects of the
merger termination.)

         The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) required NSP to
formally request closure of the merger application docket filed with them. In
July 1997, the MPUC approved NSP's request to withdraw its merger application.
The MPUC also determined in the third quarter of 1997 that it did not need to
further pursue issues raised during the merger proceedings relating to NSP's
rates, service quality and ratemaking treatment of a contract settlement related
to a prior period.




UTILITY REGULATION AND REVENUES

General

      Retail sales rates, services and other aspects of the Company's operations
are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPUC, the North Dakota Public Service
Commission (NDPSC), and the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (SDPUC)
within their respective states. The MPUC also possesses regulatory authority
over aspects of the Company's financial activities including security issuances,
property transfers within the state of Minnesota when the asset value is in
excess of $100,000, mergers with other utilities, and transactions between the
regulated Company and its affiliates. In addition, the MPUC reviews and approves
the Company's electric resource plans and gas supply plans for meeting
customers' future energy needs. The Wisconsin Company is subject to regulation
of similar scope by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) and the
Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). In addition, each of the state
commissions certifies the need for new generating plants and electric and retail
gas transmission lines of designated capacities to be located within the
respective states before the facilities may be sited and built.

      Wholesale rates for electric energy sold in interstate commerce, wheeling
rates for energy transmission in interstate commerce, the wholesale gas
transportation rates of Viking, the siting and construction of facilities by
Viking and certain other activities of the Company, the Wisconsin Company and
Viking are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC). NSP also is subject to the jurisdiction of other federal,
state and local agencies in many of its activities. (See "Electric Utility
Operations - Nuclear Power Plants - Licensing, Operation and Waste Disposal" and
"Environmental Matters" herein.)

      The Minnesota Environmental Quality Board (MEQB) is empowered to select
and designate sites for new power plants with a capacity of 50 megawatts (Mw) or
more, wind energy conversion plants with a capacity of 5 Mw or more, and routes
for electric transmission lines with a capacity of 200 kilovolts (Kv) or more,
as well as evaluate such sites and routes for environmental compatibility. The
MEQB may designate sites or routes from those proposed by power suppliers or
those developed by the MEQB. No such power plant or transmission line may be
constructed in Minnesota except on a site or route designated by the MEQB.

      NSP is unable to predict the impact on its operating results from the
future regulatory activities of any of the above agencies. NSP strives to
understand and comply with all rules and regulations issued by the various
agencies.

Revenues

      NSP's financial results depend, in part, on its ability to obtain adequate
and timely rate relief from the various regulatory bodies, its ability to
control costs and the success of its non-regulated activities. NSP's 1997
utility operating revenues, excluding intersystem non-firm electric sales to
other utilities of $84 million and miscellaneous revenues of $77 million, were
subject to regulatory jurisdiction as follows:



* Settlement proceeding, based upon revenue levels granted with no specified
return.

** Reflects ROE underlying the August 1996 rate settlement.

Ratemaking Principles in Minnesota and Wisconsin

         Since the MPUC assumed jurisdiction of Minnesota electric and gas rates
in 1975, several significant regulatory precedents have evolved. The MPUC
accepts the use of a forecast test year that corresponds to the period when
rates are put into effect and allows collection of interim rates subject to
refund. The use of a forecast test year and interim rates minimizes regulatory
lag.

         The MPUC must order interim rates within 60 days of a rate case filing.
Minnesota statutes allow interim rates to be set using (1) updated expense and
rate base items similar to those previously allowed, and (2) a return on common
equity equal to that granted in the last MPUC order for the utility. The MPUC
must make a determination on the application within 10 months after filing. If
the final determination does not permit the full amount of the interim rates,
the utility must refund the excess revenue collected, with interest. To the
extent final rates exceed interim rates, the final rates become effective at the
time of the order and retroactive recovery of the difference is not permitted.

         Minnesota law allows Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) in a
utility's rate base. The MPUC has generally included Allowance for Funds Used
During Construction (AFC) in revenue requirements for rate proceedings. However,
cash earnings are allowed on small and short-term projects that do not qualify
for AFC. (For the Company's policy regarding the recording of AFC, see Note 1 of
Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8.)

         The PSCW has a biennial filing requirement for processing rate cases
and monitoring utilities' rates. By June 1 of each odd-numbered year, the
Wisconsin Company must submit filings for calendar test years beginning the
following January 1. The filing procedure and subsequent review generally allow
the PSCW sufficient time to issue an order effective with the start of the test
year. The PSCW deviated from this biennial filing requirement while the proposed
merger of NSP and WEC was pending.

         The PSCW reviews each utility's cash position to determine if a current
return on CWIP will be allowed. The PSCW will allow either a return on CWIP or
capitalization of AFC at the adjusted overall cost of capital. The Wisconsin
Company currently capitalizes AFC on production and transmission CWIP at the
FERC formula rate and on all other CWIP at the adjusted overall cost of capital.

Fuel and Purchased Gas Adjustment Clauses in Effect

         The Company's retail electric rate schedules, and most of the Wisconsin
Company's wholesale rate schedules, provide for adjustments to billings and
revenues for changes in the cost of fuel and purchased energy. Although the lag
in implementing the billing adjustment is approximately 60 days, an estimate of
the adjustment is recorded in unbilled revenue in the month costs are incurred.
The




Company's wholesale electric sales customers do not have a fuel clause provision
in their contracts. In lieu of fuel clause recovery, the contracts instead
provide a fixed rate with an escalation factor. For eight Wisconsin Company
customers on the W-1 wholesale rate, the wholesale electric fuel adjustment
factor is calculated for the current month based on estimated fuel costs for
that month. The estimated fuel cost is adjusted to actual the following month.
The Wisconsin Company's other two wholesale customers have fixed rate contracts
which do not have a fuel adjustment factor.

         In 1995, the MPUC approved a variance of Minnesota fuel adjustment
clause rules to specifically allow for the inclusion of total wind purchase
power costs and biomass related energy costs in the fuel adjustment clause. The
Company must request approval for renewal of this variance on a continuing
basis. The Company is obligated by legislative mandate to purchase 425 Mw of
wind generated energy and 125 Mw of farm-grown closed-loop biomass generated
energy by 2002. (See Note 14 to the Financial Statements under Item 8 for a
discussion of the Company's legislative resource commitments.)

         The Wisconsin Company's automatic retail electric fuel adjustment
clause for Wisconsin customers was eliminated in 1986. The electric fuel
adjustment clause was replaced by a procedure which compares actual monthly and
anticipated annual fuel costs with those costs which were included in the latest
retail electric rates approved by the PSCW. If the comparison results in a
difference outside a range of eight percent for the first month, five percent
for the second month, or two percent for the remainder of the year, the PSCW may
hold hearings limited to fuel costs and revise rates. Any revised rates would be
effective until the next biennial rate case. The adjustment approved is
calculated on an annual basis, but applied prospectively. Effective Jan. 1,
1996, the fuel costs that are monitored include demand costs for sales,
purchased power and transmission wheeling expenses, which had been excluded
prior to that date.

         Gas rate schedules for the Company and the Wisconsin Company include a
purchased gas adjustment (PGA) clause that provides for rate adjustments for
changes in the current unit cost of purchased gas compared to the last costs
included in rates. The factor is calculated for the current month based on the
estimated purchased gas costs for that month.

         By September 1 of each year, the Company is required by Minnesota
statute to submit to the MPUC an annual report of the PGA factors used to bill
each customer class by month for the previous year commencing July 1 and ending
June 30. The report verifies whether the utility is calculating the adjustments
properly and implementing them in a timely manner. In addition, the MPUC reviews
procurement policies, cost-minimizing efforts, rule variances in effect or
requested, retail transportation gas volumes, independent auditors' reports, and
the impact of market forces on gas costs for the coming year. The MPUC has the
authority to disallow certain costs if it finds the utility was not prudent in
its gas procurement activities. On Sept. 11, 1997 the MPUC allowed full recovery
of gas costs in response to the filing for the year ended June 30, 1996. The
MPUC's determination regarding the filing for the year ended June 30, 1997 is
pending. Approval is anticipated in the latter half of 1998.

         In 1996, the PSCW conducted a generic hearing to consider alternative
incentive-based gas cost recovery mechanisms to replace the current PGA. In
November 1996, the PSCW issued an order with general guidelines for
incentive-based gas cost recovery mechanisms as well as "modified one-for-one"
gas cost recovery mechanism. All major gas utilities in Wisconsin were required
to file a proposal to replace their current PGA. In September 1997 the Wisconsin
Company filed its proposal with the PSCW. In the Wisconsin Company's proposal,
allowable gas commodity cost recovery would be based on a benchmark index which
is, in turn, based on the market price of gas. The allowable cost recovery of
the remaining components of the cost of gas (for example, fixed pipeline
transportation costs, supply reservation costs, and other costs approved by the
FERC) would be based on actual costs incurred, as is the case with the Wisconsin
Company's current PGA. The PSCW's decision is expected in June 1998. If the
Wisconsin Company's proposal is approved, the financial impact of the new gas
cost recovery mechanism will be substantially the same as with the current PGA.
Approximately 70 percent of the Wisconsin Company's gas revenues represent
recovery of gas costs through the PGA mechanism.

         The Wisconsin Company's gas and retail electric rate schedules for
Michigan customers include Gas Cost Recovery Factors and Power Supply Cost
Recovery Factors, which are based on 12 month projections. After each 12 month
period, a reconciliation is submitted whereby over-collections are refunded and
any under-collections are collected from the customers. For 1997 the Gas Cost
Recovery Factor was in place; however, the Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR)
factor was waived in 1997 due to the proposed merger with WEC. The PSCR was
reinstated effective in 1998 as discussed under "Rate Matters by Jurisdiction".

         Viking provides interstate gas transportation services only through its
pipelines and does not sell gas. Thus, Viking has no need for a PGA mechanism.
Natural gas fuel for Viking's compressor station operations is provided by
transportation service customers. On Feb. 27, 1998 Viking filed to




increase its fuel retention rates to reflect current compressor operations, to
be effective April 1, 1998.

Resource Adjustment Clauses in Effect

         In 1995, the MPUC approved the implementation of an annual recovery
mechanism for electric and gas conservation and energy management program
expenditures, including annual gas program costs and an amortization of electric
program costs, reimbursement of gas margins and a portion of electric margins
lost due to conservation activity, and returns on capital used to finance
electric conservation programs. This decision allows for accelerated recovery of
conservation and energy management program expenditures which is desirable
because it allows more timely rate recovery of cost changes outside general rate
cases and lessens the risk for future stranded costs resulting from electric
industry restructuring. A surcharge to customer's bills is included as a line
item entitled "resource adjustment". The Company is required to request a new
cost recovery level annually. Current cost recovery levels were approved
effective in July 1997 for electric and September 1996 for gas. The 1997
proposed gas change (filed May 1, 1997) is pending final MPUC action.

         In January 1996, a number of changes to the Company's regulatory
deferral and amortization practices for Minnesota electric conservation program
expenditures were approved. These changes allow the Company to expense rather
than defer and amortize new conservation expenditures beginning in 1996 and to
increase its recovery of electric margins lost due to conservation activity.
These conservation cost recovery changes are intended to avoid a significant
delay between the time when costs are incurred and when they are recovered in
rates. In addition, the Company received approval for 1996 and 1997 conservation
expenditures at levels lower than 1995. In 1997, the Company received approval
to further reduce electric conservation expenditure levels in 1998 and 1999 to 2
percent of Minnesota revenues, the minimum allowed by current Minnesota law.

Rate Matters by Jurisdiction

MINNESOTA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (MPUC)

         On Dec. 2, 1997 the Company filed for a general increase in gas retail
rates in the state of Minnesota. The Company requested an annualized increase of
$18.5 million or 5.5 percent. The Company requested an interim annualized rate
increase of $15.6 million or 4.6 percent effective Feb. 1, 1998. An interim rate
increase totaling $13.9 million on an annual basis has been approved, subject to
refund, effective Feb. 1, 1998. If the final rate level is less than the interim
rate level, the difference will be refunded to customers with interest. The MPUC
has ten months from the date of the filing to reach a decision on the Company's
rate increase request.

         Since 1995, the Company has offered, with MPUC approval, a 50 percent
discount on the first 300 kilowatt-hours (Kwh) consumed each month by qualified
low-income residential customers. These low-income discounts are recovered from
other customers.

         Approximately 33,000 of the Company's customers received assistance,
totaling $7.5 million for the 1996-97 heating season, from federally funded Low
Income Home Energy Assistance Programs (LIHEAP) operated by the State of
Minnesota. Other states served by NSP have similar programs. Qualification for
the Company's Low Income Discount Rate is based on eligibility for LIHEAP. The
federal LIHEAP program is facing some opposition and funding could be lost in
the future. In a January 1998 agreement with the Minnesota Office of the
Attorney General, the Company has agreed to provide up to $2.8 million in
supplemental grants over the next three years to NSP customers receiving aid
from the LIHEAP program.

         Gas utilities in Minnesota are required to file for a change in gas
supply contract levels to meet peak demand, to redistribute demand costs among
classes, or exchange one form of demand for another. The Company filed in
October 1996 to increase its demand entitlements due to projected increases in
firm customer count, to decrease the Minnesota jurisdictional allocation of
total demand entitlements, effective Nov. 1, 1996, and to recover the demand
entitlement costs associated with the increase in transportation and storage
levels in its monthly PGAs. In February 1997, the MPUC approved NSP's 1996-97
entitlement levels. In October 1997, the Company filed for approval of its
1997-98 demand entitlements. This filing is pending MPUC approval.

         In 1995, the MPUC initiated a rulemaking process to amend, repeal, or
replace existing rules governing customer service standards for gas and electric
utilities. The MPUC formed an advisory task force representing interests from
electric and gas utilities, low and fixed-income consumer advocate groups, other
Minnesota State agencies and other various rate payer classes. The ultimate
outcome of the rulemaking process is unknown at this time. The task force
currently is not actively meeting.

         In response to customer requests and concerns, the Company initiated
several changes and clarifications to its tariff options through miscellaneous
filings in 1997. In February 1998, the MPUC approved the Company's "group
billing" proposal, which will allow customers with multiple accounts (e.g.,
municipalities, fast food restaurants, chain stores, etc.) to receive a single
aggregated bill.




In November 1997, the MPUC approved the Company's gas Predictable Commodity
Price Service, which allows eligible customers to elect a gas service option
with a predetermined price for an annual period, rather than traditional pricing
which varies from month to month based on current wholesale gas prices.

         On Oct. 9 1997, the MPUC voted to approve NSP's request for fuel clause
adjustment (FCA) treatment for costs incurred under the gas supply management
agreement between NSP Gas and NSP Generation (two business areas within NSP).
NSP's electric utility will recover approximately $2 million under the FCA, and
NSP Gas will earn approximately $20,000 in margin. The MPUC deferred any
decision on the issue of whether a transaction between business units within the
same utility corporation is an affiliated interest agreement under the 1993
amendments to Minnesota statute 216B.48.

         No electric general rate filing is anticipated in Minnesota in 1998.

NORTH DAKOTA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (NDPSC)

         In its August 1996 order approving the Company's North Dakota base rate
adjustment, the NDPSC also opened an investigation to examine gas cost of
service allocations and rate design criteria for the Company. In May 1997, the
NDPSC voted to close this investigation. The NDPSC did not order any cost
allocation or rate design changes, but encouraged NSP to file new tariffs to
increase the availability of transportation-only services to more classes of
customers.

         No general rate filings are anticipated in North Dakota in 1998.

SOUTH DAKOTA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (SDPUC)

         Coincident with initial natural gas deliveries, NSP filed a request
with the SDPUC on Dec. 16, 1997 for a declaratory order establishing NSP as a
regulated gas utility in South Dakota. Included in the filing is also a request
for approval of initial large volume retail intrastate gas transportation rates.
NSP has not previously provided natural gas service in South Dakota.

         In August 1997, Hutchinson Technologies, Inc. (HTI) chose NSP to
provide gas service, in addition to electric service, to its new 700 employee
facility in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. NSP tapped the Angus C. Anson combustion
turbine gas supply line and constructed a 3.5 mile 4 inch diameter steel
pipeline to the Sioux Empire Development Park 5 and the new HTI facility. NSP
will provide natural gas transportation service. Gas supply arrangements will be
made by the customer. HTI transportation revenues will not be material. However,
the Company will work to expand its South Dakota gas operations in the future.

         No general rate filings are anticipated in South Dakota in 1998.

PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF WISCONSIN (PSCW)

         To facilitate its review of the Wisconsin Company's application to
merge with WEC, in 1995 the PSCW deviated from its normal biennial rate case
filing requirements and directed the Wisconsin Company to file complete electric
and gas rate cases in early 1996 for the test year beginning January 1, 1997.

         On March 15, 1996, the Wisconsin Company filed a full rate case for the
1997 test year on a stand alone basis as requested by the PSCW. The Wisconsin
Company's filing described revenue deficiencies for both electric and gas
utilities. However, no rate increases were requested. Technical hearings for the
Wisconsin Company's electric and gas rate cases were held before the PSCW on
July 8, 1996. On Nov. 26, 1996, the PSCW issued an order approving the Wisconsin
Company's application for no change in rates. However, certain classes of
customers experienced small changes in rates as a result of rate design
revisions requested by the Wisconsin Company. These changes to electric rates
for certain customers classes had an offsetting effect on overall revenues.
There were no significant changes to gas rates. In its order, the PSCW approved
a capital structure composed of 45 percent debt and 55 percent common equity,
and granted an 11.3 percent return on common equity.

         On June 9, 1997 the Wisconsin Company filed for a fuel cost surcharge
to its retail electric rates under the fuel rules provisions of the Wisconsin
Statutes. The surcharge was requested because fuel and purchased power costs had
risen beyond the amount included in the Company's current rates due to unplanned
and extended outages at the Company's nuclear generating stations and higher
than projected costs to transmit electricity purchased from other utilities to
the Wisconsin Company's service territory. Effective Sept. 25, 1997, the PSCW
authorized the Company to charge a fuel cost surcharge of $0.00043 per Kwh to
all Wisconsin retail electric customers, which produced approximately $574,000
of additional electric revenue in 1997. The surcharge represents less than one
percent of current rates and is the first rate increase requested since January
1993. The surcharge will continue in effect on an interim basis until the next
rate order is issued and is subject to refund pending final PSCW review.

         The Wisconsin Company filed retail electric and gas rate cases with the
PSCW on Nov. 14, 1997




for the test year 1998. The Wisconsin Company requested a 4.3 percent increase,
approximately $12.7 million annually, in retail electric rates and a 1.9 percent
or $1.7 million decrease in retail gas rates. The Wisconsin Company has
requested that these changes take effect during the second quarter of 1998. The
electric rate filing includes a request for recovery of network transmission
service costs of which $1.7 million had been deferred at Dec. 31, 1997 as
approved by the PSCW.

MICHIGAN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (MPSC)

         In August 1997, the MPSC approved the Wisconsin Company's application
to reinstate a PSCR factor for Michigan electric customers in 1998. On Sept. 29,
1997, the Wisconsin Company filed its request for a 1998 PSCR factor of $.00172
per Kwh which would produce about $250,000 of additional revenue in 1998.

         There were no changes in the Michigan electric and gas base rates
during 1997. The Wisconsin Company is currently reviewing the need to file for a
change in Michigan rates in 1998.

OPEN ACCESS TRANSMISSION PROCEEDINGS (FERC)

         In April 1996, the FERC issued two final rules, Order Nos. 888 and 889,
which have had a significant impact on wholesale electric markets by giving
competitors the ability to transmit electricity through utilities' transmission
systems. Order No. 888, which was effective on July 9, 1996, granted
nondiscriminatory open access to transmission service to promote wholesale
competition and requires utilities and other transmission users to abide by
comparable terms, conditions and pricing in transmitting power. Order No. 889,
effective Jan. 3, 1997, requires public utilities to implement Standards of
Conduct and use an electronic bulletin board called Open Access Same Time
Information System ("OASIS", formerly known as "Real-Time Information
Networks"). These rules require transmission system operation personnel to
provide the same information about the transmission system to all transmission
customers using the OASIS, and required separation of the wholesale power supply
("merchant") function from the transmission system operation function.

         In 1997, the FERC issued clarifying final orders in response to
rehearing requests by numerous market participants regarding Orders No. 888 and
889. These FERC clarifying final orders are currently being appealed in federal
court. A new proposed rule on Capacity Reservation Open Access Transmission
Tariffs also was issued in April 1996. This proposed rule requested comments on
a new proposed tariff to be in effect no later than Dec. 31, 1997. The FERC has
since postponed this rulemaking indefinitely.

         With regard to compliance with the first phase of FERC Order No. 888,
in July 1996, NSP submitted its transmission tariff compliance filing and an
information filing that unbundled the transmission component of the full
requirements municipal wholesale customers' rates. In October 1996, in response
to the final rule, NSP filed the FERC Order No. 888 proforma tariff using the
rates from the NSP tariff, approved in February 1996. The tariff approved in
February 1996 complies with the transmission pricing policies provisions of open
access requirement of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 which calls for
comparability of service and pricing, network service, an unbundling of
ancillary charges such as scheduling and load following. With regard to the
second phase, in December 1996 NSP submitted its compliance filing which
unbundled the transmission component of its coordination agreements. For
transactions under these agreements, these customers became NSP transmission
service customers. In October 1996, the FERC accepted NSP's information filing.

         NSP also is taking steps to comply with FERC Order No. 889, including
submission of the requisite Standards of Conduct filing in January 1997 and
training employees on these standards in January 1997. In 1997, NSP separated
personnel who perform the merchant function, which includes power and energy
marketing and trading, from personnel who perform the transmission system
operation function. In addition, a significant effort was put forth in 1997 to
enter current and all new requests for transmission service into the electronic
bulletin board. In December 1997, the FERC issued an order clarifying issues
regarding FERC Order No. 889 standards of conduct. On Feb. 12, 1998, the FERC
issued an order requiring modifications to NSP's January 1997 Standards of
Conduct compliance filing, including requirements for additional separation of
functions. NSP submitted revised standards on March 16, 1998. NSP continues to
be generally supportive of the FERC's efforts to increase competition.

ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION TARIFFS (FERC)

         On Feb. 17, 1998, the Company and the Wisconsin Company jointly filed a
Section 205 wholesale transmission rate case with the FERC requesting changes to
its point-to-point Open Access Transmission Tariff (Tariff). The requested
Tariff is based largely on the pro forma tariffs included in the FERC's Order
No. 888. Rates requested are based on a projected test year consisting of 1998
budget data, and included updated rates, proposing an 11 percent increase, for
firm point-to-point transmission service. The request, if approved, would
increase transmission revenues approximately $3 million annually. In addition,
the nonfirm point-to-point maximum rate would decrease by approximately eight
percent under the proposed tariff. Because NSP's present transmission rates are
based on a




1992 historical test year, the major reason for the increase is additional
transmission investment capitalized since 1992. NSP has requested rates to
become effective May 1, 1998, subject to refund. FERC action is pending.

         In addition, the filing includes new rates for the six ancillary
services required by FERC Order No. 888. If approved, these new rates will
result in additional revenues of approximately $1 million annually. The terms
and conditions in the proposed tariff are largely unchanged from the Order 888
proforma tariff. The rate changes will affect transmission service prices to
most wholesale transmission customers, including municipals, cooperatives and
utilities who buy electric supply from NSP. It will also affect the prices
utilities and power marketers pay for using NSP's transmission lines to transmit
power across NSP's system. Such power marketers include: the Company's new
merchant power marketing arm, NSP Energy Marketing, which sells NSP's surplus
energy; and a subsidiary of NRG, which received power marketing approval from
the FERC in 1997.

         On March 2, 1998, the Company and the Wisconsin Company also filed a
separate Section 205 rate change to the Network Integration Transmission Service
(NTS) provisions of NSP's Tariff. NSP requested a May 1, 1998 effective date.
Under the FERC Order No. 888, NSP is required to offer, among other services,
NTS service to qualifying customers, who are neighboring non-jurisdictional
electric utilities (primarily cooperative or municipal utilities) who own
transmission facilities within the NSP electrical control area. Under NTS, NSP
and other qualifying regional utilities share the total annual costs of
operating and maintaining the regional transmission network that NSP uses, net
of related network revenues, based on each company's share of the total network
load. The transmission tariff filed with the FERC is used as the cost basis for
FERC-regulated utilities in determining NTS rates. NSP expects that the new
Tariff changes, if approved, and settlement negotiations will result in lower
NTS costs in 1998. (For more information on NTS, see Management's Discussion and
Analysis under Item 7 herein.)

ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS

Competition

         NSP's electric sales are subject to competition in some areas from
municipally owned systems, rural cooperatives and, in certain respects, other
private utilities and independent power producers. Electric service also
increasingly competes with other forms of energy. The degree of competition may
vary from time to time, depending on relative costs and supplies of other forms
of energy. Although NSP cannot predict the extent to which its future business
may be affected by supply, relative cost or promotion of other electricity or
energy suppliers, NSP believes it will be in a position to compete effectively.

         In October 1992, the President signed into law the Energy Policy Act of
1992 (Energy Act). The Energy Act amends the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, as amended (PUHCA) and the Federal Power Act. Among many other
provisions, the Energy Act is designed to promote competition in the development
of wholesale power generation in the electric utility industry. It exempts a new
class of independent power producers from regulation under the PUHCA. The Energy
Act also allows the FERC to order wholesale "wheeling" by public utilities to
provide utility and non-utility generators access to public utility transmission
facilities. The provision allows the FERC to set prices for wheeling, which will
allow utilities to recover certain costs. The costs would be recovered from the
companies receiving the services, rather than the utilities' retail customers.
The FERC Orders No. 888 and 889 (as discussed in "Utility Regulation and
Revenues", herein) reflect the trend toward increasing transmission access under
the Energy Act.

         As discussed previously, in compliance with FERC Orders No. 888 and
889, NSP has separated personnel who perform the merchant function, which
includes power and energy marketing, from personnel who perform the transmission
system operation function. In 1997, NSP's merchant function, NSP Energy
Marketing, expanded its power trading to focus on new market opportunities
created by open transmission access. NSP Energy Marketing performs power and
energy marketing (both sales and purchases). The sales and revenue provided by
this function includes what NSP is currently classifying as sales for resale,
which includes both municipal power sales and sales to other utilities. Because
of Orders No. 888 and 889, NSP Energy Marketing must pay the same rates as other
utilities for use of NSP's transmission system in connection with its wholesale
power and energy sales.

         NSP's merchant function includes sales to municipal power supply
customers, which was formerly referred to as wholesale sales. The municipal
power supply market has continued to be competitive. Rate discounts and
negotiated rates are being offered to current and potential municipal power
supply customers to allow the municipals to prepare themselves for competition.
NSP has attracted new customers and is retaining customers through this
strategy. In the past several years, these customers have been evaluating a
variety of energy sources to provide their electric supply. NSP's revenues from
sales of electrical power and energy to municipal power supply customers totaled
approximately $23 million in 1997, $29 million in 1996 and $44 million in 1995.
The reduction in revenues is attributed mainly to the nine municipal




power supply customers whose contracts terminated in 1995 and 1996. These nine
customers remain transmission service customers. The Company currently has nine
municipal power supply customers and the Wisconsin Company has ten municipal
supply customers. All ten municipal power supply customers have current power
supply arrangements and are expected to purchase the majority of their power
supply requirements from the Wisconsin Company.

         Even though NSP has contracts with several municipal power supply
customers, because of competition in the sales for resale markets, NSP will need
to continue to be competitive in the entire wholesale market as many parties,
including power marketers, are now able to use its transmission lines to
transport electricity. In 1997, NSP filed 61 transmission service agreements for
FERC approval. In 1996, this number was 58. Currently, 76 customers, including
power marketers (independent brokers who buy and sell wholesale electricity as a
commodity at market prices), and NSP's Energy Marketing area, were registered to
buy transmission service from NSP. NSP still has the first right to use its
transmission system for sales to retail customers. NSP has also reserved the
right to use its transmission system to serve its firm (guaranteed delivery)
municipal power customers. But for non-firm (delivery subject to utility's
discretion to curtail without liability) wholesale transactions, NSP Energy
Marketing must compete with others to use the NSP transmission system. The
process of making a wholesale energy sale is now much more detailed, but the
sale can also now be contingent upon the availability of transmission service.

         NSP is no longer competing with only regional utilities when it buys
and sells excess power to wholesale customers, but is also competing with power
marketers from all over the United States. As more participants join this
market, margins are driven down. NSP is developing its wholesale power marketing
capabilities to compete on a national basis and not risk losing customers and
declining margins. NSP is also developing risk management practices to respond
to the rapidly growing electric commodity market.

         Some states, such as Michigan in which NSP has service territory, have
begun to allow retail customers to choose their electricity suppliers, and many
other states are considering proposals to increase competition in the supply of
electricity. NSP believes competition among suppliers to serve retail customers
will result in more innovative services and lower prices for all consumers if
the transition is managed in a thoughtful manner. NSP supports fair and equal
treatment for all competitors. Of particular importance are the recovery of
utilities' investments made under traditional regulation and resolution of
Minnesota's property tax issues. Currently, NSP pays property taxes in Minnesota
that are two to three times higher than they would be in neighboring states, and
investor-owned utilities also pay taxes that are significantly higher than those
paid by other types of utilities within Minnesota. NSP advocates tax reform to
eliminate the severe interstate and intrastate disparities as a prerequisite to
opening access to retail customers.

         In Minnesota, the MPUC developed and adopted principles for electric
industry restructuring. One of the principles supports the establishment of a
robust competitive wholesale market. As a follow-up to the principles, the MPUC
convened the Electric Competition Workgroup, which included NSP, to examine
possible changes in industry regulation and structure to foster wholesale
competition. In 1996, the MPUC accepted the workgroup's report and expanded its
charter to examine issues related to retail competition. In 1997, the MPUC
accepted the retail competition report and ordered their staff to prepare a plan
to address the issues identified in the report in response to a hypothetical
legislative mandate to open up retail access. To date, the MPUC staff has not
yet submitted the plan to the MPUC.

         Minnesota's Governor and legislative leadership have indicated that
electric utility restructuring will not be a priority in the 1998 session.
Nevertheless, legislative hearings on the issue were held in 1997. At the end of
the hearings, the joint House and Senate subcommittee decided that they needed
more technical information before making a policy recommendation to the full
legislature. Currently, two versions of an electric industry restructuring study
bill have passed the Senate and the House subcommittees and are being reviewed
for consolidation. Both bills would establish a Technical Advisory Work Group
composed of a wide range of stakeholders to examine, over a several month
period, a set of technical issues including reliability, consumer protections
and level playing field issues. Passage of a final version is expected sometime
in April 1998.

         In February 1996, the PSCW issued its report to the state legislature
on restructuring the electric industry. The report was the culmination of over a
year of work by representatives from a wide range of interests, including low
income advocates, environmental groups, regulators and the utilities. NSP played
an active role in the efforts. Key elements of the report include: 1) unbundling
the vertically-integrated utility functions into generation, transmission,
distribution and energy services; 2) improving competition in electric
generation while insuring consumer access to the low costs associated with
existing power plants; 3) preventing the exercise of market power by large
companies; 4) revising Wisconsin's regulatory processes while protecting the
environment; 5) working to transform the transmission system into a common
carrier; 6) developing distribution and retail service




requirements and 7) developing alternative means for funding and providing
social benefits to customers. The report included a 32 step plan to achieve
these elements with the ultimate goal of opening the retail market to
competition by the year 2001. The PSCW began implementing the 32 step plan in
1996. In September 1996, the PSCW issued an order setting minimum standards for
creating an independent system operator (ISO) for the electric transmission
system of NSP. This order was issued as part of a generic electric utility
restructuring process the PSCW started in 1995. As of the end of 1996, parties
had filed plans with the PSCW to unbundle utility functions; completed hearings
on revising the State's Advance Plan and Certificate of Public Convenience and
Necessity processes; developed proposals regarding the funding and delivery of
low income, energy efficiency, renewable resource and environmental research
services; and began to work on initial distribution and retail service
requirements.

         After receiving comments on the restructuring work plan in July 1997,
the PSCW consolidated the 32-step work plan into a 7-step work plan. However,
due to the summer of 1997's electrical reliability concerns in eastern
Wisconsin, the PSCW indicated that industry restructuring efforts be subordinate
to, and compatible with, reliable electric supply. The PSCW maintains that the
development of a strong ISO remains of a primary importance to retail
competition. As a result of the reliability issue in 1997, the PSCW has
indicated it intends to focus on the development of a utility infrastructure
necessary to assure reliable electric service and the removal of barriers to
competition at the wholesale level first. In late 1997, the PSCW stated that
although many parties have concluded that retail competition is a foregone
conclusion, the PSCW never indicated that retail competition was inevitable, nor
that it was in the public interest. At present, a definite timeline has not yet
been established for the implementation of retail competition in Wisconsin.

         In March 1998, the Governor of Wisconsin proposed reliability
legislation that, if enacted, will make dramatic changes in the state's energy
industry and take a number of steps toward industry restructuring. This proposal
will streamline the state's regulatory process and authorize some form of a
merchant plant market. This proposal will also require, prior to June 30, 2000,
transmission system owners to either transfer control of transmission system
assets to an ISO or divest of assets to an independent transmission owning
entity. NSP cannot predict the final contents of any such legislation or
ultimate impact on NSP.

         In North Dakota, the NDPSC, in 1997, adopted the National Association
of Regulatory Utility Commissioners' Principles to Guide the Restructuring of
the Electric Industries, which suggest that industry changes should only occur
when they result in economic efficiency and serve the broader public interest.
Specific principles address protecting network reliability, providing customers
with meaningful choice, sharing benefits and stranded costs between ratepayers
and shareholders, protecting the environment and reaffirming state commission
responsibility for determining restructuring policies. Since that time, the
NDPSC has taken no further action on this issue.

         Also in North Dakota, the 1997 legislative session established a
committee of six legislators charged with studying the impact of competition on
the electric industry. By statute, the committee has a six-year time frame to
study the impact of competition on the generation, transmission and distribution
of electric energy in the state. To date, there has been no legislation drafted
and no consensus on the need to change the current environment.

         On Jan. 14, 1998, the MPSC issued an order regarding electric retail
competition. The MPSC concluded that all customers who want to participate in
open access should have the opportunity to do so and that those customers who do
not participate should not pay higher rates because of open access. The order
directed the large Michigan utilites to make 2.5 percent of their electric load
eligible for open access in each year from 1997 through 2001. All remaining
Michigan electric customers would be given access in 2002. It also stated that
the phase-in schedule applied to all customer classes, a bidding process would
be used to allocate the open access capacity, loads of less than one Mw would be
allowed to participate through an aggregator, and that prudently incurred
stranded costs would be recovered. This order was unsuccessfully challenged by
the affected Michigan utilities, and the courts upheld the MPSC's authority to
implement retail competition.

         In July 1996, NSP executed a long term electric service contract with
one of its largest electric customers, Koch Refining Company. Previously, Koch
had planned to construct a 180 Mw cogeneration plant, leave the NSP retail
system, and sell its excess electricity supply in the wholesale market in
competition with NSP. Under the agreement, Koch will remain an NSP retail
customer, and will participate in NSP's electric supply bidding process before
constructing any new generating plant. The agreement complies with a Minnesota
law enacted in 1996. NSP filed for MPUC approval of the agreement in September
1996. In early 1997, the MPUC ruled the agreement is consistent with the statute
but deferred action on cost recovery until the Company's next electric general
rate case.

         In June 1996, the City Council for the City of St. Paul, Minnesota (the
City), approved new ten year electric and natural gas franchise agreements
between NSP and the City. Under Minnesota law,




utilities are required to obtain franchises from the municipalities where they
serve. In the new agreements, NSP and the City agreed to a "unit charge"
mechanism where the City's franchise fee is collected on the units of energy
(Kw, Kwh or CCF) of electricity or gas delivered by NSP regardless of the
supplier. The new fee structure will generate about the same total fee revenue
for the City each year, but is "supplier neutral" and will not create uneconomic
price incentives for customers to leave the NSP system. To NSP's knowledge, the
new St. Paul franchise agreements are the first in the United States where all
utility franchise fees are collected on a unit of delivery basis.

         NSP has proposed to fill future needs for new generation through
competitive bid solicitations. The use of competitive bidding to select future
generation sources allows the Company to take advantage of the developing
competition in this sector of the industry. The Company's proposal, which has
been approved by the MPUC allows NRG and NSP's own generation business unit to
bid in response to Company solicitations for proposals. The PSCW also allows
this process through the granting of waivers.

         Retail competition represents yet another development of a competitive
electric industry. Management plans to continue its ongoing efforts to be a
low-cost supplier of electricity and an active participant in the more
competitive market for electricity expected in the future. NSP will continue to
work with regulators to complete the tariff and infrastructure that will support
an electric competitive environment. Additional actions the Company is pursuing
to position itself for the competitive environment include: creative partnership
solutions with strategic customers including communities; focusing on the unique
needs of national account customers; competitive pricing alternatives; improved
reliability; implementation of service guarantees; ease of customer access,
including 24 hour, seven days per week operation; metering automation; and
centralization of common services and aggressive cost management. In addition,
NSP will compete for service outside its traditional service area. This process
has begun via NSP's NRG and EMI subsidiaries.

Technological Improvements

         In order to improve customer service, increase productivity, and
respond to the changing needs of both the electric and gas markets, NSP has
made, or is in the process of making, several major technological improvements.
In 1996, the Company implemented a new customer service system that supports
customer information and billing. NSP is also making modifications to its
computer software and other technology to address the year 2000 issues. (See
Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7 herein, for further discussion
of the year 2000 changes.)

         In 1996, the Company implemented a "feeder management system", which is
part of NSP's electric distribution automation effort, that allows NSP to
monitor, control and communicate with and make better decisions about its
electric distribution system. It allows NSP to perform engineering studies
quickly, thus customers out of service can be restored faster. It also assists
NSP in using its capacity and avoid damaging equipment. This system is
interfaced with a new energy management system, which controls NSP's electric
transmission, distribution and generation facilities, and became fully
operational in 1997, improving system performance and customer service. This
system is also assisting NSP to comply with FERC Order Nos. 888 and 889, as
discussed previously, and to compete in the changed environment as a result of
these orders.

         In 1997, NSP also implemented a portion of a new Geographic Information
System (GIS). GIS is a design and automated mapping tool providing a single
system for updating maps of gas and electric facilities. Additions, changes and
deletions are done quickly and efficiently after construction, thereby making
the maps as current as possible. GIS will assist NSP in the design of
construction projects and services. Current and accurate information will be
available on-line. This is critical in NSP's daily operations, not only for the
productivity and safety of its construction crews, but for the improved quality
of service NSP can provide to its customers. NSP expects to complete
implementation in 1998.

         Also in 1997, NSP began installing a wireless automated meter reading
system that will allow the Company to remotely read customer meters in the
Minneapolis - St. Paul metro area every month which will almost eliminate
estimated customer bills. The project, Automated Energy Services (AES), is
designed to improve customer service in the Minneapolis - St. Paul metro area.
More than one million electric and gas meters are expected to be automated by
the year 2000. As part of the AES project, NSP has contracted with an affiliate
of CellNet Data Systems, Inc. (CellNet), a company based in San Carlos,
California, which owns the technology. CellNet will own and operate a
communication network that can provide daily meter readings to NSP for automated
electric and gas meters.

Capability and Demand

         Assuming normal weather, NSP expects its 1998 summer peak demand to be
7,427 Mw. NSP's 1998 summer capability is estimated to be 8,775 Mw, (net of
contract sales) including 903 Mw (including reserves) of contracted purchases
from the Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board, a Canadian Crown




Corporation (Manitoba Hydro) and 724 Mw of other contracted purchases. The
estimate assumes 7,460 Mw of thermal generating capability and 1,315 Mw of
renewable source generating capability. Of the total summer capability, NSP has
committed 186 Mw for sales to other utilities.

         NSP's 1997 maximum demand of 7,353 Mw occurred on July 16, 1997.
Resources available at that time included 7,117 Mw of Company-owned capability
and 1,706 Mw of purchased capability net of contracted sales. Due to the
Mid-Continent Area Power Pool's (MAPP) penalty for reserve margin shortfalls and
to be prepared for weather uncertainty at the lowest overall cost, NSP carried a
reserve margin for 1997 of 19.7 percent. The minimum reserve margin requirement
as determined by the members of the MAPP, of which NSP is a member, is 15
percent. In March 1996, the members of MAPP approved a proposal to convert MAPP
into a Regional Transmission Group (RTG). As a result of this approval, a
restated agreement, "Restated Mid-Continent Area Power Pool Agreement Jan. 12,
1996" was approved by the FERC in Docket No. ER96-1447, effective Nov. 1, 1996.
Converting MAPP to an RTG is consistent with the 1992 Energy Policy Act and FERC
policies. (See Note 14 of Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8 for more
discussion of power agreement commitments.)

         In November 1997, MAPP provided to members drafts of its revised
restated agreement indicating the changes necessary to accommodate an ISO, and a
Transmission System Control Agreement through which transmission owners would
give up operational authority of their Regional Transmission Facilities to the
MAPP ISO. Some of the provisions include governance structure of the ISO, with a
nine-member board of directors, new bylaws and a code of conduct. In addition,
the MAPP Regional Transmission Committee (RTC) would be responsible for
establishing the ISO as a non-profit membership corporation. An advisory group
would be formed under the RTC to provide technical advice, review disputes
between the ISO and members, and to make recommendations to the RTC. A vote by
MAPP members is expected by mid-1998. The proposal would be filed with the FERC
after the vote. NSP is considering alternatives to ISOs including the formation
of an independent transmission company.

         In October 1997, officials from MAPP and the Southwest Power Pool (SPP)
met to coordinate the investigation of a possible consolidation of the two
regions. SPP, based in Little Rock, Arkansas, consists of 72 members that serve
more than 6.6 million customers in all or part of eight southwestern states. The
group identified functional areas to be investigated for possible consolidation:
ISO filing, tariff administration, engineering, information technology,
operations, training, policy and administration. The group has provided a
written report to the regional governing bodies who will vote on the
recommendations in April 1998.

         The Company, in conjunction with the Wisconsin Company and LaCrosse,
Wisconsin - based Dairyland Power Cooperative (DPC), proposes to construct,
operate and maintain 230- and 115- kilovolt (Kv) transmission line and
substations to improve and maintain electric service to northwestern Wisconsin
and eastern Minnesota. There is a need for additional electrical service to
eastern Minnesota and a critical need to construct facilities to prevent
potential future widespread blackouts in northwestern Wisconsin. The 230-Kv line
would run from a substation in eastern Minnesota, cross the St. Croix River and
terminate near Amery, Wisconsin. The 115-Kv line would end near Taylors Falls,
Minnesota. The proposal also includes a 161-Kv line between Hayward and Ashland,
Wisconsin. The project needs review and approval by the MEQB, PSCW and Rural
Utilities Services. The major issue is the location and aesthetics of crossing
the St. Croix River, which is a designated National Scenic Riverway. Assuming
regulatory approvals, the companies expect the project to be in service by 2003.

         The Company is continuing an extensive performance-based transmission
and distribution reliability program. This program includes preventative
maintenance on transmission and distribution power lines, improvements to
existing equipment and implementation of new technology. The Company has
invested more than $350 million in transmission facility upgrades since 1992.
The program focuses on the leading causes of outages consisting of lightning,
trees and underground cable cuts, and also concentrates on reducing the number
of human-error related outages. In 1997, the reliability program resulted in a
17 percent reduction in the total number of non-storm related outages to the
Company's feeders, from 1,696 in 1996 to 1,409 in 1997, a new record low. In
addition, outages to critical customer sites remained steady and maintained the
low average achieved in 1996, allowing the Company to exceed its 1997 year end
goal. Reliability goals for 1998 include emphasis on reliability-focused
maintenance programs, improved restoration processes, and improved customer
communication/access.

         The Company filed its most recent Resource Plan with the MPUC on Jan.
5, 1998, for the period 1998 to 2012. The plan shows how the Company intends to
meet the increased energy needs of its electric customers and includes an
approximate schedule of the timing of resource solicitation to meet such needs.
The plan contains conservation programs to reduce the Company's peak demand and
conserve overall electricity use, an approximate schedule of power purchase
solicitations to meet increasing demand, and programs and plans to maintain the
reliable operation of existing resources.




In summary, the plan:

*        Forecasts slower growth in energy and peak demand requirements. The
         plan forecasts 1.7 percent growth in NSP's energy and peak demand
         requirements, which is down from the 2.9 percent growth NSP experienced
         in 1985 to 1995.

*        Outlines NSP's efforts to continue to help our customers use
         electricity wisely through demand side management and conservation
         programs.

*        Shows a need for 140 Mw of new capacity in 2003. NSP will use a
         competitive bid process to acquire the capacity.

*        Describes the programs for achieving the mandated renewable energy
         sources of 425 Mw of wind and 125 Mw of biomass. NSP's program is the
         largest commitment to renewables in the region. NSP recommends no new
         commitments to renewables.

*        Updates the MPUC on the status of spent nuclear fuel at the Prairie
         Island plant and describes how it can continue to operate until the
         year 2007 with the number of casks that have been authorized.

================================================================================

         The following resource needs were identified in the Resource Plan
         filing:

                        Cumulative Mw Resource Needs By Type vs. Base of 1997

* Renewables include wind generation and biomass generation. The 1994 Minnesota
legislative mandates related to these are discussed in Note 14 to the Financial
Statements under Item 8 and "Electric Utility Operations - Nuclear Power Plants
- - Licensing, Operation and Waste Disposal," herein . The Company considers 265
Mw of the 425 Mw windpower mandate and all 125 Mw of the biomass generation
mandate to be committed capacity. (Including 25 Mw of windpower which was
installed in 1994.) The amounts shown in parentheses are the estimated MAPP
accredited capacity values at the time of system peak demand. The MAPP
accreditation procedure for wind is intended to measure wind generation's
contribution to system reliability at the time of system peak demand. Because
wind generation is a variable resource, the accredited capacity is less than the
installed capacity.

================================================================================

         The resource plan proposed to satisfy the above resource needs through
a combination of the following energy source options:

- -        Continued operation of existing generation facilities.

- -        Demand reduction of an additional 1,080 Mw by 2012 through conservation
         and load management.

- -        425 Mw of wind energy and 125 Mw of biomass energy under contract by
         2002.

- -        Acquisition of competitively priced resources to meet changing needs,
         i.e. competitive bidding.

         The Resource Plan also included an update of the Company's competitive
bid schedule. The Company plans to seek proposals as follows:


Proposal   Resource               Nominal       In-Service

           Flexibility Options

         The resource plan is now subject to public review and comment. The
Company expects that the




MPUC will probably take action in early 1999, to approve or modify the plan.

         Minnesota utilities are required under a 1993 Minnesota law to use
values established by the MPUC, which assign a range of environmental costs for
each method of electricity generation that is not a part of the price of
electricity, when evaluating and selecting generation resource options. These
values are known as environmental externalities. NSP, along with several other
parties, participated in a proceeding initiated by the MPUC to establish such
values. The MPUC issued its order in January 1997. The high end of the range of
externality values ordered by the MPUC add about 0.55 cents per Kwh to a typical
new coal plant and about 0.15 cents per kwh to a natural gas fired plant. The
carbon dioxide value comprises about 60 percent to 80 percent of these amounts.
On Feb. 24, 1998, NSP and several other parties argued their appeal of the MPUC
order before the Minnesota Court of Appeals, which will rule on the appeal
within 90 days.

         NSP continues to implement various Demand Side Management (DSM)
programs designed to improve load factor and reduce NSP's power production cost
and system peak demands, thus reducing or delaying the need for additional
investment in new generation and transmission facilities. NSP currently offers a
broad range of DSM programs to all customer sectors, including information
programs, rebate and financing programs and rate incentive programs. These
programs are designed to respond to customer needs and focus on increasing NSP's
value of service that, over the long term, will help its customer base become
more energy efficient and competitive. During 1997, NSP's programs reduced
system peak demand by approximately 130 Mw. Since 1982, NSP's DSM programs have
reduced system peak demand by approximately 1,284 Mw, which is equivalent to 17
percent of its 1997 summer peak demand. In its 1997 Conservation Improvement
Program Filing with the Minnesota Department of Public Service, the Company
received approval to reduce its DSM expenditures in Minnesota to 2 percent of
Minnesota revenues in 1998 and 1999, the minimum allowed by current Minnesota
law. As recently as 1995, the Company spent approximately 3.5 percent of its
Minnesota revenues on DSM.

         In 1994, the MPUC increased the Company's cost recovery and incentives
for DSM by allowing recovery of a portion of the lost margins due to DSM impacts
on electric revenues and DSM investment returns and performance bonuses. The
performance bonuses are awarded through an incentive program that rewards the
attainment of specified conservation goals. The lost margin recovery, subject to
annual review by the MPUC, was approximately $20 million in 1997, $14 million in
1996, and $7 million in 1995. The DSM investment returns and performance
bonuses, subject to annual review by the MPUC, were $8 million in 1996 and $7
million in 1995. In addition, in April 1998 the Company will file for approval
of approximately $7 million of DSM investment returns and performance bonuses
for 1997.

Energy Sources

         For the year ended Dec. 31, 1997, 47 percent of NSP's Kwh requirements
was obtained from coal generation and 25 percent was obtained from nuclear
generation. Purchased and interchange energy provided 24 percent, including 14
percent from Manitoba Hydro; NSP's hydro and other fuels provided the remaining
4 percent. The fuel resources for NSP's generation based on Kwh were coal (63
percent), nuclear (33 percent), renewable and other fuels (4 percent).

         The following is a summary of NSP's electric power output in millions
of Kwh for the past three years:

                        1997       1996       1995
                        ----       ----       ----
Thermal plants        31,896     32,657     33,802
Hydro plants           1,015      1,194      1,049
Purchased and
interchange           10,660      9,065      9,189
                      ------     ------      -----
    Total             43,571     42,916     44,040
                      ============================

         Many of NSP's power purchases from other utilities are coordinated
through the regional power organization MAPP. NSP is one of 70 members, 21
associate members and 8 regulatory participants in MAPP. The MAPP agreement
provides for the members to coordinate the installation and operation of
generating plants and transmission line facilities. The terms and conditions of
the MAPP agreement and transactions between MAPP members are subject to the
jurisdiction of the FERC.

Fuel Supply and Costs

         Coal and nuclear fuel will continue to dominate NSP's regulated utility
fuel requirements for generating electricity by NSP owned generating capacity.
It is expected that approximately 96 percent of NSP's fuel requirements, on a
Btu basis, will be provided by these two fuels over the next several years,
leaving 4 percent of NSP's annual fuel requirements for generation to be
provided by other fuels (including natural gas, oil, refuse derived fuel, waste
materials, renewable sources and wood). The actual fuel mix for 1997 and the
estimated fuel mix for 1998 and 1999 are as follows:

                       Fuel Use on Btu Basis
                       ---------------------
                               (Est)      (Est)
                     1997      1998       1999
                     -----     -----      ----

Coal                  62.2%    60.4%      59.6%
Nuclear               33.9%    36.0%      36.8%
Other                  3.9%     3.6%       3.6%




         The Company normally maintains between 20 and 40 days of coal inventory
depending on the plant site. The Company has long-term contracts providing for
the delivery of up to 100 percent of its 1998 coal requirements. Coal delivery
may be subject to short-term interruptions or reductions due to transportation
problems, weather and availability of equipment.

         Based on existing coal contracts, the Company expects more than 98
percent of the coal it burns in 1998 will have a sulfur content of less than one
percent. The Company has contracts with two Montana coal suppliers (Westmoreland
Resources and Big Sky Coal Company) and four Wyoming suppliers (Rochelle Coal
Company, Antelope Coal Company, Black Thunder Coal Company and Jacobs Ranch
Mine) for a maximum total of 35 million tons of low-sulfur coal for the next
three years. These arrangements are sufficient to meet approximately 80 percent
of the requirements of existing coal-fired plants after 1998.

         The Company is able to purchase the remaining 20 percent of its coal
requirements in a large active spot market. The Company has options from
suppliers for over 100 million tons of coal with a sulfur content of less than
one percent that could be available for future generating needs. The plants in
the Minneapolis-St. Paul area are about 800 miles from the mines in Montana and
1,000 miles from the mines in Wyoming. Coal delivered by rail provides the
Company with an economical source of fuel.

         The estimated coal requirements of the Company at its major coal-fired
generating plants for the periods indicated and the coal supply for such
requirements are as follows:

================================================================================



*MBTU = Million British Thermal Units

 Notes:

(1)      Contract expiration dates vary between 1998 and 2005 for western coal.
         Spot market purchases of other western coal, and other fuels will
         provide the remaining fuel requirements after 1998. The Company is also
         burning petroleum coke as a source of fuel.

(2)      This percentage represents the average blended sulfur content of the
         combination of fuels typically burned at each plant.

(3)      1.2 lb./MBTU when Unit 2 is operating.

(4)      The SO2 limitation at Riverside Unit 8 is 2.5 lb./MBTU. The limitation
         for Units 6 and 7 is currently 0.9 lb. SO2 /MBTU.

(5)      The SO2 limitation at Units 1 and 2 ranges from 70 percent removal with
         a maximum emission rate of 0.48 lbs SO2/MBTU to 60 percent removal with
         a maximum emission rate of 0.96 lb. SO2/MBTU averaged over 90 days. The
         SO2 limitation at Unit 3 is 70 percent removal of SO2 input and a
         maximum emission rate of 0.60 lb. SO2/MBTU averaged over 30 days. The
         use of lime and/or limestone in the plant's scrubbers may be necessary
         to achieve these limits.

(6)      Annual requirements are expected to range from 11.4 to 12.9 million.

================================================================================

         The Company's current fuel oil inventory is adequate to meet
anticipated 1998 requirements. Additional oil may be provided through spot
purchases from two local refineries and other domestic sources.

         To operate the Company's nuclear generating plants, the Company secures
contracts for uranium concentrates, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment and
fuel fabrication. The contract strategy involves a portfolio of spot purchases
and medium and long-term contracts for uranium, conversion and enrichment.
Current




contracts are flexible and cover between 70 percent and 100 percent of uranium,
conversion and enrichment requirements through the year 1998. These contracts
expire at varying times between 1998 and 2005. The overlapping nature of
contract commitments will allow the Company to maintain 70 percent to 100
percent coverage beyond 1998, if appropriate. The Company expects sufficient
uranium, conversion and enrichment to be available for the total fuel
requirements of its nuclear generating plants. Fuel fabrication is 100 percent
committed through the year 2003 and 30 percent covered through 2010. The Company
expects the unit cost of fuel to produce electricity with these nuclear
facilities will be lower than the comparable cost of fuel to produce electricity
with any other currently available fuel sources for the sustained operation of a
generation facility. The cost of nuclear fuel, including disposal, is recovered
in the customer price of the electricity sold by the Company.

         The Company's average electric fuel costs for the past three years are
shown below:

Nuclear Power Plants - Licensing, Operation and Waste Disposal

         The Company operates two nuclear generating plants: the single unit,
543 Mw Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant (Monticello) and the Prairie Island
Nuclear Generating Plant (Prairie Island) with two units totaling 1,028 Mw. The
Monticello Plant received its 40-year operating license from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) on Sept. 8, 1970, and commenced operation on June
30, 1971. Prairie Island Units 1 and 2 received their 40-year operating licenses
on Aug. 9, 1973, and Oct. 29, 1974, respectively, and commenced operation on
Dec. 16, 1973, and Dec. 21, 1974, respectively.

         In its most recent ratings of Company nuclear facilities, the NRC rated
the overall performance of both the Prairie Island and Monticello Plants as
excellent. On a scale of 1 to 3 (1 being the highest), the plants both rate at
1.25, which is the average of ratings in the areas of plant operations,
maintenance, engineering, and plant support. These ratings of the NRC's
Systematic Assessment of Licensee Performance (SALP) place the plants in the top
quarter of the 18 plants located in the Midwest.

         The Prairie Island and Monticello nuclear plants currently hold the
Institute of Nuclear Power Operations' (INPO) top rating for plant operations
and training. In addition, INPO has awarded both of the plants the INPO
Excellence Award, which is a rigorous peer review process that recognizes plants
with the highest levels of excellence in operational safety and reliability and
which have no significant weaknesses.

         The Company previously operated the Pathfinder Plant near Sioux Falls,
South Dakota as a nuclear plant from 1964 until 1967, after which it was
converted to an oil and gas-fired peaking plant. The nuclear portions were
placed in a safe storage condition in 1971, and the Company began
decommissioning in 1990. Most of the plant's nuclear material, which was
contained in the reactor building and fuel handling building, was removed during
1991. Decommissioning activities cost approximately $13 million and have been
expensed. A few millicuries of residual contamination remain at the operating
plant site.

         Operating nuclear power plants produce gaseous, liquid and solid
radioactive wastes. The discharge and handling of such wastes are controlled by
federal regulation. For commercial nuclear power plants, high-level radioactive
waste includes used nuclear fuel. Low-level radioactive wastes are produced from
other activities at a nuclear plant. They consist principally of demineralizer
resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools and equipment that have become
contaminated through use in the plant.

         A 1980 federal law places responsibility on each state for disposal of
its low-level radioactive waste. The law encourages states to form regional
agreements or compacts to dispose of regionally generated waste. Minnesota is a
member of the Midwest Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact Commission
(Compact). The development costs were to be paid by the generators of low-level
radioactive waste within the Compact. In June 1997, the Compact abandoned
efforts to find a disposal site due to decreased low-level waste generation and
increased costs to build a facility. In November 1997, the Compact approved the
return of funds contributed for development costs to Midwest nuclear utilities.
Currently, the Barnwell facility, located in South Carolina, has been given
authorization by South Carolina to accept low-level radioactive waste and the
Compact has authorized its generators to use the Barnwell facility.




         The federal government has the responsibility to dispose of or
permanently store domestic spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive
wastes. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 requires the Department of Energy
(DOE) to implement a program for nuclear waste management including the siting,
licensing, construction and operation of a repository for domestically produced
spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors and other high-level
radioactive wastes at a permanent storage or disposal facility by 1998. The
Company has contracted with the DOE for the future disposal of spent nuclear
fuel. The DOE is currently charging a disposal fee based on nuclear electric
generation sold. This fee ranges from approximately $10 million to $12 million
per year, which NSP recovers from its electric customers in cost-of-energy rate
adjustments. To date, NSP has paid the DOE $250 million in assessments for
disposal of spent nuclear fuel.

         None of the Company's spent nuclear fuel has been accepted by the DOE
for disposal. Further, the DOE has indicated that a permanent federal facility
will not be ready to accept used nuclear fuel from utilities until approximately
2010. The Company, along with a group of other utilities and state agencies,
initiated a series of lawsuits against the DOE. The primary purpose of the
lawsuits is to insure that the Company and its customers receive timely storage
and disposal of used nuclear fuel in accordance with the terms of the Company's
contract with the DOE. (See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings for further discussion of
this matter.)

         NSP, with regulatory and legislative approval, has been providing
on-site storage at its Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants. In 1979,
the Company began expanding the used nuclear fuel storage facilities at its
Monticello plant by replacement of the racks in the storage pool. Also, in 1987,
the Company completed the shipment of 1,058 used fuel assemblies from the
Monticello plant to a General Electric storage facility in Morris, Illinois. As
a result, the Monticello plant does not expect to run out of storage capacity
prior to the end of its current operating license in 2010.

         The on-site storage pool for spent nuclear fuel at Prairie Island was
filled during refueling in June 1994, so adequate space for a subsequent
refueling was no longer available. In anticipation of this, the Company, in
1989, proposed construction of a temporary on-site dry cask storage facility for
spent nuclear fuel at Prairie Island. The Minnesota Legislature (Legislature)
considered the dry cask storage issue during its 1994 legislative session as
required by a Minnesota Court of Appeals ruling in June 1993.

         In May 1994, the Governor of the State of Minnesota (Governor) signed
into law a bill passed by the Legislature. The law authorizes the Company to
install 17 dry casks at Prairie Island. Based on the assumptions and conditions
in the original Certificate of Need from the MPUC, the Company determined the 17
casks would allow operation until at least 2003 and 2004 for units 1 and 2
respectively. After review of the 1994 Legislation the Company has determined 17
casks will allow facility operation until 2007. The Company executed an
agreement with the Governor concerning the renewable energy and alternative
siting commitments contained in the new law. The law authorized immediately the
installation of the first increment of five casks. The second increment of four
casks were authorized on Oct. 2, 1996 by the MEQB certifying that by Dec. 31,
1996: (i) the Company had applied to the NRC for an alternative site license for
an off-site temporary used nuclear fuel storage facility in Goodhue County (but
not on the Prairie Island nuclear generating plant site), (ii) the Company had
used good faith in pursuing development of the alternative site, and (iii) 100
Mw of wind generation was under contract.

         As part of fulfilling the commitments required to secure the use of
additional casks, in August 1996, the Company filed the application for the
Goodhue County facility. The MEQB terminated an alternative siting process which
was one of the legislative requirements. The Company's certification by the MEQB
for the use of casks six through nine was legally challenged by the Prairie
Island Tribe (Tribe). In July 1997, the Minnesota Supreme Court denied further
review of the Tribe's petition. As a result of the decision, the Company
withdrew it's application to the NRC for the Goodhue County facility.

         In 1996, the Company took steps for its wind and biomass resource
commitments as discussed under the caption "Electric Utility
Operations-Capability and Demand", herein. Other commitments resulting from the
legislation include a low-income discount for electric customers, additional
required conservation improvement expenditures and various study and reporting
requirements to a legislative electric energy task force. In January 1995, the
MPUC approved the Company's low-income discount programs in accordance with the
statute. The Company has implemented programs to meet the other legislative
commitments. (See "Electric Utility Operations - Capability and Demand", herein
and Notes 13 and 14 of Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8 for further
discussion of this matter.)

         The final increment of eight casks are available unless prior to June
1, 1999, the Legislature specifically revokes the authorization for the final
eight casks. As of Jan. 31, 1998, seven storage casks are loaded and stored on
the Prairie Island nuclear generating plant site.

         To address the issue of continued temporary storage of spent nuclear
fuel until the DOE




provides for permanent storage or disposal, the Company is leading a consortium
working with various private parties to establish a private facility for interim
storage of spent nuclear fuel. In June 1997, the Private Fuel Storage Limited
Liability Co. (PFS) filed a license application with the NRC for a national
temporary storage site for spent nuclear fuel. The PFS, a consortium of
utilities including the Company, will undertake the development, licensing,
construction and operation of a storage facility on the Skull Valley Indian
Reservation in Utah. The full NRC review process could take up to three years
and will consist of formal evidentiary hearings and opportunity for public
input. Storage cask certification efforts are continuing with the two vendors on
track to meet the project goals. The interim used fuel storage facility could be
operational and able to accept the first shipment of spent nuclear fuel by
mid-2002. However, due to uncertainty regarding pending regulatory and
governmental approvals, it is possible that this interim storage may be delayed
or not available at all.

         On Jan. 23, 1997, the NRC issued Prairie Island a Severity Level III
violation and a $50,000 civil penalty stemming from design issues with the
Cooling Water Emergency Intake Line. The Cooling Water Emergency Intake Line is
the dedicated safety-related water source for the Cooling Water Pumps in the
event of a seismic occurrence rendering the normal intake bay inoperable. The
NRC determined that a violation of the safety evaluation process occurred
because an unreviewed safety question existed, due to these changed assumptions
on the non-seismic canal and operator action. The NRC contends NSP's response to
this regulatory issue was not promptly and adequately addressed.

         In January 1997 the NRC issued a notice of an apparent violation for
the Company's Monticello plant. The notice regarded whether the Monticello plant
should have submitted to the NRC issues about safety questions when it approved
a reduction in the number of safety-related pumps used for containment cooling.
On March 5, 1997, the Company presented to the NRC the facts and history of the
case, and further discussions centered on corrective actions. At this time the
Company does not know the outcome of this apparent violation and whether a civil
penalty will be incurred.

         On Oct. 16, 1997 the NRC assessed Prairie Island a Severity Level III
violation and $50,000 civil penalty for pump testing violations and untimely
updating of licensing documents. The NRC determined the criteria for measuring
the flow of auxiliary feedwater pumps did not accurately reflect the design
requirements for the pumps. The pumps are the backup system to provide cooling
water to the plant's steam generators. Prairie Island used a standard criterion
of ten percent below design flow to evaluate test results wherein the NRC
determined three percent was a more accurate criterion. Past test results stated
none of the pumps exceeded the three percent criterion and would have provided
the necessary waterflow if needed. The testing procedures were corrected during
the inspection.

         The Company filed its triennial nuclear decommissioning study in 1996,
and the MPUC approved it in April 1997. The filing requested continuance of the
accruals, funding and other parameters approved in the last decommissioning
study filed in 1993.

         Although the Company expects to operate the Prairie Island plant units
through the end of their useful lives, the approved capital recovery would allow
for the plant to be fully depreciated, including the accrual and recovery of
decommissioning costs by 2008, about six years earlier than the end of its
licensed life. The approved cost recovery period has been reduced because of the
uncertainty regarding spent fuel storage.

         During the past several years, the NRC has issued a number of
regulations, bulletins and orders that require analyses, modification and
additional equipment at commercial nuclear power plants. The Company has spent
approximately $530 million since 1971, including approximately $5 million in
1997 and approximately $1 million in 1996 and 1995 under such requirements. The
NRC is engaged in various ongoing studies and rulemaking activities that may
impose additional requirements upon commercial nuclear power plants. Management
is unable to predict any new requirements or their impact on the Company's
facilities and operations.

         See Note 13 to the Financial Statements under Item 8 for further
discussion of nuclear fuel disposal issues and information on decommissioning of
the Company's nuclear facilities. Also, see Note 14 to the Financial Statements
under Item 8 for a discussion of the Company's nuclear insurance and potential
liabilities under the Price-Anderson liability provisions of the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954.




Electric Operating Statistics

         The following table summarizes the revenues, sales and customers from
NSP's electric transmission and distribution business:



* Beginning in 1995, the commercial and industrial customer class was segmented
into small (less than 100 kw in demand per year), medium (100 kw up to 1,000 kw)
and large (1,000 kw or more). The estimated medium group was reported as large
prior to 1995.

** Customers accounts for 1996 and 1997 may not be fully comparable to prior
years due to differences in meter accumulation in a new billing system
implemented in 1996.




GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS

Competition/Regulation

         NSP provides retail gas service in the eastern portions of the Twin
Cities metropolitan area, portions of eastern North Dakota and northwestern
Minnesota, and other regional centers in Minnesota (Faribault, St. Cloud and
Winona) and Wisconsin (Eau Claire, LaCrosse and Ashland). As discussed in the
"Rate Matters by Jurisdiction" section herein, NSP has requested a declaratory
order from the SDPUC establishing the Company as a regulated gas utility in
South Dakota. NSP is directly connected to four interstate natural gas pipelines
serving these regions: Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern), Viking,
Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company (Williston) and Great Lakes
Transmission Limited Partnership (Great Lakes). Approximately 84 percent of
NSP's retail gas customers are served from the Northern pipeline system.

         During 1992 and 1993, the FERC issued a series of orders (together
called Order No. 636) that addressed interstate natural gas pipeline
restructuring. This restructuring required all interstate pipelines, including
those serving NSP, to "unbundle" each of the services they provide: sales,
transportation, storage and ancillary services. The implementation of Order No.
636 applies additional competitive pressure on all local distribution companies
(LDCs) including NSP, to keep gas supply and transmission prices for their large
customers competitive because of the alternatives now available to these
customers. Like gas LDCs, these customers now have expanded ability to buy gas
directly from suppliers and arrange pipeline and LDC transportation service. NSP
has provided unbundled transportation service since 1987. Transportation service
does not currently have an adverse effect on earnings because NSP's sales and
transportation rates have been designed to make NSP economically indifferent to
sales or transportation of gas. However, some transportation customers may have
greater opportunities or incentives to physically bypass the LDC distribution
system. NSP has arranged its gas supply and transportation portfolio in
anticipation that it may be required to terminate its retail merchant sales
function. Overall, NSP believes Order 636 has enhanced its ability to remain
competitive and allowed it to increase certain of its margins by providing an
increased selection of services to its customers.

         Order No. 636 allows interstate pipelines to negotiate with customers
to recover up to 100 percent of prudently incurred "transition costs" (also
known as stranded costs) attributable to Order 636 restructuring. In February
1997, the FERC upheld this decision after appeals of Order No. 636 were remanded
by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In
addition, the FERC ruled existing shippers need only agree to a five-year
contract extension to obtain a right of first refusal on continued access to the
shipper's expiring capacity; the original rule was a 20-year commitment.

         NSP's primary gas supplier, Northern, is in the process of determining
the final amount of transition costs to be passed on to customers as a result of
Order No. 636 restructuring. Northern's total Order No. 636 transition costs, to
be passed on to all of its customers, are estimated to be approximately $100
million. Northern will recover the prudent transition costs by amortizing the
amount over a period of several years, and including the amortized costs as a
component of its FERC regulated transportation charges. NSP estimates that it
will be responsible for approximately $13 million of Northern's transition
costs, spread over a period of approximately six years, which began Nov. 1,
1993. To date, NSP's regulatory commissions have approved recovery of
restructuring charges in retail gas rates. NSP has no significant Order No. 636
transition cost responsibilities to its other pipeline suppliers.

         In response to the additional competitive pressures as a result of
Order No. 636, the Company has aggressively pursued alternative pricing
strategies and service enhancements to provide additional value to customers.

         In 1996, NSP's retail gas utility operations were faced with the threat
of physical bypass by large industrial customers. Previously, NSP had used its
flexible gas rate discounting authority to compete to retain these customers.
However, reductions in natural gas pipeline construction costs (which benefit
NSP when it constructs its own facilities) made it economical for some customers
to consider bypassing NSP. In response, NSP filed a new Negotiated
Transportation Service Tariff with the MPUC. The MPUC voted to approve the
tariff on March 6, 1997. The new tariff provides additional flexibility in gas
rates discounting for potential bypass customers.

         On June 19, 1997, the Company filed a proposal for a Predictable
Commodity Price Service (PCPS) Rider which would allow firm gas commercial and
industrial customers a choice to purchase firm "fixed price" gas supplies rather
than gas supplies whose price changes monthly through the PGA clause. The PCPS
will be offered as a two-year pilot program to determine the extent of interest
in the Minnesota service territory. The MPUC approved the rider in October 1997,
and the program commenced in January 1998.

         In September 1996, NSP filed for FERC approval to "abandon" FERC's
jurisdiction over two liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants which the




Company and the Wisconsin Company operate near St. Paul, Minnesota, and Eau
Claire, Wisconsin, respectively. FERC asserted jurisdiction over the plants in
the late 1970s, and NSP has provided FERC regulated LNG services from the two
plants since that time. Under the NSP filings, the plants would remain in
service but FERC would terminate its jurisdiction under Section 7 (c) of the
Natural Gas Act, and the plants would be subject only to MPUC and PSCW
jurisdiction, respectively. The filings were initially required to complete the
canceled Primergy merger, but NSP requested the filings be approved irrespective
of the merger. In October 1997, the FERC granted Part 157 abandonment.

Business Growth

         NSP's gas utility extended service to approximately 14,000 new
customers during 1997. In addition to exploring new growth opportunities, NSP is
also focusing on conversion of potential customers who are located near NSP's
gas mains but are not hooked up to receive the service. NSP estimates there are
approximately 20,000 potential customers in this category.

         In 1997, the Wisconsin Company signed a 10-year contract with the U.S.
Army to build, own, and operate a natural gas system at Fort McCoy, a regional
U.S. Army training center near Sparta, Wisconsin. At the end of January 1998,
$820,000 of the approximately $2.0 million total cost of the project had been
spent. On Feb. 2, 1998, the Wisconsin Company began providing gas to 169
buildings that were already served by the Fort's existing natural gas
distribution system, and by July 1998 an additional 746 buildings should be
added as the Fort's propane equipment is converted to use natural gas. The
contract should produce about $1.7 million of additional revenue each year. The
Wisconsin Company has received orders from the PSCW allowing the Wisconsin
Company to treat the investment as utility property and to include the cost of
gas purchased for the project in the PGA. The project is expected to be complete
in July 1998. NSP has constructed a new town border station adjacent to Fort
McCoy off the Northern Natural pipeline, removed eight miles of old steel gas
piping, and installed 14 miles of new gas distribution main. Prior to the
Wisconsin Company's contract, some of Fort McCoy's 1,000 buildings were served
by liquid propane; others received natural gas supplied by Wisconsin Gas Co.
through a fort-owned distribution system. NSP is the electric supplier to the
fort-owned electric distribution system.

         In 1997, the NDPSC approved two NSP applications for certificates of
public convenience and necessity to extend gas service to Horace, North Dakota,
and three additional small cities outside Fargo. As a result, gas service will
be made available to about 350 customers in areas not previously served with
natural gas.

         In late 1997, the Wisconsin Company signed a purchase agreement to
acquire Natural Gas Inc. (NGI) of New Richmond, Wisconsin. The companies have
filed an application with the PSCW and expect to receive approval for the
transaction in the spring of 1998. New Richmond is located in St. Croix County
the fastest growing county in Wisconsin in 1996 with a 15 percent growth rate.
NGI, a privately owned natural gas utility, founded in 1962, serves 1,900
natural gas customers in New Richmond and has revenues of approximately $2.3
million. The transaction will be structured as a tax-free reorganization for
income tax purposes and a pooling of interests for accounting purposes.

         On Dec. 31, 1997, the Company announced an agreement and plan of merger
with Black Mountain Gas Company of Cave Creek, Arizona (Black Mountain). The
agreement is dependent upon regulatory approval and Black Mountain shareholder
approval. Black Mountain Gas Co. is a natural gas and propane distribution
company with natural gas operations in Cave Creek, Carefree, North Phoenix and
North Scottsdale, and propane operations in the city of Page, Arizona. Black
Mountain currently serves 6,500 customers and had 1997 annual revenues of
approximately $6 million. The transaction will be structured as a tax-free
reorganization for income tax purposes and a pooling of interests for accounting
purposes.

         The Company's gas operation maintains a non-utility service which sells
service contracts on a variety of home appliances. Working in partnership with
local independent service contractors, NSP Advantage Service offers 24 hour
appliance repair service. This service is offered to individuals within the
Company's service territory.

Business Standards

         In July 1996, FERC adopted new rules (in its Order No. 587) which adopt
by reference 140 standard natural gas business practices approved by the Gas
Industry Standards Board ("GISB"). GISB is the independent standards
organization of the natural gas industry. The new rules and standards apply to
interstate gas pipelines like Viking, and are intended to simplify
transportation of natural gas across the interstate gas pipeline "grid".
However, NSP's retail natural gas operations must change their information
systems and operations to comply with the pipeline changes. The new FERC rules
went into effect in the second quarter of 1997. NSP and Viking estimate their
total compliance cost will be approximately $1 million. NSP invested
approximately $0.6 million through Dec. 31, 1997 to make its systems compatible
with the new pipeline systems. Viking will seek rate recovery of the rule
compliance costs in future rate proceedings.




Standards of Conduct/Restructuring

         In January 1997, the PSCW adopted "Standards of Conduct" for gas local
distribution companies (LDCs) serving Wisconsin consumers. The standards are
similar to, but much more extensive than, the standards of conduct FERC has
imposed on Viking under FERC Order No. 497 and on NSP's wholesale electric
transmission functions under FERC Order No. 889. The PSCW standards require
separation of the LDC delivery function from any affiliate which engages in "gas
functions" and impose extensive reporting and other administrative requirements.
The Wisconsin Company filed its compliance plan in February 1997. In
restructuring the natural gas industry, the PSCW reviewed four proposed models.
The chosen model included deregulation of the gas purchasing and transportation
functions by market segment as competition becomes effective and sustainable.
The PSCW then separated restructuring into three phases. In Phase I, the PSCW
found it necessary to completely separate the gas purchasing activities
associated with providing regulated services from those associated with
providing unregulated services and to develop standards of conduct to apply to
opportunity gas sales and utilities' relationships with their affiliates. The
focus of Phase II was to develop Standards of Conduct (SOC) intended to ensure
that interested market participants have the opportunity to purchase released
pipeline capacity and gas supply, and that the releasing utility receives the
best price for the sale. In situations in which a gas utility has a gas
marketing affiliate, additional restrictions between the utility and its
affiliate are necessary to ensure fair treatment of all market participants and
to prevent cross-subsidization. Phase III focused on three main issues: (1)
identifying regulatory or structural barriers that may prohibit competition; (2)
identifying standards to determine the level of competitiveness of the market
and the level of necessary regulations and; (3) identifying conditions to impose
on marketers serving formerly regulated markets. In this phase, the PSCW decided
that gas marketers should be registered and that consumer protection and
customer service policy issues must be addressed before any markets are
deregulated. The PSCW then ordered the formation of six work groups to address
the following: Capacity Policy, Market Registration/Certification, Legislation,
End-Use Price Reporting, Market-Based Pricing for Large Volume Customers, and
Consumer Protection and Essential Services. These groups will continue to meet
over the coming years to address the various issues.

         On Aug. 29, 1997, Enron Capital & Trade et al. filed a petition for a
rulemaking with the MPUC which would have required all Minnesota gas LDCs to (i)
file unbundling plans to be implemented in early 1998, and (ii) terminate their
regulated merchant sales function by 2002. On Oct. 16, 1997 the MPUC voted to
dismiss the Enron petition and reconvene its LDC unbundling work group. The MPUC
ordered the work group to submit an LDC unbundling decision matrix to the MPUC
by June 1, 1998. The Company is participating in the work group process.

         The MPUC also solicited comments from gas utilities on questions
concerning Affiliated Interest Contract Issues and has established a Chair's
Round Table to address these concerns. The Round Table is engaged in ongoing
discussions.

         The SDPUC and NDPSC also initiated dockets in 1996 to examine whether
to adopt standards of conduct for natural gas LDCs serving the two states. The
rulemaking in Wisconsin, South Dakota and North Dakota could create precedent
for future rules affecting NSP's retail electric operations in those states.

Capability and Demand

         NSP categorizes its gas supply requirements as firm (primarily for
space heating customers) or interruptible (commercial/industrial customers with
an alternate energy supply). NSP's maximum daily sendout (firm and
interruptible) of 662,025 MMBtu for 1997 occurred on Jan. 27, 1997.

         NSP's gas supply sources are purchases of third-party gas which are
delivered under gas transportation service agreements with interstate pipelines.
These agreements provide for firm deliverable pipeline capacity of approximately
594,003 MMBtu/day. In addition, NSP has contracted with six providers of
underground natural gas storage services to meet the heating season and peak day
requirements of NSP gas customers. Using storage reduces the need for firm
pipeline capacity. These storage agreements provide NSP storage for
approximately 20 percent of annual and 30 percent of peak daily firm
requirements. NSP also owns and operates two LNG plants with a storage capacity
of 2.53 Bcf equivalent and four propane-air plants with a storage capacity of
1.42 Bcf equivalent to help meet the peak requirements of its firm residential,
commercial and industrial customers. These peak shaving facilities have
production capacity equivalent to 245,420 Mcf of natural gas per day, or
approximately 33 percent of peak day firm requirements. NSP's LNG and
propane-air plants provide a cost-effective alternative to annual fixed pipeline
transportation charges to meet the "needle peaks" caused by firm space heating
demand on extremely cold winter days and can be used to minimize daily imbalance
fees on interstate pipelines.

         A number of NSP's interruptible industrial customers purchase their
natural gas requirements directly from producers or brokers for transportation
and delivery through NSP's distribution system. Transportation rates have been
designed to make NSP economically indifferent as to whether NSP sells and
transports gas, or only transports gas.




Gas Supply and Costs

         As a result of FERC Order No. 636 restructuring, NSP's natural gas
supply commitments have been unbundled from its gas transportation and storage
commitments. NSP's gas utility actively seeks gas supply, transportation and
storage alternatives to yield a diversified portfolio that provides increased
flexibility, decreased interruption and financial risk, and economical rates.
This diversification involves numerous domestic and Canadian supply sources,
varied contract lengths, and transportation contracts with seven natural gas
pipelines. NSP has firm gas transportation contracts with the following seven
pipelines. The contracts expire in various years from 1998 through 2013:

Northern          Northern Border Pipeline Company
Williston Basin   ANR Pipeline Company
Viking            TransCanada Gas Pipeline Ltd.
Great Lakes

         The agreements with Great Lakes, Northern Border, ANR and TransCanada
provide for firm transportation service upstream of Northern and Viking,
allowing competition among suppliers at supply pooling points, and minimizing
commodity gas costs.

         In addition to these fixed transportation charge obligations, NSP has
entered into firm gas supply agreements that provide for the payment of monthly
or annual reservation charges irrespective of the volume of gas purchased. The
total annual obligation is approximately $14.5 million. These agreements are
beneficial because they allow NSP to purchase the gas commodity at a high load
factor at rates below the prevailing market price reducing the total cost per
Mcf.

         NSP has certain gas supply and transportation agreements, which include
obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of gas, or to
make payments in lieu thereof. At Dec. 31, 1997, NSP was committed to
approximately $290.7 million in such obligations under these contracts, over the
remaining contract terms, which range from the years 1998-2013. These
obligations include some of the effects of contract revisions made to comply
with Order No. 636. NSP has negotiated "market out" clauses in its new supply
agreements, which reduce NSP's purchase obligations if NSP no longer provides
merchant gas service.

         NSP purchases firm gas supply from a total of approximately 25 domestic
and Canadian suppliers under contracts with durations of one year to 10 years.
NSP purchases no more than 20 percent of its total daily supply from any single
supplier. This diversity of suppliers and contract lengths allows NSP to
maintain competition from suppliers and minimize supply costs. NSP's objective
is to be able to terminate its retail merchant sales function, if either
demanded by the marketplace or mandated by regulatory agencies, with no
financial cost to NSP.

         The cost of gas supply, transportation service and storage service is
recovered through the PGA cost recovery adjustment mechanism discussed
previously under "Utility Regulation and Revenues". The average cost of gas and
propane held in inventory for the latest test year is allowed in rate base by
the MPUC and the PSCW.

         In July 1997, NSP and thirteen other parties appealed a July 1995 FERC
order regarding rate treatment of two Great Lakes expansion projects. In the
early 1990's, Great Lakes completed two expansion projects which did not improve
service to the Company but which quadrupled its "rate base", which is a factor
in calculating the rates the Company pays Great Lakes for transporting gas. The
FERC's July 1995 order allowed Great Lakes to increase all rates to recover the
cost of these expansion projects which increased the Company's transport costs
on Great Lakes' system by 61 percent annually. Great Lakes was also allowed to
surcharge for services received since November 1991. The Company and other
parties to the appeal requested the cost of the expansion projects be recovered
only from customers who benefit from them. In January 1998, the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals ruled the July 1995 FERC order was lawful. The
additional transportation costs have been recovered through the Purchased Gas
Adjustment clause to the Company's rates, so there was no impact on the
Company's earnings.

         In September 1997, the FERC ruled that Kansas natural gas producers
must refund Kansas ad valorem tax collected improperly collected from 1983 to
1988 plus interest. During this period, Northern had bought gas from Kansas
producers and resold it to NSP. In December 1997, Northern received one $30
million refund and, in turn, refunded $4.2 million to NSP. However, the Kansas
producers are appealing the FERC order and are also pursuing federal legislation
to overturn the FERC order. In February 1998, the FERC ruled that the Kansas
producers could place disputed refunds in escrow and pipelines such as Northern
could recollect refunded amounts if final refunds are less than those already
paid. The Company and the Wisconsin Company are requesting rule waivers from
their respective regulatory agencies to retain any refunds received from
Northern pending resolution of the litigation and legislation.

         Purchases of gas supply or services by the Company from the Wisconsin
Company, its Viking pipeline affiliate and its EMI gas marketing affiliate are
subject to approval by the MPUC. The MPUC has approved all the Company's
transportation contracts with Viking and a 1994 spot gas purchase agreement with
EMI. In January 1998, NSP sought MPUC approval of a new agreement with EMI which
would




allow both purchases from and sales to EMI. This agreement is pending MPUC
approval.

         The following table summarizes the average cost per MMBtu of gas
purchased for resale by NSP's regulated retail gas distribution business, which
excludes Viking and EMI:

1997              $3.33         $3.22

Viking Gas Transmission Company (Viking)

         In June 1993, the Company acquired 100 percent of the stock of Viking
Gas Transmission Company (Viking) from Tenneco Gas, a unit of Tenneco Inc., in
Houston, Texas. Viking, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
owns and operates a 500 mile interstate natural gas pipeline serving portions of
Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota with a capacity of approximately 480
million cubic feet per day. The Viking pipeline currently serves 10 percent of
NSP's gas distribution system needs. Viking currently operates exclusively as a
transporter of natural gas for third-party shippers under authority granted by
the FERC. Rates for Viking's transportation services are regulated by FERC. In
addition to revenue derived from FERC-approved rates, which are reported in
NSP's consolidated Operating Revenues, Viking is receiving intercompany revenues
from the Company and the Wisconsin Company for jurisdictional allocations of the
acquisition adjustment paid by NSP (in excess of Tenneco's pipeline carrying
value) to acquire Viking. The Company is not currently recovering this cost in
retail gas rates in Minnesota, but is recovering this cost in North Dakota. The
Company has requested recovery of this cost in its 1998 Minnesota gas rate case.
The Wisconsin Company is recovering this cost in its retail gas rates.

         As a natural gas pipeline, Viking is subject to FERC standards of
conduct in its transactions with the Company, the Wisconsin Company and EMI,
pursuant to FERC Order No. 497. Viking must transact with EMI on a
non-discriminatory basis, and certain restrictions are imposed on the retail gas
operations of the Company and the Wisconsin Company. The Order No. 497
restrictions on Viking are similar to the Order No. 889 restrictions on NSP's
wholesale electric transmission operations.

         In November 1997, Viking placed a major expansion project in service.
The project expanded Viking's mainline capacity by 61,000 MMBtu/day (about 14
percent). The project will cost approximately $26 million. Viking expects to
recover the project costs through additional long term transportation service
revenues.

         In October 1996, Viking placed two expansion projects in service. The
projects expanded Viking's mainline capacity by 19,400 MMBtu/day (about 5
percent), the first major Viking expansion since the 1960's, and constructed a
second pipeline lateral to increase capacity to serve NSP's growing retail gas
operations in the Grand Forks area. The two projects, which were not related but
constructed at the same time, cost approximately $8 million. Viking expects to
recover the project costs through additional long term transportation service
revenues.

         On June 3, 1997, Viking, in partnership with TransCanada PipeLines,
Ltd. (TransCanada), formed Viking Voyageur Gas Transmission Company LLC
(Voyageur). In December 1997, NICOR, Inc. (NICOR) joined Voyageur so that it is
40 percent owned by Viking, 40 percent by TransCanada, and 20 percent by NICOR.
The parties are continuing negotiations toward a definitive agreement regarding
the contribution and possible merger of Viking into Voyageur as part of the
transaction, subject to certain conditions.

         On October 31, 1997, Voyageur filed with the FERC for a certificate of
public convenience and necessity (CPCN) to install a new 773 mile, 42 inch
diameter pipeline parallel to the existing Viking pipeline and extending into
the Chicago area. If constructed, the new pipeline could transport approximately
1.45 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in Minnesota,
Wisconsin, North Dakota and Illinois. The anticipated project cost is
approximately $1.24 billion (U.S. currency), and the new pipeline would be
placed in service in late 1999 or 2000. The project would be constructed only if
sufficient market demand exists, and would be subject to extensive
pre-construction regulatory and environmental reviews by the FERC and other
appropriate government agencies. If the project proceeds, the Voyageur partners
would jointly own and operate the expanded pipeline entity.

         The Voyageur project is currently undergoing extensive regulatory
reviews with respect to need, cost and environmental matters. As of Dec. 31,
1997, NSP has incurred $5.8 million related to negotiating the Voyageur
agreements and its share of the CPCN application preparation costs, including
various engineering and environmental studies, legal and other costs. Of this
amount, $0.3 million was expensed by Viking, and $5.5 million was deferred for
recovery in Voyageur's regulated gas transportation rates. The Company expects
to spend approximately $6 million in 1998 in additional project planning,
engineering, environmental, legal and other matters, to be recorded for deferred
recovery in Voyageur rates.




         Although many parties have intervened in support of the Voyageur
project, the CPCN application has also been protested by various parties,
including competing interstate pipelines. In addition, another pipeline project
to deliver western Canadian gas to near Chicago (the Alliance project) is also
pending FERC review. Thus there is some risk the Voyageur project may not be
constructed. If the Voyageur project is ultimately not constructed for any
reason, the Company would be required to expense the deferred project-related
costs in the year of project cancellation.

NONREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES

NRG Energy, Inc.

         NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) is the Company's subsidiary that develops,
builds, acquires, owns and operates several non-regulated energy-related
businesses. It was incorporated in Delaware on May 29, 1992, and assumed
ownership of the assets of NRG Group, Inc., including its subsidiary companies.
In 1997 NRG filed a S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The following summary describes NRG's most significant projects.
Additional information is included in Item 1 of NRG's 1997 Form 10-K which is
incorporated herein by reference via Exhibit 99.03. NRG businesses generated
1997 operating revenues of $92 million and equity income of $26 million, and had
assets of $1.2 billion at Dec. 31, 1997.

         NRG intends to continue to grow through combination of acquisitions and
greenfield development of power generation and thermal energy production and
transmission facilities and related assets in the United States and abroad. In
the United States, NRG's near-term focus will be primarily on the acquisition of
existing power generation capacity and thermal energy production and
transmission facilities, particularly in situations in which its expertise can
be applied to improve the operating and financial performance of the facilities.
In the international market, NRG will continue to pursue development and
acquisition opportunities in those countries in which it believes the legal,
political and economic environment is conducive to foreign investment.

         NRG conducts business domestically and internationally through various
subsidiaries, including: NRG International, Inc.; NEO Corporation; NRG Energy
Center, Inc; NRG Operating Services, Inc.; and other businesses and affiliates,
the more significant of which are discussed below.

OPERATING BUSINESSES - EQUITY INVESTMENTS

         In May 1997, NRG as part of a consortium with CMS Energy Corporation
(CMS) and Horizon Energy Australia Investments, acquired the Australian State of
Victoria's Loy Yang A power plant (Loy Yang), Victoria's largest and Australia's
lowest-cost electric generating facility. Loy Yang is a 2,000 Mw, brown
coal-fired power station. The acquisition included an adjacent coal mine. NRG
holds a 25.37 percent ownership interest in the consortium. Loy Yang is one of
the newest and most modern of Victoria's brown coal-fired generating plants,
with a portion of its electric output committed under power supply contracts
through the year 2000. The coal mine has two billion tons of proven coal
reserves, enough to serve the coal supply needs for 50 years of the Loy Yang
plant acquired by the consortium and the Loy Yang B plant not included in the
acquisition. The mine has a supply contract with the 1,000 Mw Loy Yang B
electric generating plant and the exclusive rights to provide coal supplies for
a third Loy Yang generating plant, should it be built. Loy Yang is jointly
managed and operated by CMS and NRG.

         In 1994, NRG, through wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, acquired a
37.5 percent interest in the Gladstone Power Station, a 1,680 Mw coal-fired
plant in Gladstone, Queensland, Australia from the Queensland Electricity
Commission. Other members of the unincorporated joint venture, including Comalco
Limited of Australia (Comalco), acquired the remaining interest. A large portion
of the electricity generated by the station is sold to Comalco for use in its
aluminum smelter, pursuant to long-term power purchase agreements. NRG, through
an Australian subsidiary, operates the Gladstone plant.

         In 1993, NRG, through a wholly owned foreign subsidiary, acquired a 50
percent interest in a German corporation, Saale Energie GmbH (Saale). Saale owns
a 400 Mw share of a 960 Mw power plant (60 Mw of which is sold directly to an
independent railroad) located in Schkopau, Germany, which is near Leipzig.
PowerGen plc of the United Kingdom acquired the remaining 50 percent interest in
Saale. VEBA Kraftwerke Ruhr AG of Gelsenkirchen, Germany (VKR), the builder of
the Schkopau plant, owns the remaining 58.9 percent interest and operates the
plant. The plant is fired by brown coal (lignite) mined by MIBRAG (discussed
later) under a long-term contract. Saale has a long-term power sales agreement
for its 400 Mw share of the Schkopau facility with VEAG of Berlin, Germany, the
company that controls the high-voltage transmission of electricity in the former
East Germany. The first 425 Mw unit of the plant began operation in January of
1996, and the second unit came on line in July of 1996.

         In 1993, NRG, through a wholly owned foreign subsidiary, agreed to
acquire a 33.33 percent interest in the coal mining, power generation and
associated operations of Mitteldeutsche Braunkohlengesellschaft mbH (MIBRAG),
located south of Leipzig, Germany. MIBRAG is a German corporation formed by the
German government to hold two open-cast brown coal (lignite) mining operations,
a lease on an additional mine, the associated mining rights and rights to future
mining reserves, two small industrial power plants, a circulating fluidized bed
power plant, a district heating system and coal briquetting and dust production
facilities. Under the acquisition agreement, Morrison Knudsen Corporation and
PowerGen plc also each acquired a 33 percent interest in MIBRAG, while the
German government retained a one-percent interest in MIBRAG. The investor
partners began operating MIBRAG effective Jan. 1, 1994, and the legal closing
occurred Aug. 11, 1994. In December 1996, each of the investor




partners purchased one third of the remaining one percent interest held by the
German government.

         In 1996 NRG and Nordic Power Invest AB (NPI), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Vattenfall AB, purchased 96.6 percent (4,060,732 shares) of the common stock
of Bolivian Power Company Limited (COBEE) for $43 per share through Tosli
Investment BV, the holding company jointly owned by NRG and NPI. In October
1997, the ownership of Tosli changed to 50 percent each for NRG and Vattenfall
AB as NRG sold 10 percent of Tosli to Vattenfall AB. COBEE is the second largest
generator of electricity in Bolivia with 171 Mw of capacity, which includes 136
Mw of hydro capacity and a 17 Mw gas-fired peaking unit. COBEE is incorporated
in Canada, with a local office in La Paz, Bolivia and a headquarters located in
Minneapolis, Minnesota. COBEE is in the process of expanding its hydroelectric
facilities in the Zongo Valley and upon completion, total generating capacity
will be 218 Mw.

         In November 1997, NRG acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of
Pacific Generation Company (PGC), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of
PacifiCorp Company, Inc. PGC has ownership interests in 11 projects with a total
capacity of 737 Mw with operational responsibility for 312 Mw and net ownership
interests of 166 Mw. One of the projects is located in Canada and the other ten
are located throughout the United States. The projects are diverse in terms of
fuel type, including natural gas, hydro, refuse-derived fuel, coal and wind.

         In April 1996, NRG purchased a 41.86 percent interest in O'Brien
Environmental Energy, Inc. (O'Brien). O'Brien was renamed NRG Generating (U.S.)
Inc. (NRGG). NRG currently holds 45.21 percent of the common stock of NRGG and
the remaining 54.79 percent is held publicly. NRGG is traded on the NASDAQ small
capital market under the ticker symbol NRGG. NRGG is the 100 percent owner of
power cogeneration facilities in Newark and Parlin, New Jersey. These two
facilities have an aggregate operating capacity of approximately 196 Mw. NRGG
also has a 33.3 percent interest in the 150 Mw Grays Ferry cogeneration project
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. NRGG and one of its partners in this project
recently commenced litigation seeking to enjoin PECO Energy Company (PECO) from
terminating its power purchase agreement with the project and to compel PECO to
pay the rate set forth in the existing agreements. NRGG's position is that the
actions of PECO are without merit and the existing agreements should be
enforced. On March 19, 1998 the federal court dismissed the action for lack of
jurisdiction. In addition to an equity interest in NRGG, in the purchase NRG
also acquired certain biogas projects which were transferred to its subsidiary,
NEO Corporation, and also made loans to NRGG and entered into project
commitments. (See Note 14 of the Financial Statements Under Item 8 for further
discussion of NRG's capital commitments related to NRGG.) During 1997, NRGG
purchased the Millennium project from NRG, resulting in a gain of approximately
3 cents per share.

         NRG also owns various domestic and international equity interests in
independent power production and cogeneration facilities, and thermal energy
production and transmission facilities with total equity of 560 Mw and 156.7
Megawatt therms (MWt), respectively, at Dec. 31, 1997.

OPERATING BUSINESSES - WHOLLY-OWNED

         NRG participates in several energy businesses which are managed as a
thermal business group. The Minneapolis Energy Center (MEC) provides steam and
chilled water to customers in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. MEC currently
provides 90 customers with 1.6 billion pounds of steam per year and 34 customers
with 39.1 million ton hours of chilled water per year. NRG, through its
wholly-owned subsidiary NRG Energy Center, Inc., acquired MEC in August 1993 for
approximately $110 million. MEC's assets include two steam and chilled water
plants, three chilled water plants, two combined steam plants, six miles of
steam and two miles of chilled water distribution lines. The MEC plants have a
combined steam capacity of 1,323 mmBtus per hour (388 Mwt) and cooling capacity
of 35,550 tons per hour. In addition, NRG owns and operates three steam lines in
Minnesota that provide steam from the Company's power plants to Rock-Tenn
Company, the Andersen Corporation and the Minnesota Correctional Facility in
Stillwater.

         NRG operates two refuse-derived fuel (RDF) processing plants and an ash
disposal site in Minnesota. The ownership of one plant was transferred by the
Company to NRG at the end of 1993. NRG manages the operation of the other RDF
plant, of which the Company owns 85 percent, and of the ash disposal site. The
Company pays NRG a fee to manage its RDF facility under an operation and
maintenance agreement approved by the MPUC. In 1997, the RDF plants processed
approximately 800,000 tons of municipal solid waste into approximately 650,000
tons of RDF that was burned at two NSP power plants and at a power plant owned
by United Power Association.

         NRG also owns 204 MWt of thermal energy production through several
additional wholly-owned subsidiaries operating in Minnesota and North Dakota.

NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

         NRG is pursuing several energy-related investment opportunities,
including those discussed




below, and continues to evaluate other opportunities as they arise. Potential
capital requirements for these opportunities are discussed in the Management's
Discussion and Analysis under Item 7 herein.

         A joint venture among NRG, Ansaldo Energia SpA, Italy and P.T. Kiani
Metra, Indonesia, is developing a 400 Mw coal-fired power generation facility in
West Java, Indonesia through P.T. Dayalistrik Pratama ("PTDP"), a limited
liability company created by the joint venturers. NRG and Ansaldo each have an
ownership interest of 45 percent in PTDP and P.T. Kiani Metra has an ownership
interest of 10 percent. In November 1996, PTDP signed a Power Purchase Agreement
with P.T. PLN (Persero), an instrumentality of the Government of Indonesia. NRG
Energy plans to have a 45 percent equity interest in the project and would
operate and maintain the power plant for the 30 year life of the project.
Ansaldo will have responsibility for construction. The coal-fired power plant
will sell its entire output to the local Java-Bali grid. In September 1997, the
government of Indonesia placed the project on review. All project development
efforts have been temporarily halted until the economic issues of Indonesia are
stabilized and the project is allowed to proceed by the government.

         In December 1996, NRG reached agreement with Indeck Energy Services
(Europe) to purchase a 50 percent equity interest in the Enfield Energy Centre,
a 350 Mw power project located in the North London Borough of Enfield, England
in the United Kingdom (UK). The power station is planned to begin commercial
operations in 1999 and would be jointly developed by NRG and Indeck. The power
station will sell its output to the UK grid. Natural gas will fuel the plant,
which will use an air-cooled condensing system to eliminate any visible water
vapor plume. Because of its proximity to London, local underground cables will
be used to distribute the electricity rather than large overhead transmission
lines. NRG expects to invest approximately $60 million in this project.
Financial commitments were obtained from lenders in 1997.

         In December 1996, representatives of the Estonian Government, the
state-owned Eesti Energia ("EE"), and NRG signed a Development Cooperation
Agreement ("DCA"). The DCA defines the terms under which the parties are to
establish a plan to develop and refurbish the Balti and Eesti Power Plants.
Pursuant to the DCA, a business plan for the joint project was submitted in June
1997. NRG has stated its willingness to invest up to $67.25 million of equity in
this project and to assist the joint project in obtaining non-recourse debt in
an amount necessary to fund the required capital improvements to the Balti and
Eesti Power Plants. Recently, the Estonian Government announced it had rejected
the business plan of NRG and EE and offered to work on a new plan in early 1998.
NRG's policy is to expense all costs until there is a signed contract and Board
of Directors approval. All such costs with respect to Estonia have been
expensed. Discussions are continuing with the Estonian Government as management
continues to evaluate the Estonian situation.

         NRG, together with two other parties and the Chapter 11 trustees, have
filed a plan with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of
Louisiana to acquire the fossil generating assets of Cajun Electric Power
Cooperative of Baton Rouge, Louisiana ("Cajun") for approximately $1.2 billion.
The NRG consortium has the support of the Chapter 11 trustee and Cajun's secured
creditors. The Court has also received two other competing reorganization plans,
all of which are subject to a confirmation hearing which began in December 1996.
NRG expects the confirmation process to conclude in the second quarter of 1998.
Under the plan filed with the Court, NRG would hold a 30 percent equity interest
in Louisiana Generating LLC, which would acquire Cajun's 1,706 Mw net of
non-nuclear generating assets. The plan of reorganization for Cajun contemplates
an equity investment from NRG of approximately $75-100 million.

         In 1996, a new wholly owned subsidiary of NRG purchased the senior debt
of Mid-Continent Power Company (MCPC) of Pryor, Oklahoma. In 1997, NRG received
all of MCPC's assets in exchange for forgiveness of a portion of the debt. In
December 1997, NRG sold a portion of its interest in MCPC resulting in a gain of
3 cents per share. MCPC owns a 120 Mw cogeneration facility in Pryor, Oklahoma.

PROJECTS WITH NONRECURRING EARNINGS EFFECTS

         In 1994, NRG, through a wholly owned subsidiary, purchased a 50 percent
ownership interest in Sunnyside Cogeneration Associates, a Utah joint venture,
which owns and operates a 58 Mw waste coal plant in Utah. The waste coal plant
is currently being operated by a partnership that is 50 percent owned by an NRG
affiliate. As of year-end 1997, NRG and its partner's effort to restructure the
debt of the Sunnyside cogeneration project was not successful. Due to a lack of
progress in restructuring the project's debt, NRG's net capitalized investment
in the Sunnyside project was written down by $9 million (8 cents per share after
tax) in the fourth quarter of 1997. NRG's remaining investment in the project
was $1 million at Dec. 31, 1997.

         NRG, through wholly owned subsidiaries, owns 45 percent of the San
Joaquin Valley Energy Partnerships (SJVEP), which owns four power plants located
near Fresno, California with a total capacity of 55 Mw. The plants previously
operated under long-term Standard Offer 4 (SO4) power sales contracts with
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) which expire in 2017. In early 1995, PG&E
reached basic agreements with SJVEP to acquire the SO4




contracts. The negotiated agreements resulted in cost savings for PG&E customers
as well as economic benefits for SJVEP. Under the terms of the agreements, PG&E
has been released from its contractual obligation to purchase power generated by
SJVEP. Proceeds received from PG&E under the agreements were used to repay SJVEP
debt obligations and recover investments in the facilities. SJVEP continues to
own and maintain the facilities and to evaluate opportunities to market power
without the prior costs incurred for plant depreciation and interest on debt, or
to sell the assets. All regulatory approvals for the agreements were received in
the second quarter of 1995. NRG's share of the pretax gain realized by SJVEP
from this transaction, which was recorded in June 1995, was approximately $30
million (26 cents per share after tax). Settlement distributions were paid to
NRG from SJVEP in 1995 and 1996. SJVEP's 10 Mw facility was sold to NEO in late
1996.

         In 1994, Michigan Cogeneration Partners Limited Partnership (MCP), a
partnership between subsidiaries of NRG and Cogentrix Energy, Inc., reached an
agreement with Consumers Power Company (Consumers), an electric utility
headquartered in Jackson, Michigan, to terminate the power sales contract
related to a 65 Mw cogeneration facility being developed by MCP in Parchment,
Michigan. The agreement to terminate the contract required Consumers to make a
payment to MCP of $29.8 million. As a result, NRG recorded a net pretax gain
from the termination of this contract of $9.7 million, which increased NSP's
earnings by approximately nine cents per share in the third quarter of 1994.

         NRG's subsidiary, Scoria Incorporated, and Western Syncoal Co., a
subsidiary of Montana Power Co., completed construction in January 1992 of a
demonstration coal conversion plant designed to improve the heating value of
coal by removing moisture, sulfur and ash. The plant, located in Montana, began
commercial operation in August 1993. NRG's net capitalized investment in the
Scoria coal project was written down by $3.5 million in 1994, $5 million in 1995
and $1.5 million in 1996 to reflect reductions in the expected future operating
cash flows from the project. NRG has no remaining investment to recover in the
Scoria project.

         NRG's subsidiary Graystone Corporation, and several other companies
were to build the first privately owned uranium enrichment plant in the United
States. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate successful operation
of this plant, NRG wrote off its $1.5 million investment in Graystone during
1994.


Energy Masters International, Inc. (EMI)
(formerly Cenerprise, Inc.)

         NSP's non-regulated wholly owned subsidiary, EMI, commenced operations
in October 1993 through the acquisition from bankruptcy of selected assets of
Centran Corporation, a natural gas marketing company. EMI, in addition to
marketing natural gas to end-use customers, provides customized value-added
energy services to customers, both inside NSP service territory and on a
national basis. EMI offers customers many energy products and services
including: utility billing analysis, end-use gas marketing, risk management,
construction, energy services consulting and administrative services. The MPUC
has approved a 1994 contract whereby EMI may make natural gas sales at market
based rates (determined by competitive bids) to NSP for resale to retail gas
customers. As described previously under the caption "Gas Utility Operations -
Capability and Demand", herein, a new 1998 agreement is pending MPUC approval.

         In 1995, EMI and Atlantic Energy Enterprises (AEE) established Enerval
LLC (formerly known as Atlantic CNRG Services LLC). EMI and AEE each own 50
percent of the venture, which develops new and expanded natural gas and electric
energy products and services, primarily in the northeast United States. EMI is
currently in the process of evaluating proposals for the sale of its interest in
Enerval and expects to finalize the sale during the second quarter of 1998. In
late 1997, EMI's investment in and advances to Enerval were written down to an
estimate of their net realizable value.

         In 1995, EMI acquired an 80 percent ownership interest in Kansas
City-based Energy Masters Corporation (EMC). In 1997, EMI acquired the remaining
20 percent of EMC. EMC has offices in seven states nationwide and specializes in
energy efficiency improvement services for commercial, industrial and
institutional customers. EMC continues to operate as a separate legal entity, as
a subsidiary of EMI.

         In 1997, EMI acquired 100 percent of Energy Solutions International
Inc. (ESI). ESI, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, is a full-service energy
management firm operating in 15 states nationwide. ESI continues to operate as a
separate legal entity, as a subsidiary of EMI.

Eloigne Company

         In 1993, the Company established Eloigne Company (Eloigne), to identify
and develop affordable housing investment opportunities. Eloigne's principal
business is the acquisition of a broadly diversified portfolio of rental housing
projects




which qualify for low income housing tax credits under current federal tax law.
As of Dec. 31, 1997, approximately $56 million had been invested in Eloigne
projects, including approximately $18 million in wholly owned properties (at net
book value) and approximately $38 million in equity interests in jointly-owned
projects. These investments and related working capital requirements have been
financed with approximately $27 million of long-term debt (including current
maturities) and the remainder with equity capital.

         Completed Eloigne projects as of Dec. 31, 1997, are expected to
generate tax credits of $71.1 million over the ten-year period 1998-2007. Tax
credits recognized in 1997 as a result of these investments were approximately
$6.7 million. A proposed "phase-out" of these tax credits was passed by the
United States Congress but vetoed by the President in 1995. The legislation
would have sunset the low-income housing tax credit allocation after Dec. 31,
1997. Under the vetoed proposal, projects with credits allocated prior to that
date would continue to generate tax credits over the remainder of the 10-year
credit period allowed. No legislation was reintroduced into Congress during 1996
or 1997 to phase-out low income tax credits.

Seren Innovations, Inc.

         Seren Innovations, Inc. (Seren) was formed in November, 1996 to pursue
communications and data services business in the upper Midwest. Seren invested
$6 million in a fixed wireless network now being deployed in the Minneapolis -
St. Paul metro area by an affiliate of CellNet Data Systems, Inc. In return,
Seren will receive contracted payments from the use of the network. Seren also
has the potential to receive additional royalties for data services added to the
network.

         Seren is pursuing additional network development opportunities in other
markets, which may result in potential equity investments of up to $50 million
in 1998-1999.

Ultra Power Technologies, Inc.

         Ultra Power Technologies Inc., (Ultra Power), a new NSP subsidiary
formed in late 1997, will market a proactive, non-destructive, power-cable
testing technology, for which NSP has been instrumental in the research and
development. The predictive tool was developed by Dr. Matt Mashikian of
Instrument Manufacturing Co. (IMCORP). Dr. Mashikian and IMCORP have entered
into a contract with Ultra Power to provide equipment and software to Ultra
Power. Ultra Power has exclusive marketing rights to this technology throughout

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         NSP proactively prevents adverse environmental impacts by regularly
monitoring operations to ensure the environment is not adversely affected, and
takes timely corrective actions where past practices have had a negative impact
on the environment. Significant resources are dedicated to environmental
training, monitoring and compliance matters. NSP strives to maintain compliance
with all applicable environmental laws.

         NSP is potentially liable for remediation of waste disposal sites owned
by others, and for decommissioning and restoration of present and former plant
sites, which is discussed in Notes 1, 13 and 14 to the Financial Statements
under Item 8.

         In general, NSP has been experiencing greater environmental monitoring
and compliance requirements, which have caused and may continue to cause
slightly higher operating expenses and capital expenditures. The Company has
spent approximately $727 million on capitalized environmental improvements to
new and existing facilities since 1968. NSP expects to incur approximately $18
million in capital expenditures and approximately $34 million in operating
expenses for compliance with environmental regulations in 1998. The precise
timing and amount of future environmental costs are currently unknown. (For
further discussion of environmental costs, see "Environmental Matters" under
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations under Item 7, and Note 14 to the Financial Statements under Item 8.)

Permits

         NSP's regulated businesses are required to renew environmental
operating permits for its facilities at least every five years. NSP believes
that it is in compliance, in all material respects, with environmental
permitting requirements.

Waste Disposal

         Spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal issues are discussed in
"Electric Utility Operations - Nuclear Power Plants - Licensing, Operation and
Waste Disposal and Capability and Demand," herein, in Management's Discussion
and Analysis under Item 7 and in Notes 13 and 14 of Notes to Financial
Statements under Item 8.

         The Company and NRG have contractual commitments to convert municipal
solid waste to boiler fuel (called Refuse-Derived Fuel or RDF) and to burn the
fuel to generate electricity. NRG owns and/or operates two resource recovery
plants that produce RDF from the waste. The RDF from NRG's plants is burned at
the Company's Red Wing and Wilmarth plants in the Company's service area, and
the Elk River plant owned by United Power Association. In addition, the
Wisconsin Company owns a RDF plant and the RDF produced by this plant is burned
at the French Island plant in the Wisconsin Company's service area. Processing
and burning RDF is an additional economical source of electricity, which is
beneficial to NSP's electric customers. The Company's commitment to this program
enables counties to meet state-mandated goals to reduce the amount of solid
waste which would otherwise go to landfills. In addition, the program provides
for increased materials recovery and increased use of municipal solid waste as
an energy source.

         NSP has met or exceeded the removal and disposal requirements for
polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) equipment as required by state and federal
regulations. NSP has removed nearly all known PCB capacitors from its
distribution system. NSP also has removed nearly all known network PCB
transformers and equipment in power plants containing PCBs. NSP continues to
test and dispose of PCB-contaminated mineral oil and equipment in accordance
with regulations. PCB-contaminated mineral oil is detoxified and reused or
burned for energy recovery at permitted facilities. Any future cleanup or
remediation costs associated with past PCB disposal practices is unknown at this
time.

Air Emissions Control And Monitoring

           In 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed new
air emission guidelines for municipal waste combustors. These proposed
guidelines were finalized in December 1995. In November 1997, the state of
Minnesota put a new draft waste combustor rule on public notice. This rule, when
finalized, will replace the old state waste combustor rule and will be more
restrictive than the federal guidelines. To meet the new federal and state
requirement, the Company must install additional pollution control and
monitoring equipment at the Red Wing plant and additional monitoring equipment
at the Wilmarth plant. The Company is evaluating equipment to meet the
requirements. The required equipment will likely cost between $4 million and $12
million.

         The Clean Air Act, including 1990 Amendments, (Clean Air Act) calls for
reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from electric
generating plants. These reductions, which will be phased in, began in 1995. The
majority of the rules implementing this complex legislation are finalized. No
additional capital expenditures are anticipated to comply with the sulfur
dioxide emission limits of the Clean Air Act. NSP has expended significant
amounts over the years to reduce sulfur




dioxide emissions at its plants. Based on revisions to the sulfur dioxide
portion of the program, NSP's emission allowance allocations for the years
1995-1999 were dramatically reduced from prior rulemaking. Burners at the
Company's Sherburne County Generating Plant (Sherco) unit 2 were upgraded in
1994 to further reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides. Other expenditures will be
necessary on the NSP system for compliance in the year 2000. Evaluations are
currently underway to determine if changing operating procedures could reduce or
eliminate future capital expenditures.

         In 1997, the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for
ozone and particulate matter. It is anticipated, based on historical monitoring,
that the Company will be in compliance with the new standards and therefore will
not be impacted by the new standards. If however, an area is determined to not
be in compliance with the new standards, reductions in emissions of sulfur
dioxide and oxides of nitrogen could be required.

         As part of its Clean Air Act compliance effort, testing of a full scale
prototype wet electrostatic precipitator ("wet" ESP) was completed at Sherco in
1996. The "wet" ESP equipment was installed in 1995 into one of the plant's
existing scrubber modules to determine its effectiveness in reducing particulate
emissions and lowering opacity. Based on operating test results, the Company has
chosen to convert multiple scrubber modules on Units 1 and 2 to the "wet" ESP
design. Capital investment to date for the prototype has been $4 million. The
Company estimates total capital expenditures for this project of $47 million
through 2001.

         The Company has conducted testing for air toxics at its major
facilities and has shared these results with state and federal agencies. The
Company also conducted research on ways to further reduce mercury emissions.
This information has also been shared with state and federal agencies. The Clean
Air Act requires the EPA to investigate the impact of air toxic emissions from
utilities and if appropriate, recommend regulations to control those emissions.
The EPA delivered a report to Congress in early 1998 which recommended
additional investigation on air toxics emissions. The report did not recommend
any controls on utility boilers at this time. In 1997, NSP worked proactively
with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and key legislators to pass
legislation requiring the annual reporting of mercury emissions from utility
boilers to the MPCA. NSP is also working with the MPCA on their Mercury
Reduction Initiative. The Initiative is evaluating various strategies to reduce
mercury contamination in fish.

         On March 11 and October 7, 1996, the Wisconsin Company received Notices
of Violation (NOV) from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR)
stating that emissions from unit 2 at the Wisconsin Company's French Island
generating facility had exceeded allowable levels for dioxin. The Company
responded by providing a written response to the WDNR setting forth the
Wisconsin Company's plans for bringing the emission levels back into compliance.
By year end 1997, subsequent compliance tests had demonstrated that dioxins no
longer exceeded acceptable limits. The Wisconsin Company expects that by early
1998 the WDNR will formally close out the NOV. No fines are expected.

         In 1996, the Wisconsin Company received a Letter of Non-compliance
(LON) from the WDNR for failing to meet the emission guidelines for carbon
monoxide (CO) at its Bay Front generating facility. The Wisconsin Company worked
with the WDNR to establish mutually agreed-upon CO emission limits for the Bay
Front facility. The Wisconsin Company has been advised by WDNR staff that, based
on monitoring during 1997, that the plant is in compliance with the new emission
limits. The Wisconsin Company has now been advised in writing that the LON has
been formally closed. No enforcement action or fines resulted from the LON.

           In December 1997, nearly 160 nations adopted the "Kyoto Protocol to
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change" (Kyoto Protocol).
Kyoto Protocol obligates developed nations to meet certain emissions targets;
specific limits vary from country to country. If the Kyoto Protocol is approved
internationally and the U.S. is a party, the Kyoto Protocol would impose, during
the first commitment period of 2008-2012, a binding obligation on the U.S. to
reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide to a level of
seven percent below 1990 levels and its emissions of hydrofluorocarbons,
perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexaflouride by seven percent below 1990 or 1995
levels. The Kyoto Protocol must be ratified by the U.S. Senate in order for the
U.S. to become a party to the protocol. Major provisions of the Kyoto Protocol,
such as an international emissions trading program, have yet to be developed.
Until they are developed, the impact on NSP cannot be determined.

Water Quality Monitoring

         In compliance with federal and state laws and state regulatory permit
requirements, and also in conformance with the Company's corporate environmental
policy, the Company has installed environmental monitoring systems at all coal
and RDF ash landfills and coal stockpiles to assess and monitor the impact of
these facilities on the quality of ground and surface waters. Degradation of
water quality in the state is prohibited by law and requires remedial action for
restoration to an agreed upon acceptable clean-up level. The cost of overall
water quality monitoring is not material in relation to NSP's operating results.

Electromagnetic Fields




         Electric and magnetic fields (sometimes referred to as EMF) surround
electric wires and conductors of electricity such as electrical tools, household
wiring, appliances, electric distribution lines, electric substations and
high-voltage electric transmission lines. NSP owns and operates many of these
types of facilities. Some studies have found statistical associations between
surrogates of EMF and some forms of cancer. The nation's electric utilities,
including NSP, have participated in the sponsorship of more than $115 million in
research to determine the possible health effects of EMF. Through its
participation with the Electric Power Research Institute and the EMF Research
and Public Information Dissemination Program, sponsored by the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the U.S. Department of Energy,
NSP continues its investigation and research with regard to possible health
effects posed by exposure to EMF. No litigation has been commenced or material
claims asserted against NSP for adverse health effects or diminution of property
values due to EMF.

Contingencies

         Both regulatory requirements and environmental technology change
rapidly. Accordingly, NSP cannot presently estimate the extent to which it may
be required by law, in the future, to make additional capital expenditures or to
incur additional operating expenses for environmental purposes. NSP also cannot
predict whether future environmental regulations might result in significant
reductions in generating capacity or efficiency or otherwise affect NSP's
income, operations or facilities.


CAPITAL SPENDING AND FINANCING

         NSP's capital spending program is designed to assure that there will be
adequate generating, transmission and distribution capacity to meet the future
electric and gas needs of its utility service area, and to fund investments in
non-regulated businesses. NSP continually reassesses needs and, when necessary,
appropriate changes are made in the capital expenditure program Current year
capital spending activity and future financing requirements and sources are
discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7 herein.

         On March 11, 1998, the Company issued $100 million of 5.875 percent
First Mortgage Bonds due March 1, 2003 and $150 million of 6.5 percent First
Mortgage Bonds due March 1, 2028. The proceeds will be used to redeem its $50
million 7.375 percent and $50 million 7.5 percent First Mortgage Bonds on April
27, 1998; 300,000 shares of its cumulative preferred stock adjustable rate
series A and 650,000 shares of its cumulative preferred stock adjustable rate
series B both at $100 per share plus accrued dividends on March 31, 1998; and to
reduce short-term debt balances.

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

         At year end 1997 the total number of full- and part-time employees of
NSP was 7,455 and the total number of benefit employees was 6,718. Of this
number approximately 2,800 employees are represented by five local IBEW labor
unions under a three year collective bargaining agreement which expires Dec.
31, 1999.

         401(k) CHANGES: NSP currently offers eligible employees a 401(k)
Retirement Savings Plan. In 1994, NSP began matching employees' pre-tax 401(k)
contributions. NSP's matching contributions were $4.4 million in 1997, based on
matching up to $900 for each nonbargaining employee and up to $700 for each
bargaining employee.

         WAGE INCREASES: Under a market-based pay structure implemented for
nonbargaining employees in 1994, NSP uses salary surveys that indicate how other
relevant companies pay their employees for comparable positions. In January
1997, nonbargaining employees received an average wage increase of 4 percent,
and bargaining employees received a 2 percent base wage scale increase. In
January 1998, nonbargaining employees received an average wage scale increase of
3.4 percent. Base wage scale increases for bargaining employees in 1998 were 2
percent.

         NSP's electric generating facilities provided 76 percent of its Kwh
requirements in 1997. The current generating facilities are expected to be
adequate base load sources of electric energy until 2003-2006, as detailed in
the Company's electric resource plan filed with the MPUC in 1998. All of NSP's
major generating stations are located in Minnesota on land owned by the Company.

================================================================================


         At Dec. 31, 1997, NSP had overhead transmission and distribution lines
as follows:

         Voltage                 Length (Pole Miles)
         -------                 -------------------
         500Kv                   265
         345Kv                   734
         230Kv                   283
         161Kv                   350
         115Kv                   1,609
         Less than 115Kv         32,095

         NSP also has approximately 280 transmission and distribution
substations with capacities greater than 10,000 kilovoltamperes (Kva) and
approximately 280 with capacities less than 10,000 Kva.

         Manitoba Hydro, Minnesota Power Company and the Company completed the
construction of a 500-Kv transmission interconnection between Winnipeg,
Manitoba, Canada, and the Minneapolis-St Paul, Minnesota, area in 1980. NSP has
a contract with Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board for 500 Mw of firm power utilizing
this transmission line. In addition, the Company is interconnected with Manitoba
Hydro through a 230 Kv transmission line completed in 1970. In 1995 a project
was completed to increase the Manitoba-US transmission interconnection by a
nominal 400 Mw to 1900 Mw. This project was undertaken as part of a contract
where NSP and Manitoba Hydro have established an additional 150 Mw of seasonal
power exchange. (See Note 14 of Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8 for
further discussion of power purchase commitments.)

         The electric delivery system utilization has increased during recent
years due to better analytical methods and enhanced Energy Management System
monitoring and control capability. This increased utilization has been achieved
while continuing to operate within reliability parameters established by MAPP
and North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC).

         Plans are currently being implemented for electric delivery system
upgrades to accommodate load growth expected in the Minneapolis-St. Paul
geographic area through 2010. Recent studies have indicated load growth of
approximately two percent per year. As the least cost option to accommodate the
load growth, portions of the 69 Kv transmission facilities, especially located
on the outskirts of the Twin Cities, are being reconductored and operated at 115
Kv; distribution development in these areas have been converted to 34.5 Kv. By
reconductoring on existing right-of-ways and increasing distribution voltage,
the requirements for new right-of-ways and substation sites are minimized as
compared with other alternatives for serving the load growth.

         The natural gas properties of NSP include about 8,986 miles of natural
gas transmission and distribution mains. NSP natural gas mains include




approximately 116 miles with a capacity in excess of 275 pounds per square inch
(psi) and approximately 8,870 miles with a capacity of less than 275 psi. In
addition, Viking owns a 500-mile interstate natural gas pipeline serving
portions of Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota.

         Virtually all of the utility plant of the Company and the Wisconsin
Company are subject to the lien of their first mortgage bond indentures pursuant
to which they have issued first mortgage bonds.

"Nonregulated Subsidiaries", under Item 1, incorporated herein by reference.


ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
================================================================================

         In the normal course of business, various lawsuits and claims have
arisen against NSP. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, has
recorded an estimate of the probable cost of settlement or other disposition for
such matters.

         In 1993, a natural gas explosion occurred on the Company's distribution
system in St. Paul, Minnesota. As a result of this explosion, eighteen lawsuits,
including one lawsuit with multiple plaintiffs, were filed against the Company
and the City of St. Paul. By September 1997, the Company reached a settlement on
all of the lawsuits, and also resolved all known claims that had not advanced to
litigation. The Company's total costs for legal fees, disbursements, and
resolution of claims and lawsuits were $1 million. All expenditures paid by the
Company in excess of $1 million were reimbursed by its insurance provider
through the Company's general liability coverage policy.

         On June 20, 1994, the Company along with other major utilities filed a
lawsuit against the DOE in an attempt to clarify the DOE's obligation to dispose
of spent nuclear fuel beginning not later than Jan. 31, 1998. The suit was filed
in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (Court). The
primary purpose of the lawsuit was to insure that the Company and its customers
receive timely storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel in accordance with the
terms of the Company's contract with the DOE. On July 23, 1996, the Court
affirmed the federal government's obligation. The Court unanimously ruled that
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act creates an unconditional obligation for the DOE to
begin acceptance of spent nuclear fuel by Jan. 31, 1998. The DOE did not seek
U.S. Supreme Court review. On Jan. 31, 1997, the Company, along with 30 other
electric utilities and 45 state agencies, filed another lawsuit against the DOE
requesting authority to withhold payments to the DOE for the permanent disposal
program. On May 7, 1997, the Company asked the Court to order the DOE to take
spent nuclear fuel by the Jan. 31, 1998 deadline. On Nov. 14, 1997, the Court
reiterated the unconditional obligation of the DOE to begin acceptance of spent
nuclear fuel by the 1998 deadline. The Court confirmed the obligation exists
under the statute and contract, but denied the request directing the DOE to
accept spent nuclear fuel by the deadline finding the contractual remedies under
the contract may be adequate. The Court also held that the DOE cannot use its
own delays or the unavailability of a permanent disposal or temporary storage
facility as a defense to utilities' actions. On Feb. 19, 1998, the Company and
other utilities asked the Court to order the DOE to develop a disposal program
to dispose of nuclear fuel beginning immediately; relief from an obligation to
pay fees to the Nuclear Waste Fund (Fund) and allow escrow of the funds until
the DOE is in compliance; prohibition of any suspension or termination of the
DOE's disposal contract; prevention of the DOE from paying damages related to
the breach of obligation from the Fund.

         The Company is analyzing and preparing continuing legal actions against
the DOE to enforce its statutory and contractual obligations. NSP and other
utilities are currently analyzing claims against the DOE for the costs incurred
as a result of the DOE's failure to meet its statutory and contractual
obligations.

         In October 1996, the Company was named in a class action lawsuit
commenced by two commercial customers, who claimed that the expected energy
savings from NSP's lighting efficiency program were misrepresented. On Jan. 22,
1998, a Hennepin County District Court Judge granted NSP's motion for summary
judgment and dismissed the class action lawsuit in its entirety. The plaintiffs
have until June 1, 1998 to appeal the Hennepin County District Court decision.

         On June 10, 1997, the Minnesota Office of the Attorney General (OAG)
petitioned the MPUC to investigate the Company's meter reading and billing
practices and to authorize the OAG to pursue civil penalties. The Company
contested the claims before the MPUC. On Jan. 29, 1998, the parties reached an
agreement on settlement terms which will obligate NSP to provide approximately
$3 million in immediate customer credits, up to $3 million of additional
assistance to low-income customers over the next three years, and to meet
certain agreed-to performance standards. The settlement agreement was approved
by the MPUC on March 3, 1998. The Company continues to deny any liability, and
entered into the agreement to avoid potentially significant litigation costs.
The Company recorded an estimated liability for the customer credits in its 1997
financial statements.

         On Sept. 15, 1997, NSP sought a determination in which the city of
Oakdale,




Minnesota (City) must abide by the Company's tariffs filed with the MPUC in the
Washington County District Court. The tariffs require the City to pay the
additional cost of undergrounding electrical facilities prior to installation.
On Feb. 18, 1998, the judge held that NSP must abide by the City's
undergrounding ordinance which is silent on the issue of responsibility for
payment of additional costs. The judge also ruled the tariff requiring the City
to incur the additional costs was not binding on the City. As the judge's ruling
is contrary to prior decisions of the Minnesota Court of Appeals, NSP will
appeal the decision to that court in 1998. If the decision is not overruled, NSP
would have to include the additional costs of undergrounding facilities in
future rate cases or the costs would reduce earnings. Currently, the City has
allowed NSP to construct its facilities overhead and no construction project
will be delayed due to the appeal.

         On Jan. 23, 1998, Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) filed a complaint
with the FERC against MAPP and its individual members (including the Company and
the Wisconsin Company). The complaint alleged that the electric transmission
curtailment procedures applied under the restated MAPP agreement and the NSP
Open Access Transmission Tariff do not comply with FERC Order No. 888. The
complaint alleges application of the MAPP procedure caused curtailment of
certain ComEd transactions during May 1997, to the detriment of ComEd. On March
9, 1998, MAPP filed an answer denying the ComEd allegations, and NSP submitted a
separate filing asking FERC to dismiss the complaint. ComEd requested that the
FERC order MAPP and its members to revise their procedures and ComEd seeks such
other and further relief that the FERC deems proper, including modifications to
rate schedules or tariffs, if necessary.

Matters" under Item 1, incorporated herein by reference. For a discussion of
proceedings involving NSP's utility rates, see "Utility Regulation and Revenues"

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
================================================================================

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation (the Company), has two
significant subsidiaries: Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation
(the Wisconsin Company), and NRG Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (NRG). The
Company also has several other subsidiaries, including Viking Gas Transmission
Company (Viking), Energy Masters International, Inc. (EMI), which changed its
name from Cenerprise, Inc., effective Sept. 1, 1997, and Eloigne Company
(Eloigne). The Company and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to herein
as NSP.

FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES AND RESULTS

NSP's financial objectives are:

*        TO PROVIDE INVESTOR RETURNS IN THE TOP ONE-FOURTH OF THE UTILITY
         INDUSTRY AS MEASURED BY A THREE-YEAR AVERAGE RETURN ON EQUITY. NSP's
         average return on common equity for the three years ending in 1997 was
         12.0 percent. Based on a three-year average, this return places NSP
         below the top one-fourth of the industry, which was approximately 12.7
         percent, and above the median three-year industry average of
         approximately 11.3 percent. The total return to investors (measured by
         dividends plus stock price appreciation) on NSP common stock for the
         most recent five-year period averaged 12.4 percent per year. For the
         same period, the total return for the electric industry averaged 10.7
         percent. NSP's stock price rose 27.0 percent over the year, well above
         the 22.1 percent average increase of other utilities rated AA by
         Standard & Poor's (S&P).

*        TO INCREASE DIVIDENDS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND MAINTAIN A LONG-TERM
         AVERAGE PAYOUT RATIO IN THE RANGE OF 65 TO 75 PERCENT. NSP has
         increased its dividend for 23 consecutive years. In June 1997, NSP's
         annualized common dividend rate was increased by 6 cents per share, or
         2.2 percent, from $2.76 to $2.82. The dividend payout ratio was 89.4
         percent in 1997, above the objective range due to the unusual events
         that adversely affected NSP's earnings in 1997. (See discussion under
         Results of Operations.) The objective payout ratio is based on
         long-term earnings expectations.

*        TO MAINTAIN LONG-TERM AVERAGE ANNUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH OF 5
         PERCENT FROM ONGOING OPERATIONS, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. Excluding the
         nonrecurring items discussed later under Factors Affecting Results of
         Operations, NSP's earnings per share have grown by an average annual
         rate of 4.1 percent since 1993.

                                                        1997      1996      1995
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM ONGOING OPERATIONS        $3.54      $3.82    $3.69
     Earnings (losses) from nonrecurring items          (.33)               0.22
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Total earnings per share                          $3.21      $3.82    $3.91
     ===========================================================================


*        TO PROVIDE AT LEAST 20 PERCENT OF NSP EARNINGS FROM NRG BUSINESSES BY
         THE YEAR 2000. NRG expects to meet this goal through the growing
         profitability of existing businesses and the addition of new
         businesses. Businesses owned by NRG provided 39 cents, or 11 percent,
         of NSP's earnings per share from ongoing operations in 1997, and 29
         cents, or 7.6 percent, of NSP's earnings per share from ongoing
         operations in 1996.

*        TO MAINTAIN CONTINUED FINANCIAL STRENGTH WITH A AA RATING FOR UTILITY
         BONDS. The Company's first mortgage bonds continued to be rated AA by
         Fitch Investors Service, Inc. In October 1997, S&P's raised NSP's bond
         rating to AA, as a part of an industry re-evaluation. In July 1997,
         Moody's Investors Services (Moody's) upgraded its rating on NSP's first
         mortgage bonds to Aa3. Moody's rating action reflects NSP's progress in
         satisfying legislative requirements associated with spent-fuel storage
         at Prairie Island and various other factors. Moody's also cited NSP's
         healthy competitive position and strong financial condition. Duff &
         Phelps, Inc. raised the Company's bond rating to AA in February 1998.
         First mortgage bonds issued by the Wisconsin Company carry comparable
         ratings. NSP's pretax interest coverage ratio for utility operations,
         based on income excluding Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
         (AFC), was 3.5 in 1997. A capital structure consisting of 46.7 percent
         common equity at year-end 1997 contributes to NSP's financial
         flexibility and strength.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

The following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors
that had a material effect on NSP's financial condition and results of
operations during 1997 and 1996. It should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Trends and contingencies of
a material nature are discussed to the extent known and considered relevant.
Material changes in balance sheet items are discussed below and in the
accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.

Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in
the following discussion and analysis are forward-looking statements that are
subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Such forward-looking
statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words
"anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "objective," "possible," "potential" and
similar expressions. Actual results may vary materially. Factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to:
general economic conditions, including their impact on capital expenditures;
business conditions in the energy industry; competitive factors; unusual
weather; changes in federal or state legislation; regulation; the items
discussed under "Factors Affecting Results of Operations"; and the other risk
factors listed from time to time by the Company in reports filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Exhibit 99.01 to the
Company's 1997 report on Form 10-K.




RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1997 COMPARED WITH 1996 AND 1995

NSP's 1997 earnings per share from ongoing operations (assuming dilution) were
$3.54, down 28 cents, or 7.3 percent, from the $3.82 earned in 1996 and down 15
cents, or 4.1 percent, from the $3.69 earned in 1995. NSP's total earnings per
share (assuming dilution), including nonrecurring transactions in 1997 and 1995
(as discussed later), were $3.21 in 1997, $3.82 in 1996 and $3.91 in 1995.
Nonrecurring transactions in 1997 include the write-off of costs incurred prior
to the termination of NSP's proposed merger with Wisconsin Energy Corporation
(WEC) and NRG's write-down of a cogeneration project.

Regulated utility businesses generated earnings of $3.24 per share from ongoing
operations in 1997, $3.58 in 1996 and $3.41 in 1995. Earnings from ongoing
regulated operations were lower in 1997, primarily due to higher utility
operations, maintenance and depreciation expenses, the impacts of less favorable
weather, and dilutive effects of stock issuances. Partially offsetting these
earnings decreases were growth in electric sales and reduced administrative
costs.

Nonregulated businesses generated earnings from ongoing operations of 30 cents
per share in 1997, 24 cents in 1996 and 28 cents in 1995. Nonregulated earnings
increased in 1997 primarily due to higher NRG earnings from new projects,
including tax credits. Increased financing costs at NRG and losses incurred by
EMI partially offset these increases.

UTILITY OPERATING RESULTS

ELECTRIC REVENUES Sales to retail customers, which account for more than 90
percent of NSP's electric revenue, increased 1.5 percent in 1997 and 1.0 percent
in 1996. Sales in 1997 included unfavorable weather impacts compared with normal
average temperatures, and sales in 1996 and 1995 included favorable weather
impacts compared with normal average temperatures, with the retail sales impact
for 1996 being less favorable than it was in 1995. Total electric sales volumes
increased 0.6 percent in 1997 and decreased 3.0 percent in 1996. Lower sales
volumes to other utilities in 1997 and 1996 and the loss of several municipal
power customers in 1995 and 1996 partially offset the retail sales growth in
1997 and contributed to the 1996 decrease.

On a weather-adjusted basis, retail electric sales volumes are estimated to have
increased 2.6 percent in 1997 and 1.5 percent in 1996. Retail electric sales
growth for 1998 is estimated to be 2.0 percent over 1997, or 1.5 percent, on a
weather-adjusted basis.

Sales volumes to other utilities decreased 5.2 percent in 1997, while revenues
increased in 1997 (as shown in the following table). Constraints on NSP's system
due to unscheduled plant outages and storms (as discussed later) contributed to
the decrease in volumes in 1997, while higher market prices due to market
conditions contributed to the revenue increase in 1997. Market conditions and
regional transmission system constraints contributed to the sales decrease in
1996.

The table below summarizes the principal reasons for the electric revenue
changes during the past two years:

================================================================================




ELECTRIC PRODUCTION EXPENSES Fuel expense for electric generation in 1997
increased $8.8 million, or 2.9 percent, compared with a decrease of $24.5
million, or 7.5 percent, in 1996. The 1997 increase is primarily due to higher
average fossil fuel prices, mainly reflecting the increased use of higher-cost
plants due to plant outages and transmission line and plant limitations, as
discussed later. In 1997, management decided to take the Company's Monticello
nuclear generating plant, a baseload plant, out of service to accelerate
implementation of a design change originally planned for 1998. In addition,
during the summer of 1997, portions of transmission lines connecting two of
NSP's baseload generating plants, the Monticello nuclear and Sherco fossil
plants, to the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area were damaged by storms. Until
repairs were completed later in 1997, the Company's generating and transmission
capabilities were temporarily reduced. As a result, NSP increased generation at
its more expensive peaking plants and purchased more power to meet 1997 sales
requirements. The 1996 decrease was primarily due to lower average fuel costs
resulting from a new coal transportation contract in July 1995, and lower plant
output caused by decreased electric sales, planned maintenance outages and
conversion of two plants to peaking status.

Purchased power costs increased $42.7 million, or 17.5 percent, in 1997 after
decreasing $4.1 million, or 1.7 percent, in 1996. The 1997 increase was
primarily due to higher purchases, higher average market prices and higher
demand expenses. The higher purchases were a result of lower plant availability
due to the unplanned nuclear plant outage and storms, as discussed previously,
and higher 1997 sales requirements. The 1996 decrease primarily was due to lower
demand expenses.

GAS REVENUES The majority of NSP's retail gas sales are categorized as firm
(primarily heating customers) and interruptible (commercial/industrial customers
with an alternate energy supply). Firm sales in 1997 decreased 10.8 percent
compared with 1996 sales, while firm sales in 1996 increased 13.2 percent
compared with 1995 sales. The decrease in 1997 was primarily due to the impacts
of favorable weather in 1996 and unfavorable weather in 1997, partially offset
by sales growth. The increase in 1996 primarily was due to strong sales growth
and favorable impacts of weather.

On a weather-adjusted basis, firm gas sales are estimated to have increased 2.2
percent in 1997 and increased 5.1 percent in 1996. The firm sales increase in
1997 was partially offset by lost gas sales as a result of flooding in the Grand
Forks area. Firm gas sales in 1998 are estimated to be 7.0 percent higher
compared with 1997 sales, or 3.3 percent higher on a weather-adjusted basis.

Interruptible sales of gas increased 11.6 percent in 1997 and 3.6 percent in
1996. The increases in both years are the result of favorable gas market prices
compared with alternate fuels that caused large interruptible customers with
alternate fuel sources to use more natural gas. Other gas deliveries, including
Viking sales, increased 0.6 percent in 1997 and 5.3 percent in 1996. Viking gas
transmission deliveries to parties other than NSP increased 4.8 percent in 1997
and 7.7 percent in 1996.

The table below summarizes the principal reasons for the gas revenue changes
during the past two years:

   Total revenue increase (decrease)                     $(12)          $101
================================================================================

COST OF GAS PURCHASED AND TRANSPORTED The cost of gas purchased and transported
decreased $4.2 million, or 1.2 percent, in 1997, primarily due to lower gas
sendout partially offset by a 6.7 percent increase in the per unit cost of
purchased gas. The lower sendout reflects decreased gas sales, as discussed
previously, while the increase in cost per unit of purchased gas, occurring
mainly in the first quarter of 1997, reflects changes in market conditions. The
cost of gas purchased and transported increased $78.7 million, or 30.6 percent,
in 1996, primarily due to a 20.5 percent increase in the per unit cost of
purchased gas and higher gas sendout. The increase in gas sendout reflects
increased gas sales, while the increase in cost per unit of purchased gas
reflects changes in market conditions.




OTHER OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL These expenses, in
total, increased by $37.4 million, or 5.9 percent, in 1997, compared with a
decrease of $24.9 million, or 3.8 percent, in 1996. The higher costs in 1997 are
primarily due to increased operating expenses associated with 1997 business
interruptions, higher customer service expenses, increased network transmission
service (NTS) costs, as discussed under Factors Affecting Results of Operations,
higher scheduled plant maintenance outage expenses and higher technology
improvement expenses. Business interruptions in 1997 included flooding in the
Company's service area, the unscheduled Monticello plant outage and storm damage
to transmission lines. Technology improvements included development of customer
information, automated meter reading and other systems, including preparation
for the year 2000. These cost increases were partially offset by a $6.9 million
decrease in administrative and general expenses, reflecting decreases in
insurance and employee benefit costs.

The lower costs in 1996 largely are due to lower administrative and general
costs, partly offset by higher scheduled plant maintenance outage expenses and
provisions for uncollectible accounts. Administrative and general expenses in
1996 reflect fewer employees and decreases in insurance and claims, employee
benefit and other corporate costs. (See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for a
summary of administrative and general expenses.)

CONSERVATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT Expenses increased in both 1997 and 1996
mainly due to higher amortization levels of deferred electric and gas
conservation and energy management program costs. Higher cost levels in 1996
also include the effects of expensing currently (rather than amortizing over a
period of time) new conservation expenditures beginning in 1996. These higher
amortization and cost levels are recovered concurrently through retail rate
adjustment clauses in the Company's Minnesota jurisdiction, which are discussed
later under Factors Affecting Results of Operations.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION The increases in 1997 and 1996 reflect higher
levels of depreciable plant, including new information systems and equipment in
1997 and 1996 with relatively short useful lives. Information technology
improvements are expected to continue in 1998.

PROPERTY AND GENERAL TAXES Property and general taxes decreased in 1997 and
1996, primarily due to lower property tax rates partially offset by increases
due to property additions.

UTILITY INCOME TAXES The variations in income taxes primarily are attributable
to fluctuations in taxable income and changes to effective tax rates. (See Note
7 to the Financial Statements for a detailed reconciliation of the statutory tax
rate to NSP's effective tax rate.)

NONOPERATING ITEMS RELATED TO UTILITY BUSINESSES

MERGER COSTS In May 1997, NSP and WEC mutually terminated their plans to merge.
NSP's earnings for 1997 include a pretax charge to nonoperating expense of $29
million, or 25 cents per share, to write off its cumulative merger-related costs
incurred. This charge is being reported as a nonrecurring item outside of
earnings from ongoing operations.

UTILITY FINANCING COSTS Interest costs recognized for NSP's utility businesses,
including amounts capitalized to reflect the financing costs of construction
activities, were $120.3 million in 1997, $123.1 million in 1996 and $123.4
million in 1995. The 1997 decrease is due primarily to lower average short-term
borrowing levels, and the retirement of $100 million of first mortgage bonds in
October 1997. The slight 1996 decrease is largely due to lower interest costs on
variable rate long-term debt, partially offset by higher average short-term
borrowing levels. The average short-term debt balance was $208.3 million in
1997, $265.4 million in 1996 and $208.7 million in 1995. In addition to interest
expense, beginning in 1997, financing costs of NSP's utility businesses include
distributions on redeemable preferred securities.




NONREGULATED BUSINESS RESULTS

NSP's nonregulated operations include diversified businesses such as NRG's
businesses, which are primarily independent power production, commercial and
industrial heating and cooling, and energy-related refuse-derived fuel
production. In addition, EMI's primary business is energy sales and service. NSP
also has investments in affordable housing projects through Eloigne and several
income-producing properties through other subsidiaries. Due to the nature of
these nonregulated businesses, NSP anticipates that the earnings from
nonregulated operations will experience more variability than regulated utility
businesses. As discussed below and shown in Note 8 to the Financial Statements,
NSP's nonregulated earnings for these periods are experiencing such variability.

The following summarizes the earnings contributions of NSP's nonregulated
businesses:

===============================================================================

 (1)  Includes NSP-owned refuse-derived fuel operations managed by NRG

NRG

NRG's earnings from ongoing operations (excluding the nonrecurring transaction
discussed later) increased in 1997, compared with 1996, primarily due to income
from new projects, including tax credits. New projects contributing to NRG's
earnings increase include: Bolivian Power Company Ltd. (COBEE); Pacific
Generation Company (PGC); the Schkopau power generating facility in Germany,
which began operation in July 1996; and the Australian State of Victoria's Loy
Yang A power plant in which NRG, through affiliates, purchased a 25.37 percent
interest in May 1997. NRG's landfill gas subsidiary, NEO, has entered into
projects in 1996 and 1997 that are generating higher levels of energy tax
credits. Also contributing to NRG's increased earnings were the gains on the
sale of equity interests in two projects late in 1997. Higher interest costs due
to the $250 million senior notes issued in mid-1997 partially offset the
increased earnings. NRG's earnings in 1997 were adversely affected by declines
in the value of the Australian dollar and German deutsche mark in relation to
the U.S. dollar. Had exchange rates throughout 1997 stayed the same as the
beginning of the year, NRG's 1997 earnings would have been higher by
approximately 4 cents per share.

As of year-end 1997, NRG and its partner's effort to restructure the debt of the
58-megawatt Sunnyside cogeneration project in Utah was not successful. Due to a
lack of progress in restructuring the project's debt, NRG recorded a
nonrecurring expense of 8 cents per share to write down its investment in the
Sunnyside project late in 1997. This write-down reduced income from nonregulated
businesses before interest and taxes by $9 million for 1997 and is considered a
nonrecurring item.

Excluding the nonrecurring items discussed later, NRG's earnings from ongoing
operations increased in 1996, compared with 1995, due primarily to higher equity
in earnings of projects. Equity in earnings of projects increased in 1996,
primarily due to first-time earnings from Schkopau and NRG Generating (U.S.)
Inc. and higher income from Scudder Latin American Power Projects. These
earnings were partially offset by lower equity earnings from the MIBRAG project.
Equity in earnings from MIBRAG decreased, primarily due to an expected decline
in heating briquette and coal sales. NRG's earnings from ongoing operations were
higher in 1996, as compared with 1995, despite experiencing an increased level
of business development costs in 1996 as it pursued several international and
domestic projects. Until there is substantial assurance that a project in
development will come to financial closure, such costs are expensed.

NRG's earnings for 1995 included two nonrecurring items that added 22 cents to
1995 earnings. A gain of approximately 26 cents per share was recorded for a
power sales contract termination settlement, which was partially offset by a
domestic energy project write-down of 4 cents per share.

Further information on NRG's financial results may be obtained from NRG's annual
report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.




EMI

EMI's losses for 1997 were higher than 1996, primarily due to losses incurred by
EMI's gas marketing joint venture, Enerval, the partial write-down of EMI's
investment in Enerval, and increased expenses related to combining operations
with Energy Solutions International, Inc. (ESI) and Energy Masters Corporation
(EMC), both purchased by EMI in July 1997. These increased losses were partially
offset by increased operating margins, primarily due to the curtailment of gas
trading activity in the second quarter of 1996, which had negatively impacted
operating margins during the first half of 1996. EMI is currently in the process
of evaluating proposals for the sale of its interest in Enerval and expects to
finalize the sale during the first quarter of 1998. EMI's investment in and
advances to Enerval have been written down to an estimate of their net
realizable value.

EMI's earnings for 1996 decreased, compared with 1995, largely due to price
volatility in the gas market, which adversely affected earnings from Enerval,
and losses incurred from the gas trading business.

OTHER

Eloigne's earnings have continued to grow in 1997 and 1996 due to investments in
new affordable housing projects. NSP's new communications and data services
subsidiary, Seren Innovations, experienced a loss in its first year, 1997, as it
focused on development of its products and services.

FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NSP's results of operations during 1997, 1996 and 1995 primarily were dependent
upon the operations of the Company's and Wisconsin Company's utility businesses,
consisting of the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of
electricity, and the distribution, transportation and sale of natural gas. NSP's
utility revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions,
general business conditions, the state of the economy and the cost of energy
services. Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and gas
service within their respective jurisdictions. In addition, NSP's nonregulated
businesses are contributing to NSP's earnings. The historical and future trends
of NSP's operating results have been and are expected to be affected by the
following factors:

REGULATION NSP's utility rates are approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) and state regulatory commissions in Minnesota, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Wisconsin and Michigan. Rates are designed to recover plant
investment and operating costs and an allowed return on investment, using an
annual period upon which rate case filings are based. NSP requests changes in
rates for utility services as needed through filings with the governing
commissions. The rates charged to retail customers in Wisconsin are reviewed and
adjusted biennially. Because comprehensive rate changes are not requested
annually in Minnesota, NSP's primary jurisdiction, changes in operating costs
can affect NSP's earnings, shareholders' equity and other financial results.
Except for Wisconsin electric operations, NSP's retail rate schedules provide
for cost-of-energy and resource adjustments to billings and revenues for changes
in the cost of fuel for electric generation, purchased energy, purchased gas,
and, in Minnesota, conservation and energy management program costs. For
Wisconsin electric operations, where cost-of-energy adjustment clauses are not
used, the biennial retail rate review process and an interim fuel cost hearing
process provide the opportunity for rate recovery of changes in electric fuel
and purchased energy costs in lieu of a cost-of-energy adjustment clause. In
addition to changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate filings are
sales growth, conservation and demand-side management efforts and the cost of
capital.

As discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements, regulated public utilities
are allowed to record as assets certain costs that would be expensed by
nonregulated enterprises, and to record as liabilities certain gains that would
be recognized as income by nonregulated enterprises. If deregulation or other
changes in the regulatory environment occur, NSP may no longer be eligible to
apply this accounting treatment and may be required to eliminate such regulatory
assets and liabilities from its balance sheet. Such changes could have a
material adverse effect on NSP's results of operations in the period the
write-off is recorded. At Dec. 31, 1997, NSP reported on its balance sheet
approximately $212 million and $129 million of regulatory assets and
liabilities, respectively, that would need to be recognized in the income
statement in the absence of regulation. Included in these regulatory assets are
$87 million of conservation expenditures that are anticipated to be
substantially recovered by the year 2000 based on accelerated recovery available
through resource adjustment clauses to customer rates, as discussed previously.
In addition to a potential write-off of regulatory assets and liabilities,
deregulation and competition (as discussed later) may require recognition of
certain "stranded costs" not recoverable under market pricing. NSP currently is




recovering its costs in all regulated jurisdictions and does not expect to write
off to expense any "stranded costs" unless and until market price levels change,
or unless cost levels increase above market price levels.

RATE FILINGS On Dec. 2, 1997, the Company filed a natural gas rate case seeking
an annual rate increase of approximately $18.5 million for retail customers in
Minnesota. An interim rate increase totaling $13.9 million on an annual basis
has been approved, subject to refund, effective Feb. 1, 1998.

On Nov. 14, 1997, the Wisconsin Company filed retail electric and natural gas
rate cases for Wisconsin customers requesting that the rate changes become
effective during the second quarter of 1998. The Wisconsin Company is seeking an
annual increase in retail electric rates of approximately $12.7 million and an
annual decrease in retail natural gas rates of approximately $1.7 million.

On February 17, 1998, NSP filed a rate application with the FERC to update its
rates for point to point transmission service. As filed, the proposed rates
increase annual transmission revenues by approximately $4 million. In addition,
the filing is expected to support reductions in NSP's NTS costs, as discussed
later.

COMPETITION The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the Act) has been a catalyst for
comprehensive and significant changes in the operation of electric utilities,
including increased competition. The Act's reform of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) promoted creation of wholesale nonutility power
generators and authorized the FERC to require utilities to provide wholesale
transmission services to third parties. The legislation allows utilities and
nonregulated companies to build, own and operate power plants nationally and
internationally without being subject to restrictions that previously applied to
utilities under the PUHCA. NSP plans to continue its efforts to be a
competitively priced supplier of electricity and an active participant in the
competitive market for electricity.

In 1996, the FERC issued Orders No. 888 and 889, which have had a significant
impact on wholesale electric markets by giving competitors the ability to
transmit electricity through utilities' transmission systems. Order No. 888
granted nondiscriminatory access to transmission service. Order No. 889 ensures
a fair market by imposing standards of conduct on transmission system owners, by
requiring separation of the wholesale power supply ("merchant") function from
the transmission system operation function and by mandating the posting of
transmission availability and pricing information on an electronic bulletin
board. These new open access rules became effective in 1996 and 1997. In 1997,
the FERC issued clarifying final orders in response to rehearing requests by
numerous market participants regarding Orders No. 888 and 889. These FERC
clarifying final orders are currently being appealed in federal court. NSP has
made transmission filings with the FERC and believes it is taking the proper
steps to comply with the new rules as they become effective. NSP continues to be
generally supportive of the FERC's efforts to increase competition.

In compliance with FERC Orders No. 888 and 889, NSP has separated personnel who
perform the merchant function, which includes power and energy marketing and
trading, from personnel who perform the transmission system operation function.
In 1997, NSP's merchant function, NSP Energy Marketing, expanded its power
trading to focus on new market opportunities created by open transmission
access. NSP is also developing risk management practices to respond to the
rapidly growing electric commodity market. In addition, a significant effort was
put forth in 1997 to enter current and all new requests for transmission service
into the electronic bulletin board, as directed by FERC Order No. 889 and
supported by NSP.

The FERC Order No. 888 requires utilities to offer, among other services,
Network Transmission Service (NTS) to qualifying customers. Under NTS, NSP and
other qualifying regional utilities share the total annual costs of operating
and maintaining the regional transmission network that NSP uses, net of related
network revenues, based on each company's share of the total network load. The
transmission tariff filed with the FERC is used as the cost basis for
FERC-regulated utilities in determining NTS rates. In 1997, NSP conducted a
review of information received from other participating utilities and commenced
settlement negotiations with these utilities regarding the final amount of NTS
costs to be paid by NSP for 1997. Based on this review and discussion, NSP
concluded that its net NTS costs for 1997 were less than the $27 million
previously estimated. NSP recorded a liability for what management believes is a
reasonable estimate of the net NTS costs for 1997. NSP expects that its
transmission tariff filing and settlement negotiations will result in lower NTS
costs in 1998.

Some states have begun to allow retail customers to choose their electricity
supplier, and many other states are considering retail access proposals. NSP
believes that retail competition will result in more innovative services and




lower prices for all consumers if the transition is managed in a thoughtful
manner. NSP supports fair and equal treatment for all competitors, recovery of
utilities' investments made under traditional regulation and a resolution of
property tax issues. NSP supports a plan that would take two or three years to
resolve these issues and develop infrastructure, and another two to three years
to phase in customers' choice. In 1997, the Minnesota Public Utilities
Commission (MPUC) approved a report by its staff that identifies issues that
must be resolved before retail competition can begin, but did not approve an
action plan or schedule for its implementation. The Minnesota Legislature began
studying the issues in 1997 and concluded that another year of study was
necessary before any action could be taken. The Public Service Commission of
Wisconsin (PSCW) revised its restructuring plan, delaying the start of retail
competition another year to 2002. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC)
approved a plan to begin offering a choice of suppliers to retail customers in
selected markets in 1998. That plan was unsuccessfully challenged by the
affected Michigan utilities, and the courts upheld the MPSC's authority to
implement retail competition. The timing of regulatory actions regarding
restructuring and their impact on NSP cannot be predicted at this time and may
be significant.

USED NUCLEAR FUEL STORAGE AND DISPOSAL In 1994, NSP received legislative
authorization from the state of Minnesota for the use of 17 casks for temporary
spent-fuel storage at the Company's Prairie Island nuclear generating facility.
Based on assumptions in the original Certificate of Need granted by the MPUC,
the Company previously estimated that 17 casks would allow operation of the
Prairie Island facility to continue to 2003. After review of the 1994
legislative authorization which amends the Certificate of Need, and through the
use of longer fuel cycles, the Company has determined 17 casks will allow
operation of the facility until 2007. The first nine casks have been authorized
by the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board (MEQB). The Company had loaded
seven of the casks as of Dec. 31, 1997. As a condition of the authorization, the
Minnesota Legislature established several resource commitments for the Company,
including wind and biomass generation sources, as well as other requirements.
The Company has taken steps to fulfill these requirements. The MEQB has
terminated an alternative siting process, which had been one of the original
legislative requirements.

Regarding permanent fuel storage, in 1996 the Company and other utilities were
successful in a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to compel it
to fulfill its statutory and contractual obligations to store and dispose of
used nuclear fuel as required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. In
January 1997, the Company, other utility parties and state parties filed another
lawsuit against the DOE, requesting authority to withhold payments to the DOE
for the permanent disposal program. In April 1997, the parties filed for
additional relief, asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
(the Court) to order the DOE to take spent nuclear fuel by Jan. 31, 1998. In
November, 1997, the Court, in a unanimous ruling, reiterated the unconditional
obligation for the DOE to begin acceptance of spent nuclear fuel by Jan. 31,
1998. The Court confirmed this obligation exists under both the statute and the
standard contract; however, the Court denied the Company's request for an order
directing the DOE to accept spent nuclear fuel by the Jan. 31, 1998 date in the
standard contract, finding that the contractual remedies under the standard
contract, i.e., damages, may be adequate. The Court also held that the DOE
cannot use its own delays or the unavailability of a permanent disposal or
temporary storage facility as defense to utilities' actions for damages.

In its November 1997 decision, the Court did not discuss the request to escrow
payments to the Nuclear Waste Fund. In December 1997, the DOE petitioned the
Court for rehearing. Based on the Court's ruling, NSP and other utilities are
currently analyzing claims against the DOE for the costs incurred as a result of
the DOE's failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations. However, it
is still unknown when the DOE actually will begin accepting used fuel.
Consequently, the Company continues to rely on interim on-site storage
facilities. Also, the Company is part of a consortium to establish a private
facility for interim storage of used nuclear fuel, the availability of which is
uncertain at this time. (See Notes 13 and 14 to the Financial Statements for
more information.)

TECHNOLOGY CHANGES FOR THE YEAR 2000 Like many other companies, NSP expects to
incur significant costs to modify or replace existing technology, including
computer software, for uninterrupted operation in the year 2000 and beyond. In
1996, NSP's Board of Directors approved funding to address development and
remediation efforts related to the year 2000. A committee made up of senior
management is leading NSP's initiatives to identify year 2000 related issues and
remediate business processes as necessary in 1998. Testing of computer software
modifications and other remediated processes is scheduled for 1999. NSP is also
working with major suppliers so that NSP does not experience business
interruptions due to year 2000 issues in the suppliers' business processes. The
amount of additional development and remediation costs necessary after 1997 for
NSP to prepare for the year




2000 is estimated to be approximately $20 million, expected mainly in 1998. In
1997 and 1996, NSP expensed approximately $2.3 million and $0.6 million,
respectively, for this modification effort.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS NSP incurs several types of environmental costs, including
nuclear plant decommissioning, storage and ultimate disposal of used nuclear
fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, remediation of contaminated
sites and monitoring of discharges into the environment. Because of the
continuing trend toward greater environmental awareness and increasingly
stringent regulation, NSP has been experiencing a trend toward increasing
environmental costs. This trend has caused, and may continue to cause, slightly
higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance.
In addition to nuclear decommissioning and used nuclear fuel disposal expenses
(as discussed in Note 13 to the Financial Statements), costs charged to NSP's
operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous
materials and wastes were approximately $31 million in 1997, $31 million in 1996
and $26 million in 1995, and are expected to average approximately $35 million
per year for the five-year period 1998-2002. However, the precise timing and
amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal
of hazardous materials, are currently unknown. In each of the years 1997, 1996
and 1995, the Company spent about $19 million, $10 million and $13 million,
respectively, for capital expenditures on environmental improvements at its
utility facilities. In 1998, the Company expects to incur approximately $18
million in capital expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations
and approximately $142 million for the five-year period 1998-2002. These capital
expenditure amounts include the costs of constructing used nuclear fuel storage
casks. (See Notes 13 and 14 to the Financial Statements for further discussion
of these and other environmental contingencies that could affect NSP.)

WEATHER NSP's earnings can be significantly affected by unusual weather. In
1997, warmer-than-normal weather late in the year decreased earnings over a
normal year by an estimated 11 cents per share. In 1996, colder-than-normal
weather during the heating season increased earnings over a normal year by an
estimated 16 cents per share. In 1995, unusual weather, mainly a hot summer,
increased earnings over a normal year by an estimated 21 cents per share. The
effect of weather is considered part of NSP's ongoing business operations.

IMPACT OF NONREGULATED INVESTMENTS A significant portion of NSP's earnings comes
from nonregulated operations, as discussed in the Results of Operations section.
NSP expects to continue investing in nonregulated projects, including domestic
and international power production projects through NRG, as described under
Future Financing Requirements. The nonregulated projects in which NRG has
invested carry a higher level of risk than NSP's traditional utility businesses.
Current investments in nonregulated projects are subject to competition,
operating risks, dependence on certain suppliers and customers, and domestic and
foreign environmental and energy regulations. Nonregulated project investments
also may be subject to partnership and government actions and foreign
government, political, economic and currency risks. Future nonregulated projects
will be subject to development risks, including uncertainties prior to final
legal closing, in addition to some or all of the previously identified risks.
Most of NRG's current project investments (as listed in Note 10 to the Financial
Statements) consist of minority interests, and a substantial portion of future
investments may take the form of minority interests, which may limit NRG's
financial risk and ability to control the development or operation of the
projects. In addition, significant expenses may be incurred for projects pursued
by NRG that do not materialize. The aggregate effect of these factors creates
the potential for volatility in the nonregulated component of NSP's earnings.
Accordingly, the historical operating results of NSP's nonregulated businesses
may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has proposed
new accounting standards that would require the full accrual of nuclear plant
decommissioning and certain other site exit obligations. Material adjustments to
NSP's balance sheet would occur upon implementation of the FASB's proposal,
which does not currently have a scheduled effective date. However, the effects
of regulation are expected to minimize or eliminate any impact on operating
expenses and earnings from this future accounting change. (For further
discussion of the expected impact of this change, see Note 13 to the Financial
Statements.)

USE OF DERIVATIVES Through its nonregulated subsidiaries, NSP uses derivative
financial instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and natural gas prices, and changes in interest rates on the cost
of borrowing. Also, to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with fixed
rate debt in a declining interest rate environment, NSP uses interest rate swap
agreements to convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. (See Notes 1 and 11
to the Financial Statements for further discussion of NSP's financial
instruments and derivatives.)




NONRECURRING ITEMS NSP's earnings for 1997 include two significant unusual or
infrequently occurring items. As discussed previously, NSP recorded a
nonrecurring charge of $29 million, or 25 cents per share, to write off costs
previously deferred as a result of the proposed merger with WEC. Also, as
discussed in the Nonregulated Business Results section, NRG wrote down a
cogeneration project, reducing income from nonregulated businesses before
interest and taxes by $9 million, or 8 cents per share.

NSP's earnings for 1995 include two significant unusual or infrequently
occurring items. As discussed in the Nonregulated Business Results section, NRG
recognized a pretax gain of approximately $30 million, or 26 cents per share,
from a power sales contract termination settlement. Partially offsetting this
gain was an asset impairment write-down of $5 million before taxes, or 4 cents
per share, for a nonregulated domestic energy project.

INFLATION Inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect
NSP's prices to customers or returns to shareholders.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

1997 FINANCING REQUIREMENTS NSP's need for capital funds primarily is related to
the construction of plant and equipment to meet the needs of electric and gas
utility customers and to fund equity commitments or other investments in
nonregulated businesses. Total NSP utility capital expenditures (including AFC)
were $397 million in 1997. Of that amount, $305 million related to replacements
and improvements of NSP's electric system and nuclear fuel, and $72 million
involved construction of natural gas distribution and transmission facilities.
NSP companies invested approximately $591 million in 1997 for equity interests
in and loans to nonregulated projects, for the acquisition of existing
businesses and for additions to nonregulated property. NRG invested in many
energy projects in 1997, including the $149 million purchase of PGC, and several
equity investments, the largest of which are listed in Note 10 to the Financial
Statements. Eloigne invested in affordable housing projects, including wholly
owned properties and limited partnership ventures.

1997 FINANCING ACTIVITY During 1997, NSP's sources of capital included
internally generated funds and external financings, as discussed later. The
allocation of financing requirements between these capital resources is based on
the relative cost of each resource, regulatory restrictions and the constraints
of NSP's long-range capital structure objectives.

Funds generated internally from operating cash flows in 1997 remained sufficient
to meet working capital needs, debt service, dividend payout requirements and
nonregulated investment commitments, as well as to fund a significant portion of
construction expenditures. NSP's objective pretax interest coverage ratio for
utility operations is 3.5 - 5.0. The utility pretax interest coverage ratio,
excluding AFC, was 3.6 in 1997, 4.4 in 1996, and 4.1 in 1995, which falls within
the objective range. Internally generated funds from utility operations could
have provided financing for more than 100 percent of NSP's utility capital
expenditures for 1997 and approximately 90 percent of the $1.9 billion in
utility capital expenditures incurred for the five-year period 1993-1997. The
pretax interest coverage ratio, excluding AFC, for all NSP operations was 2.8 in
1997, 3.7 in 1996 and 3.8 in 1995. The 1997 decline in the coverage ratio is due
to the unusual events that adversely affected NSP's earnings in 1997, as
discussed previously in the Results of Operations section, and issuance of new
debt by NRG, as discussed later.

NSP had approximately $260 million in short-term borrowings, including $122
million related to NRG, outstanding as of Dec. 31, 1997. Throughout 1997, the
Company used short-term borrowings to temporarily finance a portion of utility
capital expenditures and provide for other cash needs. NRG's line of credit
borrowings were used for the acquisition of PGC and other corporate purposes.

In the utility businesses, during 1997 NSP issued $200 million of 7.875 percent
preferred securities through a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary trust and
used the proceeds to redeem two preferred stock issues and reduce short-term
debt levels. The Company also collateralized $188 million of outstanding
pollution control bonds under its first mortgage indenture, and Viking issued
$14 million of long-term debt to finance an expansion project.

NSP's 1997 business acquisition, equity investments in nonregulated projects,
and construction expenditures were primarily financed through internally
generated funds and the issuance of debt by nonregulated subsidiaries. NRG
issued $250 million of 7.5 percent unsecured publicly traded Senior Notes in
1997 to support equity requirements for projects currently under way and in
development. The Senior Notes were assigned ratings of BBB- by S&P and




Baa3 by Moody's. Project financing requirements, in excess of equity
contributions from investors, were satisfied with project debt and loans from
NSP's nonregulated businesses (mainly NRG). Project debt associated with many of
NSP's nonregulated investments is not reflected in NSP's balance sheet because
the equity method of accounting is used for such investments. (See Note 10 to
the Financial Statements.) Loans made by NSP to nonregulated projects are
reflected separately on the balance sheet as Notes Receivable from Nonregulated
Projects.

During 1997, the Company issued 5.6 million shares of common stock. Of these
shares, 4.9 million were sold to a group of underwriters in September 1997 at an
offering price to the public of $49.5625 per share. The net proceeds to the
Company of $237 million were used for general corporate purposes, including the
retirement of $100 million of first mortgage bonds that matured Oct. 1, 1997,
expenditures for the Company's construction program and the repayment of
short-term borrowings. Of the remaining new shares, 0.3 million were issued
under the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRSPP), 0.2 million
were issued under the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) and 0.2 million were
issued under the Executive Long-Term Incentive Award Stock Plan.

FUTURE FINANCING REQUIREMENTS Utility financing requirements for 1998-2002 may
be affected in varying degrees by numerous factors, including load growth,
changes in capital expenditure levels, rate changes allowed by regulatory
agencies, new legislation, market entry of competing electric power generators,
changes in environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements. NSP
currently estimates that its utility capital expenditures will be $441 million
in 1998 and $2.1 billion for the five-year period 1998-2002. Of the 1998 amount,
approximately $371 million is scheduled for electric utility facilities and
approximately $49 million for natural gas facilities, including Viking. Approval
of the $1.25 billion Viking Voyageur Project, a proposed natural gas
transmission pipeline, would increase the total gas expenditures approximately
$500 million for the five-year period 1998-2002, with yearly expenditures
dependent on FERC approval. In addition to utility capital expenditures,
expected financing requirements for the five-year period 1998-2002 include
approximately $606 million to retire long-term debt and fund principal
maturities.

Through its subsidiaries, NSP expects to invest significant amounts in
nonregulated projects in the future. Financing requirements for nonregulated
project investments will vary depending on the success, timing and level of
involvement in projects currently under consideration. NSP's potential capital
requirements for nonregulated projects and property are estimated to be
approximately $310 million in 1998 and approximately $940 million for the
five-year period 1998-2002. These amounts include commitments for NRG
investments, as discussed in Note 14 to the Financial Statements, and Eloigne
investments of up to $11 million annually in 1998-2002 for affordable housing
projects. In addition to the estimated potential investments in nonregulated
projects as disclosed above, NSP continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance
shareholder returns and achieve long-term financial objectives through
investments in projects or acquisitions of existing businesses. These
investments could cause significant changes to the capital requirement estimates
for nonregulated projects and property. Long-term nonregulated financing may be
required for such investments.

The Company also will have future financing requirements for the portion of
nuclear plant decommissioning costs not funded externally. Based on the most
recent decommissioning study approved by regulators, these amounts are
anticipated to be approximately $363 million, and are expected to be paid during
the years 2010 to 2022.

FUTURE SOURCES OF FINANCING NSP expects to obtain external capital for future
financing requirements by periodically issuing long-term debt, short-term debt,
common stock and preferred securities as needed to maintain desired
capitalization ratios. Over the long term, NSP's equity investments in
nonregulated projects are expected to be financed at the nonregulated subsidiary
level, from internally generated funds or the issuance of subsidiary debt.
Financing requirements for the nonregulated projects, in excess of equity
contributions from project investors, are expected to be fulfilled through
project or subsidiary debt. In addition, to provide additional capital to NRG,
NSP is considering the public offering of up to 20 percent equity ownership of
NRG in late 1998 or 1999. Eloigne expects to finance approximately 60 percent of
its estimated five-year investments in affordable housing projects with equity
and approximately 40 percent with long-term debt. Decommissioning expenses not
funded by an external trust are expected to be financed through a combination of
internally generated funds, long-term debt and common stock. The extent of
external financing to be required for nuclear decommissioning costs, as
discussed above, is unknown at this time.

NSP's ability to finance its utility construction program at a reasonable cost
and to provide for other capital needs depends on its ability to meet investors'
return expectations. Financing flexibility is enhanced by providing working
capital needs and a high percentage of total capital requirements from internal
sources, and having the ability to




issue long-term securities and obtain short-term credit. NSP expects to maintain
adequate access to securities markets in 1998. Access to securities markets at a
reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. The Company's
first mortgage bonds are currently rated AA by Standard & Poor's Corporation,
Aa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., AA by Duff & Phelps, Inc., and AA by
Fitch Investors Service, Inc. Ratings for the Wisconsin Company's first mortgage
bonds are generally comparable. These ratings reflect the views of such
organizations, and an explanation of the significance of these ratings may be
obtained from each agency.

The Company's and the Wisconsin Company's first mortgage indentures limit the
amount of first mortgage bonds that may be issued. The MPUC and the PSCW have
jurisdiction over securities issuance. At Dec. 31, 1997, with an assumed
interest rate of 6.75 percent, the Company could have issued about $2.1 billion
of additional first mortgage bonds under its indenture, and the Wisconsin
Company could have issued about $351 million of additional first mortgage bonds
under its indenture.

The Company filed a shelf registration for first mortgage bonds with the SEC in
October 1995. Depending on capital market conditions, the Company expects to
issue the remaining $300 million of registered, but unissued, bonds over the
next several years to raise additional capital or redeem outstanding securities.

The Company's Board of Directors has approved short-term borrowing levels up to
10 percent of capitalization. The Company has received regulatory approval for
up to $575 million in short-term borrowing levels and plans to keep its credit
lines at or above its average level of commercial paper borrowings. Commercial
banks presently provide credit lines of $300 million to the Company and an
additional $245 million to subsidiaries of the Company, including a $175 million
unsecured revolving bank credit facility available to NRG. NSP credit lines make
short-term financing available in the form of bank loans, letters of credit and
support for commercial paper for utility operations.

The Company's Articles of Incorporation authorize the maximum amount of
preferred stock that may be issued. Under these provisions, the Company could
have issued all $500 million of its remaining authorized, but unissued,
preferred stock at Dec. 31, 1997, and remained in compliance with all interest
and dividend coverage requirements.

The Company's Articles of Incorporation authorize an additional 85.4 million
shares of common stock in excess of shares issued at Dec. 31, 1997. In 1996, the
Company filed a registration statement with the SEC to provide for the sale of
up to 1.6 million additional shares of new common stock under the Company's
DRSPP and Executive Long-Term Incentive Award Stock Plan. The Company may issue
new shares or purchase shares on the open market for its stock-based plans. (See
Note 3 to the Financial Statements for discussion of stock awards outstanding.)
The Company plans to issue new shares for its DRSPP, ESOP and Executive
Long-Term Incentive Award Stock plans in 1998. NSP currently has no plans for
any general offerings of common stock in 1998 or 1999.

Internally generated funds from utility operations are expected to equal
approximately 85 percent of anticipated utility capital expenditures for 1998
and approximately 95 percent of the $2.1 billion in anticipated utility capital
expenditures for the five-year period 1998-2002. Internally generated funds from
all operations are expected to equal approximately 60 percent and 85 percent of
the anticipated total capital requirements for 1998 and the five-year period
1998-2002, respectively. Because NSP has generally been reinvesting foreign cash
flows in operations outside the United States, the equity income from foreign
investments is not fully available to provide operating cash flows for domestic
cash requirements such as payment of NSP dividends, domestic capital
expenditures and domestic debt service. Through NRG, NSP is establishing a
diverse portfolio of foreign energy projects with varying levels of cash flows,
income and foreign taxation to allow maximum flexibility of foreign cash flows
in the future.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTS Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation (the
Company), is predominantly a regulated public utility serving customers in
Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. Northern States Power Company, a
Wisconsin corporation (the Wisconsin Company), a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, is a regulated public utility serving customers in Wisconsin and
Michigan. Another wholly owned subsidiary, Viking Gas Transmission Company
(Viking), is a regulated natural gas transmission company that operates a
500-mile interstate natural gas pipeline. Consequently, the Company, the
Wisconsin Company and Viking maintain accounting records in accordance with
either the uniform system of accounts prescribed by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) or those prescribed by state regulatory
commissions, whose systems are the same in all material respects.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include all
material companies in which the Company holds a controlling financial interest,
including: the Wisconsin Company; NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG); Viking; Energy Masters
International, Inc. (EMI), formerly Cenerprise, Inc.; and Eloigne Company
(Eloigne). The Company and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to herein
as NSP. As discussed in Note 10, NSP has investments in partnerships, joint
ventures and projects for which the equity method of accounting is applied.
Earnings from equity in international investments are recorded net of foreign
income taxes. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation except for intercompany and intersegment profits for
sales among the electric and gas utility businesses of the Company, the
Wisconsin Company and Viking, which are allowed in utility rates.

REVENUES Revenues are recognized based on products and services provided to
customers each month. Because utility customer meters are read and billed on a
cycle basis, unbilled revenues (and related energy costs) are estimated and
recorded for services provided from the monthly meter-reading dates to
month-end.

The Company's rate schedules, applicable to substantially all of its utility
customers, include cost-of-energy and resource adjustment clauses, under which
rates are adjusted to reflect changes in average costs of fuels, purchased
energy, purchased gas and, in Minnesota, conservation and energy management
program costs. As ordered by its primary regulator, Wisconsin Company retail
rate schedules include a cost-of-energy adjustment clause for purchased gas but
not for electric fuel and purchased energy. For Wisconsin electric operations
where cost-of-energy adjustment clauses are not used, the biennial retail rate
review process and an interim fuel cost hearing process provide the opportunity
for rate recovery of changes in electric fuel and purchased energy costs in lieu
of a cost-of-energy adjustment.

UTILITY PLANT AND RETIREMENTS Utility plant is stated at original cost. The cost
of additions to utility plant includes direct labor and materials, contracted
work, allocable overhead costs and allowance for funds used during construction.
The cost of units of property retired, plus net removal cost, is charged to the
accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and
replacement of items determined to be less than units of property are charged to
operating expenses.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION (AFC) AFC, a noncash item, is
computed by applying a composite pretax rate, representing the cost of capital
used to finance utility construction activities, to qualified Construction Work
in Progress (CWIP). The AFC rate was 5.75 percent in 1997, 5.5 percent in 1996
and 6.0 percent in 1995. The amount of AFC capitalized as a construction cost in
CWIP is credited to other income (for equity capital) and interest charges (for
debt capital). AFC amounts capitalized in CWIP are included in rate base for
establishing utility service rates. In addition to construction-related amounts,
AFC is also recorded to reflect returns on capital used to finance conservation
programs.

DEPRECIATION For financial reporting purposes, depreciation is computed by
applying the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of various
property classes. The Company files with the Minnesota Public Utilities
Commission (MPUC) an annual review of remaining lives for electric and gas
production properties. The most recent studies, as approved by the MPUC,
recommended immaterial changes in annual depreciation accruals for 1997 and
1996.




The Company also submitted in 1997, as required every five years, an average
service life filing for transmission, distribution and general properties. The
filing, as approved by the MPUC, decreased depreciation approximately $1 million
from 1996 levels. Depreciation provisions, as a percentage of the average
balance of depreciable utility property in service, were 3.78 percent in 1997,
3.68 percent in 1996 and 3.64 percent in 1995.

DECOMMISSIONING As discussed in Note 13, NSP currently is recording the future
costs of decommissioning the Company's nuclear generating plants through annual
depreciation accruals. The provision for the estimated decommissioning costs has
been calculated using an annuity approach designed to provide for full expense
accrual (with full rate recovery) of the future decommissioning costs, including
decontamination and removal, over the estimated operating lives of the Company's
nuclear plants. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has proposed new
accounting standards that would require the full accrual of nuclear plant
decommissioning and certain other site exit obligations beginning no sooner than
1999. (See Note 13 for more discussion of this proposed standard.)

NUCLEAR FUEL EXPENSE The original cost of nuclear fuel is amortized to fuel
expense based on energy expended. Nuclear fuel expense also includes assessments
from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for costs of future fuel disposal and
DOE facility decommissioning, as discussed in Note 13.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Accruals for environmental costs are recognized when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can
be reasonably estimated. Costs are charged to expense if they relate to the
remediation of conditions caused by past operations, or if they are not expected
to mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. Costs may be
deferred as a regulatory asset based on expected recovery in future rates. Where
environmental expenditures relate to facilities currently in use, such as
pollution control equipment, the costs may be capitalized and depreciated over
the future service periods. Estimated remediation costs are recorded at
undiscounted amounts, independent of any insurance or rate recovery, based on
prior experience, assessments and current technology. Accrued obligations are
regularly adjusted as environmental assessments and estimates are revised, and
remediation efforts proceed. For sites where NSP has been designated as one of
several potentially responsible parties, the amount accrued represents NSP's
estimated share of the cost. NSP intends to treat any future costs incurred
related to decommissioning and restoration of its nonnuclear power plants and
substation sites, where operation may extend indefinitely, as a capitalized
removal cost of retirement in utility plant. Depreciation expense levels
currently recovered in rates include a provision for an estimate of removal
costs, based on historical experience.

INCOME TAXES Under the liability method used by NSP, income taxes are deferred
for all temporary differences between pretax financial and taxable income and
between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using the tax rates
scheduled by law to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Due to
the effects of regulation, current income tax expense is provided for the
reversal of some temporary differences previously accounted for by the
flow-through method. Also, regulation has created certain regulatory assets and
liabilities related to income taxes, as summarized in Note 9. NSP's policy for
income taxes related to international operations is discussed in Note 7.

Investment tax credits were deferred and are being amortized over the estimated
lives of the related property.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The local currencies are generally the functional
currency of NSP's foreign operations. Foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates of exchange. Income, expense
and cash flows are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange for the
period. The resulting currency translation adjustments are accumulated and
reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. During 1997, the
effects of changes in currency exchange rates on NRG's international project
investments, mainly in Australia, reduced equity by $66 million.

Exchange gains and losses that result from foreign currency transactions (e.g.,
converting cash distributions made in one currency to another) and derivative
arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting (see Note 11) are included
in the results of operations as a component of income from nonregulated
businesses before interest and taxes. The earnings impact of these items was not
material to NSP's results for the periods presented.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NSP's policy is to hedge projected foreign
currency denominated cash flows, where appropriate hedging instruments are
available, to preserve their U.S. dollar value. NRG has entered into currency
hedging transactions through the use of forward foreign currency exchange
agreements with terms of less than one to three years. Gains and losses on these
agreements offset the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on
NRG's known and anticipated cash flows. Gains on agreements that hedge firm
commitments of




cash flows are deferred and included in the measurement of the related foreign
currency transaction in the period the transaction occurs, and losses on these
agreements are deferred in the same manner unless it is estimated that deferral
would lead to recognizing losses in later periods. Gains and losses on
agreements that hedge cash flows not meeting the criteria of a firm commitment
are recorded in the current period as a component of NSP's nonregulated income
before interest and taxes. Prior to July 1997, NSP's policy was to hedge foreign
currency denominated investments as they were made, where appropriate hedging
instruments were available, to preserve their U.S. dollar value. Gains and
losses on these agreements offset the effects of foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations on the valuation of the investments underlying the hedges. Hedging
gains and losses, net of income tax effects, on these agreements were reported
with other currency translation adjustments as a separate component of
stockholders' equity. While NRG is not currently hedging foreign currency
denominated investments, NRG will hedge such investments when management
believes that preserving the U.S. dollar value of the investment is appropriate.
NRG is not hedging currency translation adjustments related to future operating
results. NRG does not speculate in foreign currencies.

Where appropriate, NRG also uses interest rate hedging instruments to protect
against increases in the cost of borrowing at both the corporate and project
level. Gains and losses on interest rate hedging instruments are deferred and
included in the measurement of the underlying equity investment when made.

Another derivative arrangement is the use of natural gas futures contracts by
EMI to manage the risk of gas price fluctuations. The cost or benefit of natural
gas futures contracts is recorded when related sales commitments are fulfilled
as a component of EMI's nonregulated operating expenses. NSP does not speculate
in natural gas futures. A final derivative instrument used by NSP is interest
rate swaps that convert fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. The cost or
benefit of the interest rate swap agreements is recorded as a component of
interest expense. None of these derivative financial instruments are reflected
on NSP's balance sheet.

USE OF ESTIMATES In recording transactions and balances resulting from business
operations, NSP uses estimates based on the best information available.
Estimates are used for such items as plant depreciable lives, tax provisions,
uncollectible accounts, environmental costs, unbilled revenues and actuarially
determined benefit costs. As better information becomes available, or actual
amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently,
operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.
The depreciable lives of certain plant assets are reviewed and, if appropriate,
revised each year, as discussed previously.

CASH EQUIVALENTS NSP considers investments in certain debt instruments,
primarily commercial paper and money market funds, with an original maturity to
NSP of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

REGULATORY DEFERRALS As regulated utilities, the Company, the Wisconsin Company
and Viking account for certain income and expense items under the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71---Accounting for the
Effects of Regulation. In doing so, certain costs that would otherwise be
charged to expense are deferred as regulatory assets based on expected recovery
from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain credits that otherwise would
be reflected as income are deferred as regulatory liabilities based on expected
flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery of
deferred costs and expected flowback of deferred credits are generally based on
specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each item. Regulatory assets and
liabilities are amortized consistent with ratemaking treatment established by
regulators. Note 9 describes the nature and amounts of these regulatory
deferrals.

STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION NSP has several stock-based compensation
plans, as described in Note 3. Under the intrinsic-value-based method of
accounting followed by NSP, no compensation expense is recorded for stock
options because there is no difference between the market price and purchase
price at the grant date, which is the measurement date for determining
compensation expense. NSP does, however, record compensation expense for stock
that is awarded to certain employees, but held by NSP until the restrictions
lapse or the stock is forfeited. Effective for 1996, the FASB issued a new
accounting standard, SFAS No. 123---Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
which provides an optional accounting method for compensation from stock option
and other stock award programs. NSP did not elect the new optional accounting
method. If the provisions of the optional method had been adopted as of the
beginning of 1995, the effect on net income and earnings per share for 1997,
1996 and 1995 would have been immaterial.




DEVELOPMENT COSTS As it pursues projects under development, NRG expenses
development costs incurred until a sales agreement or letter of intent is signed
and the project has received capital authorization. Additional costs incurred
after this point are capitalized as part of equity investments in projects. When
project operations begin, such capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the project's related assets
or revenue contract period.

OTHER ASSETS The purchase of various nonregulated entities at a price exceeding
the underlying fair value of net assets acquired has resulted in recorded
goodwill of $43 million ($38 million net of accumulated amortization) at Dec.
31, 1997. This goodwill and other intangible assets acquired are being amortized
using the straight-line method over periods of three to 30 years. NSP
periodically evaluates the recovery of goodwill based on an analysis of
estimated undiscounted future cash flows.

Intangible and other assets also include deferred financing costs (net of
amortization) of approximately $22 million at Dec. 31, 1997. These financing
costs are being amortized over the remaining maturity period of the related
debt.

RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1996 and 1995
income statements to conform to 1997 presentation. These classifications had no
effect on net income or earnings per share.

2. Preferred Securities

The Company has two series of adjustable rate preferred stock. The dividend
rates are calculated quarterly and are based on prevailing rates of certain
taxable government debt securities indices. At Dec. 31, 1997, the annualized
dividend rates were $5.50 for both series A and series B.

At Dec. 31, 1997, various preferred stock series were callable at prices per
share ranging from $100.00 to $103.75, plus accrued dividends.

In January 1997, a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary trust of NSP issued
$200 million in 7.875 percent preferred securities that mature in 2037. A
portion of the proceeds was used to redeem the Company's $6.80 and $7.00 series
of preferred stock in February 1997. Distributions paid to preferred security
holders are reflected as a financing cost in the Consolidated Statement of
Income along with interest expense. Distributions paid by the subsidiary trust
on the preferred securities are financed through interest payments from the
Company on debentures issued by the Company and held by the subsidiary trust,
which are eliminated in NSP's consolidation. The preferred securities are
redeemable at $25 per share beginning in 2002. Distributions and redemption
payments are guaranteed by NSP.

3. Common Stock and Incentive Stock Plans

The Company's Articles of Incorporation and First Mortgage Indenture provide for
certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends on common stock. At Dec.
31, 1997, the Company could have paid, without restrictions, additional cash
dividends of more than $1 billion on common stock.

Nonqualified stock options and restricted stock may be granted under NSP's
Executive Long-Term Incentive Award Stock Plan. The awards granted in any
calendar year cannot exceed 1 percent of the number of outstanding shares of NSP
common stock at the end of the previous calendar year. When options are
exercised, or restricted stock granted, the Company may either issue new shares
or purchase market shares. Using the treasury stock method of accounting for
stock options unexercised, the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding for the calculation of Earnings Per Share - Assuming Dilution
includes any dilutive effects of stock options and other stock awards as
potential common shares.

Stock options currently granted may be exercised one year from the date of grant
and are exercisable thereafter for up to nine years. The options are forfeited
if employment ceases before the one-year vesting term. If employment ceases
after the one-year vesting term, options will either be forfeited, or would need
to be exercised within three or 36 months, depending on the circumstances. The
exercise price of an option is the market price of NSP common stock on the date
of grant. The plan, in previous years, granted other types of performance
awards, some of which are still outstanding. Most of these performance awards
were valued in dollars, but paid in shares based on the market price at the time
of payment. Transactions under the various incentive stock programs, with the
corresponding weighted average exercise price, were as follows:




Stock Option and Performance Awards



The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at
Dec. 31, 1997:

                                                      Range of Exercise Prices
                                                   -----------------------------
                                                   $33.25-40.94     $42.19-50.94
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Options Outstanding:
  Number outstanding at Dec. 31, 1997                   170 346       923 517
  Weighted-average remaining contractual life (years)       3.1           7.4
  Weighted-average exercise price                        $37.15        $46.60
Options Exercisable:
  Number exercisable at Dec. 31, 1997                   170 346       663 156
  Weighted-average exercise price                        $37.15        $46.27

In addition to stock options, restricted stock is granted based on a dollar
value of the award. The market price on the date of grant is used to determine
the number of restricted shares awarded. The stock is held by NSP until the
restrictions lapse: 50 percent of the stock will vest one year from the date of
the award and the remaining 50 percent vests two years from the date of the
award. Dividends on the shares held while the restrictions are in place are
reinvested to obtain additional shares, and the restrictions apply to these
additional shares. In each of the years 1995 through 1997, NSP granted
restricted stock awards of 15,898, 18,584 and 26,344 shares, respectively, at
then-current market prices of NSP stock. Compensation expense related to these
awards was immaterial.

4. Short-Term Borrowings

As of Dec. 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company had a $300 million revolving credit
facility under a commitment fee arrangement. This facility provides short-term
financing in the form of bank loans, letters of credit and support for
commercial paper sales. There were no borrowings against this facility at Dec.
31, 1997 and 1996. At Dec. 31, 1997 and 1996, credit lines of $245 million and
$75 million, respectively, were provided primarily by commercial banks to wholly
owned subsidiaries of the Company. There were $122 million and approximately $4
million in outstanding loans against these subsidiary credit lines at Dec. 31,
1997 and 1996, respectively. In addition, at Dec. 31, 1997 and 1996, $49 million
and $21 million, respectively, in letters of credit were outstanding (as
discussed in Note 11), which reduced the available credit lines.

At Dec. 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company had $138 million and $362 million,
respectively, in short-term commercial paper borrowings outstanding, and another
$122 million and $7 million, respectively, in short-term bank loans outstanding,
mainly for nonregulated subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rates on all
short-term borrowings were 6.2 percent as of Dec. 31, 1997, and 5.7 percent as
of Dec. 31, 1996.

5. Long-Term Debt

Except for minor exclusions, all real and personal property of the Company and
the Wisconsin Company is subject to the liens of the First Mortgage Indentures.
Other debt securities are secured by a lien on the related property, as
indicated on the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization.

The annual sinking-fund requirements of the Company's and the Wisconsin
Company's First Mortgage Indentures are the amounts necessary to redeem 1
percent of the highest principal amount of each series of first mortgage bonds
at any time outstanding, excluding those series issued for pollution control and
resource recovery financings, and excluding certain other series totaling $1
billion. The Company may, and has, applied property additions in lieu of cash
payments on all series, as permitted by its First Mortgage Indenture. The
Wisconsin Company also may apply property additions in lieu of cash on all
series as permitted by its First Mortgage Indenture.




The Company's 2011 and 2019 series First Mortgage Bonds have variable interest
rates, which currently change at various periods up to 270 days, based on
prevailing rates for certain commercial paper securities or similar issues. The
interest rates applicable to these issues averaged 4.0 percent and 3.8 percent,
respectively, at Dec. 31, 1997. The 2011 series bonds are redeemable upon seven
days notice at the option of the bondholder. The Company also is potentially
liable for repayment of the 2019 series when the bonds are tendered, which
occurs each time the variable interest rates change. The principal amount of all
of these variable rate bonds outstanding represents potential short-term
obligations and, therefore, is reported under current liabilities on the balance
sheet.

Maturities and sinking-fund requirements on long-term debt (in millions) are:
1998, $22.8; 1999, $217.3; 2000, $122.4; 2001, $167.8; and 2002, $76.6.

6. Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

NSP offers the following benefit plans to its benefit employees, of whom
approximately 40 percent are represented by five local labor unions under a
collective-bargaining agreement, which expires Dec. 31, 1999.

PENSION BENEFITS NSP has a noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan that
covers substantially all employees. Benefits are based on a combination of years
of service, the employee's highest average pay for 48 consecutive months and
Social Security benefits.

NSP's policy is to fully fund into an external trust the actuarially determined
pension costs recognized for ratemaking and financial reporting purposes,
subject to the limitations under applicable employee benefit and tax laws. Plan
assets principally consist of common stock of public companies, corporate bonds
and U.S. government securities. The funded status of NSP's pension plan as of
Dec. 31 is as follows:

(Thousands of dollars)                                       1997          1996

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Net pension asset (liability) recorded                  $(5 338)       $8 702
===============================================================================

For ratemaking purposes, the Company's pension costs are determined and recorded
under the aggregate-cost actuarial method. As required by SFAS No.
87---Employers' Accounting for Pensions, the difference between the pension
costs recorded for ratemaking purposes and the amounts determined under SFAS No.
87 is recorded as a regulatory liability on the balance sheet. Net annual
periodic pension cost includes the following components:



The weighted average discount rate used in determining the actuarial present
value of the projected obligation was 7 percent for Dec. 31, 1997 and 7.5
percent for Dec. 31, 1996. The rate of increase in future compensation levels
used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected obligation was
5 percent in 1997 and 1996. The assumed long-term rate of return on assets used
for cost determinations under SFAS No. 87 was 9 percent for




1997, 1996 and 1995. Assumption changes decreased 1997 pension costs (determined
under SFAS No. 87) by approximately $6.9 million and increased 1996 costs by
approximately $12.6 million. However, because the Company's pension expense is
determined under the aggregate-cost method (not SFAS No. 87) for ratemaking and
financial reporting purposes, the effects of regulation prevented the majority
of assumption changes from affecting earnings.

401(k) NSP has a contributory, defined contribution Retirement Savings Plan,
which complies with section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and covers
substantially all employees. Since 1994, NSP has been matching specified amounts
of employee contributions to this plan. NSP's matching contributions were $4.4
million in 1997, $4.3 million in 1996 and $3.7 million in 1995.

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE NSP has a contributory health and welfare benefit
plan that provides health care and death benefits to substantially all employees
after their retirement. The plan is intended to provide for sharing the costs of
retiree health care between NSP and retirees. For employees retiring after Jan.
1, 1994, a six-year cost-sharing strategy was implemented with retirees paying
15 percent of the total cost of health care in 1994, increasing to a total of 40
percent in 1999. In conjunction with the 1993 adoption of SFAS No.
106-Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, NSP
elected to amortize on a straight-line basis over 20 years the unrecognized
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) of $215.6 million for
current and future retirees.

Before 1993, NSP funded payments for retiree benefits internally. While NSP
generally prefers to continue using internal funding of benefits paid and
accrued, significant levels of external funding, including the use of
tax-advantaged trusts, have been required by NSP's regulators, as discussed
later. Plan assets held in such trusts principally consist of investments in
equity mutual funds and cash equivalents. The funded status of NSP's retiree
health care plan as of Dec. 31 is as follows:

(Thousands of dollars)                                  1997            1996

Net benefit liability recorded                        $83 338        $ 68 222
=============================================================================

The assumed health care cost trend rates used in measuring the APBO at Dec. 31,
1997 and 1996, were 9.2 percent and 9.8 percent for those under age 65, and 6.8
percent and 7.1 percent for those age 65 and over, respectively. The assumed
cost trend rates are expected to decrease each year until they reach 5.5 percent
for both age groups in the year 2004, after which they are assumed to remain
constant. A 1 percent increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for
each year would increase the APBO by approximately 14.5 percent as of Dec. 31,
1997. Service and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement
cost would increase by approximately 15.4 percent with a similar 1 percent
increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate. The assumed discount rate
used in determining the APBO was 7 percent for Dec. 31, 1997, and 7.5 percent
for Dec. 31, 1996, compounded annually. The assumed long-term rate of return on
assets used for cost determinations under SFAS No. 106 was 8 percent for 1997,
1996 and 1995. Assumption changes decreased costs by approximately $4.0 million
in 1997 and approximately $2.0 million in 1996.




The net annual periodic postretirement benefit cost recorded consists of the
following components:



Regulators for nearly all of NSP's retail and wholesale customers have allowed
full recovery of increased benefit costs under SFAS No. 106, effective in 1993.
Increased 1993 accrual costs of approximately $12 million for Minnesota retail
customers were amortized over the years 1994 through 1996, consistent with
approved rate recovery. External funding was required by Minnesota and Wisconsin
retail regulators to the extent it is tax advantaged; funding began for
Wisconsin in 1993 and will begin in 1998 for Minnesota. For wholesale
ratemaking, the FERC has required external funding for all benefits paid and
accrued under SFAS No. 106 since 1993.

ESOP NSP has a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) that covers
substantially all employees. Employer contributions to this non-contributory,
defined contribution plan are generally made to the extent NSP realizes a tax
savings on its income statement from dividends paid on certain shares held by
the ESOP. Contributions to the ESOP in 1997, 1996 and 1995, which represent
compensation expense, were $4.4 million, $4.6 million and $5.0 million,
respectively. ESOP contributions have no material effect on NSP earnings because
the contributions (net of tax) are essentially offset by the tax savings
provided by the dividends paid on ESOP shares. Leveraged shares held by the ESOP
are allocated to participants when dividends on stock held by the plan are used
to repay ESOP loans. NSP's ESOP held 5.6 million and 5.9 million shares of the
Company's common stock as of Dec. 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. An average of
0.3 million, 0.2 million and 0.2 million uncommitted leveraged ESOP shares were
excluded from earnings-per-share calculations in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. The fair value of NSP's leveraged ESOP shares was approximately
the same as cost at Dec. 31, 1997 and 1996.




7. Income Taxes

Total income tax expense from operations differs from the amount computed by
applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before income tax
expense. The reasons for the difference are as follows:



Income before income taxes includes net foreign equity income of $27 million,
$28 million and $32 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Except to the
extent NSP's earnings from foreign operations are subject to current U.S. income
taxes, NSP's management intends to reinvest indefinitely such earnings in its
foreign operations. Accordingly, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes
have not been provided on a cumulative amount of unremitted earnings of foreign
subsidiaries of approximately $112 million at Dec. 31, 1997. The additional U.S.
income tax and foreign withholding tax on the unremitted foreign earnings, if
repatriated, would be offset in whole or in part by foreign tax credits. Thus,
it is impracticable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable.




The components of NSP's net deferred tax liability (current and noncurrent
portions) at Dec. 31 were:

Administrative and general (A&G) expense for utility operations consists of the
following:



Income from nonregulated businesses consists of the following:



* Includes nonrecurring project write-downs of $9 million in 1997 and $5 million
  in 1995

The following summarizes the individual components of unamortized regulatory
assets and liabilities shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at Dec. 31:



* Earns a return on investment in the ratemaking process

10. Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method

Through its nonregulated subsidiaries, NSP has investments in various
international and domestic energy projects and domestic affordable housing and
real estate projects. The equity method of accounting is applied to such
investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and partnerships,
because the ownership structure prevents NSP from exercising a controlling
influence over operating and financial policies of the projects. Under this
method, equity in the pretax income or losses of domestic partnerships and in
the net income or losses of international projects is reflected as Equity in
Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates. A summary of NSP's significant
equity-method investments is as follows:



  *Acquired in 1997

11. Financial Instruments

FAIR VALUES The estimated Dec. 31 fair values of NSP's recorded financial
instruments are as follows:



For cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, the carrying amount
approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The
fair values of the Company's long-term investments, mainly debt securities in an
external nuclear decommissioning fund, are estimated based on quoted market
prices for those or similar investments. The fair value of NSP's long-term debt
is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues,
or the current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities and credit
quality.

DERIVATIVES NRG has entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts
with counterparties to hedge certain exposures to currency fluctuations.
Pursuant to these contracts, transactions have been executed that are designed
to protect the economic value in U.S. dollars of selected known and anticipated
NRG cash flows denominated in Australian dollars and German deutsche marks. As
of Dec. 31, 1997, NRG had in place contracts with a notional value of $10
million to hedge foreign currency denominated known future cash flows. In
addition, NRG has in place forward foreign currency exchange contracts with a
net notional value of $8.6 million to hedge projected construction expenditures,
which do not qualify for hedge accounting and consequently result in currency
fluctuations that can affect earnings. The effect on 1997 earnings from these
contracts was immaterial. The forward foreign currency exchange contracts
terminate in 1998. If all of the contracts had been terminated at Dec. 31, 1997,
$1.0 million would have been payable by NRG for currency exchange rate changes
to date. Management believes NRG's exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance
by the counterparties to its forward exchange contracts is not significant,
based on the investment grade rating of the counterparties.




NRG also has two agreements in place, with a notional amount of $80 million, to
fix the interest rate at a rate based on U.S. Treasury obligations for known
future borrowings related to project investment commitments. If the agreements
had been terminated at Dec. 31, 1997, $4.2 million would have been payable by
NRG based on the underlying U.S. Treasury interest rate on that date.

EMI has entered into natural gas futures contracts in the notional amount of $23
million at Dec. 31, 1997. The original contract terms range from one month to
two years. The contracts are intended to mitigate risk from fluctuations in the
price of natural gas that will be required to satisfy sales commitments for
future deliveries to customers in excess of EMI's natural gas reserves. EMI's
futures contracts hedge $24 million in anticipated natural gas sales in
1998-1999. Margin balances of $3 million at Dec. 31, 1997, were maintained on
deposit with brokers and recorded as cash and cash equivalents on NSP's balance
sheet. The counterparties to the futures contracts are the New York Mercantile
Exchange, investment banks and major gas pipeline operators. Management believes
that the risk of nonperformance by these counterparties is not significant. If
the contracts had been terminated at Dec. 31, 1997, $0.7 million would have been
payable by EMI for natural gas price fluctuations to date.

NSP has two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $220
million. These swaps were entered into in conjunction with first mortgage bonds.
As summarized below, these agreements effectively convert the interest costs of
these debt issues from fixed to variable rates based on the six-month London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), with the rates changing semiannually.

                                                   Term of        Net Effective
                          Notional Amount           Swap       Interest Cost at
     Series               (millions of dollars)   Agreement     at Dec. 31, 1997
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5 1/2% Series due Feb. 1, 1999      $200             Maturity          5.49%
7 1/4% Series due March 1, 2023     $ 20        March 1, 1998          7.96%

Market risks associated with these agreements result from short-term interest
rate fluctuations. Credit risk related to nonperformance of the counterparties
is not deemed significant, but would result in NSP terminating the swap
transaction and recognizing a gain or loss, depending on the fair market value
of the swap. The interest rate swaps serve to hedge the market risk associated
with fixed rate debt in a declining interest rate environment. This hedge is
produced by the tendency for changes in the fair market value of the swap to be
offset by changes in the present value of the liability attributable to the
fixed rate debt issued in conjunction with the interest rate swaps. If the
interest rate swaps had been discontinued on Dec. 31, 1997, $0.6 million would
have been payable by the Company, while the present value of the related fixed
rate debt was $0.6 million below carrying value.

LETTERS OF CREDIT NSP uses letters of credit to provide financial guarantees for
certain operating obligations, including NSP workers' compensation benefits and
ash disposal site costs, and EMI natural gas purchases, generally with terms of
one year which are automatically renewed, unless prior written notice of
cancellation is provided to NSP and the beneficiary by the issuing bank. In
addition, NRG uses letters of credit for nonregulated equity commitments, as
collateral for credit agreements, for fuel purchase and operating commitments
and bids on development projects. At Dec. 31, 1997, letters of credit of $101
million were outstanding, of which $48 million related to NRG commitments. The
contract amounts of these letters of credit approximate their fair value and are
subject to fees competitively determined in the marketplace.

12. Joint Plant Ownership

The Company is a part owner of an 855-megawatt coal-fired electric generating
unit, Sherburne County generating station unit No. 3 (Sherco 3), which began
commercial operation Nov. 1, 1987. Undivided interests in Sherco 3 have been
financed and are owned by the Company (59 percent) and Southern Minnesota
Municipal Power Agency (41 percent). The Company is the operating agent under
the joint ownership agreement. The Company's share of related expenses for
Sherco 3 since commercial operations began are included in Utility Operating
Expenses. The Company's share of the gross cost recorded in Utility Plant at
Dec. 31, 1997 and 1996, was $603.9 million and $588.0 million, respectively. The
corresponding accumulated provisions for depreciation were $196.2 million and
$168.6 million.




13. Nuclear Obligations

FUEL DISPOSAL NSP is responsible for the temporary storage of used nuclear fuel
from the Company's nuclear generating plants. Under a contract with the Company,
the DOE is obligated to assume the responsibility for permanent storage or
disposal of NSP's used nuclear fuel. The Company has been funding its portion of
the DOE's permanent disposal program since 1981. Funding took place through an
internal sinking fund until 1983, when the DOE began assessing fuel disposal
fees under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 based on a charge of 0.1 cent
per kilowatt-hour sold to customers from nuclear generation. Fuel expense
includes DOE fuel disposal assessments of $10.1 million, $11.3 million and $12.3
million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The cumulative amount of such
assessments paid by NSP to the DOE through Dec. 31, 1997, was approximately $250
million. Currently, it is not determinable if the amount and method of the DOE's
assessments to all utilities will be sufficient to fully fund the DOE's
permanent storage or disposal facility.

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act stipulated that the DOE execute contracts with
utilities that require DOE to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel no later than
Jan. 31, 1998. Accordingly, NSP has been providing, with regulatory and
legislative approval, its own temporary on-site storage facilities at its
Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants. In December 1996, the DOE notified
commercial spent fuel owners of an anticipated delay in accepting used nuclear
fuel by the required date of Jan. 31, 1998, and conceded that a permanent
storage or disposal facility will not be available until at least 2010.

The Company and other affected parties have commenced lawsuits against the DOE
to require the DOE to meet its statutory and contractual obligations, which can
include damages for nonperformance. NSP and other utilities are currently
analyzing claims against the DOE for the costs incurred as a result of the DOE's
failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations. With the dry cask
storage facilities approved in 1994 for the Prairie Island nuclear generating
plant, the Company believes it has adequate storage capacity to continue
operation of its Prairie Island nuclear plant until at least 2007. The
Monticello nuclear plant has storage capacity to continue operations until 2010.
Storage availability to permit operation beyond these dates is not assured at
this time. In the meantime, NSP is investigating all of its alternatives for
used fuel storage until a DOE facility is available, including pursuing the
establishment of a private facility for interim storage of used nuclear fuel as
part of a consortium of electric utilities. If on-site temporary storage at
NSP's nuclear plants reaches approved capacity, the Company could seek interim
storage at this or another contracted private facility, if available.

Nuclear fuel expenses in 1997, 1996 and 1995 include about $4 million, $4
million and $5 million, respectively, for payments to the DOE for the
decommissioning and decontamination of the DOE's uranium enrichment facilities.
The DOE's initial assessment of $46 million to the Company was recorded in 1993.
This assessment will be payable in annual installments from 1993-2008 and each
installment is being amortized to expense on a monthly basis in the 12 months
following each payment. The most recent installment paid in 1997 was $3.9
million; future installments are subject to inflation adjustments under DOE
rules. The Company is obtaining rate recovery of these DOE assessments through
the cost-of-energy adjustment clause as the assessments are amortized.
Accordingly, the unamortized assessment of $38 million at Dec. 31, 1997, has
been deferred as a regulatory asset and is reported under the caption
Environmental Costs in Note 9.

PLANT DECOMMISSIONING Decommissioning of all Company nuclear facilities is
planned for the years 2010-2022, using the prompt dismantlement method. The
Company currently is following industry practice by ratably accruing the costs
for decommissioning over the approved cost recovery period and including the
accruals in Utility Plant---Accumulated Depreciation, as discussed in Note 1.
Consequently, the total decommissioning cost obligation and corresponding asset
currently are not recorded in NSP's financial statements. The FASB has proposed
new accounting standards, which, if approved, would require the full accrual of
nuclear plant decommissioning and certain other site exit obligations no sooner
than 1999. Using Dec. 31, 1997, estimates, NSP's adoption of the proposed
accounting would result in the recording of the total discounted decommissioning
obligation of $698 million as a liability, with the corresponding costs
capitalized as plant and other assets and depreciated over the operating life of
the plant. The obligation calculation methodology proposed by the FASB is
slightly different from the ratemaking methodology that derives the
decommissioning accruals currently being recovered in rates, as discussed later.
The Company has not yet determined the potential impact of the FASB's proposed
changes in the accounting for site exit obligations other than nuclear
decommissioning (such as costs of removal). However, the ultimate
decommissioning and site exit costs to be accrued are the same under both
methods and, accordingly, the effects of regulation are expected to minimize or
eliminate any impact on operating expenses and results of operations from this
future accounting change.




Consistent with cost recovery in utility customer rates, the Company records
annual decommissioning accruals based on periodic site-specific cost studies and
a presumed level of dedicated funding. Cost studies quantify decommissioning
costs in current dollars. Since the costs are expected to be paid in 2010-2022,
funding presumes that current costs will escalate in the future at a rate of 4.5
percent per year. The total estimated decommissioning costs that will ultimately
be paid, net of income earned by external trust funds, is currently being
accrued using an annuity approach over the approved plant recovery period. This
annuity approach uses an assumed rate of return on funding, which is currently 6
percent (net of tax) for external funding and approximately 8 percent (net of
tax) for internal funding.

The total obligation for decommissioning currently is expected to be funded
approximately 82 percent by external funds and 18 percent by internal funds, as
approved by the MPUC. Rate recovery of internal funding began in 1971 through
depreciation rates for removal expense, and was changed to a sinking fund
recovery in 1981. Contributions to the external fund started in 1990 and are
expected to continue until plant decommissioning begins. Costs not funded by
external trust assets, including accumulated earnings, will be funded through
internally generated funds and issuance of Company debt or stock. The assets
held in trusts as of Dec. 31, 1997, primarily consisted of investments in fixed
income securities, such as tax-exempt municipal bonds and U.S. government
securities, which mature in two to 26 years, and common stock of public
companies. The Company plans to reinvest matured securities until
decommissioning commences.

At Dec. 31, 1997, the Company has recorded and recovered in rates cumulative
decommissioning accruals of $465 million. The following table summarizes the
funded status of the Company's decommissioning obligation at Dec. 31, 1997:



Decommissioning expenses recognized include the following components:



Decommissioning and interest accruals are included with the accumulated
provision for depreciation on the balance sheet. Interest costs and trust
earnings associated with externally funded obligations are reported in Other
Utility Income and Deductions on the income statement.

The MPUC last approved a nuclear decommissioning study and related nuclear plant
depreciation capital recovery request in April 1997, using cost data from the
1993 study. Although management expects to operate the Prairie Island units
through the end of each unit's licensed life, the approved capital recovery
would allow for the plant to be fully depreciated, including the accrual and
recovery of decommissioning costs, in 2008, about six years earlier than the end
of each unit's licensed life. The approved recovery period for Prairie Island
has been reduced because of the uncertainty regarding used fuel storage, as
discussed previously. The Company believes future decommissioning cost accruals
will continue to be recovered in customer rates.




14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

CAPITAL COMMITMENTS NSP estimates utility capital expenditures, including
acquisitions of nuclear fuel, will be $441 million in 1998 and $2.1 billion for
1998-2002. There also are contractual commitments for the disposal of used
nuclear fuel. (See Note 13.)

As of Dec. 31, 1997, NRG is contractually committed to additional equity
investments of approximately $35 million in 1998 and approximately $172 million
for 1998-2002 for various international power generation projects. In addition,
in 1996, NRG executed an agreement whereby NRG is obligated to provide to NRG
Generating (U.S.) Inc. (NRGG), an unconsolidated affiliate of NRG, power
generation investment opportunities in the United States over a three-year
period. These projects must have in aggregate, over the three-year term, an
equity value of at least $60 million or a minimum of 150 net megawatts. In
addition, NRG has committed to finance NRGG's investment in the projects to the
extent funds are not available to NRGG on comparable terms from other sources.
As required by the agreement, NRG provided several investment opportunities to
NRGG in 1997, and, as a result, NRGG purchased the Millennium project from NRG.
NRGG financed the Millennium purchase from sources other than NRG.

LEGISLATIVE RESOURCE COMMITMENTS In 1994, the Minnesota Legislature established
several energy resource and other commitments for NSP to obtain the Prairie
Island temporary nuclear fuel storage facility approval. The commitments, which
can be met by building, purchasing or, in the case of biomass, converting
generation resources, are:

Power Type               Megawatts Required                Contract Deadline

       Total Biomass     125

The Company is complying with the requirements of these resource commitments as
follows:

In 1994, the Company received Minnesota legislative approval for additional
on-site temporary storage facilities at NSP's Prairie Island plant, provided the
Company satisfies certain requirements. Seventeen dry cask containers, each of
which can store approximately one-half year's used fuel, were approved to become
available. The first four casks were available in 1994. In late 1996, the MEQB
certified that NSP has met the requirements necessary to use the sixth through
ninth casks at the Prairie Island nuclear generating facility. The final eight
casks become available in 1999 unless the above resource commitments are not met
and the Minnesota Legislature revokes its approval. As of Dec. 31, 1997, the
Company had loaded seven casks.

Other commitments established by the Legislature include a discount for
low-income electric customers, required conservation improvement expenditures
and various study and reporting requirements to a legislative electric energy
task force. In 1995, the MPUC approved the Company's low-income discount
programs in accordance with the statute. The Company has implemented programs to
begin meeting the other legislative commitments. The Company's capital
commitments, disclosed below, include the known effects of the 1994 Prairie
Island legislation. The impact of the legislation on power purchase commitments
and other operating expenses is not yet determinable.

GUARANTEES In 1997 and 1996, the Company sold a portion of its other
receivables, consisting of energy loans made to customers, to a third party. The
portion of the receivables sold consisted of customer loans to local government
entities for energy efficiency improvements under various conservation programs
offered by the Company. Under the sale agreements, the Company is required to
guarantee repayment to the third party of the remaining loan balances. At Dec.
31, 1997, the outstanding balance of the loans was approximately $28 million.
Based on prior collection experience of these loans, the Company believes that
losses under the loan guarantees, if any, would have an immaterial impact on the
results of operations.

LEASES Rentals under operating leases were approximately $32 million, $29
million and $27 million for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Future
commitments under these leases generally decline from current levels.

FUEL CONTRACTS NSP has contracts providing for the purchase and delivery of a
significant portion of its current coal, nuclear fuel and natural gas
requirements. These contracts, which expire in various years between 1998 and
2013, require minimum purchases and deliveries of fuel, and additional payments
for the right to purchase coal in the future. In total, NSP is committed to the
minimum purchase of approximately $341 million of coal, $29 million of nuclear
fuel and $291 million of natural gas and related transportation, or to make
payments in lieu thereof, under these contracts. In addition, NSP is required to
pay additional amounts depending on actual quantities shipped under these
agreements. As a result of FERC Order 636, NSP has developed a mix of gas
supply, transportation and storage contracts designed to meet its needs for
retail gas sales. The contracts are with several suppliers and for various
periods of time. Because NSP has other sources of fuel available and suppliers
are expected to continue to provide reliable fuel supplies, risk of loss from
nonperformance under these contracts is not considered significant. In addition,
NSP's risk of loss, in the form of increased costs, from market price changes in
fuel is mitigated through the cost-of-energy adjustment provision of the
ratemaking process, which provides for recovery of nearly all fuel costs.

POWER AGREEMENTS The Company has executed several agreements with the Manitoba
Hydro-Electric Board (MH) for hydroelectricity. A summary of the agreements is
as follows:

                                                      Years        Megawatts
Participation Power Purchase                       1998-2005          500
Seasonal Diversity Exchanges:
   Summer exchanges from MH                        1998-2014          150
                                                   1998-2016          200
   Winter exchanges to MH                          1998-2014          150
                                                   1998-2015          200
                                                   2015-2017          400
                                                   2018               200

The cost of the 500-megawatt participation power purchase commitment is based on
80 percent of the costs of owning and operating the Company's Sherco 3
generating plant, adjusted to 1993 dollars. The future annual capacity costs for
the 500-megawatt MH agreement is estimated to be approximately $55 million.
There are no capacity payments for the diversity exchanges. These commitments to
MH represent about 17 percent of MH's system capability in 1998 and account for
approximately 10 percent of NSP's 1998 electric system capability. The




risk of loss from nonperformance by MH is not considered significant, and the
risk of loss from market price changes is mitigated through cost-of-energy rate
adjustments.

The Company has an agreement with Minnkota Power Cooperative for the purchase of
summer season capacity and energy. From 1998 through 2001, the Company will buy
150 megawatts of summer season capacity for $12 million annually. From 2002
through 2015, the Company will purchase 100 megawatts of capacity for $10
million annually. Under the agreement, energy will be priced at the cost of fuel
consumed per megawatt-hour at the Coyote Generating Station in North Dakota. The
Company also has a seasonal (summer) purchase power agreement with Minnesota
Power for the purchase of 173 megawatts, including reserves, from 1998-2000.
The annual cost of this capacity will be approximately $2 million.

The Company has agreements with several nonregulated power producers to purchase
electric capacity and associated energy. The 1998 cost of these commitments for
nonregulated capacity is approximately $46 million for 360 megawatts of summer
capacity. This commitment is expected to remain at this level until 2012, at
which time it will decrease to approximately $39 million annually and then
gradually decrease to approximately $26 million in the year 2027 due to the
expiration of existing agreements.

NUCLEAR INSURANCE The Company's public liability for claims resulting from any
nuclear incident is limited to $8.9 billion under the 1988 Price-Anderson
amendment to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The Company has secured $200 million
of coverage for its public liability exposure with a pool of insurance
companies. The remaining $8.7 billion of exposure is funded by the Secondary
Financial Protection Program, available from assessments by the federal
government in case of a nuclear accident. The Company is subject to assessments
of up to $79 million for each of its three licensed reactors to be applied for
public liability arising from a nuclear incident at any licensed nuclear
facility in the United States. The maximum funding requirement is $10 million
per reactor during any one year.

The Company purchases insurance for property damage and site decontamination
cleanup costs with coverage limits of $1.5 billion for each of the Company's two
nuclear plant sites. The coverage consists of $500 million from Nuclear Mutual
Limited (NML) and $1.0 billion from Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL).

NEIL also provides business interruption insurance coverage, including the cost
of replacement power obtained during certain prolonged accidental outages of
nuclear generating units. Premiums billed to NSP from NML and NEIL are expensed
over the policy term. All companies insured with NML and NEIL are subject to
retrospective premium adjustments if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds.
Capital has been accumulated in the reserve funds of NML and NEIL to the extent
that the Company would have no exposure for retrospective premium assessments in
case of a single incident under the business interruption and the property
damage insurance coverages. However, in each calendar year, the Company could be
subject to maximum assessments of approximately $4.6 million for business
interruption insurance (five times the amount of its annual premium) and $19.0
million for property damage insurance (generally five times the amount of its
annual premium) if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES Other long-term liabilities include an accrual of
$34 million, and other current liabilities include an accrual of $6 million at
Dec. 31, 1997, for estimated costs associated with environmental remediation.
Approximately $31 million of the long-term liability and $4 million of the
current liability relate to a DOE assessment for decommissioning a federal
uranium enrichment facility, as discussed in Note 13. Other estimates have been
recorded for expected environmental costs associated with manufactured gas plant
sites formerly used by the Company, and other waste disposal sites, as discussed
below.

These environmental liabilities do not include accruals recorded, and collected
from customers in rates, for future nuclear fuel disposal costs or
decommissioning costs related to the Company's nuclear generating plants. (See
Note 13 for further discussion.)

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or state environmental agencies have
designated the Company as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) for 15 waste
disposal sites to which the Company allegedly sent hazardous materials. Ten of
these 15 sites have been remediated and, consistent with settlements reached
with the EPA and other PRPs, the Company has paid $1.7 million for its share of
the remediation costs. While these remediated sites will continue to be
monitored, the Company expects that future remediation costs, if any, will be
immaterial. Under applicable law, the Company, along with each PRP, could be
held jointly and severally liable for the total remediation costs of PRP sites.
Of the five unremediated sites, the total remediation costs are currently
estimated to be approximately $11 million. If additional remediation is
necessary or unexpected costs are incurred, the amount




could be higher. The Company is not aware of the other parties' inability to
pay, nor does it know if responsibility for any of the sites is in dispute. For
these five sites, neither the amount of remediation costs nor the final method
of their allocation among all designated PRPs has been determined. However, the
Company has recorded an estimate of approximately $750,000 for its share of
future costs for these five sites, including $700,000 that is expected to be
paid in 1998. While it is not feasible to determine the ultimate impact of PRP
site remediation at this time, the amounts accrued represent the best current
estimate of the Company's future liability. It is the Company's practice to
vigorously pursue and, if necessary, litigate with insurers to recover incurred
remediation costs whenever possible. Through litigation, the Company has
recovered a portion of the remediation costs paid to date. Management believes
remediation costs incurred, but not recovered, from insurance carriers or other
parties should be allowed recovery in future ratemaking. Until the Company is
identified as a PRP, it is not possible to predict the timing or amount of any
costs associated with sites, other than those discussed above.

The Wisconsin Company potentially may be involved in the cleanup and remediation
at four sites. Three sites are solid and hazardous waste landfill sites in Eau
Claire, Rice Lake and Amery, Wis. The Wisconsin Company contends that it did not
dispose of hazardous wastes in these landfills during the time period in
question. Because neither the amount of cleanup costs nor the final method of
their allocation among all designated PRPs has been determined, it is not
feasible to predict the outcome of these matters at this time. The Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) named the Wisconsin Company as one of
three Responsible Parties for creosote and coal tar contamination at a fourth
site in Ashland, Wis. WDNR's consultant is preparing a remedial option study for
the entire Ashland site, which includes the Wisconsin Company's portion and two
other adjacent portions. Until this study is completed and more information is
known concerning the extent of the final remediation required by the WDNR, the
remediation method selected, the related costs, the various parties involved,
and the extent of the Wisconsin Company's responsibility, if any, for sharing
the costs, the ultimate cost to the Wisconsin Company and timing of any payments
related to the Ashland site are not determinable. At Dec. 31, 1997, the Company
had recorded an estimated liability of $880,000 for future remediation costs
associated with the Wisconsin Company-owned portion of the Ashland site. Through
Dec. 31, 1997, the Wisconsin Company has incurred approximately $646,000 in
actual expenditures to date. Based on a recent Public Service Commission of
Wisconsin decision to allow recovery of incremental costs incurred for this site
beginning in 1997, the Wisconsin Company has recorded a regulatory asset for the
accrued and actual expenditures related to the Ashland site. The ultimate
cleanup and remediation costs at the Eau Claire, Amery, Rice Lake and Ashland
sites and the extent of the Wisconsin Company's responsibility, if any, for
sharing such costs are not known at this time, but may be significant.

The Company also is continuing to investigate various properties, which it
presently or previously owned. The properties were formerly sites of gas
manufacturing, gas storage plants or gas pipelines. The purpose of this
investigation is to determine if waste materials are present, if they are an
environmental or health risk, if the Company has any responsibility for remedial
action and if recovery under the Company's insurance policies can contribute to
any remediation costs. The Company has already remediated one site, which
continues to be monitored. The Company has paid $2.5 million to remediate this
site and expects to incur in the future only immaterial monitoring costs related
to this remediated site. Another 14 gas sites remain under investigation, and
the Company is actively taking remedial action at four of the sites. In
addition, the Company has been notified that two other sites eventually will
require remediation, and a study was initiated in 1996 to determine the cost and
method of cleanup at these two sites, which began in 1997. As of Dec. 31, 1997,
the Company has paid $8.1 million for the six active sites and has recorded an
estimated liability of approximately $3.0 million for future costs, with payment
expected over the next 10 years. This estimate is based on prior experience and
includes investigation, remediation and litigation costs. As for the eight
inactive sites, no liability has been recorded for remediation or investigation
because the present land use at each of these sites does not warrant a response
action. While it is not feasible to determine at this time the ultimate costs of
gas site remediation, the amounts accrued represent the best current estimate of
the Company's future liability for any required cleanup or remedial actions at
these former gas operating sites. Environmental remediation costs may be
recovered from insurance carriers, third parties, or in future rates. The MPUC
allowed the Company to defer certain remediation costs of four active sites in
1994 and the Company requested, in its December 1997 gas rate case, recovery of
these accumulated costs. In January 1998, the MPUC allowed the recovery of these
gas site remediation costs in the interim gas rates that went into effect in
February 1998. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an environmental regulatory
asset for these costs (see Note 9). The Company may request recovery of costs to
remedy the other two active sites following the completion of preliminary
investigations.

The Clean Air Act, including the Amendments of 1990 (the Clean Air Act), calls
for reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from electric
generating plants. These reductions, which will be phased in, began in 1995. The
majority of the rules implementing this complex legislation have been finalized.
NSP has invested significantly over the years to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions
at its plants. No additional capital




expenditures are anticipated to comply with the sulfur dioxide emission limits
of the Clean Air Act. NSP is still evaluating how best to implement the nitrogen
oxides standards. The Company's capital expenditures include some costs for
ensuring compliance with the Clean Air Act's other emission requirements; other
expenditures may be necessary upon EPA's finalization of remaining rules.
Because NSP is still in the process of implementing some provisions of the Clean
Air Act, its total financial impact is unknown at this time. Capital
expenditures for opacity compliance are considered in the capital expenditure
commitments disclosed previously. The depreciation of these capital costs will
be subject to regulatory recovery in future rate proceedings.

Several of NSP's facilities have asbestos-containing material, which represents
a potential health hazard to people who come in contact with it. Governmental
regulations specify the timing and nature of disposal of asbestos-containing
materials. Under such requirements, asbestos not readily accessible to the
environment need not be removed until the facilities containing the material are
demolished. Although the ultimate cost and timing of asbestos removal is not yet
known, it is estimated that removal under current regulations would cost $45
million in 1997 dollars. Depending on the timing of asbestos removal, such costs
would be recorded as incurred as operating expenses for maintenance projects,
capital expenditures for construction projects, or removal costs for demolition
projects.

Environmental liabilities are subject to considerable uncertainties that affect
NSP's ability to estimate its share of the ultimate costs of remediation and
pollution control efforts. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of
site contamination, the extent of required cleanup efforts, varying costs of
alternative cleanup methods and pollution control technologies, changes in
environmental remediation and pollution control requirements, the potential
effect of technological improvements, the number and financial strength of other
potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites and the identification of
new environmental cleanup sites. NSP has recorded and/or disclosed its best
estimate of expected future environmental costs and obligations, as discussed
previously.

LEGAL CLAIMS In the normal course of business, NSP is a party to routine claims
and litigation arising from prior and current operations. NSP is actively
defending these matters and has recorded an estimate of the probable cost of
settlement or other disposition.
