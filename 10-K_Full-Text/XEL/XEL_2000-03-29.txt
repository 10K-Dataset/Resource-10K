PART I

Item 1—Business

Northern States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota) was incorporated in 1909 under the laws of Minnesota. Its executive offices are located at 414
Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401 (Phone 612-330-5500). NSP-Minnesota has two significant subsidiaries, Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin
corporation (NSP-Wisconsin), and NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG). NSP-Minnesota also has several other subsidiaries, including: Energy Masters International, Inc. (EMI);
Viking Gas Transmission Company (Viking); Eloigne Company (Eloigne); Seren Innovations, Inc. (Seren); and Ultra Power Technologies, Inc. (Ultra Power). NSP-Minnesota and its
subsidiaries are collectively referred to as NSP.

NSP
is predominantly an operating public utility engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and the transportation, storage and distribution of natural
gas. NSP-Minnesota serves retail customers in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Arizona. NSP-Wisconsin serves retail customers in Wisconsin and Michigan. NRG operates
several nonregulated energy businesses and is an equity investor in many nonregulated energy affiliates throughout the world.

Regulated
electric and gas utility companies are facing challenges, including: increasing competition, increasing pressure to control costs, uncertainties in regulatory processes and
increasing costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, there are uncertainties related to permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. A growing portion of NSP's earnings
comes from nonregulated operations. The nonregulated projects can carry a higher level of risk than NSP's traditional utility businesses. For further discussion of these matters, see Management's
Discussion and Analysis under Item 7 and Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8.

Except
for historical information, the matters discussed in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and
assumptions, as discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7 and Exhibit 99.01 to this report on Form 10-K.

PROPOSED BUSINESS COMBINATION

On March 24, 1999, NSP and New Century Energies, Inc. (NCE) agreed to merge and form a new entity, Xcel Energy Inc. In
March 2000, the state of Arizona approved the merger and the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act expired. For more discussion of this proposed business combination, see
Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7, Note 15 to the Financial Statements under Item 8 and Exhibit 99.03 and 99.04.

UTILITY REGULATION AND REVENUES

General

Retail sales rates, services and other aspects of NSP-Minnesota's operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the Minnesota Public Utilities
Commission (MPUC), the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC), the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (SDPUC) and the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) within their respective states.
The MPUC also possesses regulatory authority over aspects of NSP-Minnesota's financial activities, including security issuances, property transfers within the
state of Minnesota when the asset value is in excess of $100,000, mergers with other utilities, and transactions between NSP-Minnesota and its affiliates. In addition, the MPUC reviews and
approves NSP-Minnesota's electric resource plans and gas supply plans for meeting customers' future energy needs. NSP-Wisconsin is subject to regulation of similar scope by the
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) and the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). In addition, each of the state commissions certifies the need for new generating plants and electric
and retail gas transmission lines of designated capacities to be located within the respective states before the facilities may be sited and built.


The
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has jurisdiction over wholesale rates for electric transmission service and electric energy sold in interstate commerce, hydro facility
licensing, the wholesale gas transportation rates of Viking, the siting and construction of facilities by Viking and certain other activities of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin
and Viking. Federal, state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over many of NSP's other activities.

The
Minnesota Environmental Quality Board (MEQB) is empowered to select and designate sites for new power plants with a capacity of 50 megawatts (Mw) or more and wind energy
conversion plants with a capacity of 5 Mw or more. It also designates routes for electric transmission lines with a capacity of 200 kilovolts (kv) or more. The MEQB also evaluates such sites and
routes for environmental compatibility. The MEQB may designate sites or routes different than those proposed by power suppliers. No power plant or transmission line may be constructed in Minnesota
except on a site or route designated by the MEQB.

NSP
is unable to predict the impact on its operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of the above agencies. NSP strives to comply with all rules and regulations
issued by the various agencies.

Revenues

NSP's financial results depend, in part, on its ability to obtain adequate and timely rate relief from the various regulatory bodies, its ability to control
costs and the success of its nonregulated activities. NSP's 1999 utility operating revenues, excluding non-firm electric sales to other utilities of $144 million and miscellaneous
electric and gas revenues of $71 million, were subject to regulatory jurisdiction as follows:

Ratemaking Principles in Minnesota and Wisconsin

The MPUC accepts the use of a forecast test year that corresponds to the period when rates are put into effect and allows collection of interim rates subject
to refund. The use of a forecast test year and interim rates minimizes regulatory lag.

The
MPUC must order interim rates within 60 days of a rate case filing. Minnesota statutes allow interim rates to be set using (1) updated expense and rate base items
similar to those previously allowed, and (2) a return on common equity equal to that granted in the last MPUC order for the utility. The MPUC must make a determination on the application within
10 months after filing. If the final determination does not permit the full amount of the interim rates, the utility must refund the excess revenue collected, with interest. To the extent final
rates exceed interim rates, the final rates become effective at the time of the order and retroactive recovery of the difference is not permitted.

Minnesota
law allows Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) in a utility's rate base. The MPUC has generally included Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFC) in revenue
requirements for rate proceedings.

The
PSCW has a biennial filing requirement. By June of each odd-numbered year, NSP-Wisconsin must submit filings for calendar years beginning the following
January. The filing procedure and review generally allow the PSCW sufficient time to issue an order effective with the start of the test year.

The
PSCW reviews each utility's cash position to determine if a current return on CWIP will be allowed. The PSCW will allow either a return on CWIP or capitalization of AFC at the
adjusted overall cost of capital. NSP-Wisconsin currently capitalizes AFC on production and transmission CWIP at the FERC formula rate and on all other CWIP at the adjusted overall cost of
capital.

Fuel and Purchased Gas Adjustment Clauses

NSP-Minnesota's retail electric rate schedules and most of NSP-Wisconsin's wholesale electric rate schedules provide for adjustments to
billings and revenues for changes in the cost of fuel and purchased energy. NSP-Minnesota is permitted to recover option costs through the fuel clause although, changes in capacity charges
are not recovered through the fuel clause. NSP-Minnesota's wholesale electric sales customers do not have a fuel clause provision in their contracts. Instead of fuel clause recovery, the
contracts provide a fixed rate with an escalation factor.

NSP-Wisconsin
does not have an automatic electric fuel adjustment clause for Wisconsin retail customers. In lieu of fuel clause recovery, a procedure is in place that
compares actual monthly and anticipated annual fuel costs with those costs that were included in the latest retail electric rates. If the comparison results in a difference outside a prescribed range,
the PSCW may hold hearings limited to fuel costs and revise rates. Any revised rates would be effective until the next rate case. The adjustment approved is calculated on an annual basis, but applied
prospectively.


Gas
rate schedules for NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and Black Mountain Gas (BMG) in Arizona include a purchased gas adjustment (PGA) clause that provides for
rate adjustments for changes in the current unit cost of purchased gas compared with the last costs included in rates. The factors in Minnesota and Wisconsin are calculated for the current month based
on the estimated purchased gas costs for that month. In Arizona, the factor is based on actual gas costs with a two-month lag.

By
September of each year, NSP-Minnesota is required to submit to the MPUC an annual report of the PGA factors used to bill each customer class by month for the previous
year commencing July 1 and ending June 30. The report verifies whether the utility is calculating the adjustments properly and implementing them in a timely manner. In addition, the MPUC
reviews procurement policies, cost-minimizing efforts, rule variances, retail transportation gas volumes, independent auditors' reports and the impact of market forces on gas costs for the
coming year. The MPUC has the authority to disallow certain costs if it finds the utility was not prudent in its gas procurement activities.

During
1999, the PSCW approved a new Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism (GCRM) to replace the PGA. The financial impact of the new gas cost recovery mechanism is substantially the same as
with the former PGA. Approximately 70 percent of NSP-Wisconsin's gas revenues represent recovery of gas costs through the GCRM mechanism.

NSP-Wisconsin's
gas and retail electric rate schedules for Michigan customers include gas cost recovery factors and power supply cost recovery factors (PSCR), which are
based on 12-month projections. After each 12-month period, a reconciliation is submitted whereby over-collections are refunded and any under-collections are
collected from the customers.

Viking
provides interstate gas transportation services only and does not sell gas. Viking makes incidental purchases and sales of natural gas to balance the volumes of gas in the
pipeline. In 1998, the FERC approved a tariff change to reflect the costs and revenues from those incidental transactions on a true-up basis, similar to a PGA mechanism.

Resource Adjustment Clauses

NSP-Minnesota is required by Minnesota law to spend a minimum of 2 percent of Minnesota electric revenue and 0.5 percent of Minnesota
gas revenue on conservation improvement programs (CIP). These costs are recovered through an annual recovery mechanism for electric and gas conservation and energy
management program expenditures. NSP-Minnesota is required to request a new cost recovery level annually.

Regulatory Matters by Jurisdiction

Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC)

During 1999, NSP recorded charges to earnings of $35 million (before tax), or approximately 14 cents per share, due to the disallowance of rate recovery
for accrued 1998 conservation program incentives. In addition, due to the uncertainty of future conservation incentive recovery, NSP did not accrue any conservation incentives for 1999 activity. See
Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7 for discussion of this issue.

On
July 27, 1999, the MPUC issued an order requiring an investigation into the reasonableness of NSP's retail electric rates in Minnesota. As required by the rate investigation
order, NSP filed detailed schedules and an explanation of why it believes its current rates continue to be just and reasonable. In January 2000, the MPUC accepted NSP's filing, closed the
investigation and transferred any further analysis to the NSP-NCE merger proceeding.


During
1999, NSP obtained approval from the MPUC to include the cost of electricity futures and options in the fuel clause. This approval allows NSP to recover the cost of hedging
against price volatility in electricity markets.

With
the exception of any filings regarding conservation program incentives, no filings requesting a general electric or gas rate increase are anticipated in Minnesota in 2000.

North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC)

In July 1998, the NDPSC ordered its staff to conduct an investigation of NSP's North Dakota jurisdictional electric earnings. The purpose of the
investigation was to determine if existing rates wer fair and reasonable given earnings results. In December 1999, NDPSC Staff issued an investigation report finding NSP to be in an excess
revenue position of about $0.8 million. In January 2000, NSP entered into a settlement agreement with NDPSC staff. The settlement calls for a $250,000 electric rate reduction, closing of
the earnings investigation case, the NDPSC approval of NSP's pending application to merge with NCE and the filing of a performance-based regulation plan within 10 days of the NDPSC merger
approval.

In
December 1999, the NDPSC approved NSP's petition for a gas rate correction, increasing annual gas revenue by approximately $300,000.

South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (SDPUC)

In 1999, the SDPUC approved NSP's request for an order establishing NSP as a regulated intrastate gas pipeline in South Dakota, including a request for
approval of initial large volume retail intrastate gas transportation rates. NSP had not previously provided natural gas service in South Dakota.

No
general rate filings are anticipated in South Dakota in 2000.

Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW)

On Oct. 28, 1999, the PSCW approved NSP-Wisconsin's application for authority to maintain base retail electric and natural gas service rates
in Wisconsin at current levels through 2001. Current rates were placed in effect September 1998.

On
Feb. 14, 2000, NSP-Wisconsin filed an application with the PSCW to increase electric rates for fuel costs. In its application, NSP-Wisconsin noted
that 2000 fuel costs are forecast to be approximately $12 million above authorized levels, primarily due to higher purchased power costs. The application is currently pending before the PSCW,
and a decision is expected in the second quarter of 2000. The amount of cost recovery and the effective date of the potential surcharge will be determined upon completion of the regulatory process. If
NSP-Wisconsin's application is approved, a surcharge would be added to customer bills for the remainder of 2000 and all of 2001.

Under
the PSCW biennial rate filing rule, NSP-Wisconsin anticipates filing a general electric and gas rate case by June 1, 2001.

Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC)

In January 1999, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing NSP-Wisconsin to restructure electric rates for its Michigan
customers. The restructuring does not affect total revenues. Return on equity was set at 11.9 percent.

No
general rate filings are anticipated in Michigan in 2000.


Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC)

In July 1998, the ACC approved the sale of Black Mountain Gas (BMG) assets and transfer of BMG's Certificate of Convenience and Necessity to NSP. As
part of the approval, BMG filed an application with the ACC for a 21.6 percent decrease in gas rates. In October 1999, the parties filed an Agreement and a Proposed Opinion and Order
requesting an overall decrease of $495,000. A rate order was received in December 1999 confirming this decision.

As
part of the approval and transfer process, BMG was required to file a rate application for its Cave Creek Division by April 1, 2000, which will accommodate a full
calendar test year for the ratemaking process.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)

In 1996, the FERC issued Orders No. 888 and 889, which have had a significant impact on wholesale electric markets by giving competitors the ability to
transmit electricity through utilities' transmission systems. See Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7 for discussion of these rules.

In
the first quarter of 1998, NSP filed wholesale electric point-to-point and network integration transmission service (NTS) rate cases with the FERC. In
March 1999, NSP filed an offer of settlement, which would resolve virtually all issues in the two cases. The offer of settlement provided an approximate 2 percent reduction in
point-to-point rates, which combined with anticipated reductions in non-firm discounting is expected to have little or no impact on annual revenue. In addition, the
settlement called for an annual increase of approximately $1 million in ancillary service revenues. Finally, the settlement placed a cap on NSP's annual NTS payment liabilities to its five NTS
customers at $10 million per year.
The point-to-point and ancillary rates would be effective October 1998. The offer also included a three-year moratorium period on future transmission rate
changes. In December 1999, the FERC issued an order approving the settlement.

In
June 1998, the FERC issued an order in the electric transmission rate case requiring NSP to interrupt service to its own retail customers proportionally with curtailment of
wholesale transmission-only customers taking service under NSP's Order No. 888 transmission tariff. When NSP's transmission lines are constrained or about to become overloaded, the
FERC order would have required NSP to interrupt service to retail customers to reduce transmission loadings on constrained facilities on a pro rata basis with curtailment of wholesale transactions. In
August 1998, NSP filed an appeal of the FERC orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit. In May 1999, the Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded the FERC ruling. In
November 1999, the FERC issued an order on remand providing an acceptable resolution to the matter and NSP submitted a compliance filing, which the FERC accepted in December 1999.
However, in November 1999, Enron Power Marketing, Inc. requested U.S. Supreme Court review of the Eighth Circuit ruling. In February 2000, the Supreme Court denied review and the
appeal is now complete.

In
May 1999, a majority of the members of the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP) voted to approve a MAPP regional transmission service tariff. The MAPP tariff
would supersede MAPP members' individual electric transmission service tariffs for most wholesale transactions. The proposed MAPP tariff was filed with the FERC in June 1999. MAPP proposed the
new tariff be effective 90 days after a FERC order accepting the tariff for filing. When effective, MAPP's tariff could reduce NSP's pretax earnings due to lower revenues and/or higher costs.
The tariff is pending FERC action. While there is a small probability that the tariff could take effect as early as July 1, 2000, which would result in a $6 million pretax impact in
2000, NSP anticipates continued regulatory delay to tariff implementation, resulting in minimal or no impact on NSP's 2000 pretax earnings.

In
June 1998, Viking filed a rate case with the FERC, requesting a $3 million annual rate increase. In 1999, a settlement agreement was reached that provided Viking an
annual rate increase of approximately


$1.3 million,
or 6 percent, effective Jan. 1, 1999, and a four year phased rate roll-in for the cost of Viking's 1996 and 1997 expansion projects. FERC approved this
settlement in May 1999.

ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS

Competition and Industry Restructuring

NSP's electric sales are subject to competition in some areas from municipally owned systems, cooperatives, other utilities and independent power producers.
Electric service also increasingly competes with other forms of energy. Although NSP cannot predict the extent to which its future business may be affected by competition, NSP believes it will be in a
position to compete effectively.

In
addition to competition for sales, the electric utility industry is undergoing a possibly significant restructuring. Depending on future regulatory decisions, utilities like NSP
may be required to separate the functions of power generation, transmission, distribution and energy services. NSP cannot predict the ultimate result of restructuring. However, NSP is taking proactive
steps to effectively compete in a restructured energy marketplace, such as joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) and forming a Nuclear Management Company with other utilities. For
more information on these actions, see Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7.

Wholesale Competition

The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Act) is designed to promote competition in the development of wholesale power generation in the electric industry.

In
compliance with FERC Orders No. 888 and 889, NSP has separated personnel who perform the merchant function, which includes power and energy marketing, from personnel who
perform the transmission system operation function. NSP's merchant function, Energy Marketing, performs power and energy marketing (both sales and purchases). The sales and revenue provided by this
function is classified as sales for resale. Because of Orders No. 888 and 889, NSP Energy Marketing must pay the same rates as other utilities for use of NSP's transmission system.

In
1998, NSP expanded its wholesale energy marketing efforts by formally establishing an Energy Marketing division. Energy Marketing is responsible for meeting the requirements of
NSP's retail and wholesale electric customers for low-cost energy while optimizing earnings from NSP's generation resources. Energy Marketing is no longer competing with only regional
utilities when it buys and sells excess power to wholesale customers, but with power marketers from all over the United States. As more participants join the market, margins are expected to decline.
Energy Marketing is developing its wholesale power marketing capabilities to compete on a national basis.

Although
NSP has contracts with several municipal customers, a competitive market requires NSP to remain competitive in the entire wholesale market because many parties, including
power marketers, are now able to use NSP's transmission lines to transport electricity. Rate discounts and negotiated rates are being offered to current and potential municipal power supply customers.
In the past several years, these customers have been evaluating a variety of energy sources to provide their electric supply. The process of making a wholesale energy sale is now much more competitive
and can be contingent upon the availability of transmission service.

In
December 1999, FERC issued order No. 2000, which adopted new rules that encourage all wholesale transmission service providers to join regional transmission
organizations (RTOs).


Retail Competition

Some states, such as Michigan, have begun to allow retail customers to choose their electricity suppliers, and many other states are considering proposals to
increase competition in the supply of electricity.

Electric
industry restructuring has not yet emerged as a major issue in Minnesota. In 1998, the Minnesota Legislature directed the Legislative Electric Energy Task Force (LEETF) to
study restructuring. The LEETF solicited comments from NSP and other interested parties on four topics: bulk power systems; distribution reliability, safety and maintenance; energy prices and price
protection mechanisms; and universal service. Based on those comments, the LEETF filed a report with the Legislature in January 1999, concluding that additional study was necessary. The
Legislature did not act on electric restructuring in 1999. The LEETF is considering introducing a major bill to focus the discussion in 2000. The Minnesota Department of Commerce (MDC) has announced
it intends to prepare a comprehensive electric restructuring bill for introduction in 2001. The MDC and the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce may be seeking passage of a "consumer information" bill in
2000, requiring the unbundling of rates on consumers' bills. However, the Minnesota Legislature is not expected to take significant action on this matter until the 2001 session.

Due
to reliability concerns, the PSCW turned its focus from restructuring the electric utility industry to developing the utility infrastructure necessary to assure reliable electric
service. In 1998, Wisconsin Act 204, "the Reliability Act," became law. The Reliability Act contains a number of steps necessary for industry restructuring, including streamlining and updating the
regulatory process. During 1999, an electric reliability bill was passed that included further steps necessary to move towards a restructured industry. Major components included some relief from a
restriction on the amount of nonutility assets that a Wisconsin utility holding company can own, a requirement that eastern Wisconsin utilities join an eastern Wisconsin transmission company, and
mandated public benefits encompassing low-income energy assistance, conservation programs and renewable and environmental research. The bill also included a renewable portfolio mandate,
local impact fees for new transmission lines and nitrogen oxide (NOx) protections for MAPP utilities.

The
effects on NSP-Wisconsin include:

•

an
increase in the amount of money that must be collected from NSP-Wisconsin's customers to fund low-income assistance and
conservation programs, and renewable and environmental research, and

•

partial
protection from potential costs related to the proposed NOx emission regulations.

NSP-Wisconsin
is not affected by the renewable mandate since it already relies significantly on renewable sources of energy. Although activity has taken place at the
Legislature that should ultimately provide for a competitive energy market, at this time a definitive timeline has not yet been established for the implementation of retail competition in Wisconsin.

In
1997, the NDPSC adopted the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners' Principles to Guide the Restructuring of the Electric Industries, which suggest that industry
changes should only occur when they result in economic efficiency and serve the broader public interest. Specific principles address protecting reliability, providing customers with meaningful choice,
sharing benefits and stranded costs between ratepayers and shareholders, protecting the environment and reaffirming state commission responsibility for determining restructuring policies. The NDPSC
has taken no further action on restructuring.

In
1997, the North Dakota Legislature established an Electric Utility Committee (EUC) of six legislators charged with studying the impact of competition on the electric industry. By
statute, the committee has six years to study the impact of competition on the electric energy industry in the state. The


EUC
is formulating tax law changes intended to remove disparities between investor-owned and cooperative systems in the state. In 2000, the EUC will begin assessing the need for modifications to the
Territorial Integrity Act, a law governing distribution service territories within the state. Based on its findings, the EUC intends on introducing tax or service territory legislation, if necessary,
to the 2001 Legislature.

In
1998, the MPSC reaffirmed its order to open Michigan's retail electricity market to competition. The initial order directed large Michigan utilities to open 2.5 percent of
their electric load to competition each year from 1997 to 2001. In 2002, all Michigan electric customers would have access to a competitive market. The larger Michigan utilities challenged this order.
The lower courts upheld the MPSC's authority to implement retail competition. However, the State Supreme Court ruled the MPSC does not have the authority to order retail competition, but may allow it
if utilities proceed voluntarily. The smaller Michigan utilities, including NSP-Wisconsin, have not elected to offer customer choice at this time. A coalition of businesses and a few
utilities, working through the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, have introduced a bill to mandate customer choice by January 2002. The smaller utilities continue to work with the Chamber and
legislators to include provisions that take into consideration the unique situation of the smaller utilities in terms of multi-state territory, implementation costs to customers and the effective
date.

NSP
has proposed to fill future needs for new generation through competitive bid solicitations. The use of competitive bidding to select future generation sources allows NSP to take
advantage of the developing competition in this sector of the industry. NSP's proposal, which has been approved by the MPUC, allows NRG and NSP's generation business unit to bid in response to company
solicitations for proposals.

NSP
plans to continue to be a low-cost supplier of electricity and an active participant in the more competitive market for electricity expected in the future. NSP will
continue to work with regulators to develop a tariff and infrastructure that will support a competitive electric environment. NSP is positioning itself for the competitive environment by offering
value-added services tied to our core businesses.

Automated Meter Reading

In 1997, NSP began installing a wireless automated meter reading system that allows NSP to remotely read customer meters. Approximately 900,000 automated
electric and gas meters have been installed. NSP has contracted with an affiliate of CellNet Data Systems, Inc., which owns and operates the communication network that provides daily meter
readings to NSP for automated electric and gas meters. In February 2000, CellNet announced it was filing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At this time, NSP does not expect CellNet's financial
difficulties to pose significant operational risk to NSP's ability to continue to read customer meters or otherwise conduct business.

Capability and Demand

NSP's 1999 maximum demand of 7,990 Mw occurred on July 29, 1999. Resources available at that time included 7,176 Mw of company-owned
capability and 2,024 Mw of purchased capability, net of contracted sales. NSP carried a reserve margin for 1999 of 15 percent to avoid the MAPP penalty for reserve shortfalls. As a
member of MAPP, NSP must own or contract for enough electric generating capacity to serve its own customers plus an additional reserve requirement to protect the system from failure in
case of an unexpected generating station outage or demand due to severe weather. NSP's reserve requirement is determined jointly with the other parties to the MAPP agreement. The minimum reserve
margin requirement for MAPP members is 15 percent.

Assuming
normal weather, NSP expects its 2000 summer electric peak demand to be 7,696 Mw. NSP expects to meet its summer peak and the MAPP reserve requirements through a
combination of generation and purchases. See Note 14 of Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8 for more discussion of power agreement commitments.


During
1998 NSP filed an electric resource plan with the MPUC for the period 1998 to 2012. The plan describes how NSP intends to meet the energy needs of its electric customers and
includes an approximate schedule of the timing of resource solicitation to meet such needs. The plan contains conservation programs to reduce NSP's peak demand and conserve overall electricity use, an
approximate schedule of power purchase solicitations to meet increasing demand, and programs and plans to maintain the reliable operation of existing resources. In summary, the plan:

•

Forecasts
1.7 percent annual growth in NSP's energy and peak demand requirements.

•

Outlines
NSP's demand side management and conservation programs.

•

Shows
new capacity needs of 140 Mw in 2003 and 2,400 Mw by 2012.

•

Describes
the programs for achieving the mandated renewable energy sources of 425 Mw of wind and 125 Mw of biomass.

•

Updates
the status of spent nuclear fuel at the Prairie Island plant and describes how it can continue to operate until the year 2007 with the number of
casks that have been authorized.

The
resource plan proposes to satisfy NSP resource needs through the following energy source options:

•

Continued
use of existing generation facilities.

•

Demand
reduction of an additional 1,080 Mw by 2012 through conservation and load management.

•

Mw of wind energy and 125 Mw of biomass energy under contract by 2002.

•

Acquisition
of competitively priced resources through competitive bidding.

During
1999, the MPUC voted to approve most aspects of the resource plan. However, the MPUC ordered NSP to acquire an additional 400 Mw of wind generation by 2012, subject to
least cost determination.

Minnesota
utilities are required under Minnesota law to use values established by the MPUC, which assign a range of environmental costs to each method of electricity generation when
evaluating and selecting generation resource options. These values are known as environmental externalities. The high end of the range of externality values ordered by the MPUC add about
0.55 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh) to a typical new coal plant and about 0.15 cents per kwh to a natural gas fired plant. The production of carbon dioxide comprises about
60 percent to 80 percent of these amounts.

NSP
continues to implement various demand side management (DSM) programs designed to improve load factor and reduce NSP's power production costs and system peak demands, reducing or
delaying the need for additional investment in new generation and transmission facilities. NSP offers a range of DSM programs, including information programs, rebate and financing programs and rate
incentive programs. These programs are designed to increase the value of NSP's service and help NSP's customer base become more energy efficient and competitive. NSP's DSM programs have reduced system
peak demand by approximately 1,381 Mw.

Energy Sources

During 1999, 42 percent of NSP's kwh requirements were obtained from coal generation and 28 percent were obtained from nuclear generation.
Purchased and interchange energy provided 26 percent,


including
11 percent from Manitoba Hydro; NSP's hydro and other fuels provided the remaining 4 percent. The following is a summary of NSP's electric power output in millions of kwh for
the past three years:

In
1999, NSP filed with the MPUC its plan to repower two coal-fired units at its Black Dog plant in Minnesota with natural gas combined-cycle technology. The MPUC and
other government agencies will review the merits of the project. Under NSP's proposal, the maximum capacity of Black Dog units 1 and 2 would increase from 175 Mw to 290 Mw. The
total cost of the project is estimated to be $156 million. If approved, the repowered units could begin operating in mid-2002.

NSP
has been experiencing increased purchased energy and capacity costs to manage its summer load requirements. Future price spikes that the industry could experience due to weather
conditions, outages or other supply and demand considerations could affect NSP's financial results. For more information, see Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7.

Fuel Supply and Costs

Coal and nuclear fuel will continue to dominate NSP's regulated utility fuel requirements for generating electricity by NSP-owned generating
capacity. The actual fuel mix for 1999 and the estimated fuel mix for 2000 and 2001 are as follows:

NSP
normally maintains between 20 and 40 days of coal inventory at each plant, depending on the plant site. NSP has long-term contracts providing for the delivery
of up to 100 percent of its 2000 coal requirements. Coal delivery may be subject to short-term interruptions or reductions due to transportation problems, weather and availability
of equipment.

Based
on existing coal contracts, NSP expects more than 98 percent of the coal it burns in 2000 will have a sulfur content of less than 1 percent. NSP has contracts for
a maximum of 27 million tons of low-sulfur coal for the next two years. The contracts are with two Montana coal suppliers (Westmoreland Resources and Big Sky Coal Company) and six
Wyoming suppliers (Rochelle Coal Company, Antelope Coal Company, Black Thunder Coal Company, Jacobs Ranch Mine, Belle Ayr Mine and North Rochelle Mine). These arrangements are sufficient to meet
100 percent of the requirements of existing coal-fired plants in 2000 and 2001.

NSP
will purchase approximately 10 percent of its coal requirements in a large active spot market if prices are more favorable than contracted prices.

Contract
expiration dates vary between 2000 and 2005 for western coal. Spot market purchases of other western coal and other fuels will provide the remaining fuel requirements after
2000.

NSP's
current fuel oil inventory is adequate to meet anticipated 2000 requirements. Additional oil may be obtained through spot purchases.

To
operate NSP's nuclear generating plants, NSP secures contracts for uranium concentrates, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment and fuel fabrication. The contract strategy involves
a portfolio of spot purchases and medium and long-term contracts for uranium, conversion and enrichment.

Current
contracts are flexible and cover 100 percent of uranium, conversion and enrichment requirements through the year 2000. These contracts expire at varying times between
2000 and 2005. The overlapping nature of contract commitments will allow NSP to maintain 50 percent to 100 percent coverage beyond 2000. NSP expects sufficient uranium, conversion and
enrichment to be available for the
total fuel requirements of its nuclear generating plants. Fuel fabrication is 100 percent committed through the year 2003 and 30 percent covered through 2010.

Nuclear Power—Operations and Waste Disposal

NSP operates two nuclear generating plants: the Monticello plant and the Prairie Island plant. Monticello began operation in 1971 and is licensed to operate
until 2010. Prairie Island Units 1 and 2 began operation in 1973 and 1974 and are licensed to operate until 2013 and 2014, respectively.

In
September 1998, NSP received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for an amendment to the Monticello operating license to increase the power level as a
result of improvements in technology, equipment and plant performance. This change increased Monticello's summer generating capacity from 545 Mw to 578 Mw.

NSP
previously operated the Pathfinder plant in South Dakota as a nuclear plant from 1964 until 1967. It has since been converted to an oil and gas-fired peaking plant.
Most of the plant's nuclear material was removed during 1991. A few millicuries of residual contamination remain at the site.


Nuclear
power plant operation produces gaseous, liquid and solid radioactive wastes. The discharge and handling of such wastes are controlled by federal regulation. For nuclear power
plants, high-level radioactive waste includes used nuclear fuel. Low-level radioactive wastes are produced from other activities at a nuclear plant. They consist principally of
demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools and equipment that has become contaminated through use in the plant.

Federal
law places responsibility on each state for disposal of its low-level radioactive waste. Low-level radioactive waste from NSP's Monticello and Prairie
Island nuclear plants is currently disposed of at
the Barnwell facility, located in South Carolina (all classes of low-level waste), and the Clive facility, located in Utah (class A low-level waste only). Chem Nuclear
is the owner and operator of the Barnwell facility, which has been given authorization by South Carolina to accept low-level radioactive waste from out of state. Envirocare, Inc.
operates the Clive facility. NSP and Barnwell currently operate under an annual contract, while NSP uses the Envirocare facility through various low-level waste processors. NSP has
low-level storage capacity available at Prairie Island and Monticello that would allow both plants to continue to operate until the end of their licensed life, if off-site
low-level disposal facilities were no longer available to NSP.

The
federal government has the responsibility to dispose of, or permanently store, domestic spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive wastes. The Nuclear Waste
Policy Act of 1982 requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to implement a program for nuclear waste management. This includes the siting, licensing, construction and operation of a repository for
domestically produced spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors and other high-level radioactive wastes at a permanent storage or disposal facility by 1998. None of NSP's
spent nuclear fuel has been accepted by the DOE for disposal. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings and Note 13 to the Financial Statements under Item 8 for further discussion
of this matter.

NSP,
with regulatory and legislative approval, has been providing on-site storage at its Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants. In 1979, NSP began expanding the
used nuclear fuel storage facilities at its Monticello plant by replacement of the racks in the storage pool. In 1987, NSP completed the shipment of 1,058 used fuel assemblies from the Monticello
plant to a General Electric storage facility in Morris, Ill. The Monticello plant is expected to have sufficient pool storage capacity to the end of its current operating license in 2010.

The
Prairie Island spent fuel pool has undergone two storage rack replacements. The on-site storage pool for spent nuclear fuel at Prairie Island was nearly filled prior
to a scheduled refueling in June 1995, and adequate space for a subsequent refueling was no longer available. In anticipation of this, NSP, in 1989, proposed construction of a temporary
on-site dry cask storage facility for spent nuclear fuel at Prairie Island. In May 1994, the governor of Minnesota signed into law a bill authorizing NSP to install 17 spent fuel
casks at Prairie Island. NSP has determined 17 casks will allow facility operation until 2007. As of Dec. 31, 1999, nine storage casks were loaded and stored on the Prairie Island nuclear
generating plant site.

The
Minnesota Legislature established several energy resource and other commitments for NSP to obtain the Prairie Island temporary nuclear fuel storage facility approval. NSP has
implemented programs to meet the legislative commitments. For more information on the status of these legislative commitments, see Note 14 to the Financial Statements under Item 8.

NSP
is leading a consortium of private parties to establish a private facility for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. In 1997, the Private Fuel Storage LLC (PFS) filed a license
application with the NRC for a national temporary storage site for spent nuclear fuel. The PFS will undertake the development, licensing, construction and operation of a storage facility on the Skull
Valley Indian Reservation in Utah. The NRC review process could take up to three years and will consist of formal evidentiary hearings and opportunity for public input. Storage cask certification
efforts are continuing with the two vendors on track to meet the project goals. The interim used fuel storage facility could be operational and able to accept the first


shipment
of spent nuclear fuel by 2003. However, due to uncertainty regarding pending regulatory and governmental approvals, it is possible that this interim storage may be delayed or not available at
all.

The
NRC has issued a number of regulations, bulletins and orders that require analyses, modification and additional equipment at commercial nuclear power plants. The NRC is engaged in
various ongoing studies and rulemaking activities that may impose additional requirements upon commercial nuclear power plants. NSP is unable to predict any new requirements or their impact on NSP's
facilities and operations.

For
further discussion of nuclear issues, see Note 13 and Note 14 to the Financial Statements under Item 8.

GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS

Competition/Regulation

NSP provides retail gas service in the eastern portions of the Twin Cities metropolitan area, northwestern Minnesota, and other regional centers in Minnesota
(Faribault, St. Cloud and Winona). NSP also serves portions of eastern North Dakota, the cities of Page, Carefree, North Phoenix, North Scottsdale and Cave Creek in Arizona and the cities of Eau
Claire, LaCrosse, Ashland and New Richmond in Wisconsin.

In
the early 1990's, the FERC issued Order No. 636, which mandated unbundling interstate natural gas pipeline services—sales, transportation, storage and ancillary
services. The implementation of Order No. 636 has resulted in additional competitive pressure on all local distribution companies (LDC) to keep gas supply and transmission prices for their
large customers competitive. Customers have greater ability to buy gas directly from suppliers and arrange their own pipeline and LDC transportation service. NSP provides unbundled transportation
service. Transportation service does not have an adverse effect on earnings because NSP's sales and transportation rates have been designed to make NSP economically indifferent to whether gas has been
sold and transported or merely transported. However, some transportation customers may have greater opportunities or incentives to physically bypass the LDC distribution system. NSP has arranged its
gas supply and transportation portfolio to provide flexibility in the event it may be required to terminate its retail merchant sales function.

NSP
has aggressively pursued alternative pricing strategies and service enhancements to provide additional value to customers and to improve its competitive position.

In
1997, the MPUC approved a negotiated transportation service tariff that provides additional flexibility in discounting gas rates for customers considering a bypass of NSP's system.

In
1997, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota's proposal for a predictable commodity price service rider, which allows firm gas commercial and industrial customers the choice
to purchase firm fixed price gas supplies rather than gas supplies whose price changes monthly through the PGA clause.

Business Growth

NSP's gas utility customer base grew by approximately 20,000 customers during 1999. In addition to exploring new growth opportunities, NSP is also focusing on
conversion of potential customers who are located near NSP's gas mains, but are not connected to the service.

In
December 1999, NSP-Minnesota merged with Natrogas Inc. Natrogas, based in Minneapolis, has approximately 20,000 natural gas and propane customers in four
states. In July 1998, NSP-Minnesota merged with BMG, located in Cave Creek, Ariz. BMG is a natural gas and propane distribution company with approximately 6,500 customers. Also in
July 1998, NSP-Wisconsin completed its merger with Natural Gas Inc. (NGI) of New Richmond, Wis. NGI has approximately 1,900 customers. All three of these mergers were
structured as tax-free reorganizations for income tax purposes and were accounted for using the pooling of interests method. Prior period financial statements have not been restated due to
immateriality.

In
January 1999, NSP filed for MPUC, ACC and NDPSC approval to transfer the BMG operations into a wholly owned subsidiary of NSP. NSP believes this structure will provide more
efficient management and regulation, and will comply with the Public Utility Holding Company Act. The transaction has been approved by the states and is pending final SEC approval.

NSP-Minnesota's
gas operation maintains a nonutility service that sells service contracts on a variety of home appliances. Working in partnership with local independent
service contractors, NSP Advantage Service offers 24-hour appliance repair service to individuals within NSP-Minnesota's service territory.


In
February 2000, the FERC issued new rules expanding the scope of conduct applicable to interstate gas pipelines (like Viking) with gas marketing affiliates.

Standards

FERC rules incorporate standard natural gas business practices approved by the Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB). The rules and standards apply to interstate
gas pipelines such as Viking, and are intended to simplify transportation of natural gas across the interstate gas pipeline grid. GISB and FERC continue to revise the standards periodically, requiring
incremental expenditures by Viking and NSP.

In
January 1997, the PSCW adopted standards of conduct for natural gas LDCs serving Wisconsin consumers. The standards are similar to, but much more extensive than, the
standards of conduct imposed by the FERC. The PSCW standards require separation of the LDC delivery function from any affiliate that engages in gas functions and impose extensive reporting and other
administrative requirements. NSP-Wisconsin's compliance plan was approved during 1999.

Capability and Demand

NSP categorizes its gas supply requirements as firm or interruptible (customers with an alternate energy supply). NSP's maximum daily sendout (firm and
interruptible) of 782,702 mmBtu for 1999 occurred on Jan. 4, 1999.

NSP
purchases gas from independent suppliers. The gas is delivered under gas transportation agreements with interstate pipelines. These agreements provide for firm deliverable
pipeline capacity of approximately 620,500 mmBtu/day. In addition, NSP has contracted with providers of underground natural gas storage services. Using storage reduces the need for firm pipeline
capacity. These storage agreements provide NSP storage for approximately 19 percent of annual and 30 percent of peak daily, firm requirements.

NSP
also owns and operates two LNG plants with a storage capacity of 2.5 bcf equivalent and four propane-air plants with a storage capacity of 1.4 Bcf equivalent to help
meet the peak requirements of its firm residential, commercial and industrial customers. These peak-shaving facilities have production capacity equivalent to 246,000 mcf of natural gas per
day, or approximately 32 percent of peak day firm requirements. NSP's LNG and propane-air plants provide a cost-effective alternative to annual fixed pipeline
transportation charges to meet the peaks caused by firm space heating demand on extremely cold winter days and can be used to minimize daily imbalance fees on interstate pipelines.

Gas
utilities in Minnesota are required to file for a change in gas supply contract levels to meet peak demand, to redistribute demand costs among classes, or exchange one form of
demand for another. In
March 1999, the MPUC approved NSP's 1998-99 entitlement levels, which allow NSP-Minnesota to recover the demand entitlement costs associated with the increase in
transportation and storage levels in its monthly PGA. NSP-Minnesota's filing for approval of its 1999-2000 entitlement levels is pending MPUC action.

Gas Supply and Costs

NSP's natural gas supply commitments have been unbundled from its gas transportation and storage commitments. NSP's gas utility actively seeks gas supply,
transportation and storage alternatives to yield a diversified portfolio that provides increased flexibility, decreased interruption and financial risk, and economical rates. This diversification
involves numerous domestic and Canadian supply sources, with varied contract lengths. Approximately 80 percent of NSP's retail gas customers are served from the


Northern
pipeline system. NSP has firm gas transportation contracts with the following pipelines, which expire in various years from 2000 through 2013.

Northern

Northern Border Pipeline Company

Williston Basin

ANR Pipeline Company

Viking

TransCanada Gas Pipeline Ltd.

Great Lakes

El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline

The
agreements with Great Lakes, Northern Border, ANR and TransCanada provide for firm transportation service upstream of Northern and Viking, allowing competition among suppliers at
supply pooling points and minimizing commodity gas costs.

In
addition to these fixed transportation charge obligations, NSP has entered into firm gas supply agreements that provide for the payment of monthly or annual reservation charges
irrespective of the volume of gas purchased. The total annual obligation is approximately $17 million. These agreements allow NSP to purchase natural gas at a high load factor at rates below
the prevailing market price, reducing the total cost per mmBtu.

NSP
has certain gas supply and transportation agreements that include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of gas or to make payments in lieu of. At
Dec. 31, 1999, NSP was committed to approximately $236 million in such obligations under these contracts, which range from the years 2000-2013. NSP has negotiated market out
clauses in its new supply agreements, which reduce NSP's purchase obligations if NSP no longer provides merchant gas service.

NSP
purchases firm gas supply from approximately 30 domestic and Canadian suppliers under contracts with durations of one year to 10 years. NSP purchases no more than
20 percent of its total daily supply from any single supplier. This diversity of suppliers and contract lengths allows NSP to maintain competition from suppliers and minimize supply costs.
NSP's objective is to be able to terminate its retail merchant sales function, if necessary, to remain competitive in the marketplace or if mandated by regulatory agencies, with minimal cost to NSP.

The
following table summarizes the average cost per mmBtu of gas purchased for resale by NSP's regulated retail gas distribution business, which excludes Viking.

Purchases

NSP-Minnesota's transportation contracts with Viking.

Viking Gas Transmission Company

Acquired by NSP in 1993, Viking owns and operates a 670-mile interstate natural gas pipeline serving portions of Minnesota, Wisconsin and North
Dakota, with a capacity of approximately 510 mcf per day. The Viking pipeline currently serves 10 percent of NSP's gas distribution system needs. Viking operates exclusively as a transporter of
natural gas for third-party shippers under authority granted by the FERC. In addition to revenue derived from FERC-approved rates, Viking is receiving intercompany revenues from
NSP-Minnesota for its jurisdictional allocations of the acquisition adjustment paid by NSP (in excess of carrying value) to acquire Viking. NSP-Minnesota is not currently
recovering this cost in retail gas rates in


Minnesota,
but is recovering this cost in North Dakota. NSP-Wisconsin recovered a portion of the cost in its retail gas rates through 1998.

As
a natural gas pipeline, Viking is subject to FERC standards of conduct in its transactions with NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin. Viking must transact with
NSP on a non-discriminatory basis and certain restrictions are imposed on the retail gas operations of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin.

In
1997, Viking, in partnership with TransCanada PipeLines, Ltd. and NICOR, Inc., formed Viking Voyageur Gas Transmission Company LLC. The purpose of the Voyageur
project was to install a new 773-mile pipeline parallel to the existing Viking pipeline and extending into the Chicago area. The Voyageur project did not receive the necessary shipper
support to make the project viable. In April 1998, Viking withdrew from the proposed Voyageur pipelineproject and wrote off $1.4 million in costs related to the Voyageur project. During
1999, Viking reached a settlement with TransCanada and NICOR. Viking purchased all engineering and other studies related to the Voyageur project for approximately $4.7 million. Since the
studies obtained through the settlement have continuing value to Viking, the payment has been capitalized as plant.

In
May 1999, Viking received FERC approval to expand its transmission system in northwestern and central Minnesota by installing 45 miles of 24-inch pipeline. The
$22 million expansion project was completed in November 1999 and increased capacity by 28,200 dekatherms per day.

In
March 1999, Viking, WICOR and CMS Energy Corp. announced plans to build an interstate natural gas pipeline to serve the growing needs of the northern Illinois and
southeastern Wisconsin markets. The three energy companies will each own an equal share of the proposed pipeline. The project, called the Guardian Pipeline, will transport natural gas from a hub near
Joliet, Ill. to the Ixonia, Wis., area. The 147-mile pipeline is projected to initially carry about 750 mcf of natural gas per day, and depending on market conditions, can be expanded to
1.1 bcf per day. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $230 million. In December 1999, Guardian filed for a FERC certificate of public convenience and necessity, which would
authorize construction.

NRG
conducts business domestically and internationally through various subsidiaries, including: NRG International, Inc.; NEO Corporation; NRG Energy Center, Inc; NRG Operating
Services, Inc.; NRG Northeast Generating LLC; NRG South Central Generating LLC; and other businesses and affiliates.

The
summary on page 22 describes NRG's most significant projects. Additional information is included in Item 1 of NRG's 1999 Form 10-K, which is incorporated by
reference via Exhibit 99.02.

NRG New Business Development

NRG is pursuing several energy-related investment opportunities, including those discussed further, and continues to evaluate other opportunities as they
arise. Potential capital requirements for these opportunities are discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7.

In
April 1999, NRG acquired the Somerset power station for approximately $55 million from Eastern Utilities Associates. The Somerset station, located in Somerset, Mass.,
includes two coal-fired generating facilities and two aeroderivative combustion turbine peaking units with a nominal capacity rating of 160 Mw. NRG owns a 100 percent interest in
the project. In connection with this acquisition, NRG entered into a Wholesale Standard Offer Service Agreement in which NRG is obligated to provide approximately 30 percent of the energy and
capacity requirements of certain EUA affiliates (which is estimated to be approximately 275 Mw at peak requirement) until Dec. 31, 2009.

In
May 1999, NRG and Dynegy acquired the Encina generating station and 17 combustion turbines for approximately $356 million from San Diego Gas & Electric
Company. The facilities, which have a combined capacity of 1,218 Mw, are located near Carlsbad and San Diego, Calif. NRG and Dynegy each own a 50 percent interest.

In
June 1999, NRG acquired the Huntley and Dunkirk generating stations from Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. (NIMO) for approximately $355 million. The two
coal-fired plants are located near Buffalo, N.Y., and have a combined summer capacity of 1,360 Mw. NRG owns a 100 percent interest in the project. In connection with this
acquisition, NRG entered into several Transition Power Purchase Agreements in which NIMO will purchase energy and capacity from these facilities for four years. NRG has agreed to sell
100 percent of the capacity of and an option to purchase up to 39 percent of the annual energy output from the Dunkirk facility to NIMO at fixed prices.

In
June 1999, NRG acquired the Arthur Kill generating station and the Astoria gas turbine site for approximately $505 million from Consolidated Edison Company (ConEd).
These facilities, which are located in the New York City area, have a combined summer capacity of 1,456 Mw. NRG owns a 100 percent interest in these projects. In connection with these
acquisitions, NRG has agreed to sell to ConEd energy from the Arthur Kill and Astoria facilities at a fixed price in varying amounts, as specified by ConEd, up to the full capability of each facility.
In addition, NRG has agreed to sell to ConEd at a fixed price, during certain periods, up to 100 percent of the capacity of the Arthur Kill generating facility and Astoria gas turbines
facility.


In
August 1999, a U.S. district judge issued a settlement order clearing the way for Louisiana Generating LLC to be confirmed as the winning bidder for Cajun Electric Power
Cooperative's 1,708 Mw of fossil-fueled generation. NRG currently owns 100 percent of Louisiana Generating. It is expected that output from the base-load Cajun facility will be sold
principally under long-term contracts. The acquisition, for approximately $1 billion, is expected to close at the end of the first quarter of 2000.

In
October 1999, NRG purchased the 1,700-Mw oil and gas-fired Oswego generating station, located in Oswego, N.Y., for approximately $85 million
from Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation and Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation. NRG owns a 100 percent interest in the project.

In
November 1999, NRG agreed to purchase the 665-Mw Killingholme A station from National Power plc. Killingholme A was commissioned in 1994 and is a combined-cycle,
gas-turbine power station located in England. The purchase price for the station will be approximately 410 million pounds sterling (approximately $662 million at
end-of-year exchange rates) subject to commercial adjustments.

In
December 1999, NRG purchased gas and oil electric generating stations with a combined capacity of 2,235 Mw for $460 million from Connecticut Light & Power
Company (CL&P). The facilities are located throughout Connecticut. NRG owns a 100 percent interest in the project. NRG entered into a Standard Offer Service Wholesale Sales Agreement with CL&P.
NRG will supply CL&P with 35 percent of its standard offer service load during 2000, 40 percent during 2001 and 2002 and 45 percent during 2003.

In
December 1999, NRG purchased a 50 percent interest in the Rocky Road Power Plant, a 250-Mw natural gas-fired simple-cycle peaking facility in
East Dundee, Ill., from Dynegy Inc. for approximately $60 million. The power plant began commercial operations on June 30, 1999, and received approval in October 1999 for
the installation of an additional 100-Mw natural gas combustion turbine, increasing the facilities generating capacity to 350 Mw. The expansion is expected to be in service before the
start of the peak summer 2000 season.

In
December 1999, NRG sold a portion of its ownership interest in Cogeneration Corp. of America (CogenAmerica) to Calpine Corp. As a result of the sale, NRG recorded a gain of
approximately 3 cents per share and reduced its ownership stake in CogenAmerica from 45 percent to 20 percent.

In
January 2000, NRG reached agreement to purchase 1,875 Mw of fossil-fueled electric generation assets in the Northeast region of the United States from Conectiv. The purchase
price is approximately $800 million. NRG will sell 500 Mw of energy around the clock to Delmarva Power and Light Company under a five-year agreement. The remaining energy and
capacity will be sold into the markets in the Northeast region of the United States. NRG will own a 100 percent interest in the project.

In
February 2000, NRG executed a memorandum of understanding with GE Power Systems, a division of General Electric Company, to purchase 11 gas turbine generators and five steam
turbine generators over the next five years for approximately $500 million. NRG intends to install the 16 turbines, having a combined capacity of 3,000 Mw, at its existing North American plant
sites.

NRG
has a 25 percent equity interest in the Enfield Energy Centre Ltd., a 396-Mw natural gas power project located in England. The power station is expected
to begin commercial operations in 2000. The power station will sell its output to the UK grid.

Seren Innovations, Inc.

Seren was formed in November 1996 to pursue communications and data services business. Seren is constructing a combination cable television, telephone
and high-speed Internet access system in Minnesota, California and Colorado. Seren is pursuing additional development in other markets.


Energy Masters International, Inc.

EMI began operations in 1993. EMI primarily offers retrofitting and upgrading facilities for greater energy efficiency on a national basis. In 1995, EMI
acquired Energy Masters Corporation, a company that specializes in energy efficiency improvement services for commercial, industrial and institutional customers. In 1997, EMI acquired
100 percent of Energy Solutions International Inc., an energy management firm.

In
1995, EMI and Atlantic Energy Enterprises established Enerval LLC, which provided natural gas services in the northeast United States. EMI's investment in Enerval was written down
to an estimate of its net realizable value in 1997. In 1998, EMI sold its interest in Enerval.

Eloigne Company

Eloigne was established in 1993 and its principal business is the acquisition of rental housing projects that qualify for low-income housing tax
credits under current federal tax law. As of Dec. 31, 1999, approximately $76 million had been invested in Eloigne projects, including approximately $22 million in wholly owned
properties and approximately $54 million in equity interests in jointly-owned projects. These investments and related working capital requirements have been financed with approximately
$47 million of long-term debt and the remainder with equity capital.

Completed
Eloigne projects as of Dec. 31, 1999, are expected to generate tax credits of $78 million over the 10-year period 2000-2009. Tax
credits recognized in 1999 as a result of these investments were approximately $9 million.

Ultra Power Technologies, Inc.

Ultra Power, formed in 1997, markets a proactive, non-destructive, power cable testing technology. Ultra Power has exclusive marketing rights to
this technology throughout the United States and Canada. Ultra Power markets this service to utilities and commercial customers with underground cable.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

NSP monitors its operations to ensure the environment is not adversely affected and takes timely corrective actions if past practices have had a negative
impact on the environment. Significant resources are dedicated to environmental training, monitoring and compliance. NSP strives to comply with all applicable environmental laws.

NSP-Wisconsin
has been named as one of three potentially responsible parties in connection with environmental contamination at a site in Ashland, Wis.
NSP-Wisconsin has recorded a liability for an estimate of its share of the cost of remediating a portion of the Ashland site based on information available to date. For further discussion
of the Ashland site see Note 14 to the Financial Statements under Item 8.

NSP
is potentially liable for remediation of waste disposal sites and for decommissioning and restoration of present and former plant sites. For further discussion of environmental
matters, see Note 14 to the Financial Statements under Item 8.

With
the acquisition of the NRG Northeast assets, NRG assumed certain liabilities for existing environmental conditions at the sites with the exception of off-site
liabilities associated with the disposal of hazardous materials and certain other environmental liabilities.

Environmental
site assessments have been prepared for all of the recently acquired NRG Northeast assets. The remediation activities at the Arthur Kill, Astoria and Somerset facilities
are still in the study


phase.
As such, remediation cost estimates are based on approaches that have yet to be approved by the regulatory agencies involved. Data from additional investigations performed at the Astoria Gas
Turbines and the approach being taken at the Somerset Station may result in less costly remediation efforts than budgeted.

For
the Connecticut facilities, NRG is planning to conduct additional studies to better quantify remedial needs. Such studies include the preparation of risk assessments to justify
remedial actions proposed
by NRG to the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Permits

NSP's regulated businesses are required to renew environmental operating permits for their facilities at least every five years. NSP believes that it is in
compliance, in all material respects, with environmental permitting requirements.

Waste Disposal

Spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal issues are discussed in "Nuclear Power Plants—Operation and Waste Disposal" and in Notes 13 and 14 of Notes
to Financial Statements under Item 8.

NSP
has met or exceeded the state and federal removal and disposal requirements for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) equipment. NSP has removed nearly all known PCB capacitors from its
distribution system, network transformers and equipment in power plants. NSP continues to dispose of PCB-contaminated mineral oil and equipment in accordance with regulations.
PCB-contaminated mineral oil is detoxified and reused or burned for energy recovery at permitted facilities. Any future cleanup or remediation costs associated with past PCB disposal
practices are unknown at this time.

Air Emissions Control And Monitoring

In 1994, the U.S. EPA proposed air emission guidelines for municipal waste combustors. To meet the federal and state requirements, NSP-Minnesota
has completed installation of additional pollution-control and monitoring equipment at the Red Wing and Wilmarth plants at a cost of $12 million. NSP-Wisconsin's French Island
facility will be subject to the EPA's small municipal waste combustor regulations. These have not yet been finalized but could result in installation of additional pollution control and monitoring
equipment.

The
Clean Air Act calls for reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from electric generating plants. NSP has expended significant amounts over the
years to reduce SO2 emissions at its plants. Improvements have been made at the Sherco and King plants to reduce emissions of NOx to comply with Phase II requirements.

In
1996, a wet electrostatic precipitator (wet ESP) was installed at Sherco to reduce particulate emissions and lower opacity. NSP has chosen to convert multiple scrubber modules on
Sherco units 1 and 2 to the wet ESP design. Capital investment to date for the prototype has been $21 million. NSP estimates total capital expenditures for this project through 2002 will be
$46 million.

In
1997, the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and fine particulate matter. In 1999, these standards were remanded to the EPA for reconsideration. It is
unknown if the EPA will simply try to re-adopt the 1997 standards or propose additional changes. It is anticipated, based on historical monitoring, that NSP will be in compliance with the
1997 standards. However, if the standards change or if an area is determined not to comply with the standards, reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions could be required.


The
Clean Air Act requires the EPA to investigate the impact of air toxic emissions from utilities and, if appropriate, recommend regulations to control those emissions. The EPA
delivered a report to Congress in early 1998 that recommended additional investigation of air toxic emissions. The report did
not recommend any controls on utility boilers at that time. In 1999, the EPA issued an Information Collection Request (ICR) that required utilities to analyze coal shipments for mercury and share the
results the EPA. In addition, a number of coal-fired units were randomly selected to conduct mercury emissions stack tests. NSP-Minnesota's Sherco Unit 3 was one of the units
selected. Testing is scheduled for completion in 2000. The EPA intends to utilize all of the ICR data collected to make a regulatory determination on the need for mercury controls on
coal-fired utility boilers by the end of 2000. As part of the Minnesota Mercury Reduction Initiative, NSP-Minnesota has been asked to submit to the MPCA a plan outlining steps
the company will take as part of this voluntary effort. The plan is expected to be submitted in early 2000.

On
Oct. 14, 1999, New York Gov. Pataki directed the Commissioner of the New York Department of Environment Conservation to require further reductions of SO2 emissions and NOx
emissions from New York power plants, beyond what is required under current federal and state law. Under Gov. Pataki's directive, NOx emissions during the "non-ozone" season would be
reduced to levels consistent with those currently mandated for the "ozone" season under the Ozone Transport Commission's Memorandum of Understanding. This additional reduction requirement would be
phased in between 2003 and 2007. In addition, Gov. Pataki announced that he is ordering a reduction of S02 emissions by 50 percent beyond the requirements of the federal acid rain program.
These reductions would also be phased in between 2003 and 2007. Compliance with these emission reduction requirements, if they become effective, could have a material impact on the operation of NRG's
facilities located in New York.

In
1994, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was established. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was drafted and adopted at the third conference. This Protocol will
become effective following ratification by 55 countries, provided those 55 countries account for at least 55 percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990. Since the Conference at
Kyoto, there have been several conferences in which significant progress has been made to turn the broad concepts of Kyoto into working realities, including the development of an action plan. The
sixth Conference will meet in November 2000 to continue development of the plan. Although the U.S. has signed the Kyoto Protocol, it must be ratified by the U.S. Senate for the U.S. to become a
party to the protocol. If the U.S. becomes a party, the Kyoto Protocol would impose, during the first commitment period of 2008-2012, a binding obligation on the U.S. to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions by 7 percent below 1990 levels. Until the details regarding the action plan are completed, the impact on NSP cannot be determined.

As
discussed in Note 14 to the Financial Statements under Item 8, NSP-Wisconsin challenged the EPA NOx emission regulations. In March 2000, the Court ruled
that the EPA unlawfully included Wisconsin in the scope of the NOx rules. That decision releases NSP-Wisconsin from the new NOx rules.

Water Quality Monitoring

To comply with federal and state laws and state regulatory permit requirements, NSP has installed environmental monitoring systems at all coal and RDF ash
landfills and coal stockpiles to assess and monitor the impact of these facilities on the quality of ground and surface waters. Degradation of water quality in the state is prohibited by law and
requires remedial action for restoration to an acceptable clean-up level.

Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMF)

EMF surround electric wires and conductors of electricity such as electrical tools, household wiring, appliances, electric distribution lines, electric
substations and high-voltage electric transmission lines. Extensive research has been conducted in the last three decades concerning the possibility that adverse


health
effects may result from exposure to power-frequency fields surrounding transmission and distribution lines and the electrical appliances and devices that are common in residences and
workplaces. By 1995, it was generally concluded in the scientific community that there was no consistent evidence that exposure to EMF produced by power lines and electric devices causes cancer or
produces other adverse effects on human health. Extensive research studies published since 1995 have reinforced this view. The nation's electric utilities, including NSP, continue to support research
in an effort to determine whether exposure to EMF causes health effects.

Contingencies

Both regulatory requirements and environmental technology change rapidly. NSP cannot estimate the extent to which it may be required by law, in the future, to
make additional capital expenditures or incur additional operating expenses for environmental purposes. NSP also cannot predict whether future environmental regulations might result in significant
reductions in generating capacity or efficiency or otherwise affect NSP's income, operations or facilities.

CAPITAL SPENDING AND FINANCING

NSP's capital spending program is designed to assure that there will be adequate generating, transmission and distribution capacity to meet the future needs of
its utility service area, and to fund investments in nonregulated businesses. NSP continually reassesses needs and, when necessary, appropriate changes are made in the capital expenditure program.
Current year capital spending activity and future financing requirements and sources are discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis under Item 7.

NSP
and Dairyland Power Cooperative have proposed building an electric transmission system between NSP's Chisago substation in eastern Minnesota and Dairyland's Apple River substation
in northwestern Wisconsin in response to a need for additional reliability and capacity in both regions. During 1999, the PSCW granted permission to build the system. Approval from Minnesota
regulators is pending. The Minnesota Department of Commerce (MDC) recommended against building the line as it is proposed, although they did acknowledge the need for more transmission capacity. Its
recommendation will be considered by the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board (MEQB), which has the authority to approve or deny the project. NSP and Dairyland have responded to additional data
requests from the MDC to be used in the regulatory proceedings in Minnesota. At this time, the administrative law judge is reviewing the case and parties are making their cases before him. A decision
from the MEQB is expected in mid-2000.

In
March 2000, NRG issued $250 million of 8.70 percent 20-year remarketable or redeemable securities through an unconsolidated grantor trust. The
funds were subsequently converted to 160 million pound sterling and will be used to finance NRG's investment in the Killingholme power station in England.

In
March 2000, NRG South Central Generating LLC, a subsidiary of NRG, issued $800 million of senior secured bonds in a two-part offering. The first tranche was for
$500 million with a coupon of 8.962 percent and a maturity of 2016. The second tranche was for $300 million with a coupon of 9.479 percent and a maturity of 2024. The
proceeds will be used to finance NRG's investment in the Cajun generating facilities.

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

At year-end 1999, there were 9,098 full- and part-time NSP employees and 8,180 benefit employees. Approximately 3,204
employees are represented by five local International Brotherhood of Electric Workers (IBEW) labor unions.


Union Contract Extension

In 1999, NSP and the five IBEW local unions representing NSP employees reached agreement on a five-year extension of the collective bargaining
agreement. The contract expires at the end of 2004.

Wage increases

In January 1999, nonbargaining employees received an average wage increase of 4.0 percent, and bargaining employees received a 2.0 percent
base wage scale increase. In January 2000, nonbargaining employees received an average wage increase of 4.0 percent and bargaining employees received a 3.5 percent base wage scale
increase.

Benefit Changes

NSP revised its retirement plans for nonbargaining employees (effective January 1999) and bargaining employees (effective January 2000) as
follows:

NSP's electric generating facilities provided 74 percent of its kwh requirements in 1999. The current generating facilities are expected
to be adequate base load sources of electric energy until 2003-2006, as detailed in NSP-Minnesota's electric resource plan filed with the MPUC in 1998. All of NSP's major
generating stations are located in Minnesota on land owned by NSP-Minnesota.


At
Dec. 31, 1999, NSP had overhead and underground transmission and distribution lines as follows:

Voltage

Length (Pole Miles)

500kv


345kv


230kv


161kv


115kv

1,636

Less than 115kv

49,612

NSP also has approximately 284 transmission and distribution substations with capacities greater than 10,000 kilovoltamperes (kva) and
approximately 288 with capacities less than 10,000 kva.

Manitoba
Hydro, Minnesota Power Company and NSP completed the construction of a 500-kv transmission interconnection between Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and the
Minneapolis-St Paul, Minnesota, area in 1980. NSP has a contract with Manitoba Hydro for 500 Mw of firm power utilizing this transmission line. In addition, NSP is interconnected with
Manitoba Hydro through a 230-kv transmission line completed in 1970. In 1995, a project was completed to increase the Manitoba-U.S. transmission interconnection by a nominal
400 Mw to 1,900 Mw.

Plans
are currently being implemented for electric delivery system upgrades to accommodate load growth expected in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area through 2010. As the least
cost option to accommodate the load growth, portions of the 69-kv transmission facilities, especially those located on the outskirts of the Twin Cities, are being reconductored and
operated at 115 kv; distribution development in these areas has been converted to 34.5 kv. By reconductoring on existing right-of-ways and increasing distribution voltage, the
requirements for new right-of-ways and substation sites are minimized compared with other alternatives for serving the load growth.

NSP
natural gas mains include approximately 117 miles of transmission mains and approximately 9,637 miles of distribution mains. In addition, Viking owns a 670-mile
interstate natural gas pipeline serving portions of Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota.

Virtually
all of the utility plant of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin are subject to the lien of their first mortgage bond indentures pursuant to which they
have issued first mortgage bonds.

For
discussion and information concerning nonregulated properties, see "Nonregulated Subsidiaries" under Item 1, incorporated by reference.

Item 3—Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, various lawsuits and claims have arisen against NSP. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, has recorded an
estimate of the probable cost of settlement or other disposition for such matters.

On
Nov. 24, 1998, Wisconsin Electric Power Co. (WE) filed a complaint against NSP with the FERC, relating to transmission service curtailments. In March 1999, NSP and WE
reached a settlement agreement, which was approved by the FERC on May 19, 1999. The settlement provides that NSP would not be liable to WE for transmission curtailments during 1998 and NSP
would bear certain disputed transmission mitigation costs for 1998 and 1999. The settlement is not material.

On
June 8, 1998, NSP filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims against the Department of Energy (DOE) requesting damages in excess of $1 billion for the DOE's
partial breach of the Standard Contract. NSP requested damages consisting of the costs of storage of spent nuclear fuel at the Prairie Island nuclear generating plant, anticipated costs related to the
Private Fuel Storage, LLC and costs relating to the 1994 state legislation limiting the number of casks that can be used to store spent nuclear fuel at Prairie Island. On April 6, 1999, the
Court of Federal Claims dismissed NSP's complaint. On May 20, 1999, NSP filed a notice of appeals with the Federal Circuit and on July 20, 1999, NSP filed its


initial
brief on appeal. The Department of Justice, representing the United States, filed its initial brief on Oct. 29, 1999. No date has been set for oral argument. A decision is expected in
mid-2000.

On
Aug. 7, 1998, a group of residential and commercial customers brought a class action lawsuit against the DOE in the Federal District Court in Minneapolis, Minn. The suit
demands the return of monies paid by customers into the nuclear waste fund and other damages, based on the failure of the DOE to meets its unconditional obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel by
Jan. 31, 1998. NSP is named as nominal defendant because NSP has the contract with the DOE under which payments are made into the fund. On Dec. 23, 1999, the Court dismissed the class
action suit.

In
1997, NSP was served with a summons and complaint on behalf of the owners of Schachtner Farms located in Deer Park, Wis. The complaint alleged that stray voltage from NSP's system
harmed their dairy herd, resulting in lost milk production, injury to the dairy herd, lost profits and increased veterinary expenses. On Nov. 23, 1999, the jury returned a verdict finding NSP
negligent and awarding Schachtner Farms $850,000 for economic damages and $200,000 for inconvenience, annoyance and loss of use and enjoyment of their property plus costs and interest. The Court
trebled the damages because the jury found that NSP was willful, wanton or reckless in its failure to provide adequate service to the farm. NSP has appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals, Third
District, of the State of Wisconsin. NSP-Wisconsin anticipates that insurance will indemnify it for all damages and costs subject to applicable insurance policy deductibles.

a discussion of other legal claims, see "Legal Claims" in Note 14 to the Financial Statements under Item 8, incorporated by reference. For a discussion of environmental
proceedings, see "Environmental Matters" under Item 1, incorporated by reference. For a discussion of proceedings involving NSP's utility rates, see "Utility Regulation and Revenues" and "Gas Utility

Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis

Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation (NSP-Minnesota), has two significant subsidiaries: Northern States Power Company, a
Wisconsin corporation (NSP-Wisconsin), and NRG Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (NRG). NSP-Minnesota also has several other subsidiaries, including Viking Gas
Transmission Company (Viking), Energy Masters International, Inc. (EMI), Eloigne Company (Eloigne), Seren Innovations, Inc. (Seren) and Ultra Power Technologies, Inc. (Ultra
Power). NSP-Minnesota and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as NSP.

FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES AND RESULTS

Because of several significant charges and adverse weather conditions (both are discussed later), 1999 earnings declined and NSP fell short of some of its
financial objectives. This decline in earnings is not representative of NSP's continuing operational and financial strength.

Our
earnings objective for 2000 is $1.95 per share, including build-out costs at Seren, which have reduced the projection by 15 cents per share. NRG is expected to
contribute 80 cents per share, or about 40 percent of NSP's earnings. These projections assume NSP continues to own 100 percent of NRG and Seren.

In
June 1999, NSP increased its dividend for the 25th consecutive year. The increase of 2 cents per share raised the dividend per share from $1.43 to $1.45 on an annual basis.
At the time of the
proposed merger to form Xcel Energy, the annual dividend is expected to be increased to $1.50 per share, equivalent to the current dividend of New Century Energies (NCE) adjusted for the 1.55 exchange
ratio.

NSP's
objective is to maintain continued financial strength with an AA rating for utility bonds. NSP-Minnesota's first mortgage bonds were rated:

•

AA-
by Fitch IBCA


•

AA
by Standard & Poors

•

Aa3
by Moody's Investors Service

The
three rating agencies placed NSP's bond ratings under review upon announcement of its merger with NCE. These ratings and the review reflect the views of rating agencies, which can
provide an explanation of the significance. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency. First
mortgage bonds issued by NSP-Wisconsin carry comparable ratings.

BUSINESS STRATEGIES

NSP's mission is to be a recognized leader in the energy industry by increasing the value provided to our customers with energy-related products and services.
We will utilize the skills and talents of our people to thrive in a dynamic and competitive energy environment that provides increased value for our customers and shareholders and significant growth
opportunities for our company. NSP continues to move forward with its 10-Point Game Plan to achieve this mission.

Grow NRG

—NRG's goal is to become a top independent power producer in each of its core markets: North America, Europe and
Asia-Pacific. NRG expects to achieve this goal by profitably growing existing businesses and adding new businesses. NRG's asset acquisitions have enabled its earnings to grow from 16 cents
per share in 1997 to 37 cents per share in 1999. NRG's long-term goal is to increase its earnings by an average of 25 percent per year. During 1999, NRG completed more than
$1.6 billion of asset acquisitions, increasing its generation capability by more than 7,500 megawatts. During 2000, NRG expects to spend approximately $2.7 billion to acquire or develop
more than 6,000 megawatts of generating facilities.

Position NSP's Generation Business for Long-Term Value

—NSP's conventional plants include
coal-fired, hydro, refuse-derived fuel, natural gas and oil-fired facilities. NSP will make strategic investments designed to enhance the value of these generating assets.

Create an Independent Nuclear Company

—With increasing regulation and associated costs in the nuclear industry, NSP believes
the best way to enhance NSP's nuclear assets is to combine our operations with other well-run nuclear plants and create a Nuclear Management Company. During 1999, NSP, Alliant Energy,
Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service Corporation formed a Nuclear Management Company (NMC) to provide services to member companies.

Expand Energy Marketing

—To enhance NSP's position in the increasingly competitive electric market, NSP has expanded its
wholesale energy marketing efforts by establishing an Energy Marketing function. Energy Marketing is responsible for meeting the requirements of NSP's retail and wholesale electric customers for
low-cost energy, while optimizing margins from NSP's generation resources.

Provide for Independent Transmission Operations

—To foster competition in the wholesale electricity market, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requires the transmission portion of a utility's business to be functionally separate from the utility's generation facilities. The state of Wisconsin also calls
for a separate transmission operating structure. During 1999, NSP joined the Midwest Independent System Operator (Midwest ISO) because it is the most effective means available to enhance the
competitive market for wholesale electricity.

Expand NSP's Core Electric and Gas Distribution Business

—To expand our core business, NSP will actively seek to acquire and
merge with other energy companies. During 1999, NSP announced its plans to merge with NCE and form Xcel Energy. While NSP cannot guarantee the timing or receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals,
NSP currently expects the merger to be completed by the middle of 2000.

Develop Seren

—Seren provides broadband telecommunications services, including high-speed Internet access,
telephone service and cable TV and soon will provide video-on-demand. Seren is expanding its broadband network in Minnesota, California and Colorado.


Grow Viking

—NSP's goal is to continue the growth of Viking through pipeline expansion. During 1999, Viking completed a
5 percent capacity expansion. In addition, Viking, WICOR and CMS Energy announced plans to build a 147-mile natural gas pipeline to serve northern Illinois and southeastern
Wisconsin.

Drive EMI to Profitability

—EMI is narrowing its focus to concentrate on retrofitting and upgrading customer facilities for
greater energy efficiency.

Manage NSP's Entire Business as a Portfolio

—NSP will manage its collective businesses as a portfolio of assets with a focus
on growth. NSP will acquire or divest businesses and assets if it will increase shareholder value. Pooling restrictions, associated with NSP's proposed merger with NCE, limit NSP's ability to divest
assets for a period of time.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

The following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on NSP's financial condition and results of operations
during the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Financial Statements and Notes.

Except
for the historical statements contained in this report, the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis are forward-looking statements that are subject to
certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Such forward-looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "objective," "outlook,"
"possible," "potential" and similar expressions. Actual results may vary materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to:

•

general
economic conditions, including their impact on capital expenditures

•

business
conditions in the energy industry

•

competitive
factors

•

unusual
weather

•

changes
in federal or state legislation

•

items described under "Factors Affecting Results of Operations"

•

the
other risk factors listed from time to time by NSP in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Exhibit 99.01
to NSP's 1999 report on Form 10-K

Proposed Business Combination

—On March 24, 1999, NSP and NCE agreed to merge and form a new entity, Xcel
Energy. The merger requires approval or regulatory review by certain state and federal regulators. The merger is expected to be a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange
for shareholders of both companies and to be accounted for as a pooling of interests. At the time of the merger, Xcel Energy will register as a holding company.


The
Xcel Energy board of directors will determine the dividend payment level of Xcel Energy. However, NSP anticipates that Xcel Energy will adopt an initial dividend equivalent to the
current dividend of NCE. Based on the conversion ratio of 1.55 shares of Xcel common stock for each share of NCE stock, the pro forma dividend for Xcel Energy would currently be $1.50 per share
annually.

For
more discussion of this merger, see Note 15 to the Financial Statements. The following discussion and analysis is based on the financial condition and operations of NSP and
does not reflect the potential effects of the proposed merger between NSP and NCE.

The
combination of four significant one-time items accounted for a decline in 1999 earnings per share of 40 cents compared with 1998.

Conservation Incentive Recovery 1998

—In 1999, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) denied NSP recovery of 1998
lost margins, load management discounts and incentives associated with state-mandated programs for electric energy conservation. NSP recorded a $35 million charge based on this action, which
reduced 1999 earnings by 14 cents per share. This charge represented a $32 million reduction in accrued revenue and a reduction of carrying charges. NSP may appeal the decision on 1998
conservation incentives.

Conservation Incentive Recovery 1999

—At the end of 1999, the MPUC had not approved a conservation plan for 1999 or
subsequent years. Based on the change in MPUC policy on conservation incentives and regulatory uncertainty, management decided not to accrue any conservation incentives for 1999. On Jan. 27,
2000, the MPUC approved a conservation incentive plan under which utilities could earn incentives up to 30 percent of their annual conservation spending. For NSP, the maximum amount of
conservation incentives that could be earned is approximately $10 million, with the actual incentive dependent on performance compared with conservation goals. The MPUC also decided that the
conservation incentive program is not linked to earnings levels. NSP estimates it could potentially earn $2 million-$3 million in 2000 for 1999 performance. NSP will file its performance
report with the MPUC in the spring of 2000 and request approval of the appropriate amount based on final conservation program results for 1999. In addition, the MPUC denied NSP's request to allow rate
recovery of load management discounts provided to certain customers.

NSP's
1998 earnings included approximately 13 cents per share from accrued conservation incentives. Including carrying charges, the reversal of 1998 conservation incentives reduced
1999 earnings by 14
cents per share, a decrease of 27 cents per share compared with incentive recovery levels in 1998. The earnings impacts in 1999 are non-cash accrual adjustments. NSP will make a filing
with the MPUC in 2000 to address the cash impacts of conservation incentives collected in rates, including any overcollections for 1998 and 1999.


EMI Goodwill

—NSP recorded a pretax charge of approximately $17 million, or about 8 cents per share, to write off all
goodwill that was recorded by its subsidiary EMI for its acquisitions of Energy Masters Corporation in 1995 and Energy Solutions International in 1997. This charge reflects a revised business outlook
based on recent levels of contract signings by EMI.

Loss on Marketable Securities

—During 1999, NSP recorded pretax charges of approximately $14 million, or 5 cents per
share, for a valuation write-down on its investment in the publicly traded common stock of CellNet Data Systems, Inc. In October 1999, CellNet announced it was experiencing
financial difficulties and was contemplating restructuring its capital financing. In February 2000, CellNet filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. At Dec. 31,1999, the remaining
value of NSP's investment in CellNet stock was approximately $1 million and Seren had approximately $5 million of intangible assets related to CellNet. Recovery of these assets is
uncertain, pending the resolution of CellNet's financial difficulties.

2.7 percent over 1999, or 2.1 percent on a weather-adjusted basis. Sales for resale volumes and revenues increased in 1999 and 1998 due to the expansion of NSP's wholesale energy
marketing operations.

Electric
production expenses tend to vary with changing retail and wholesale sales requirements and unit cost changes in fuel and purchased power. Due to fuel clause cost recovery
mechanisms for retail customers and the ability to vary wholesale prices with changing market conditions, most fluctuations in energy costs do not affect electric margin. However, during
July 1999, NSP's service territory experienced extremely high temperatures, which drove customer usage to record levels. With NSP's power plants operating at maximum available capacity, market
conditions forced NSP to purchase the power necessary to serve customer demand at very high costs. NSP's fuel clause billing adjustment process in Minnesota does not allow for the recovery of capacity
charges above the levels reflected in base rates. In addition, NSP-Wisconsin does not have an automatic fuel clause to recover increased energy and capacity charges from customers. Without
the ability to obtain full recovery, these unusually high energy and capacity costs reduced electric margin as shown below.

to more unfavorable weather in 1998, compared with 1997, partially offset by sales growth. Interruptible sales declined in 1998 because lower alternate fuel prices caused interruptible customers to
purchase less natural gas and customers were able to switch to transportation-only service. Firm gas sales in 2000 are estimated to be 15.1 percent higher than 1999 sales, or
2.2 percent higher on a weather-adjusted basis.

The
cost of gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and unit cost of gas purchases. However, due to purchased gas cost recovery mechanisms for retail customers,
fluctuations in the cost of gas have little effect on gas margin. The following table summarizes the principal reasons for gas margin changes during the past two years:

Other Operation, Maintenance and Administrative and General

—Expenses decreased in 1999 by $15.2 million, or
2.1 percent, compared with 1998. 1999 expenses decreased primarily due to cost control, including lower employee benefit costs, higher levels of insurance refunds and lower Year 2000
remediation costs.

Expenses
increased in 1998 by $48.3 million, or 7.2 percent, compared with 1997. The higher costs in 1998 are primarily due to increased expenses associated with plant
outages, nuclear regulatory costs, storm damage, Year 2000 remediation, energy marketing activities, customer growth and an insurance refund in 1997.


Depreciation and Amortization

—Costs increased $17.5 million in 1999 and $12.3 million in 1998, primarily due
to higher levels of depreciable plant, including new information systems and equipment with relatively short depreciable lives.

NONOPERATING UTILITY ITEMS

Utility Financing Costs

—Interest costs for NSP's utility businesses were $128.5 million in 1999,
$115.8 million in 1998 and $120.3 million in 1997. The 1999 increase is largely due to higher average short-term debt levels to support financing needs. The 1998 decrease is
largely due to lower average short-term debt levels, partially offset by increased long-term debt levels. For more information, see the Statements of Capitalization.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFC)

—AFC declined primarily due to reductions in carrying charges and other
adjustments related to conservation incentive adjustments, as discussed previously, and less construction activity presumed to be financed with equity capital.

Primergy Merger Costs

—In May 1997, NSP and Wisconsin Energy Corp. mutually terminated their plans to merge. NSP's
earnings for 1997 include a pretax charge to nonoperating expense of $29 million, or 12 cents per share, to write off its cumulative merger-related costs incurred.

NRG

—NRG's earnings increased for 1999, compared with 1998, primarily due to acquisitions of generating facilities in the
Northeast region of the United States. During 1999, NRG recognized a gain of approximately 3 cents per share due to the partial sale of its interest in Cogeneration Corporation of America. Results for
1999 also reflected increased earnings from MIBRAG. These increased earnings were partially offset by the effects of cooler-than-normal weather in California, which reduced
equity earnings at the El Segundo, Long Beach and Encina generating stations. In addition, earnings were decreased by costs related to project acquisitions and business development, and increased
interest expenses. Also, equity earnings were affected by several other factors, including a currency transaction adjustment relating to the Kladno project and a decrease in earnings from NEO, NRG's
landfill gas affiliate.


NRG's
earnings increased in 1998, compared with 1997, primarily due to income from new projects. In addition, NEO generated higher levels of energy tax credits. Increased earnings
were partially offset by higher interest costs. Also, NRG's earnings in 1998 were adversely affected by declines in the value of the Australian dollar and German deutsche mark in relation to the U.S.
dollar. In 1997, NRG's investment in the Sunnyside project was written down by $9 million, or 4 cents per share.

In
1998, NRG sold one-half of its 50 percent interest in Enfield Energy Centre Ltd. for approximately $26 million, resulting in an
after-tax gain of approximately $17 million. This gain increased 1998 earnings by approximately 11 cents per share. Also in 1998, NRG recorded a charge of approximately
$22 million ($15 million after tax) to write down its investment in a 400-megawatt coal-fired power station in West Java, due to the political and economic
instability in Indonesia. This write-down reduced 1998 earnings by approximately 10 cents per share.

Further
information on NRG's financial results may be obtained from NRG's annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.

EMI

—EMI's losses for 1999 were greater than 1998, due to the write-off of goodwill associated with two
acquisitions, as previously discussed. The write-off of goodwill reduced 1999 results by approximately 8 cents per share. EMI's losses for 1998 were lower than 1997, due to increased
margins in 1998 and losses incurred by Enerval in 1997, a joint venture previously held by EMI. In 1998, EMI sold its interest in Enerval. EMI's investment in Enerval was written down in 1997.

Eloigne

—Eloigne's earnings grew in 1999 and 1998 due to new investments in affordable housing projects.

Seren

—Seren's build-out of its broadband communications network in St. Cloud, Minn., and initial construction
in northern California resulted in losses for 1999 and 1998, consistent with Seren's business plan.

FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NSP's utility revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions, general business conditions and the cost of energy services. Various
regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and gas service within their respective jurisdictions. In addition, NSP's nonregulated businesses are becoming a more significant factor in NSP's
earnings. The historical and future trends of NSP's operating results have been and are expected to be affected by the following factors:

Regulation

—NSP's utility rates are approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state regulatory
commissions in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Arizona and Michigan. Rates are designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. NSP requests
changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions. The rates charged to retail customers in Wisconsin are reviewed and adjusted biennially. Because comprehensive
rate changes are requested infrequently in Minnesota, NSP's primary jurisdiction, changes in operating costs can affect NSP's financial results. Except for Wisconsin electric operations, NSP's retail
rate schedules provide for cost-of-energy and resource adjustments to billings and revenues for changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation, purchased energy, purchased
gas and, in Minnesota, conservation and energy management program costs. In Minnesota, changes in electric capacity costs are not recovered through the fuel clause. For Wisconsin electric operations,
where cost-of-energy adjustment clauses are not used, the biennial retail rate review process and an interim fuel cost hearing process provide the opportunity for rate recovery
of changes in electric fuel and purchased energy costs in lieu of a cost-of-energy adjustment clause. In addition to changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate
filings are sales growth, conservation and demand-side management efforts and the cost of capital.

Regulated
public utilities are allowed to record as assets certain costs that would be expensed by nonregulated enterprises and to record as liabilities certain gains that would be
recognized as income by nonregulated enterprises. If restructuring or other changes in the regulatory environment occur, NSP may


no
longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment and may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets and liabilities from its balance sheet. Such changes could have a material adverse
effect on NSP's results of operations in the period the write-off is recorded. At Dec. 31, 1999, NSP reported on its balance sheet regulatory assets of approximately
$136 million and regulatory liabilities of approximately $206 million that would need to be recognized in the income statement in the absence of regulation. In addition to a potential
write-off of regulatory assets and liabilities, deregulation and competition may require recognition of certain "stranded costs" not recoverable under market pricing. NSP currently does
not expect to write off any "stranded costs" unless market price levels change, or cost levels increase above market price levels. See Notes 1 and 9 to the Financial Statements for further discussion
of regulatory deferrals.

Merger Settlement Agreements

—In December 1999, NSP signed separate agreements with the Minnesota Office of Attorney
General and the Minnesota Energy Consumers related to stipulated terms under which those parties would support NSP's proposed merger with NCE. Under the agreements, which contained substantially the
same financial terms, NSP agreed to reduce its Minnesota electric rates by $10 million per year, or approximately 0.6 percent less than current levels, for 2001-2005. The
agreements are subject to the approval of the MPUC and can be terminated in the event the merger does not proceed. Under the agreements, NSP's electric rates may not otherwise be increased through
2005, except under limited circumstances.

In
January 2000, NSP also signed a separate agreement with the Minnesota Dept. of Commerce (MDC), in which the MDC would support NSP's proposed merger with NCE. Under the
agreement NSP agreed not to seek recovery of certain merger costs from customers, to meet various quality standards and to certain provisions affecting the regulatory oversight of Xcel Energy.

Competition

—The Energy Policy Act of 1992 has been a catalyst for comprehensive and significant changes in the operation of
electric utilities, including increased competition. The Act's reform of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) promoted creation of wholesale nonutility power generators and
authorized the FERC to require utilities to provide wholesale transmission services to third parties. The legislation allows utilities and nonregulated companies to build, own and operate power plants
nationally and internationally without being subject to restrictions that previously applied to utilities under the PUHCA.

In
1996, the FERC issued Orders No. 888 and 889 to foster competition in the electric utility industry. These orders give competing wholesale suppliers the ability to transmit
electricity through a utility's transmission system. Order No. 888 grants nondiscriminatory access to transmission service. Order No. 889 seeks to ensure a fair market by imposing
standards of conduct on transmission system owners, by requiring separation of the wholesale power supply function from the transmission system operation function, and by mandating the posting of
transmission availability and pricing information on an electronic bulletin board. NSP has made open access transmission tariff filings and compliance filings with the FERC and believes it is taking
the proper steps to comply with these rules.

Some
states have begun to allow retail customers to choose their electricity supplier, and many other states are considering retail access proposals. The Minnesota Legislature
continues to study the issues, but has determined that further study is necessary before any action can be taken. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) and Wisconsin Legislature have been
focusing their efforts on improving electric reliability by requiring utility infrastructure improvements prior to addressing customer choice. The Michigan Public Service Commission has approved
voluntary plans that began offering retail customers a choice of suppliers in selected markets in 1998. The Michigan Legislature is considering legislation to allow customer choice for all customers
by 2002. The timing of regulatory and
legislative actions regarding restructuring and their impact on NSP cannot be predicted at this time and may be significant.

Transmission Operations

—During 1999, NSP joined the Midwest ISO, a FERC-approved Regional Transmission
Organization (RTO). This action commits the NSP transmission system to control by the


Midwest
ISO and ensures transmission operations in compliance with FERC Order No. 888. Recent developments include:

•

The
Midwest ISO intends to commence operations in 2001. The Midwest ISO will administer transmission service for most of the area extending east from NSP's
service area to Pennsylvania and south through Illinois and Kentucky. NSP remains a member of the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP). MAPP recently signed an agreement with the Midwest
ISO, which may further broaden the scope of the Midwest ISO and regional markets for transmission service.

•

Wisconsin
state law requires the PSCW to order a public utility that owns transmission facilities in Wisconsin to transfer control of its transmission
facilities to an ISO or divest its interest in its transmission facilities to an Independent Transmission Company (ITC) by June 30, 2000. It is expected that during 2000 the PSCW will approve
NSP-Wisconsin's request to join the Midwest ISO and certify that NSP-Wisconsin's joining of the Midwest ISO will satisfy the requirements of this Wisconsin law.

Nuclear Management Company (NMC)

—As part of its game plan, NSP announced its intention to form an independent nuclear
management company. Recent developments include:

•

During
1999, NSP, Wisconsin Electric Power Co., Wisconsin Public Service Corp. and Alliant Energy established an NMC to improve plant performance and
reliability, strengthen operational efficiency, maintain high safety levels and reduce costs. The four companies operate seven nuclear units at five sites, with a total generation capacity exceeding
3,650 megawatts.

•

In
late 1999, NMC member utilities filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to transfer plant operating licenses to the NMC. The four partners,
including NSP, will retain ownership of their respective nuclear plant assets. License transfer would allow the NMC to become an operating company in 2000. During 1999, NSP's board of directors and
the boards of the other utilities approved the transfer of the nuclear operating licenses for their respective companies to the NMC. The request to transfer operating licenses requires approval from
federal regulators, including the NRC.

Used Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal

—In 1994, NSP received legislative authorization from the state of Minnesota to use
17 casks for temporary spent-fuel storage at NSP's Prairie Island nuclear generating facility. NSP has determined that 17 casks will allow operation of the facility until 2007. NSP had
loaded nine of the casks as of Dec. 31, 1999. As a condition of the authorization, the Minnesota Legislature established several resource commitments for NSP, including wind and biomass
generation sources as well as other requirements. NSP is complying with these requirements, as discussed in Note 14 to the Financial Statements.

NSP
and other utilities have an ongoing dispute with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) regarding the DOE's statutory and contractual obligations to provide permanent storage and
disposal facilities for nuclear fuel by Jan. 31, 1998, as required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for more information.

Year 2000 (Y2K)

—NSP's Y2K program covered not only NSP's 2,000 computer applications, consisting of about 75,000 programs
and totaling more than 30 million lines of code, but also the thousands of
hardware and embedded system components in use throughout NSP. Although it appears that NSP successfully transitioned into the year 2000 with no Y2K disruptions to customers or to internal operations,
there are no guarantees that a Y2K-related problem will not surface at a later date. NSP is not presently aware of any such situations; however, occurrences of this type could adversely affect NSP's
business, operating results or financial condition.

NSP
has spent approximately $22 million for Y2K efforts, from 1996-1999. This includes $9 million in 1999. These costs have been expensed as incurred, except
for a small portion deferred for approved rate recovery.


Environmental Matters

—NSP incurs several types of environmental costs, including nuclear plant decommissioning, storage and
ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, remediation of contaminated sites and monitoring of discharges into the environment. Because of greater
environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation, NSP has experienced increasing environmental costs. This trend has caused, and may continue to cause, slightly higher operating expenses
and capital expenditures for environmental compliance. In addition, NRG's recent acquisition of generation facilities will tend to increase nonutility costs for environmental compliance.

In
addition to nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, costs charged to NSP's operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous
materials and wastes were approximately:

•

$32 million
in 1999

•

$32 million
in 1998

•

$31 million
in 1997

NSP's
utility operations expect to spend approximately $35 million per year for 2000-2004. However, the precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including
those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are currently unknown.

Capital
expenditures on environmental improvements at its utility facilities, which include the costs of constructing spent nuclear fuel storage casks, were approximately:

•

$39 million
in 1999

•

$21 million
in 1998

•

$19 million
in 1997

NSP
expects to incur approximately $24 million in capital expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations in 2000 and approximately $74 million for
2000-2004. In addition, NRG expects to incur approximately $44 million in capital expenditures for environmental compliance for 2000-2004. See Notes 13 and 14 to the
Financial Statements for further discussion of NSP's environmental contingencies.

Weather

—NSP's earnings can be significantly affected by weather. Very hot summers and very cold winters increase electric
and gas sales, but can also increase expenses, which may not be fully recoverable. Unseasonably mild weather reduces electric and gas sales. The following summarizes the estimated impact on NSP's
earnings due to temperature variations from historical averages.

•

Weather
in 1999 decreased earnings by an estimated 8 cents per share.

•

Weather
in 1998 decreased earnings by an estimated 11 cents per share.

•

Weather
in 1997 decreased earnings by an estimated 6 cents per share.

Impact of Nonregulated Investments

—A significant portion of NSP's earnings comes from nonregulated operations. NSP expects
to continue investing in nonregulated projects, including domestic and international power production projects through NRG and broadband communications systems through Seren. NSP's nonregulated
businesses may carry a higher level of risk than NSP's traditional utility businesses due to a number of factors, including:

•

competition,
operating risks, dependence on certain suppliers and customers, and domestic and foreign environmental and energy regulations;

•

partnership
and government actions and foreign government, political, economic and currency risks; and

•

development
risks, including uncertainties prior to final legal closing.


Some
of NRG's project investments (as listed in Note 10 to the Financial Statements) consist of minority interests, which may limit NRG's financial risk, but also limit NRG's
ability to control the development or operation of the projects. In addition, significant expenses may be incurred for projects pursued by NRG that do not materialize. The aggregate effect of these
factors creates the potential for volatility in the nonregulated component of NSP's earnings. Accordingly, the historical operating results of NSP's nonregulated businesses may not necessarily be
indicative of future operating results.

Use of Derivatives and Market Risk

—NSP uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates on NRG's international project cash flows, natural gas, electricity and fuel prices on margins and interest rates on the cost of borrowing. See Notes 1 and 11 to the Financial
Statements for further discussion of NSP's financial instruments and derivatives.

The
fair value of NRG's interest rate hedging contracts is sensitive to changes in interest rates. As of Dec. 31, 1999, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates from
prevailing market rates would decrease the market value of NRG's interest rate hedging contracts by approximately $28 million. Conversely, a 10 percent increase in interest rates from
the prevailing market rates would increase the market value by approximately $26 million.

NRG
has an investment in the Kladno project in the Czech Republic. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 52 requires foreign currency gains and losses to flow
through the income statement if settlement of an obligation is in a currency other than the local currency of the entity. A portion of the Kladno project debt is in non-local currency
(U.S. dollars and German deutsche marks). As of Dec. 31, 1999, if the value of the Czech koruna decreased by 10 percent in relation to the U.S. dollar and the German deutsche mark, NRG
would have recorded a $5 million loss (after tax) on the currency transaction adjustment. If the value of the Czech koruna increased by 10 percent, NRG would have recorded a
$5 million gain (after tax) on the currency transaction adjustment.

In
February 1999, EMI transferred its natural gas supply and marketing function to NSP's Energy Marketing division. Sales commitments and natural gas futures and forward
contracts that EMI entered into prior to the transfer remain the contractual responsibility of EMI. As of Dec. 31, 1999, EMI had natural gas forward and futures contracts in the notional amount
of less than $1 million. These contracts will expire during 2000 and EMI will have no further derivative activity. EMI's market risk due to changes in market prices of natural gas forward and
futures contracts is immaterial.

NSP's
Energy Marketing division has exposure to the risk of changes in market prices of electricity and natural gas. As of Dec. 31, 1999, a 10 percent increase or
decrease in electricity futures and forward
prices would have an immaterial impact on NSP's financial results. Any changes in the values of these futures contracts would be offset by a change in the underlying commodities being hedged.

NRG's
power marketing subsidiary is exposed to the risk of changes in market prices of fuel oil, natural gas and electricity. To manage exposure to this volatility, NRG uses a variety
of energy contracts, including options, swaps and forward contracts. As of Dec. 31, 1999, a 10 percent increase in fuel oil, natural gas and electricity forward prices would result in a
gain on these contracts of approximately $12 million. Conversely, a 10 percent decrease in fuel oil, natural gas and electricity forward prices would result in a loss on these contracts
of approximately $12 million. These hypothetical gains and losses on energy forward contracts would be offset by the gains and losses on the underlying commodities being hedged.

Accounting Changes

—The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has proposed new accounting standards that would require
the full accrual of nuclear plant decommissioning and certain other site exit obligations. Material adjustments to NSP's balance sheet would occur upon implementation of the FASB's proposal, which
would be no earlier than 2002. However, the effects of regulation are expected to minimize or eliminate any impact on operating expenses and earnings from this future accounting change. For further
discussion of the expected impact of this change, see Note 13 to the Financial Statements.


In
June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133—Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement requires that all derivatives be
recognized at fair value in the balance sheet and all changes in fair value be recognized currently in earnings or deferred as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on the intended use
of the derivative, its resulting designation and its effectiveness. NSP plans to adopt this standard in 2001, as required. NSP has not yet determined the potential impact of implementing this
statement.

Inflation

—Inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect NSP's prices or returns to shareholders.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

1999 Financing Requirements

—NSP's need for capital funds primarily is related to the construction of plant and equipment to
meet the needs of electric and gas utility customers and to fund equity commitments or other investments in nonregulated businesses. In 1999:

•

Total
utility capital expenditures were $462 million. Of that amount, $367 million related to replacements and improvements of NSP's electric
system and nuclear fuel, and $67 million involved construction of natural gas facilities.

•

NSP
companies (mainly NRG) invested approximately $1.9 billion for equity interests in and loans to nonregulated projects for the acquisition of
generating assets and for additions to nonregulated property.

1999 Financing Activity

—During 1999, NSP's sources of capital included internally generated funds and external financings.
The allocation of financing requirements between these capital resources is based on the relative cost of each resource, regulatory restrictions and NSP's long-range capital structure
objectives. The following summarizes the financing sources used in 1999.

•

Internal
funds—Funds generated internally from operating cash flows in 1999 remained generally sufficient to meet working capital needs, debt
service, dividend payout requirements and a significant portion of utility construction expenditures. NSP's goal for its pretax interest coverage ratio for utility operations is 3.5-5.0.
The utility pretax interest coverage ratio, excluding AFC, was 3.2 in 1999, 3.8 in 1998 and 3.6 in 1997. Internally generated funds from utility operations could have provided financing for
approximately 80 percent of NSP's utility capital expenditures for 1999 and approximately 95 percent of the $2.0 billion in utility capital expenditures incurred from
1995-1999. The pretax interest coverage ratio, excluding AFC, for all NSP operations was 2.1 in 1999, 2.9 in 1998 and 2.8 in 1997.

•

External
financing—NSP's short-term debt availability and usage is described in Note 2 to the Financial Statements. In
general, short-term borrowings are used to provide temporary financing, mainly for NSP-Minnesota and NRG, utility capital expenditures, nonregulated projects and other
short-term cash needs. NSP's long-term debt and capital stock activity are shown on the Statements of Capitalization and Stockholders' Equity. These sources are used to provide
permanent financing for both regulated and nonregulated business activities.

The
1999 nonregulated asset acquisitions, property additions and equity investments by NSP's subsidiaries were primarily financed by the issuance of subsidiary debt and equity
contributions from NSP. Project debt associated with some nonregulated investments is not reflected in NSP's balance sheet because the equity method of accounting is used for such investments as
discussed in Note 10 to the Financial Statements.

Future Financing Requirements

—NSP currently estimates that its utility capital expenditures will be $490 million in
2000 and $2.3 billion for 2000-2004. Of the 2000 amount, approximately $410 million is scheduled for electric utility facilities and approximately $50 million for
natural gas facilities. In addition to


utility
capital expenditures, expected financing requirements for 2000-2004 include approximately $1 billion to retire long-term debt and fund principal maturities.

NSP
subsidiaries expect to invest significant amounts in nonregulated projects in the future. Financing requirements for nonregulated project investments will vary depending on the
success, timing and level of involvement in projects currently under consideration.

•

NRG
expects to invest approximately $2.7 billion in 2000 and approximately $4.7 billion for 2000-2004 for nonregulated projects
and property, which include acquisitions and project investments. NRG's capital requirements may vary significantly. NRG's capital requirements for 2000 reflect expected acquisitions of existing
generation facilities, including Cajun, Killingholme A and the Conectiv fossil assets. A significant portion of NRG's capital requirements is expected to be financed by project-secured debt. In
addition, NRG may issue a limited amount of equity financing to third parties for funding a portion of the capital requirements.

•

Seren
expects to spend approximately $180 million during 2000, which reflects the build-out of its broadband communications network in
Northern California. Seren is evaluating its financing options, including equity financing to third parties and project-secured debt. Seren's capital requirements for 2001-2004 may vary
significantly depending on the success of development efforts under way.

NSP
and its subsidiaries continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance shareholder returns and achieve long-term financial objectives through investments in projects or
acquisitions of existing businesses. These investments could cause significant changes to the capital requirement estimates for nonregulated projects and property. Long-term financing may
be required for such investments.

NSP
also will have future financing requirements for the portion of nuclear plant decommissioning costs not funded externally. Based on the most recent decommissioning study approved
by regulators, these amounts are anticipated to be approximately $363 million and are expected to be paid during the years 2010-2022.

Future Sources of Financing

—NSP expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing long-term
debt, short-term debt, common stock and preferred securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios. Over the long term, NSP's equity investments in and acquisitions of nonregulated
projects are expected to be financed at the nonregulated subsidiary level from internally generated funds or the issuance of subsidiary debt. Financing requirements for the nonregulated projects, in
excess of equity contributions from partners, are expected to be fulfilled through project or subsidiary debt. Decommissioning expenses not funded by an external trust will be financed through a
combination of internally generated funds, long-term debt and common stock.

The
following summarizes the financing sources expected to be available to NSP in the near future:

•

Internal
funds—Internally generated funds from utility operations are expected to equal approximately 85 percent of anticipated utility
capital expenditures for 2000 and approximately 95 percent of the anticipated utility capital expenditures for 2000-2004. Because NRG has been reinvesting foreign cash flows in
operations outside the United States, the equity income from foreign investments is not fully available to provide operating cash flows for domestic cash requirements such as payment of NSP dividends,
domestic capital expenditures and domestic debt service.

•

Short-term
debt—NSP has received regulatory approval for up to approximately $1.5 billion in short-term
borrowing levels. NSP credit lines (as discussed in Note 2 to the Financial Statements) make short-term financing available in the form of bank loans, letters of credit and support
for commercial paper.

•

Utility
long-term debt—NSP-Minnesota's and NSP-Wisconsin's first mortgage indentures limit the amount of
first mortgage bonds that may be issued. The MPUC and the PSCW have jurisdiction


over
securities issuance. At Dec. 31, 1999, with an assumed interest rate of 7.75 percent, NSP-Minnesota could have issued about $1.9 billion of additional first
mortgage bonds under its indenture and NSP-Wisconsin could have issued about $320 million of additional first mortgage bonds under its indenture. NSP has $150 million of
unissued bonds remaining from its $400 million universal shelf registration filed with the SEC in November 1998 and $50 million of unissued first mortgage bonds remaining from its
shelf registration filed in October 1995. In addition, NSP-Minnesota is planning on filing a $400 million universal debt shelf registration during the first half of 2000.
During 1999, NSP-Wisconsin filed a shelf registration with the SEC to issue up to $80 million of long-term debt. NSP-Wisconsin currently expects to issue
between $50 million and $80 million of unsecured long-term debt during 2000, primarily to reduce short-term debt levels.

•

NRG
debt—In December 1999, NRG filed a shelf registration with the SEC to issue up to $500 million of unsecured debt. NRG expects
to issue debt under this shelf during 2000 for general corporate purposes, which may include financing development and construction of new facilities, additions to working capital and financing
capital expenditures and pending or potential acquisitions. In addition to NRG corporate debt, NRG Northeast Generating LLC (N.E. Generating), a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG, issued
$750 million of bonds in February 2000 to pay down short-term borrowings and reduce NRG's corporate debt issued to fund N.E. Generating (see Note 2).

•

Common
stock—NSP's Articles of Incorporation authorize an additional 194.3 million shares of common stock in excess of shares issued at
Dec. 31, 1999. In 1999, NSP filed registration statements with the
SEC to allow for the sale of up to 1.9 million shares of newly issued common stock under NSP's Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Program (DRSPP) and Executive Long-Term
Incentive Award Stock Plan. NSP plans to issue new shares for its DRSPP, Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) and Executive Long-Term Incentive Award Stock Plan in 2000. NSP filed its
proposed 2000 Capital Structure and Financing Plan with the MPUC in November 1999. In its filing, NSP proposed that if the completion of its merger with NCE is timed as currently anticipated,
NSP will be recapitalized as a subsidiary of Xcel Energy. If completion of the merger appears to be delayed, NSP may issue equity or an equity-related security in the first half of 2000.

•

Preferred
stock—NSP's Articles of Incorporation authorize the maximum amount of preferred stock that may be issued. Under these provisions, NSP
could have issued all $595 million of its remaining authorized, but unissued, preferred stock at Dec. 31, 1999, and remained in compliance with all interest and dividend coverage
requirements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders of

Northern States Power Company:

In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of capitalization and the related consolidated statements of income, of common stockholders' equity and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Northern States Power Company (NSP), a Minnesota corporation, and its subsidiaries at Dec. 31, 1999 and 1998, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended Dec. 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. These financial statements are the responsibility of NSP's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business and System of Accounts

NSP-Minnesota is primarily a public utility serving customers in Minnesota,
North Dakota, South Dakota and Arizona. NSP-Wisconsin serves utility customers in Wisconsin and Michigan. Viking operates an interstate natural gas pipeline. All of the utility companies'
accounting records conform to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) uniform system of accounts or to systems required by various state regulatory commissions, which are the same in all
material aspects.

Principles of Consolidation

The following wholly owned subsidiaries of NSP-Minnesota are included in the
consolidated financial statements. In this report, we refer to these companies collectively as NSP.

•

NSP-Wisconsin

•

NRG
Energy, Inc.

•

Viking
Gas Transmission Co.

•

Energy
Masters International, Inc.

•

Eloigne
Co.

•

Seren
Innovations, Inc.

•

Ultra
Power Technologies, Inc.

NSP
uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in partnerships, joint ventures and certain projects, mainly at NRG and Eloigne. We record our portion of earnings from
international investments after subtracting foreign income taxes. In the consolidation process, we eliminate all significant intercompany transactions and balances except for intercompany and
intersegment profits for sales among the electric and gas utility businesses of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and Viking, which are allowed in utility rates.

Revenues

NSP records utility revenues based on a calendar month, but reads meters and bills customers according to a
cycle that doesn't necessarily correspond with the calendar month's end. To compensate,
we estimate and record unbilled revenues from the monthly meter-reading dates to the month's end. NSP-Minnesota's rates include monthly adjustments for:

•

changes
in the average cost of fuel, including electricity and natural gas that NSP purchases, from base levels approved in the most recent rate case; and

•

recovery
of conservation and energy management program costs and incentives in Minnesota, which is reviewed annually.

NSP-Wisconsin's
rates include a cost-of-energy adjustment clause for purchased gas, but not for purchased electricity or electric fuel. We can
request recovery of those electric costs prospectively through the rate review process, which normally occurs every two years in Wisconsin, and an interim fuel cost hearing process.

Utility Plant and Retirements

Utility plant is stated at original cost. The cost of utility plant includes direct labor
and materials, contracted work, overhead costs and applicable interest expense. The cost of utility plant retired, plus net removal cost, is charged to accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Maintenance and replacement of items determined to be less than units of property are charged to operating expenses.


Allowance for Funds Used during Construction (AFC)

AFC, a noncash item, represents the cost of capital used to finance
utility construction activity. AFC is computed by applying a composite pretax rate to qualified construction work in progress. The AFC rate was 5.25 percent in 1999, 8.0 percent in 1998
and 5.75 percent in 1997. The amount of AFC capitalized as a construction cost is credited to other income (for equity capital) and interest charges (for debt capital). AFC amounts capitalized
are included in NSP's rate base for establishing utility service rates. In addition to construction-related amounts, AFC is also recorded to reflect returns on capital used to finance conservation
programs.

Depreciation

NSP determines the depreciation of its plant by spreading the original cost equally over the plant's
useful life. Every five years, NSP submits an average service life filing to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for electric and gas property. The most recent filing occurred in 1997.
Depreciation expense as a percentage of the average utility plant in service was 3.83 percent in 1999, 3.77 percent in 1998 and 3.78 percent in 1997.

Decommissioning

NSP accounts for the future cost of decommissioning—or permanently retiring—its
nuclear generating plants through annual depreciation accruals using an annuity approach designed to provide for full rate recovery of the future decommissioning costs. Our decommissioning calculation
covers all expenses, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material, and extends over the estimated lives of the plants. The calculation assumes that NSP will recover those costs
through rates. (See Note 13 for more information on decommissioning.)

Nuclear Fuel Expense

Nuclear fuel expense, which is recorded as the plant uses fuel, includes the cost of:

•

nuclear
fuel used

•

future
spent nuclear fuel disposal, based on fees established by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)

•

NSP's
portion of the cost of decommissioning or shutting down the DOE's fuel enrichment facility

Environmental Costs

We record environmental costs when it is probable that NSP is liable for the costs and we can
reasonably estimate the liability. We may defer costs as a regulatory asset based on our expectation that we will recover these costs from customers in future rates. Otherwise, we expense the costs.
If an environmental expense is related to facilities we currently use, such as pollution control equipment, we capitalize and depreciate the costs over the life of the plant.

We
record estimated remediation costs, excluding inflationary increases and possible reductions for insurance coverage and rate recovery. The estimates are based on our experience,
our assessment of the current situation and the technology currently available for use in the remediation.

We
regularly adjust the recorded costs as we revise estimates and as remediation proceeds. If we are one of several designated responsible parties, we estimate and record only our
share of the cost. We treat any future costs of restoring sites where operation may extend indefinitely as a capitalized cost of plant retirement. The depreciation expense levels we can recover in
rates include a provision for these estimated removal costs.

Income Taxes

Based on the liability method, NSP defers income taxes for all temporary differences between pretax
financial and taxable income, and between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities.


We
use the tax rates that are scheduled to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to turn around, or reverse.

Due
to the effects of past regulatory practices, when deferred taxes were not required to be recorded, we account for the reversal of some temporary differences as current income tax
expense. We defer investment tax credits and spread their benefits over the estimated lives of the related property. Utility rate regulation also has created certain regulatory assets and liabilities
related to income taxes, which we summarize in Note 9. We discuss our income tax policy for international operations in Note 7.

Foreign Currency Translation

NSP's foreign operations generally use the local currency as their functional currency in
translating international operating results and balances to U.S. currency. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the end of a reporting
period. Income, expense and cash flows are translated at weighted-average exchange rates for the period. We accumulate the resulting currency translation adjustments and report them as a component of
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.

When
we convert cash distributions made in one currency to another currency, we include those gains and losses in the results of operations as a component of income from nonregulated
businesses before interest and taxes. We do the same for foreign currency derivative arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Derivative Financial Instruments

To preserve the U.S. dollar value of projected foreign currency cash flows, NRG
hedges—or protects—those cash flows if appropriate foreign hedging instruments are available. The gains and losses on those agreements offset the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations on NRG's known and anticipated cash flows. NRG defers gains on agreements that hedge firm commitments of
cash flows, and accounts for them as part of the relevant foreign currency transaction when the transaction occurs. NRG defers losses on these agreements the same way, unless it appears that the
deferral would result in recognizing a loss later.

While
NRG is not currently hedging investments involving foreign currency, NRG will hedge such investments when it believes that preserving the U.S. dollar value of the investment is
appropriate. NRG is not hedging currency translation adjustments related to future operating results. NRG does not speculate in foreign currencies.

From
time to time, NRG also uses interest rate hedging instruments to protect it from an increase in the cost of borrowing. Gains and losses on interest rate hedging instruments are
reported as part of the asset for Equity Investments in Nonregulated Projects when the hedging instrument relates to a project that has financial statements that are not consolidated into NRG's
financial statements. Otherwise, they are reported as a part of debt.

In
the past, EMI used natural gas futures and forward contracts to manage the risk of gas price fluctuations. In February 1999, EMI transferred its gas supply and marketing
function to NSP's Energy Marketing division. EMI's remaining gas future and forward contracts will expire during 2000 and EMI will have no further derivative activity.

NSP's
Energy Marketing division and NRG's Power Marketing subsidiary use future and forward contracts to manage the risk of natural gas and electricity price fluctuations. The cost or
benefit of futures or forward contracts is recorded when related sales commitments are fulfilled as a component of operating expenses. NSP and NRG do not speculate in electricity or natural gas
futures.


A
final derivative instrument used by NSP and NRG is the interest rate swap. The cost or benefit of the interest rate swap agreements is recorded as a component of interest expense.
None of these derivative financial instruments are reflected on NSP's balance sheet. For information on derivatives, see Note 11.

Use of Estimates

In recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations, NSP uses estimates based on
the best information available. We use estimates for such items as plant depreciable lives, tax provisions, uncollectible amounts, environmental costs, unbilled revenues and actuarially determined
benefit costs.

We
revise the recorded estimates when we get better information or when we can determine actual amounts. Those revisions can affect operating results. Each year, we also review the
depreciable lives of certain plant assets and revise them if appropriate.

Cash Equivalents

NSP considers investments in certain debt instruments—with a remaining maturity of three
months or less at the time of purchase—to be cash equivalents. Those debt instruments are primarily commercial paper and money market funds.

Regulatory Deferrals

As regulated entities, NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and Viking account for
certain income and expense items using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71—Accounting for the Effects of Regulation. Under SFAS No. 71:

•

we
defer certain costs, which would otherwise be charged to expense, as regulatory assets based on our expected ability to recover them in future rates;
and

•

we
defer certain credits, which would otherwise be reflected as income, as regulatory liabilities based on our expectation they will be returned to
customers in future rates.

We
base our estimates of recovering deferred costs and returning deferred credits on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each item. We amortize regulatory assets and
liabilities consistent with the period of expected regulatory treatment.

Stock-Based Employee Compensation

NSP has several stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 4.
NSP accounts for those plans using the intrinsic value method. We do not record compensation expense for stock options because there is no difference between the market price and the purchase price at
grant date. We do, however, record compensation expense for restricted stock that NSP awards to certain employees, but holds until the restrictions lapse or the stock is forfeited. We do not use the
optional accounting under SFAS No. 123—Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. If we had used the SFAS No. 123 method of accounting, the reduction in earnings for 1999, 1998
and 1997 would have been less than 1 cent per share per year.

Development Costs

As NRG develops projects, it expenses the development costs it incurs until a sales agreement or
letter of intent is signed and the project has received NRG board approval. NRG capitalizes additional costs incurred at that point. When a project begins to operate, NRG amortizes the capitalized
costs over either the life of the project's related assets or the revenue contract period, whichever is less. If a project is terminated without becoming operational, NRG expenses the capitalized
costs in the year of the termination.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill results when NSP purchases an entity at a price higher than the underlying fair value of the
net assets. We amortize the goodwill and other intangible assets over periods consistent with the economic useful life of the assets. Our intangible assets are currently amortized over a


range
of 15 to 40 years. We periodically evaluate the recovery of goodwill based on an analysis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows. At Dec. 31, 1999, NSP's intangible assets
included $41 million of goodwill, net of accumulated amortization.

Intangible
and other assets also included deferred financing costs, net of amortization, of approximately $37 million at Dec. 31, 1999. We are amortizing these financing
costs over the remaining maturity period of the related debt.

Reclassifications

We reclassified certain items in the 1997 and 1998 income statements to conform to the 1999
presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income or earnings per share.

2. Short-Term Borrowings

Short-term debt outstanding at Dec. 31 consisted of:

At
the end of 1998 and 1999, NSP-Minnesota had a $300 million revolving credit facility under a commitment fee arrangement. This facility provides
short-term financing in the form of bank loans, letters of credit and support for commercial paper sales. NSP did not borrow or issue any letters of credit against this facility in 1998 or
1999.

In
addition, banks provided credit lines of $556 million to wholly owned subsidiaries of NSP at Dec. 31, 1999. At that time, a total of $343 million was borrowed
against these lines, mainly by NRG.

On
Feb. 22, 2000, NRG Northeast Generating issued $750 million of senior secured bonds to refinance short-term project borrowings. The bond offering included
three tranches: $320 million with an interest rate of 8.065 percent due in 2004, $109 million with an interest rate of 8.842 percent due in 2010 and $321 million
with an interest rate of 9.292 percent due in 2024. NRG used $647 million of the proceeds to repay short-term borrowings outstanding at Dec. 31, 1999. Accordingly,
$647 million of short-term debt has been classified as long-term debt, based on this refinancing.

3. Long-Term Debt

Except
for minor exclusions, all property of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin is subject to the liens of the first mortgage indentures, which are contracts
between the companies and their bond holders. A lien on the related property secures other debt securities, as we indicate in the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization.


The
annual sinking-fund requirements of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin's first mortgage indentures are the amounts necessary to redeem
1 percent of the highest principal amount of each series of first mortgage bonds at any time outstanding, excluding:

•

series
issued for pollution control and resource recovery financings

•

certain
other series totaling $1 billion

NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin may apply property additions in lieu of cash on all series, as permitted by their first mortgage indenture.

NSP-Minnesota's
2011 and 2019 series First Mortgage Bonds have variable interest rates, which currently change at various periods up to 270 days, based on
prevailing rates for certain commercial paper securities or similar issues. The interest rates applicable to these issues averaged 5.75 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, at
Dec. 31, 1999. The 2011 series bonds are redeemable upon seven days notice at the option of the bondholder. NSP-Minnesota also is potentially liable for repayment of the 2019 series
when the bonds are tendered, which occurs each time the variable interest rates change. The principal amount of all of these variable rate bonds outstanding represents potential short-term
obligations and, therefore, is reported under current liabilities on the Balance Sheets.

Maturities
and sinking-fund requirements on long-term debt are:

•

$153 million
in 2000

•

$190 million
in 2001

•

$42 million
in 2002

•

$290 million
in 2003

•

$373 million
in 2004

4. Common Stock and Incentive Stock Plans

NSP's
Articles of Incorporation and first mortgage indenture include certain restrictions on paying cash dividends on common stock. Even with these restrictions, NSP could have paid
more than $1.4 billion in additional cash dividends on common stock at Dec. 31, 1999.

NSP
grants nonqualified stock options and restricted stock under our Executive Long-Term Incentive Award Stock Plan. The awards granted in any year cannot exceed
1 percent of the number of outstanding shares of NSP common stock at the end of the previous year. When options are exercised or when we grant restricted stock, we may either issue new shares
or purchase market shares.

The
weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding includes the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock awards based on the treasury stock
method. Effective in January 1999, stock options granted to NSP officers vest at a rate of one-third each year for three years. Stock options for other employees vest one year from
the date of grant. Once they have vested, options can be exercised up to 10 years after the date they were granted.

Employees
forfeit stock options if their employment ends (for reasons other than retirement) before the vesting term. If employment ends after the vesting term, employees either
forfeit their options or must exercise them within three to 36 months, depending on their circumstances. If an employee retires, all options granted in 1999 will vest immediately and can be
exercised over their 10-year life. The exercise


price
of an option is the market price of NSP stock on the date of grant. The plan previously granted other types of performance awards, some of which remain outstanding. Most of these performance
awards were valued in dollars, but paid in shares based on the market price at the time of payment. The following table includes transactions that have occurred under the various incentive stock
programs, with the corresponding weighted average exercise price:

There were also 12,197 other awards outstanding at Dec. 31, 1999.

In
addition to granting stock options, NSP grants certain employees restricted stock based on a dollar value of the award. We use the market price of the stock on the date it was
granted to determine the number of restricted shares to grant. NSP holds the stock until restrictions lapse; 50 percent of the stock vests one year from the date of the award and the other
50 percent vests two years from the date of the
award. We reinvest dividends on the shares we hold while restrictions are in place. Restrictions also apply to the additional shares acquired through dividend reinvestment.

Over
the last three years, NSP has granted the following restricted stock awards:

•

52,688
shares in 1997

•

49,651
shares in 1998

•

51,790
shares in 1999


Compensation
expense related to these awards was immaterial.

5. Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

NSP offers the following benefit plans to its benefit employees. Approximately 37 percent of benefit employees are represented by five local labor
unions under a collective-bargaining agreement, which expires in 2004.

Pension Benefits

NSP has two noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all utility employees.
Benefits are based on a combination of years of service, the employee's average pay and Social Security benefits.

NSP's
policy is to fully fund into an external trust the actuarially determined pension costs recognized for ratemaking and financial reporting purposes, subject to the limitations of
applicable employee benefit and tax laws. Plan assets principally consist of the common stock of public companies, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities.

Postretirement Health Care

NSP has a contributory health and welfare benefit plan that provides health care and death
benefits to almost all NSP retirees. The plan was terminated for nonbargaining employees retiring after 1998 and for bargaining employees after 1999. For covered retirees, the plan enables NSP and
such retirees to share the costs of retiree health care. NSP nonbargaining retirees pay 40 percent of total health care costs. Cost-sharing for bargaining employees is governed by
the terms of NSP's collective bargaining agreement.

In
conjunction with the 1993 adoption of SFAS No. 106—Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, NSP elected to amortize the
unrecognized accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) on a straight-line basis over 20 years.

Regulators
for almost all of NSP's retail and wholesale customers have allowed full rate recovery of increased benefit costs under SFAS No. 106. Minnesota and Wisconsin retail
regulators require external funding to the extent it is tax advantaged. Such funding began for Wisconsin in 1993 and for Minnesota
in 1998. For wholesale ratemaking, FERC requires external funding for all benefits paid and accrued under SFAS No. 106. Plan assets held in external funding trusts principally consist of
investments in equity mutual funds and cash equivalents.

401(k)

NSP has a contributory, defined contribution Retirement Savings Plan, which complies with section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code and covers substantially all utility employees. NSP matches specified amounts of employee contributions to the plan. NSP's matching contributions were approximately
$6.5 million in 1999, $4.8 million in 1998 and $4.4 million in 1997.

ESOP

NSP has a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) that covers substantially all utility employees. NSP
makes contributions to this noncontributory, defined contribution plan to the extent we realize a tax savings from dividends paid on certain ESOP shares. Contributions to the ESOP, which represent
compensation expense, were $4.2 million in 1999, $4.3 million in 1998 and $4.4 million in 1997.

ESOP
contributions have no material effect on NSP earnings because the contributions are essentially offset by the tax savings provided by the dividends paid on ESOP shares. NSP
allocates leveraged ESOP shares to participants when it repays ESOP loans with dividends on stock held by the ESOP.

NSP's
ESOP held 11.3 million shares of NSP common stock at the end of 1999 and 1998, and 11.2 million shares of NSP common stock at the end of 1997.

NSP
excluded the following uncommitted leveraged ESOP shares from earnings per share calculations: 0.5 million in 1999, 0.6 million in 1998 and 0.6 million in
1997.

NRG
intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from foreign operations except to the extent the earnings are subject to current U.S. income taxes. Accordingly, U.S. income taxes and
foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on a cumulative amount of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $195 million and $158 million at Dec. 31,
1999 and 1998. The additional U.S. income tax and foreign withholding tax on the unremitted foreign earnings, if repatriated, would be offset in whole or in part by foreign tax credits. Thus, it is
not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable.

8. Preferred Securities

At
Dec. 31, 1999, various preferred stock series were callable at prices per share ranging from $102.00 to $103.75, plus accrued dividends.

In
1997, a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary trust of NSP issued $200 million of 7.875 percent preferred securities that mature in 2037. Distributions paid by the
subsidiary trust on the preferred securities are financed through interest payments on debentures issued by NSP-Minnesota and held by the subsidiary trust, which are eliminated in NSP's
consolidation. The preferred securities are redeemable at $25 per share beginning in 2002. Distributions and redemption payments are guaranteed by NSP. Distributions paid to preferred security holders
are reflected as a financing cost in the Income Statement along with interest expense.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

10. Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method

NSP's
nonregulated subsidiaries have investments in various international and domestic energy projects, and domestic affordable housing and real estate projects. We use the equity
method of accounting for such investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and partnerships. That's because the ownership structure prevents NSP from exercising a controlling influence over
the projects' operating and financial policies. Under this method, NSP records its portion of the earnings or losses of unconsolidated affiliates as equity earnings. A summary of NSP's significant
equity method investments follows.

For
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, the carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The fair values of
NSP's long-term investments, mainly debt securities in an external nuclear decommissioning fund, are estimated based on quoted market prices for those or similar investments. The fair
value of NSP's long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues, or the current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities and credit
quality.

Derivatives

As of Dec. 31, 1999, NRG had no contracts to hedge—or protect—foreign
currency denominated future cash flows. One contract that was outstanding during 1999 had no material effect on earnings.

During
the third quarter of 1999, NRG Northeast Generating LLC (N.E. Generating), a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG, entered into $600 million of "treasury locks," at various
interest rates, which expired in February 2000. These treasury locks were an interest rate hedge for an N.E. Generating bond offering issued in February 2000 (see Note 2).

At
Dec. 31, 1999, NRG had three interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling approximately $393 million. The contracts are used to manage NRG's exposure
to changes in interest rates. If the swaps had been discontinued on Dec. 31, 1999, NRG would have owed the counterparties


approximately
$3 million. Management believes that NRG's exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by the counterparties to its hedging contracts is insignificant, based on the investment
grade rating of the counterparties.

•

In
September 1999, NRG entered into a $200 million swap agreement effectively converting the 7.5 percent fixed rate on its senior
notes to a variable rate. It expires on June 1, 2009.

•

A
second swap effectively converts a $16 million issue of variable rate debt into fixed rate debt. The swap expires on Sept. 30, 2002.

•

A
third swap converts $177 million of floating rate debt into fixed rate debt. The swap expires on Dec. 17, 2014.

As
of Dec. 31, 1999, EMI had natural gas forward and futures contracts in the notional amount of less than $1 million. These contracts will expire during 2000 and EMI
will have no further derivative activity.

NSP's
Energy Marketing division uses energy futures contracts, along with physical supply, to hedge market risk in the energy market. At Dec. 31, 1999, the notional amount of
energy futures contracts was approximately $2 million. Management believes that the risk of counterparty nonperformance with regard to any of Energy Marketing's hedge transactions is not
significant.

NRG's
Power Marketing subsidiary uses energy forward contracts, along with physical supply, to hedge market risk in the energy market. At Dec. 31, 1999, the notional amount of
energy forward contracts was approximately $207 million. If the contracts had been terminated at Dec. 31, 1999, NRG would have received approximately $12 million based on price
fluctuations to date. Management believes the risk of counterparty nonperformance with regards to any of NRG's hedging transactions is not significant.

Letters of Credit

NSP and its subsidiaries use letters of credit, generally with terms of one year, to provide
financial guarantees for certain operating obligations. In addition, NRG uses letters of credit for nonregulated equity commitments, collateral for credit agreements, fuel purchase and operating
commitments, and bids on development projects.

At
Dec. 31, 1999, there were $140 million in letters of credit outstanding, including $116 million related to NRG commitments. The contract amounts of these
letters of credit approximate their fair value and are subject to fees determined in the marketplace.

12. Joint Plant Ownership

NSP is part owner of an 860-megawatt coal-fired electric generating unit called Sherco 3. NSP owns and has financed 59 percent
and Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency owns and has financed 41 percent of Sherco 3. NSP is the operating agent under the joint ownership agreement. NSP's share of related expenses for
Sherco 3 is included in Utility Operating Expenses. NSP's share of the gross cost recorded in Utility Plant was approximately $607 million at year-end 1999 and $604 million
at year-end 1998. The accumulated provisions for depreciation were $233 million in 1999 and $215 million in 1998.

13. Nuclear Obligations

Fuel Disposal

NSP is responsible for temporarily storing used—or spent—nuclear fuel from its
nuclear plants. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for permanently storing spent fuel from NSP's nuclear plants as well as from other U.S. nuclear plants. NSP has been funding its
portion of the DOE's permanent disposal program since 1981. The fuel disposal fees are based on a charge of 0.1


cent
per kilowatt-hour sold to customers from nuclear generation. Fuel expense includes DOE fuel disposal assessments of approximately $12 million in 1999, $11 million in
1998 and $10 million in 1997.

In
total, NSP had paid approximately $272 million to the DOE through Dec. 31, 1999. However, we cannot determine whether the amount and method of the DOE's assessments
to all utilities will be sufficient to fully fund the DOE's permanent storage or disposal facility.

The
Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the DOE to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel no later than Jan. 31, 1998. In 1996, the DOE notified commercial spent fuel owners of an
anticipated delay in accepting spent nuclear fuel by the required date and conceded that a permanent storage or disposal facility will not be available until at least 2010. NSP and other utilities
have commenced lawsuits against the DOE to recover damages caused by the DOE's failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations.

Without
a DOE facility, NSP has been providing, with regulatory and legislative approval, its own temporary on-site storage facilities at its Monticello and Prairie Island
nuclear plants. With the dry cask storage facilities approved in 1994, NSP believes it has adequate storage capacity to continue operation of its Prairie Island nuclear plant until at least 2007. The
Monticello nuclear plant has storage capacity to continue operations until 2010. Storage availability to permit operation beyond these dates is not assured at this time. NSP is investigating all of
its alternatives for spent fuel storage until a DOE facility is available, including pursuing the establishment of a private facility for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel as part of a consortium
of electric utilities. If on-site temporary storage at Prairie Island reaches approved capacity, NSP could seek interim storage at this or another contracted private facility, if
available.

Nuclear
fuel expense includes payments to the DOE for the decommissioning and decontamination of the DOE's uranium enrichment facilities. In 1993, NSP recorded the DOE's initial
assessment of $46 million, which is payable in annual installments from 1993-2008. NSP is amortizing each installment to expense on a monthly basis. The most recent installment paid
in 1999 was $4 million; future installments are subject to inflation adjustments under DOE rules. NSP is obtaining rate recovery of these DOE assessments through the
cost-of-energy adjustment clause as the assessments are amortized. Accordingly, we deferred the unamortized assessment of $32 million at Dec. 31, 1999, as a
regulatory asset.

Plant Decommissioning

Decommissioning of NSP's nuclear facilities is planned for the years 2010-2022, using
the prompt dismantlement method. NSP currently is following industry practice by ratably accruing the costs for decommissioning over the approved cost recovery period and including the accruals in
Utility Plant—Accumulated Depreciation. Consequently, the total decommissioning cost obligation and corresponding assets currently are not recorded in NSP's financial statements.

The
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has proposed new accounting standards, which, if approved, would require the full accrual of nuclear plant decommissioning and other
site exit obligations no sooner than 2002. Using Dec. 31, 1999, estimates, NSP's adoption of the proposed accounting would result in the recording of the total discounted decommissioning
obligation of $705 million as a liability, with the corresponding costs capitalized as plant and other assets and depreciated over the operating life of the plant. NSP has not yet determined
the potential impact of the FASB's proposed changes in the accounting for site exit obligations, such as costs of removal, other than nuclear decommissioning. However, the ultimate decommissioning and
site exit costs to be accrued are expected to be similar to the current methodology. The effects of regulation are expected to minimize or eliminate any impact on operating expenses and results of
operations from this future accounting change.

Consistent
with cost recovery in utility customer rates, NSP records annual decommissioning accruals based on periodic site-specific cost studies and a presumed level of
dedicated funding. Cost studies


quantify
decommissioning costs in current dollars. Since the costs are expected to be paid in 2010-2022, funding presumes that current costs will escalate in the future at a rate of
4.5 percent per year. The total estimated decommissioning costs that will ultimately be paid, net of income earned by external trust funds, is currently being accrued using an annuity approach
over the approved plant recovery period. This annuity approach uses an assumed rate of return on funding, which is currently 6 percent, net of tax, for external funding and approximately
8 percent, net of tax, for internal funding.

The
MPUC last approved NSP's nuclear decommissioning study and related nuclear plant depreciation capital recovery request in April 1997, using 1993 cost data. Although NSP
expects to operate Prairie Island through the end of each unit's licensed life, the approved capital recovery would allow for the plant to be fully depreciated, including the accrual and recovery of
decommissioning costs, in 2008. This is about six years earlier than each unit's licensed life. The approved recovery period for Prairie Island has been reduced because of the uncertainty regarding
used fuel storage. NSP believes future decommissioning cost accruals will continue to be recovered in customer rates.

The
total obligation for decommissioning currently is expected to be funded approximately 82 percent by external funds and 18 percent by internal funds, as approved by
the MPUC. Contributions to the external fund started in 1990 and are expected to continue until plant decommissioning begins. Costs not funded by external trust assets, including accumulated earnings,
will be funded through internally generated funds and issuance of NSP debt or stock. The assets held in trusts as of Dec. 31, 1999, primarily consisted of investments in fixed income
securities, such as tax-exempt municipal bonds and U.S. government securities that mature in two to 30 years, and common stock of public companies. NSP plans to reinvest matured
securities until decommissioning begins.

At
Dec. 31, 1999, NSP had recorded and recovered in rates cumulative decommissioning accruals of $549 million. The following table summarizes the funded status of NSP's
decommissioning obligation at Dec. 31, 1999:

cost accruals Jan. 1, 2000.

14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Capital Commitments

NSP estimates utility capital expenditures, including purchases of nuclear fuel, will be
$490 million in 2000 and $2.3 billion for 2000-2004. There also are contractual commitments for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel. (See Note 13.)

NRG
expects to invest approximately $2.7 billion in 2000 and approximately $4.7 billion for 2000-2004 for nonregulated projects and property, which include
acquisitions and project investments. NRG's capital requirements may vary significantly. NRG's capital requirements for 2000 reflect expected acquisitions of existing generation facilities, including
Cajun, Killingholme A and the Conectiv fossil assets. A significant portion of NRG's capital requirements is expected to be financed by project-secured debt. In addition, NRG may issue a limited
amount of equity financing to third parties for funding a portion of the capital requirements.

Seren
expects to spend approximately $180 million during 2000, which reflects the build-out of its broadband communications network in Northern California. Seren is
evaluating its financing options, including equity financing to third parties and project-secured debt. Seren's capital requirements for 2001-2004 may vary significantly depending on the
success of development efforts under way.

Legislative Resource Commitments

In 1994, NSP received Minnesota legislative approval for additional
on-site temporary spent fuel storage facilities at NSP's Prairie Island plant, provided NSP satisfies certain requirements. Seventeen dry cask containers were approved. As of
Dec. 31, 1999, NSP had loaded nine casks. The Minnesota Legislature established several energy resource and other commitments for NSP to obtain the Prairie Island temporary nuclear fuel storage
facility approval. These commitments can be met by building, purchasing, or in the case of biomass, converting generation resources.

The
1994 legislation requires NSP to have 425 megawatts of wind resources contracted by Dec. 31, 2002. Of this commitment, approximately 130 megawatts remain to be contracted.
During 1999, the MPUC ordered an additional 400 megawatts to be contracted by 2012, subject to least-cost determinations.


During
1997 and 1998, NSP executed three separate power purchase agreements (PPA) for a total of 125 megawatts of biomass-fueled generation resources. These contracts would meet the
statutory requirements to contract for 125 megawatts of biomass energy by Dec. 31, 1998. However, in December 1999, NSP terminated one of the contracts due to the nonperformance of the
vendor. NSP is currently working to replace this contract. At a hearing in December 1999, the MPUC approved two 25-megawatt PPAs and required further reporting by NSP in relation to
its efforts to meet the mandate, including whether NSP intends to exercise an option to increase the megawatt size of one of the contracts. Although the agreements met the requirements for biomass
scheduled to be operational by Dec. 31, 2001, and Dec. 31, 2002, due to various delays the actual operational dates of the biomass facilities may be later than scheduled.

Other
commitments established by the Legislature include a discount for low-income electric customers, required conservation improvement expenditures and various study and
reporting requirements to a legislative electric energy task force. NSP has implemented programs to meet the legislative commitments. NSP's capital commitments include the known effects of the Prairie
Island legislation. The impact of the legislation on future power purchase commitments and other operating expenses is not yet determinable.

Guarantees

NSP has sold a portion of its other receivables to a third party. The portion of the receivables sold
consisted of customer loans to local and state government entities for energy efficiency improvements under various conservation programs offered by NSP. Under the sales agreements, NSP
is required to guarantee repayment to the third party of the remaining loan balances. At Dec. 31, 1999, the outstanding balance of the loans was approximately $25 million. Based on prior
collection experience of these loans, NSP believes that losses under the loan guarantees, if any, would have an immaterial impact on the results of operations.

Leases

Rentals under operating leases were approximately $43 million, $33 million and $32 million
for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Future commitments under these leases generally decline from current levels.

Fuel Contracts

NSP has contracts providing for the purchase and delivery of a significant portion of its current coal,
nuclear fuel and natural gas requirements. These contracts expire in various years between 2000 and 2013. In total, NSP is committed to the minimum purchase of approximately $399 million of
coal, $21 million of nuclear fuel and $235 million of natural gas and related transportation, or to make payments in lieu thereof, under these contracts. In addition, NSP is required to
pay additional amounts depending on actual quantities shipped under these agreements.

NSP
has developed a mix of natural gas supply, transportation and storage contracts designed to meet its needs for retail gas sales. The contracts are with several suppliers and for
various periods of time. Because NSP has other sources of fuel available and suppliers are expected to continue to provide reliable fuel supplies, risk of loss from nonperformance under all fuel
contracts is not considered significant. In addition, NSP's risk of loss, in the form of increased costs, from market price changes in fuel is mitigated through the
cost-of-energy adjustment provision of the ratemaking process, which provides for recovery of nearly all fuel costs.


Power Agreements

NSP has several agreements to purchase electricity from the Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board (MH). A
summary of the agreements is as follows:

Power Agreements

Years

Megawatts

Participation power purchase

2000-2005


Seasonal diversity exchanges:

Summer exchanges from MH

2000-2014

2000-2016



Winter exchanges to MH

2000-2014


2000-2015


2015-2017




The
cost of the 500-megawatt participation power purchase commitment is based on 80 percent of the costs of owning and operating NSP's Sherco 3 generating plant,
adjusted to 1993 dollars. The future annual capacity costs for the 500-megawatt MH agreement are estimated to be approximately $58 million. There are no capacity payments for the
diversity exchanges. These commitments represent about 17 percent of MH's system capacity and account for approximately 10 percent of NSP's 2000 electric system capability. The risk of
loss from nonperformance by MH is not considered significant, and the risk of loss from market price changes is mitigated through cost-of-energy rate adjustments.

NSP
has an agreement with Minnkota Power Cooperative for the purchase of summer season capacity and energy. NSP will buy 150 megawatts of summer season capacity for approximately
$12 million annually in 2000 and 2001. From 2002-2015, NSP will purchase 100 megawatts of capacity for $10 million annually. NSP also has a summer purchase power agreement
with Minnesota Power for the purchase of 173 megawatts, including reserves, for 2000. The annual cost of this capacity will be approximately $2 million.

NSP
has agreements with several nonregulated power producers to purchase electric capacity and associated energy. The cost of these commitments is approximately $45 million
annually for 379 megawatts of summer capacity for 2000-2003. These commitments are expected to range between $52 million and $84 million annually for 2004-2024.
These commitments are expected to decline to approximately $27 million annually for 2025-2027, due to the expiration of existing agreements.

Wholesale Sales Agreement

In 1999, NRG entered into a Standard Offer Service Wholesale Sales Agreement with Connecticut
Light & Power Co. (CL&P). NRG will supply CL&P with 35 percent of its standard offer service load during 2000, 40 percent during 2001 and 2002 and 45 percent during 2003.
The four-year contract is valued at $1.7 billion. NRG will serve the load with a combination of existing
generation and power purchases. Also in 1999, NRG acquired generating stations with a combined capacity of 2,235 megawatts from CL&P.

Nuclear Insurance

NSP's public liability for claims resulting from any nuclear incident is limited to
$9.5 billion under the 1988 Price-Anderson amendment to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. NSP has secured $200 million of coverage for its public liability exposure with a pool of insurance
companies. The remaining $9.3 billion of exposure is funded by the Secondary Financial Protection Program, available from assessments by the federal government in case of a nuclear accident.
NSP is subject to assessments of up to $88 million for each of its three licensed reactors to be applied for public liability arising from a


nuclear
incident at any licensed nuclear facility in the United States. The maximum funding requirement is $10 million per reactor during any one year.

NSP
purchases insurance for property damage and site decontamination cleanup costs from Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL). The coverage limits are $1.5 billion for each
of NSP's two nuclear plant sites.

NEIL
also provides business interruption insurance coverage, including the cost of replacement power obtained during certain prolonged accidental outages of nuclear generating units.
Premiums are expensed over the policy term. All companies insured with NEIL are subject to retroactive premium adjustments if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds. Capital has been accumulated in
the reserve funds of NEIL to the extent that NSP would have no exposure for retroactive premium assessments in case of a single incident under the business interruption and the property damage
insurance coverage. However, in each calendar year, NSP could be subject to maximum assessments of approximately $4 million for business interruption insurance and $15 million for
property damage insurance if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds.

Environmental Contingencies

Other long-term liabilities include an accrual of $35 million, and other
current liabilities include an accrual of $6 million, at Dec. 31, 1999, for estimated costs associated with environmental remediation. Approximately $24 million of the
long-term liability and $4 million of the current liability relate to a DOE assessment for decommissioning a federal uranium enrichment facility, as discussed in Note 13.
Other estimates have been recorded for expected environmental costs associated with manufactured gas plant sites formerly used by NSP, and other waste disposal sites, as discussed later. These
environmental liabilities do not include accruals recorded and collected from customers in rates for future nuclear fuel disposal costs or decommissioning costs related to NSP's nuclear generating
plants. See Note 13 for further discussion of nuclear items.

The
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or state environmental agencies have designated NSP-Minnesota as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for 14 waste disposal
sites to which NSP-Minnesota allegedly sent hazardous materials.

•

Eleven
of these 14 sites have been remediated and, consistent with settlements reached with the EPA and other PRPs, NSP-Minnesota has paid
$2.4 million for its share of the remediation costs. One site that was previously remediated was reactivated due to a change in the use of the land. While these remediated sites will continue
to be monitored, NSP-Minnesota expects that future remediation costs, if any, will be immaterial. Under applicable law, NSP-Minnesota, along with each PRP, could be held
jointly and severally liable for the total remediation costs of PRP sites.

•

Neither
the total remediation cost nor the final method of cost allocation among all PRPs of the three unremediated sites has been determined. However,
NSP-Minnesota has recorded an estimate of approximately $0.1 million for its share of future costs for these sites. NSP-Minnesota is not aware of the other parties'
inability to pay, nor does it know if responsibility for any of the sites is in dispute.

While
it is not feasible to determine the ultimate impact of PRP site remediation at this time, the amounts accrued represent the best current estimate of NSP-Minnesota's
future liability. It is NSP-Minnesota's practice to vigorously pursue and, if necessary, litigate with insurers to recover incurred remediation costs whenever possible. Through litigation,
NSP-Minnesota has recovered a portion of the remediation costs paid to date. Management believes remediation costs incurred, but not recovered, from insurance carriers or other parties
should be allowed recovery in future ratemaking. Until NSP-Minnesota


is
identified as a PRP, it is not possible to predict the timing or amount of any costs associated with sites, other than those discussed previously.

NSP-Wisconsin
may be involved in the cleanup and remediation at three sites, including one that NSP-Minnesota is also investigating. One site is a former
transformer disposal facility in New Lisbon, Wis., and the remaining two are locations where fuel tanks were installed. The ultimate cleanup and remediation costs of these sites and the extent of
NSP-Wisconsin's responsibility, if any, for sharing such costs are not known at this time, but are expected to be immaterial.

NSP-Minnesota
is also investigating other properties that were formerly sites of gas manufacturing, gas storage plants or gas pipelines to determine if waste materials are
present and if they are an environmental or health risk. NSP-Minnesota also determines if it has any responsibility for remedial action and if recovery under NSP-Minnesota's
insurance policies can contribute to remediation costs.

•

NSP-Minnesota
has remediated four sites, which continue to be monitored. NSP-Minnesota has paid $7.3 million to remediate
these sites and expects to incur only immaterial monitoring costs related to these sites.

•

Another
11 gas sites remain under investigation. NSP-Minnesota is taking remedial action at four of these sites.

•

As
of Dec. 31, 1999, NSP-Minnesota had paid $4.3 million for the four active sites and had recorded an estimated liability of
approximately $2.6 million for future costs at these sites, with payment expected over the next five years. This estimate is based on prior experience and includes investigation, remediation
and litigation costs.

•

No
liability has been recorded for remediation or investigation of the remaining seven sites under investigation because the present land use at each of
these sites does not warrant a response action.

While
it is not feasible to determine at this time the ultimate cost of gas site remediation, the amounts accrued represent the best current estimate of NSP-Minnesota's
future liability for any required cleanup or remedial actions at these former gas operating sites. Environmental remediation costs may be recovered from insurance carriers, third parties or in future
rates. The MPUC allowed NSP-Minnesota to defer certain remediation costs of four active sites in 1994. In September 1998, the MPUC allowed the recovery of these gas site remediation
costs in gas rates, with a portion assigned to NSP's electric operations for two sites formerly used by NSP generating facilities. Accordingly, NSP-Minnesota has recorded an environmental
regulatory asset for these costs. NSP-Minnesota may request recovery of costs to remediate other activated sites following the completion of preliminary investigations.

NSP-Wisconsin
will be involved in the cleanup and remediation at locations of former manufactured gas plants at Ashland, La Crosse, Eau Claire and Chippewa Falls, Wis. The
ultimate cleanup and remediation costs of sites other than Ashland (discussed below) and the extent of NSP-Wisconsin's responsibility, if any, for sharing such costs are not known at this
time, but are expected to be immaterial.

The
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) named NSP-Wisconsin as one of three PRPs for creosote and coal tar contamination at the Ashland site. The Ashland site
includes property owned by NSP-Wisconsin and two other properties, which include an adjacent city lakeshore park area and a small area of Lake Superior's Chequemegon Bay adjoining the
park.

The
EPA has accepted a petition from a local environmental group to conduct a preliminary assessment of the Ashland site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act (CERCLA). A preliminary assessment (PA) is a limited scope investigation to evaluate the


potential
for hazardous substance releases from a site and also to determine if the site is likely to score at a high enough level to be considered for inclusion on the National Priorities List (NPL).
The PA was performed in the second half of 1999 and the results indicated a score sufficiently high to proceed to the next formal step of the EPA scoring under the Hazardous Ranking System (HRS) under
CERCLA. The HRS scoring process being performed by the EPA is now under way. NSP-Wisconsin anticipates the WDNR will still act as lead agency on the site. The PA and HRS scoring process
will result in a delay in selection of a remedial strategy for the site until later in 2000. NSP-Wisconsin has proposed and WDNR has conceptually approved an interim action (groundwater
treatment system) for one operable unit at the site for which NSP-Wisconsin has accepted responsibility. This interim action is expected to be operational by the spring of 2000 and is
designed to be a first step in remediating one portion of the site.

The
WDNR and NSP-Wisconsin have each developed several estimates of the ultimate cost to remediate the Ashland site. The estimates vary significantly, between
$4 million and $93 million, based on different assumptions for methods of remediation and expected results. However, NSP-Wisconsin believes that the estimated costs of the
most reasonable and effective solutions are between $24 million and $51 million. During 2000, the WDNR is expected to select the method of remediation for use at the site, after which a
more accurate estimate of the cost can be developed. NSP-Wisconsin has already recorded a liability for remediation costs for its portion of the Ashland site, estimated using reasonably
effective remedial methods. NSP-Wisconsin has deferred as a regulatory asset the remediation costs
accrued for the Ashland site because management expects that the PSCW will continue to allow NSP-Wisconsin to recover payments for environmental remediation from its customers. The PSCW
has consistently authorized recovery in NSP-Wisconsin rates of all remediation costs incurred at the Ashland site, and has authorized recovery of similar remediation costs for other
utilities.

In
1998, the EPA published nitrogen oxide (NO

x

) emission regulations affecting 22 states, including Wisconsin. The goal of the new regulations is to reduce
NO

x

emissions by 85 percent by May 1, 2003. Two of NSP-Wisconsin's boilers and eight of its combustion turbines may be affected by this action. If the existing
boilers and combustion turbines are made compliant using retrofit technology to control NO

x

emissions, it could cost NSP-Wisconsin up to $62 million for capital
improvements and add $14 million each year for operation and maintenance expenses. This is the estimated cost of the most expensive alternative to achieve compliance, which is not necessarily
the compliance alternative of choice. If the rules are finalized in their most stringent form, other alternatives for these older units may be deemed more cost effective than retrofitting. How the
WDNR will implement the new EPA NO

x

regulations and their applicability to NSP-Wisconsin are still uncertain.

NSP-Wisconsin
has joined with two other Wisconsin-based utilities as well as the Wisconsin Paper Council and Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce industrial organizations
to request a judicial review of the EPA's final NO

x

rules. NSP-Wisconsin believes that the EPA improperly included Wisconsin in the scope of the regulatory action and it
improperly calculated potential emissions of NO

x

, reducing the allowable emission limits for the state.

In
1999, the EPA was ordered by a federal appeals panel to suspend implementation of the NO

x

rules pending further action on a lawsuit brought by another trade group. It
is possible that the state of Wisconsin will either not be required to meet the more stringent NO

x

requirements or that their implementation will be delayed substantially.

The
Clean Air Act calls for phased-in reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from electric generating plants. NSP has invested significantly over
the years to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions at its plants. No additional capital expenditures are anticipated to comply with the sulfur dioxide


emission
limits of the Clean Air Act. NSP-Minnesota is completing installation of over-fire air at the King plant to meet the NO

x

emission limitations.
NSP-Minnesota's capital expenditures include some costs for ensuring compliance with the Clean Air Act; other expenditures may be necessary upon EPA finalization of remaining rules.
Because NSP is still in the process of implementing some provisions of the Clean Air Act, its total financial impact is unknown at this time. Capital expenditures for opacity compliance are included
in the capital expenditure commitments disclosed previously. The depreciation of these capital costs will be subject to regulatory recovery in future rate proceedings.

In
addition to NSP's utility plants, NRG has several plants throughout the United States, some of which were acquired during 1999. These plants are subject to federal and state
emission standards and other environmental regulations. Although NRG continues to study and investigate the methods and costs of complying with these standards and regulations, the future financial
effect is not known at this time and may be material.

Several
of NSP's facilities contain asbestos, which can be a health hazard to people who come in contact with it. Under governmental requirements, asbestos not readily accessible to
the environment
need not be removed until the facilities containing the material are demolished. Although the ultimate cost and timing of asbestos removal is not yet known, it is estimated that removal under current
regulations would cost $45 million in 1999 dollars. Asbestos removal costs would be recorded as incurred as operating expenses for maintenance projects, capital expenditures for construction
projects or removal costs for demolition projects.

Environmental
liabilities are subject to considerable uncertainties that affect NSP's ability to estimate its share of the ultimate costs of remediation and pollution control efforts.
Uncertainties include the nature and extent of site contamination, the extent of required cleanup efforts, varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and pollution control technologies, changes in
environmental remediation and pollution control requirements, the potential effect of technological improvements, the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at
multi-party sites and the identification of new environmental cleanup sites. NSP has recorded and/or disclosed its best estimate of expected future environmental costs and obligations.

Legal Claims

In the normal course of business, NSP is a party to routine claims and litigation arising from prior and
current operations. NSP is actively defending these matters and has recorded an estimate of the probable cost of settlement or other disposition.

On
Dec. 11, 1998, a gas explosion in St. Cloud, Minn., killed four people, including two NSP employees, injured approximately 14 people and damaged several buildings. The
accident occurred as a crew from Cable Constructors Inc. (CCI) was installing fiber optic cable for Seren. Seren, CCI and Sirti, an architecture/engineering firm retained by Seren, are named as
defendants in 10 lawsuits relating to the explosion. NSP is a defendant in eight of the lawsuits. NSP and Seren deny any liability for this accident. NSP has a self-insured retention
deductible of $2 million with general liability coverage limits of $185 million. Seren's primary insurance coverage is $1 million and its secondary insurance coverage is
$185 million. The ultimate cost to NSP and Seren, if any, is presently unknown.

In
April 1997, a fire damaged several buildings in downtown Grand Forks, N.D., during a flood in the city. On July 23, 1998, the St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co. commenced
a lawsuit against NSP for damages in excess of $15 million. The suit was filed in the District Court in Grand Forks County in North Dakota. The insurance company alleges the fire was electrical
in origin and that NSP was legally responsible for the fire because it failed to shut off electrical power to downtown Grand Forks during the flood and prior to the fire. Seven additional lawsuits
have been filed against NSP by insurance companies that insured


businesses
damaged by the fire. It is NSP's position that it is not legally responsible for this unforeseeable event. NSP has a self-insured retention deductible of $2 million, with
general liability insurance coverage limits of $150 million. The ultimate cost to NSP, if any, is unknown at this time.

On
or about July 12, 1999, Fortistar Capital, Inc. commenced an action against NRG in Hennepin County (Minnesota) District Court, seeking damages in excess of
$100 million and an order restraining NRG from consummating the acquisition of Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.'s Oswego generating station. Fortistar's motion for a temporary restraining order was
denied and a temporary injunction hearing was held on Sept. 27, 1999. The acquisition of the Oswego generating station was closed on Oct. 22, 1999, following notification to the court of
the closing date. NRG intends to continue to vigorously
defend the suit and believes Fortistar's claims to be without merit. NRG has asserted numerous counterclaims against Fortistar.

15. Proposed Business Combination

As previously reported in NSP's Report on Form 8-K, dated March 24, 1999, which was filed on March 25, 1999, NSP and NCE
agreed to merge and form Xcel Energy. At the time of the merger, each share of NCE common stock will be exchanged for 1.55 shares of Xcel Energy common stock. NSP shares need not be exchanged and will
become Xcel Energy shares on a one-for-one basis. Cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Xcel Energy common stock.

The
merger requires approval or regulatory review by certain state utilities regulators, the SEC, the FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Federal Communications
Commission, and expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. During June 1999, shareholders of both NSP and NCE approved
the merger. The FERC approved the merger in January 2000. The states of Kansas and Colorado have approved the merger. Merger approval is not required in Michigan, Oklahoma, South Dakota or
Wisconsin. NSP and NCE have filed merger applications with regulators in Arizona, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Wyoming and Texas, and at the SEC. While NSP cannot guarantee the timing or
receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, NSP currently expects the merger to be completed by the middle of 2000.

The
merger is expected to be a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange for shareholders of both companies (except for fractional shares), and to be
accounted for as a pooling of interests. NSP and NCE have agreed to certain undertakings and limitations regarding the conduct of their businesses prior to the closing of the transaction. At the time
of the merger, Xcel Energy will register as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

At
Dec. 31, 1999, NSP had deferred approximately $25 million of merger costs, pending the consummation of the business combination and consistent with NSP's filed
request for regulatory amortization over future periods.

Xcel Energy Summarized Pro Forma Information

The following summary of unaudited pro forma financial information for
Xcel Energy gives effect to the merger using the pooling of interests method of accounting. Under this accounting method, NSP's and NCE's balance sheets and income statements are treated as if they
have always been combined for financial reporting purposes. This unaudited pro forma summarized financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and related
notes of NSP and NCE, which are included in the 1999 Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the respective companies.


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15. Proposed Business Combination (Continued)

The unaudited pro forma balance sheet information at Dec. 31, 1999, assumes the merger had been completed on Dec. 31, 1999. The unaudited pro
forma income statement information assumes the merger had been completed on Jan.1, 1999, the beginning of the earliest period presented.

These
summarized pro forma amounts do not include any of the estimated cost savings expected to result from the merger of NCE and NSP. Such cost savings, net of the costs incurred to
achieve such savings and to complete the merger transaction, are subject to regulatory review and approval. However, the pro forma amounts for NSP and NCE include approximately $25 million and
$20 million, respectively, of deferred nonrecurring merger costs as of Dec. 31, 1999, mainly those directly attributable to the merger transaction. Assuming the business combination is
accounted for as a pooling of interests, these costs will be expensed upon the consummation of the NCE/NSP merger. The pro forma income statement information amounts do not reflect any of these costs.
The pro forma balance sheet information has been adjusted to reflect a write-off of the deferred costs and a related reduction of retained earnings.

In
addition to the pro forma balance sheet adjustment discussed above, adjustments have also been made to the historical amounts for NCE and NSP to conform their presentation for pro
forma combined reporting, mainly to group nonregulated property with utility plant, and to report nonregulated revenue and operating income with utility amounts.

The
unaudited summarized pro forma financial information does not necessarily indicate what the combined company's financial position or operating results would have been if the
merger had been completed on the assumed completion dates and does not necessarily indicate future operating results of the combined company.

16. Segment and Related Information

NSP has four reportable segments: Electric Utility, Gas Utility and two of its nonregulated energy businesses, its wholly owned subsidiaries NRG and EMI.

•

NSP's
Electric Utility generates, transmits and distributes electricity primarily in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota and South Dakota. It also
makes sales for resale and provides wholesale transmission service to various entities in the United States.

•

NSP's
Gas Utility transmits, transports, stores and distributes natural gas and propane primarily in Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Michigan and
Arizona.

•

NRG
develops, builds, acquires, owns and operates several nonregulated energy-related businesses, including independent power production, commercial and
industrial heating and cooling, and energy-related refuse-derived fuel production, both domestically and outside the United States.

•

EMI
is an energy service company, primarily retrofitting and upgrading facilities for greater energy efficiency, in the United States.

In
general, NSP has segmented its operations as either regulated or nonregulated businesses. Further, the regulated businesses are separated between electric and gas; and nonregulated
businesses are separated by company (primarily based on product and services). The electric and gas businesses are part of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and Viking companies and
are reviewed at various jurisdiction and/or company levels. They have been aggregated as reportable segments as they are aggregated for reporting to NSP's board of directors. Assets by segment are not
reported to management and are not included in the disclosures that follow.

The
measure of profit or loss for electric and gas segments reported in the various management reports varies, but the largest component, NSP-Minnesota, reports net income
and earnings per share on a basis consistent with consolidated net income and earnings per share, except that allocations are needed for some items, as described later. Intercompany and intersegment
sales are priced at approved tariff rates and are immaterial. In addition, since NRG and EMI are separate companies, their net income and earnings per share are the measure of profit or loss for both
internal management reporting and consolidated external NSP reporting.

To
report net income for electric and gas utility segments, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin must assign or allocate all costs and certain other income. In
general, costs are:

•

directly
assigned wherever applicable

•

allocated
based on cost causation allocators wherever applicable


•

allocated
based on a general allocator for all other costs not assigned by the above two methods

The
"all other" category includes segments that measure below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure and consists primarily of nonregulated companies, including Eloigne,
an affordable housing investment company; Seren, a broadband telecommunications company; Ultra Power, a power-cable testing company; and several other small companies and businesses.

(a)

The Consolidated Total amounts for income and expense items represent the sum of utility amounts (including some nonoperating items) from the Statements of Income and the
nonregulated amounts from Note 6. The depreciation and amortization amounts in the Statements of Cash Flows are different than reported in the Consolidated Total column due to classification of
certain depreciation and amortization amounts as other expense items in the Income Statement.

(b)

All operating revenues are from external customers located in the United States. However, NRG has significant equity investments for nonregulated projects outside of
the United
States. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, primarily independent power projects, includes $38.6 million in 1999, $29.3 million in 1998 and $27.1 million in 1997 from
nonregulated projects located outside of the United States. NRG's equity investments in projects outside of the United States were $606 million in 1999, $557 million in 1998 and
$517 million in 1997.

(a)

1999 results include two adjustments related to regulatory recovery of conservation program incentives. Second quarter results were reduced by $35 million before taxes, or
14 cents per share, due to the disallowance of 1998 incentives. Fourth quarter results were reduced by $22 million before taxes, or 8 cents per share, due to the reversal of all
income recorded through the third quarter for 1999 electric conservation program incentives. In addition, 1999 fourth quarter results include a pretax charge of $17 million, or 8 cents per
share, to write off goodwill related to EMI's acquisitions. Also a pretax charge of $11 million, or 4 cents per share, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999 to write down an investment in
CellNet common stock. In addition, NRG recorded a gain of approximately 3 cents per share on the partial sale of its interest in Cogeneration Corp. of America during the fouth quarter of 1999.

(b)

1998 results include a $22 million pretax charge, which reduced third quarter earnings by 10 cents per share, for the write-down of NRG projects.

(c)

1998 results include a $26 million pretax gain, which increased fourth quarter earnings by 11 cents per share, for a partial sale of an NRG
project.

Pension Plan Table

As of January 1, 1999, pension benefits were changed. Prior to January 1, 1999, each nonbargaining employee was given an opportunity to choose
between two retirement programs, the Traditional Program and the Pension Equity Program. All of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table chose the Traditional Program for their
pension benefits.

Under
the

Traditional Program

, the annual compensation used to calculate the average compensation uses base salary for the year, and,
for certain individuals, including Messrs. Howard, McIntyre, Taylor and Johnson, bonus compensation paid in that same year. After an employee has reached 30 years of service, no
additional years of service are used in determining the pension benefit under the Traditional Program. The basic pension benefit under the Traditional Program payable at age 65 is the same as the
benefit payable under the pension plan as of December 31, 1998. The benefit amounts under the Traditional Program are computed in the form of a straight-life annuity. Both programs,
the Traditional Program and the Pension Equity Program, feature a cash balance side account which credits $1,400 annually, plus interest each year. The opening balance as of January 1, 1999 was
$1,400 times years of service.

The
following table illustrates the approximate retirement benefits payable under the Traditional Program to employees retiring at the normal retirement age of 65 years:

At the end of 1999, each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table had the following credited service: Mr. Howard, 12.92 years,
Mr. Anders, 2.67 years, Mr. McIntyre, 26.83 years, Mr. Taylor, 26.58 years and Mr. Johnson, 21.08 years.


An
employment agreement with Mr. Howard provides that he and his spouse, if she survives him, will receive a lump-sum payment equal to the present value of combined
benefits from the Pension Plan and supplemental Company payments as though he had completed 30 years of service, less the pension benefits earned from a former employer. For purposes of the
employment agreement, the present value of the lump sum payment will be calculated using a discount rate based on the interest rate for valuing immediate annuities used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, which is now different from the GATT rate utilized for other employees.

An
employment agreement with Mr. Anders provides that he will receive payments equal to the combined benefits from the Pension Plan and supplemental Company payments as though
his service with a former employer were included in determining benefits under the Company's pension plans, less the pension benefits earned from a former employer. Benefits under the employment
agreement will include incentive payments in determining the final average compensation.

Employment Agreements and Severance Arrangements

At the time we entered into the merger agreement with New Century Energies, we also entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Howard, which will
replace his current employment agreement when the merger takes place. Under this new agreement, Mr. Howard will continue to be an employee of Xcel Energy and will serve as Chairman of the Board
of Directors of Xcel Energy for one year following the merger. He will also be forbidden from competing with Xcel Energy and its affiliates for two years following the termination of his employment or
for one year after the merger, whichever is longer, and from disclosing confidential information of Xcel Energy and its affiliates.

Under
his new employment agreement, Mr. Howard will receive the following compensation and benefits during the year following the merger:

•

a
base salary not less than the higher of his base salary immediately before the merger and his current base salary of $730,000;

•

an
annual bonus on the same basis as other senior executives, with a target bonus of 65% of his base salary;

•

the
same employee benefits as other senior executives of Xcel Energy; and

•

the
same fringe benefits as he receives under his current employment agreement.

In
addition, Mr. Howard will receive a special retention bonus in recognition of:

•

his
remaining employed for one year following the merger, even though he will no longer be chief executive officer;

•

the
special efforts he will be making to cause the merger to take place and to implement a successful transition to combined operations of Northern States
Power and New Century Energies; and

•

his
agreement to the noncompetition and confidentiality covenants described above.

If
the merger does take place and Mr. Howard remains employed for one year after the merger, he will be paid a special retention bonus of $7.6 million one year after the
merger. If the merger does not take place, or if the merger takes place but Mr. Howard dies or becomes disabled within one year after the merger, a special retention bonus of
$2.5 million will be paid on the day his employment terminates. In either case, $2.5 million is being paid specifically for the noncompetition and confidentiality covenants described
above, and Mr. Howard will be obligated to return that amount if he breaches the covenants in any material way.


If
Mr. Howard's employment were to be terminated by Xcel Energy without cause or if he were to terminate his employment for good reason after the merger, he would be entitled
to receive the compensation and benefits described above as if he had remained employed under the new employment agreement for the remainder of the year following the merger. Mr. Howard's new
employment agreement also preserves the supplemental retirement benefit to which he is entitled under his current employment agreement. Finally, Xcel Energy is obligated to make Mr. Howard
whole for any excise tax on excess parachute payments that he may incur.

We
adopted a 1999 senior executive severance policy shortly before we entered into the merger agreement. This policy will continue for five years, and may be extended beyond five
years. All of the executive officers of Northern States Power other than Mr. Howard participate in the policy.

Under
the policy, a participant whose employment is terminated at any time before the third anniversary of the merger will receive severance benefits unless

•

the
employer terminated the participant for cause;

•

the
termination was because of the participant's death, disability, or retirement;

•

the
division or subsidiary in which the participant worked was sold and the buyer agreed to continue the participant's employment with specified
protections for the participant; or

•

the
participant terminated voluntarily without good reason. To receive the severance benefits, the participant must also sign an agreement releasing all
claims against the employer and its affiliates, and agreeing not to compete with the employer and its affiliates and not to solicit their employees and customers.

The
severance benefits for executive officers under the policy include the following:

•

a
cash payment equal to 2.5 times the participant's annual base salary, annual bonus and annualized long-term incentive compensation, plus
pro-rated incentive compensation for the year of termination;

•

a
cash payment equal to the additional amounts that would have been credited to the executive under pension and retirement savings plans, if the
participant had remained employed for another 2.5 years;

•

continued
welfare benefits for 2.5 years;

•

financial
planning benefits for two years, and outplacement services costing not more than $30,000; and

•

an
additional cash payment to make the participant whole for any excise tax on excess parachute payments that he or she may incur, with certain limitations
specified in the policies.

The
benefits under the severance policy described above will be reduced by any severance benefits that the participant receives under the senior executive severance policy that we
adopted in 1995.

We
cannot be sure whether any executive officers of Northern States Power will terminate employment and receive severance benefits. Also, even if we assume that they will get the
benefits, the actual amount of the benefits will depend on when their employment actually terminates and other factors which we cannot now determine. However, based on current compensation levels, we
have estimated that if (1) the merger had occurred on March 24, 2000, (2) all of our executive officers were terminated at the time the merger occurred, and (3) the other
assumptions we used to make the calculations are correct, then the cash payments they would receive under the policies would be approximately as follows: Edward J. McIntyre,
$4.1 million; Paul E. Anders, $2.6 million; Loren L. Taylor, $3.0 million; and Gary R. Johnson, $2.6 million; all other executive officers of Northern
States Power as a group, $27.4 million. These amounts assume that they will be required to pay excise tax on excess parachute payments.


Director Compensation

Employees of the Company receive no separate compensation for service as a director. During 1999, directors not employed by the Company received a $25,000
annual retainer (or a pro rata portion if service was less than 12 months) and $1,200 for each Board and Committee meeting attended. These directors also received a grant of stock equivalent
units under the Stock Equivalent Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which was established in 1996 and is described below. Additionally, a $2,800 annual retainer was paid to each elected
Committee Chairperson.

In
1996, we established a Stock Equivalent Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Stock Equivalent Plan") to more closely align directors' interests with those of our
shareholders. Under the Stock Equivalent Plan, directors may receive an annual award of stock equivalent units with each unit having a value equal to one share of common stock of the Company. Stock
equivalent units do not entitle a director to vote and are only payable as a distribution of whole shares of the Company's common stock upon a director's termination of service. The stock equivalent
units fluctuate in value as the value of common stock of the Company fluctuates. Additional stock equivalent units are accumulated upon the payment of and at the same value as dividends declared on
common stock of the Company. On April 29, 1999, non-employee directors each received an award of 872.344 stock equivalent units totaling approximately $20,800 in cash value.
Additional stock equivalent units were accumulated during 1999 as dividends were paid on common stock of the Company. The number of stock equivalents for each non-employee director is
listed in the share ownership chart which is set forth below.

Directors
also may participate in a deferred compensation plan which provides for deferral of director retainers and meeting fees until after retirement from the Board of Directors. A
director may defer director retainer and meeting fees into the Stock Equivalent Plan.
