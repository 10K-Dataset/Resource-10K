  Recovers, over a 15-year period, the incremental cost (including fuel and
  purchased energy) incurred by PSCo as a result of a voluntary plan to reduce
  emissions and improve air quality in the Denver metro area.

DSM

Demand-side management. Energy
  conservation, weatherization and other programs to conserve or manage energy
  use by customers.


DSMCA

Demand-side management cost
  adjustment. A clause permitting PSCo to recover demand-side management costs
  over five years while non-labor incremental expenses and carrying costs
  associated with deferred DSM costs are recovered on an annual basis. Costs
  for the low-income energy assistance program are recovered through the DSMCA.

ECA

Retail electric commodity
  adjustment. The ECA, effective Jan. 1, 2004, is an incentive adjustment
  mechanism that compares actual fuel and purchased energy expense in a

  cap on any cost sharing over or under an allowed ECA formula rate. The
  current ECA mechanism expired Dec. 31, 2006. Effective Jan. 1, 2007
  the ECA has been modified to include an incentive adjustment to encourage
  efficient operation of base load coal plants and encourage cost reductions
  through purchases of economical short-term energy. The total incentive
  payment to PSCo in any calendar year will not exceed $11.25 million. The ECA
  mechanism will be revised quarterly and interest will accrue monthly on the
  average deferred balance. The ECA will expire at the earlier of rates taking
  effect after Comanche 3 is placed in service or Dec. 31, 2010.

FCA

Fuel clause adjustment. A
  clause included in electric rate schedules that provides for monthly rate
  adjustments to reflect the actual cost of electric fuel and purchased energy
  compared to a prior forecast. The difference between the electric costs
  collected through the FCA rates and the actual costs incurred in a month are
  collected or refunded in a subsequent period.

FCA (Wholesale)

Wholesale fuel clause
  adjustment. A fuel cost recovery mechanism in the NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS
  wholesale electric tariff that provides for monthly adjustments to reflect
  the actual cost of electric fuel and purchased energy compared to a prior

  transportation. The GCA is revised monthly to coincide with changes in
  purchased gas costs.

PCCA

Purchased capacity cost
  adjustment. Allows PSCo to recover from customers purchased capacity payments
  to power suppliers under specifically identified power purchase agreements
  not included in the determination of PSCo’s base electric rates or other
  recovery mechanisms. This clause expired in 2006. A new PCCA clause became
  effective Jan. 1, 2007, which permits recovery from retail customers for
  all purchased capacity payments to power suppliers. Capacity charges are not
  included in PSCo’s base electric rates or other recovery mechanisms.

PGA

Purchased gas adjustment. A
  clause included in NSP-Minnesota’s and NSP-Wisconsin’s retail natural gas
  rate schedules that provides for prospective monthly rate adjustments to
  reflect the forecasted cost of purchased natural gas and natural gas
  transportation. The annual difference between the natural gas costs collected
  through PGA rates and the actual natural gas costs is collected or refunded
  over the subsequent period.

QSP

Quality of service plan.
  Provides for bill credits to retail customers if the utility does not achieve
  certain operational performance targets and/or specific capital investments
  for reliability. The current QSP for PSCo and SPS electric utility expired in

  energy (including wind energy) in retail electric rates in Minnesota. The RCR
  is revised annually. The RCR will be replaced by the TCR adjustment effective
  in 2007.

SCA

Steam cost adjustment. Allows
  PSCo to recover the difference between its actual cost of fuel and the amount
  of these costs recovered under its base steam service rates. The SCA is
  revised annually to coincide with changes in fuel costs.

TCR

Transmission cost recovery
  adjustment. Allows NSP-Minnesota to recover the cost of transmission
  facilities not included in the determination of NSP-Minnesota’s base electric
  rates in retail electric rates in Minnesota. The TCR was approved by the MPUC
  in 2006 to be effective in 2007, and will be revised annually as new transmission
  investments and costs are incurred.

Other Terms and Abbreviations

COMPANY
OVERVIEW

Xcel Energy is
a holding company, with subsidiaries engaged primarily in the utility business.
In 2006, Xcel Energy’s continuing operations included the activity of four
wholly-owned utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers
in 8 states. These utility subsidiaries are NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo
and SPS. These utilities serve customers in portions of Colorado, Michigan,
Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Along
with WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline company, these companies comprise
the continuing regulated utility operations.

Xcel Energy was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in 1909. Xcel
Energy’s executive offices are located at 414 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis,
Minn. 55401. Its Web site address is www.xcelenergy.com. Xcel Energy makes
available, free of charge through its Web site, its annual report on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K as soon as reasonably practicable after such
material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. In addition, the
Xcel Energy Guidelines on Corporate Governance and Code of Conduct also are
available on its Web site.

NSP-Minnesota

NSP-Minnesota
was incorporated in 2000 under the laws of Minnesota. NSP-Minnesota is an
operating utility engaged in the generation, purchase, transmission,
distribution and sale of electricity in Minnesota, North Dakota and South
Dakota. The wholesale customers served by NSP-Minnesota comprised approximately
13 percent of the total sales in 2006. NSP-Minnesota also purchases,
transports, distributes and sells natural gas to retail customers and
transports customer-owned natural gas in Minnesota and North Dakota.
NSP-Minnesota provides electric utility service to approximately 1.4 million
customers and natural gas utility service to approximately 0.5 million
customers. Approximately 90 percent of NSP-Minnesota’s retail electric
operating revenues was derived from operations in Minnesota during 2006.

The electric
production and transmission system of NSP-Minnesota is managed as an integrated
system with that of NSP-Wisconsin, jointly referred to as the NSP System. The
electric production and transmission costs of the entire NSP System are shared
by NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin. A FERC-approved agreement between the two
companies, called the Interchange Agreement, provides for the sharing of all
costs of generation and transmission facilities of the NSP System, including
capital costs.


NSP-Minnesota owns the following direct subsidiaries: United Power and
Land Co., which holds real estate; and NSP Nuclear Corp., which holds
NSP-Minnesota’s interest in the NMC.

NSP-Wisconsin

NSP-Wisconsin was incorporated in 1901 under the laws of Wisconsin. NSP-Wisconsin
is an operating utility engaged in the generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity to approximately 245,000 customers in portions of
northwestern Wisconsin and in the western portion of the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan. The wholesale customers served by NSP-Wisconsin comprised
approximately 8 percent of NSP-Wisconsin’s total sales in 2006. NSP-Wisconsin
also purchases, transports, distributes and sells natural gas to retail
customers and transports customer-owned natural gas in the same service
territory to approximately 100,000 customers. See the discussion of the
integrated management of the electric production and transmission system of
NSP-Wisconsin under NSP-Minnesota, discussed previously. Approximately 97
percent of NSP-Wisconsin’s retail electric operating revenues was derived from
operations in Wisconsin during 2006.

NSP-Wisconsin owns the following direct subsidiaries: Chippewa and
Flambeau Improvement Co., which operates hydro reservoirs; Clearwater
Investments Inc., which owns interests in affordable housing; and NSP Lands, Inc.,
which holds real estate.

PSCo

PSCo was incorporated in 1924 under the laws of Colorado. PSCo is an
operating utility engaged primarily in the generation, purchase, transmission,
distribution and sale of electricity. PSCo also purchases, transports,
distributes and sells natural gas to retail customers and transports
customer-owned natural gas. PSCo serves approximately 1.3 million electric
customers and approximately 1.3 million natural gas customers in Colorado. The
wholesale customers served by PSCo comprised approximately 22 percent of PSCo’s
total Kwh sales in 2006. All of PSCo’s retail electric operating revenues were
derived from operations in Colorado during 2006.

PSCo owns the following direct subsidiaries: 1480 Welton, Inc.,
which owns certain real estate interests for PSCo; PSRI, which owns and manages
permanent life insurance policies on certain current and former employees; and
Green and Clear Lakes Company, which owns water rights. PSCo also holds a
controlling interest in several other relatively small ditch and water
companies.

SPS

SPS was incorporated in 1921 under the laws of New Mexico. SPS is an
operating utility engaged primarily in the generation, purchase, transmission,
distribution and sale of electricity. SPS serves approximately 386,000 electric
customers in portions of Texas and New Mexico. The wholesale customers served
by SPS comprised approximately 37 percent of SPS’ total Kwh sales in 2006. Approximately
77 percent of SPS’ retail electric operating revenues was derived from
operations in Texas during 2006.

In October 2005, SPS reached a definitive agreement to sell its
delivery system operations in Oklahoma, Kansas and a small portion of Texas to
Tri-County Electric Cooperative. Effective July 31, 2006, SPS completed
the sale to Tri-County Electric Cooperative for $24.5 million, and a gain of
$6.1 million was recognized. SPS now provides wholesale service to Tri-County
Electric Cooperative.

Other
Subsidiaries

WGI was incorporated in 1990 under the laws of Colorado. WGI is a small
interstate natural gas pipeline company engaged in transporting natural gas
from the PSCo system near Chalk Bluffs, Colo., to the Cheyenne system near
Cheyenne, Wyo.

In 1999, WYCO Development LLC (WYCO) was jointly formed with a
subsidiary of El Paso Corporation to develop and lease new natural gas pipeline
and compression facilities. Xcel Energy plans to invest approximately $145
million in WYCO between 2007 and 2009. The WYCO pipeline project is expected to
begin operations in 2008 and the WYCO storage project is expected to begin
operations in 2009. The new pipeline and storage projects will be leased to
Colorado Interstate Gas Company, a subsidiary of El Paso Corporation. The terms
of the lease agreement of the new pipeline and storage projects will be based
on FERC regulation and it is anticipated that they will be approved by the FERC
as a component of the certificate filing to be made by the Colorado Interstate
Gas Company.

Xcel Energy’s nonregulated subsidiary in continuing operations is
Eloigne.

See financial information regarding the segments of Xcel Energy’s
business at Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


In the past, Xcel Energy had several other subsidiaries that were sold
or divested. For more information regarding Xcel Energy’s discontinued
operations, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS

Electric Utility Trends

Overview

Utility
Industry Growth —

Xcel Energy intends
to focus on growing through investments in electric and natural gas rate base
to meet growing customer demands and to maintain or increase reliability and
quality of service to customers. Xcel Energy has and plans to continue to file
rate cases with state and federal regulators to earn a return on its
investments and recover costs of operations. For more information regarding
Xcel Energy’s capital expenditures, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Utility
Restructuring and Retail Competition —

The
structure of the utility industry has been subject to change. Merger and
acquisition activity was significant as utilities combined to capture economies
of scale or establish a strategic niche in preparing for the future. The FERC
has implemented wholesale electric utility competition, and the wholesale
customers of Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries can purchase from competing
wholesale suppliers and use the transmission systems of the utility
subsidiaries on a comparable basis to the utility subsidiaries’ use to serve
their native load.

Xcel Energy recognizes that local market conditions and political
realities must be considered in developing its transition to competition plan
and a planned competition date for the Texas Panhandle. Given the current
situation, Xcel Energy has been unable to develop a plan for the Texas
Panhandle to move toward retail competition that would be in the best interests
of its customers. Xcel Energy currently does not plan to propose to implement
retail customer choice in the Texas Panhandle until required.

Xcel Energy does support the continued development of wholesale
competition and non-discriminatory wholesale open access transmission services.
Xcel Energy will continue to work with the SPP on RTO development for the
Panhandle region and the incorporation of independent transmission operations
to insure non-discriminatory open access. Xcel Energy is also still pursuing
strengthening its transmission system internally to alleviate north and south
congestion within the Texas Panhandle and other lines to increase the transfer
capability between the Texas Panhandle and other electric systems.

Some states have implemented some form of retail electric utility
competition. Much of Texas has implemented retail competition, but it is
presently limited to utilities within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas
(ERCOT), which does not include SPS. Under current law, SPS can file a plan to
implement competition, subject to regulatory approval, in Texas. Xcel Energy
does not plan to implement competition until it is required. In 2002,
NSP-Wisconsin began providing its Michigan electric customers with the
opportunity to select an alternative electric energy provider. To date, no
NSP-Wisconsin customers have selected an alternative electric energy provider.

The retail electric business does face some competition as industrial
and large commercial customers have some ability to own or operate facilities
to generate their own electricity. In addition, customers may have the option
of substituting other fuels, such as natural gas or steam/chilled water for
heating, cooling and manufacturing purposes, or the option of relocating their
facilities to a lower cost region. While each of Xcel Energy’s utility
subsidiaries face these challenges, these subsidiaries believe their rates are
competitive with currently available alternatives.

Summary of
Recent Federal Regulatory Developments

The FERC has jurisdiction over rates for electric transmission service
in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale, hydro facility
licensing, natural gas transportation, accounting practices and certain other
activities of Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries. State and local agencies have
jurisdiction over many of Xcel Energy’s utility activities, including
regulation of retail rates and environmental matters. In addition to the
matters discussed below, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a discussion of other regulatory matters.

FERC Rules Implementing
Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Energy Act) —

The Energy Act repealed PUHCA effective Feb. 8,
2006. In addition, the Energy Act required the FERC to conduct several
rulemakings to adopt new regulations to implement various aspects of the Energy
Act. Since Aug. 2005, the FERC has completed or initiated the proceedings
to modify its regulations on a number of subjects, including:

·

Adopting
new regulations by establishing rules for accounting procedures for
holding company systems, including cost allocation rules for transactions
between companies within a holding company system;


·

Adopting
new regulations to implement changes to the FERC’s merger and asset transfer
authority;

·

Adopting
new “market manipulation regulations” prohibiting any “manipulative or
deceptive device or contrivance” in wholesale natural gas and electricity
commodity and transportation or transmission markets and interpreting this
standard in a manner consistent with Rule 10b-5 of the SEC;
violations are subject to potential civil penalties of up to $1 million per
day;

·

Adopting
regulations to establish a national Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to
replace the voluntary North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC)
structure, and requiring the ERO to establish mandatory reliability standards
and imposition of financial or other penalties for violations of adopted
standards. The FERC has issued proposed rules to make 83 ERO reliability
standards mandatory and subject to potential financial penalties for
non-compliance to be effective June 1, 2007;

·

Adopting
rules to implement changes to the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act to
allow utility ownership of QFs and strengthening the thermal energy
requirements for entities seeking to be QFs;

·

Proposing
rules that would allow a utility to seek to eliminate its mandatory QF
power purchase obligation for utilities in organized wholesale energy markets
such as MISO; and

·

Adopting rules to establish
incentives for investment in new electric transmission infrastructure.

While Xcel Energy cannot predict the ultimate impact the new
regulations will have on its operations or financial results, Xcel Energy is
taking appropriate actions that are intended to comply with and implement these
new rules and regulations as they become effective.

Electric
Transmission Rate Regulation —

The
FERC also regulates the rates charged and terms and conditions for electric
transmission services. FERC policy encourages utilities to turn over the
functional control over their electric transmission assets and the related
responsibility for the sale of electric transmission services to an RTO. NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin are members of the MISO. SPS is a member of the SPP. Each
RTO separately files regional transmission tariff rates for approval by FERC. All
members within that RTO are then subjected to those rates. PSCo is currently
participating with other utilities in the development of WestConnect, which
would provide certain regionalized transmission and wholesale energy market
functions but would not be an RTO.

Centralized
Regional Wholesale Markets —

FERC rules require
RTO’s to operate centralized regional wholesale energy markets. The FERC required
the MISO to begin operation of a “Day 2” wholesale energy market on April 1,
2005. MISO uses security constrained regional economic dispatch and congestion
management using locational marginal pricing (LMP) and FTRs. The Day 2 market
is intended to provide more efficient generation dispatch over the 15 state
MISO region, including the NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin systems. SPP
received FERC approval to initiate an Energy Imbalance Service (EIS) market,
which will provide a more limited wholesale energy market that will affect the
SPS system. The SPP EIS market commenced on Feb. 1, 2007.

NSP-Minnesota

Ratemaking
Principles

Summary of
Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction —

Retail
rates, services and other aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s operations are regulated
by the MPUC, the NDPSC and the SDPUC within their respective states. The MPUC
has regulatory authority over aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s financial activities,
including security issuances, property transfers, mergers and transactions
between NSP-Minnesota and its affiliates. In addition, the MPUC reviews and
approves NSP-Minnesota’s electric resource plans for meeting customers’ future
energy needs. The MPUC also certifies the need for generating plants greater
than 50 MW and transmission lines greater than 100 KV.

The MPUC is also empowered to select and designate sites for new power
plants with a capacity of 50 MW or more and wind energy conversion plants with
a capacity of five MW or more. It also designates routes for electric
transmission lines with a capacity of 100 KV or more. No large power plant or
transmission line may be constructed in Minnesota except on a site or route
designated by the MPUC. The NDPSC and SDPUC have regulatory authority over the
need for certain generating and transmission facilities, and the siting and
routing of certain new generation and transmission facilities in North Dakota
and South Dakota, respectively.

NSP-Minnesota is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect
to its wholesale electric operations, accounting practices, wholesale sales for
resale and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce.
NSP-Minnesota has received


authorization from the FERC to make wholesale electric sales at
market-based prices (see market-based rate authority discussion) and is a
transmission-owner member of the MISO.

Fuel,
Purchased Energy and Conservation Cost Recovery Mechanisms —

NSP-Minnesota’s
retail electric rate schedules in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota
include a FCA that provides for monthly adjustments to billings and revenues
for changes in prudently incurred cost of fuel, fuel related items and
purchased energy. NSP-Minnesota is permitted to recover these costs through FCA
mechanisms individually approved by the regulators in each jurisdiction. The
FCA mechanisms allow NSP-Minnesota to bill customers for the cost of fuel and
fuel related costs used to generate electricity at its plants and energy
purchased from other suppliers. With NSP-Minnesota’s participation in the MISO
Day 2 market, questions were raised regarding the inclusion of certain MISO
charges in the FCA. However, in December 2006, the MPUC authorized FCA
recovery of all MISO Day 2 charges, except certain administrative charges,
which NSP-Minnesota is partially recovering in base rates and partially
deferring for future recovery. In general, capacity costs are not recovered
through the FCA. NSP-Minnesota’s electric wholesale customers also have a FCA
provision in their contracts.

NSP-Minnesota is required by Minnesota law to spend a minimum of 2
percent of Minnesota electric revenue on conservation improvement programs. These
costs are recovered through an annual cost recovery mechanism for electric
conservation and energy management program expenditures. NSP-Minnesota is
required to request a new cost recovery level annually.

MERP Rider
Regulation —

In December 2003,
the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s MERP proposal to convert two coal-fueled
electric generating plants to natural gas, and to install advanced pollution
control equipment at a third coal-fired plant. These improvements are expected
to significantly reduce air emissions from these facilities, while increasing
the capacity at system peak by 300 MW. The projects are expected to come on
line between 2007 and 2009, at a cumulative investment of approximately $1
billion. The MPUC approved a rate rider to recover prudent costs of the
projects from Minnesota customers beginning Jan. 1, 2006, including a rate
of return on the construction work in progress. The MPUC approval has a sliding
ROE scale based on actual construction cost compared with a target level of
construction costs (based on an equity ratio of 48.5 percent and debt of 51.5
percent) to incentivize NSP-Minnesota to control construction costs. At
Dec. 31, 2006, the estimated ROE was 10.74 percent, based on construction
progress to date.

Energy Sources
and Related Initiatives

NSP-Minnesota expects to use existing electric generating stations,
purchases from other utilities, independent power producers and power
marketers, demand-side management options, new generation facilities and phased
expansion of existing generation at select power plants to meet its system
capacity requirements.

Purchased
Power —

NSP-Minnesota has contractual
arrangements to purchase power from other utilities and nonregulated energy
suppliers. Capacity is the measure of the rate at which a particular generating
source produces electricity. Energy is a measure of the amount of electricity
produced from a particular generating source over a period of time. Long-term
purchase power contracts typically require a periodic payment to secure the
capacity from a particular generating source and a charge for the associated
energy actually purchased from such generating source.


NSP-Minnesota
also makes short-term purchases to replace generation from company-owned units
that are unavailable due to maintenance and unplanned outages, to comply with
minimum availability requirements, to obtain energy at a lower cost than that
which could be produced by other resource options, including company-owned
generation and/or long-term purchase power contracts, and for various other
operating requirements.

Excelsior
Energy Inc. (Excelsior) —

In December 2005,
Excelsior, an independent energy developer, filed a power purchase agreement
with the MPUC seeking a declaration by the MPUC that NSP-Minnesota be compelled
to enter into a power purchase agreement and purchase the output from each of two
integrated gas combined cycle (IGCC) plants to be located in northern Minnesota.
Excelsior filed this petition making claims pursuant to Minnesota statutes,
relating to Innovative Energy Project and Clean Energy Technology.

The MPUC referred this matter to a contested case hearing to develop
the facts and issues that must be resolved to act on Excelsior’s petition,
including development of price information. The contested case proceeding considered
a 603 MW unit in phase I and a second 603 MW unit in phase II of Excelsior
project.

In 2006, NSP-Minnesota and other parties filed testimony in phase I of
this proceeding. The parties filed briefs in January 2007. The ALJ is expected
 to make a recommendation to the MPUC on
phase I later in the first quarter of 2007 and make a recommendation on phase
II in August 2007.

NSP-Minnesota’s
position in the proceeding is that the proposal (i) is inconsistent with
our resource need, (ii) is not likely to be least-cost and is not in the
public interest, (iii) shifts substantial risks to NSP-Minnesota and our
ratepayers, (iv) presents a power purchase agreement that is inconsistent
with industry standards in its allocation of risks and costs, (v) the
proposal fails to satisfy the elements of the statutes under which it is
proposed, and (vi) the proposal could result in significant adverse
financial consequences. NSP-Minnesota intends to request that all costs
associated with the proposed power purchase agreement, if approved, will be
recoverable in customer rates.

NSP System
Resource Plan —

On Nov. 1, 2004,
NSP-Minnesota filed its proposed resource plan for the period 2005 through 2019.
The proposed plan identified needed resources and proposed processes for
acquiring resources to meet those needs. On July 28, 2006, the MPUC issued
an order that, among other things:

·

Approved NSP-Minnesota’s
proposal to proceed with a request for proposal for 136 MW of peaking resources
with an intended in service date of 2011;

·

Identified a base load
resource need of 375 MW beginning in 2015 and required NSP-Minnesota to file a
certificate of need application for a proposed base load resource to begin the
acquisition process by Nov. 1, 2006;

·

Approved acquisition of
1,680 MW of wind generation resource over the planning period;

·

Accepted the proposed
increases in demand-side management and energy-savings goals; and

·

Accepted the submittal of
Xcel’s plan for uprating the Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants along
with a comprehensive environmental and upgrade plan for the Sherco plant.

On Oct. 18, 2006, the MPUC issued an order after reconsideration
clarifying the Nov. 1, 2006, filing requirements and extending the filing
requirement for the nuclear upgrades until Sept. 1, 2007, to accommodate
scheduling and legislative review of the MPUC’s decision in the Monticello
certificate of need proceeding.

NSP-Minnesota
expects to file its next resource plan with the MPUC on July 1, 2007.

NSP-Minnesota Base Load Acquisition
Proceeding —

On Nov. 1, 2006,
NSP-Minnesota filed a proposal with the MPUC for a purchase of 375 MW of
capacity and energy from Manitoba Hydro for the period 2015-2025 and the
purchase of 380 MW of wind energy to fulfill the base load need identified
in the 2004 resource plan. The proposal included a signed term sheet with
Manitoba Hydro and a process to acquire the wind energy through competitive
bidding. Alternative suppliers were entitled to submit competing proposals to
the MPUC by Dec. 18, 2006. An alternate supplier proposed a 375 MW share
of a mine mouth lignite circulating fluidized bed plant located in North Dakota
and 380 MW of wind energy generation, with an option for Xcel Energy ownership
in both components. The MPUC found both NSP-Minnesota’s proposal and the alternate
proposal to be substantially complete and referred the matter to a contested
case proceeding.

NSP-Minnesota
Transmission Certificates of Need —

In
December 2001, NSP-Minnesota proposed construction of various transmission
system upgrades to provide transmission outlet capacity for up to 825 MW of
renewable energy generation (wind and biomass) being constructed in southwest
and western Minnesota. In March 2003, the MPUC granted four certificates
of need to NSP-Minnesota, thereby approving construction, subject to certain
conditions. The initial projected cost of the transmission upgrades was approximately
$160 million. The MPUC granted a routing permit for the


first major transmission facilities in the development program in 2004.
The remaining route permit proceedings were completed in 2005

.

In 2003, the MPUC also approved an RCR
automatic adjustment mechanism that allows NSP-Minnesota to recover the revenue
requirements associated with certain transmission investments for delivery of
renewable energy resources.

In late 2006, NSP-Minnesota filed two applications for certificates of
need with the MPUC for four additional transmission lines in southwestern
Minnesota and Chisago County. NSP-Minnesota along with ten other transmission
providers, have announced plans to file certificate of need applications by mid
2007 for three transmission lines serving Minnesota and parts of surrounding
states.

See Note 13 in
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Purchased Transmission Services —

NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin have contractual arrangements with MISO to deliver power and
energy to the NSP System for native load customers.

Nuclear Power
Operations and Waste Disposal —

NSP-Minnesota owns two nuclear
generating plants: the Monticello plant and the Prairie Island plant. See
additional discussion regarding the nuclear generating plants at Note 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nuclear power
plant operation produces gaseous, liquid and solid radioactive wastes. The
discharge and handling of such wastes are controlled by federal regulation. High-level
radioactive wastes primarily include used nuclear fuel. Low-level radioactive
waste consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing,
rags, tools and equipment that have become contaminated through use in the
plant.

Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal —

Federal
law places responsibility on each state for disposal of its low-level
radioactive waste generated within its borders. Low-level radioactive waste
from NSP-Minnesota’s Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants is currently
disposed at the Barnwell facility located in South Carolina (all classes of
low-level waste) and at the Clive facility located in Utah (class A low-level
substance only). NSP-Minnesota has an annual contract with Barnwell, but is
also able to utilize the Clive facility through various low-level waste
processors. NSP-Minnesota has low-level storage capacity available on-site at
Prairie Island and Monticello that would allow both plants to continue to
operate until the end of their current licensed lives, if off-site low-level
disposal facilities were not available to NSP-Minnesota.

High-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal —

The
federal government has the responsibility to dispose of, or permanently store,
domestic spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive wastes. The
Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the DOE to implement a program for nuclear
high level waste management. This includes the siting, licensing, construction
and operation of a repository for domestically produced spent nuclear fuel from
civilian nuclear power reactors and other high-level radioactive wastes at a
permanent Federal storage or disposal facility. To date, the DOE has not
accepted any of NSP-Minnesota’s spent nuclear fuel. See Item 3 — Legal
Proceedings and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of this matter.

NSP-Minnesota
has on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel at its Monticello and Prairie Island
nuclear plants. In 1993, the Prairie Island plant was licensed by the federal
NRC to store up to 48 casks of spent fuel at the plant. In 1994, the Minnesota
Legislature adopted a limit on dry cask storage of 17 casks for the entire
state. In 2003, the Minnesota Legislature enacted revised legislation that will
allow NSP-Minnesota to continue to operate the facility and store spent fuel
there until its current licenses with the NRC expire in 2013 and 2014. The
legislation transfers the primary authority concerning future spent-fuel
storage issues from the state Legislature to the MPUC. It also allows for
additional storage without the requirement of an affirmative vote from the
state Legislature, if the NRC extends the licenses of the Prairie Island and
Monticello plants and the MPUC grants a certificate of need for such additional
storage. It is estimated that operation through the end of the current license
will require 12 additional storage casks to be stored at Prairie Island, for a
total of 29 casks. In October 2006, the MPUC authorized an on-site storage
facility and 30 casks at Monticello, which will allow the plant to operate to
2030. There decision becomes effective June 1, 2007, unless the
legislature takes action. As of Dec. 31, 2006, there were 22 casks loaded
and stored at the Prairie Island plant. See Note 15 in the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of the matter.

PFS —

NSP-Minnesota
is part of a consortium of private parties working to establish a private
facility for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. In 1997, PFS filed a
license application with the NRC for a temporary storage site for spent nuclear
fuel on the Skull Valley Indian Reservation in Utah. On Feb. 28, 2006, the
NRC commissioners issued the license for PFS, ending the 8-year effort to
gain a license for the site. The license is contingent on the condition that
PFS must demonstrate that it has adequate funding before construction may begin.
In December 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Utah’s petition for a writ
of certiorari to hear an appeal of a lower court’s ruling on a series of state
statutes aimed at blocking the


storage and transportation of
spent fuel to PFS. Also in December 2005, NSP-Minnesota indicated that it
would hold in abeyance future investments in the construction of PFS as long as
there is apparent and continuing progress in federally sponsored initiatives
for storage, reuse, and/or disposal for the nation’s spent nuclear fuel. In September 2006,
the Department of the Interior issued two findings: (1) that it would not
grant the leases for rail or intermodal sites and (2) that it was revoking
its previous Conditional Approval of the site lease between PFS and the Skull
Valley Indian tribe even though the conditions had been met. The stated reasons
were principally lack of progress at Yucca Mountain and lack of Bureau of
Indian Affairs staff to monitor this activity. Both findings are expected to be
appealed.

Prairie Island Steam Generator Replacement —

Prairie Island

Unit 2 steam generators received
required inspections during a scheduled 2005 outage. Based on current rates of
degradation and available repair processes, NSP-Minnesota plans to replace
these steam generators in the 2013 regular refueling outage. Due to the
potential shortages in the world markets for materials and shop capabilities,
NSP-Minnesota received Xcel Energy board approval in August 2006 to begin
the process for long-lead time materials.

NSP-Minnesota Nuclear Plant Re-licensing —

Monticello’s current 40-year license
expires in 2010, and Prairie Island’s licenses for its two units expire in 2013
and 2014. Monticello’s license renewal was approved by the NRC in November 2006,
and the MPUC issued its approval in October 2006 allowing additional spent
fuel storage. Minnesota statutes provide that the MPUC decision becomes
effective June 1, 2007, which allows the legislature the opportunity to
review the MPUC action if considered appropriate. Prairie Island has initiated
the necessary plant assessments and aging analysis to support submittal of
similar applications to the NRC and the MPUC, currently planned for submittal
in early 2008.

Nuclear Plant Power Uprates —

At
the direction of the MPUC, NSP-Minnesota is pursuing capacity increases of all
three units that will total approximately 250 MW, to be implemented, if
approved, between 2009 and 2015. The life extension and a capacity increase for
Prairie Island Unit 2 is contingent on replacement of Unit 2’s original steam
generators, currently planned for replacement during the refueling outage in
2013. Total capital investment for these activities is estimated to be
approximately $1 billion between 2006 and 2015. NSP-Minnesota plans to seek
approval for an alternative recovery mechanism from customers of its nuclear
costs. NSP-Minnesota plans to submit the certificate of need for the Monticello
uprate in the second quarter of 2007 and the certificate of need for the
Prairie Island uprate in the third quarter of 2007.

NMC —

As of Dec. 31, 2006,
all members of the NMC, other than Xcel Energy, have chosen to sell their units
and exit the NMC. Regarding the remaining members of the NMC, the sales
transaction of the CMS Energy Corp. Palisades Nuclear Power Plant is targeted
to close in the first quarter of 2007. In December 2006, Wisconsin Electric
Power Co., announced its intent to sell
its Point Beach Nuclear Plant to FPL Energy, with the sale expected to
close in the third or fourth quarter of 2007.

Following consummation of these sale transactions, NSP-Minnesota will
be the sole remaining member of the NMC. NSP-Minnesota is evaluating the
situation and is considering various alternatives, including transitioning the
NMC to a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy. To facilitate implementation
of this option, Xcel Energy plans are progressing to restructure the NMC to
support a two-site organization, as well as reabsorb the administrative
functions within Xcel Energy by the end of 2007.

For further discussion of nuclear obligations, see Note 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fuel Sources —

Coal inventory levels may vary widely among
plants. However, the NSP System normally maintains approximately 30 days of
coal inventory at each plant site. Coal supply inventories at Dec. 31,
2006 were approximately 30 days usage, based on the maximum burn rate for all
of NSP-Minnesota’s coal-fired plants. Estimated coal requirements at
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin’s major coal-fired generating plants are
approximately 12.4 million tons per year.

NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have a number of coal transportation
contracts that provide for delivery of approximately 99 percent of 2007 coal
requirements, 99 percent of 2008 coal requirements and 99 percent of 2009 coal
requirements. Coal delivery may be subject to short-term interruptions or
reductions due to transportation problems, weather, and availability of
equipment.

To operate NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear generating
plants, NSP-Minnesota secures contracts for uranium concentrates, uranium
conversion, uranium enrichment and fuel fabrication. The contract strategy
involves a portfolio of spot purchases and medium- and long-term contracts for
uranium, conversion and enrichment with multiple producers and countries to
alleviate the current supply/demand imbalance. Due to less availability in the
world supply market for uranium, conversion and enrichment, NSP-Minnesota is
working toward maintaining a strategic inventory level to decrease its exposure
to supply limitations.

·

Current
nuclear fuel supply contracts cover 100 percent of uranium concentrates requirements
through 2008, approximately 90 percent of the requirements for 2009 and
approximately 32 percent of the requirements for 2010 through 2012 with no
coverage of requirements for 2013 and beyond. Contracts with additional uranium
concentrate suppliers are currently in various stages of negotiations that are
expected to provide a portion of the requirements through 2016.

·

Current
contracts for conversion services cover 100 percent of the requirements through
2009 and approximately 67 percent of the requirements from 2010 through 2012,
with no coverage for 2013 and beyond.

·

Current
enrichment services contracts cover 100 percent of 2007 and 2008, and approximately
96 percent of the 2009 requirements. Approximately 50 percent of the 2010
through 2013 enrichment services requirements are currently covered with no
coverage of requirements for 2014 and beyond. These current contracts expire at
varying times between 2009 and 2013. Contracts with additional enrichment
services suppliers are being investigated for coverage from 2010 and beyond.

·

Fuel
fabrication for Monticello is covered through 2010. Under a new contract
executed in 2006 for fuel fabrication services, Prairie Island’s fuel
fabrication is 100 percent committed for six reloads with an option to extend
for three additional reloads. The six reloads provide for fabrication services
through at least 2013, while adding the optional reloads would provide for
fabrication services to at least 2015.

NSP-Minnesota expects sufficient uranium, conversion and enrichment to
be available for the total fuel requirements of its nuclear generating plants. Contracts
for additional uranium are currently being negotiated that would provide
additional supply requirements through 2016. Some exposure to price volatility
will remain, due to index-based pricing structures on the contracts.

The NSP System uses both firm and interruptible natural gas and standby
oil in combustion turbines and certain boilers. Natural gas supplies for power
plants are procured under short-, intermediate- and long-term contracts at
liquid trading hubs that expire in various years from 2007 through 2027 in
order to provide an adequate supply of fuel. Certain natural gas supply and
transportation agreements include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery
of specified volumes of natural gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery. At
Dec. 31, 2006, NSP-Minnesota’s commitments related to these contracts were
approximately $128 million. The NSP System has limited on-site fuel oil storage
facilities and relies on the spot market for incremental supplies, if needed.


Commodity Marketing Operations

NSP-Minnesota conducts various
wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric
capacity, energy and energy related products. NSP-Minnesota uses physical and
financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge
supplies and purchases. See additional discussion under Item 7A — Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

NSP-Wisconsin

Ratemaking Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of
Jurisdiction

—

Retail rates, services and other
aspects of NSP-Wisconsin’s operations are regulated by the PSCW and the MPSC,
within their respective states. In addition, each of the state commissions
certifies the need for new generating plants and electric transmission lines
before the facilities may be sited and built. NSP-Wisconsin is subject to the
jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to its wholesale electric operations,
accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale and the transmission of
electricity in interstate commerce. NSP-Wisconsin has received authorization
from the FERC to make wholesale electric sales at market-based prices (see
market-based rate authority discussion).

The PSCW has a biennial base-rate filing requirement. By June of
each odd-numbered year, NSP-Wisconsin must submit a rate filing for the test
year beginning the following January.

Fuel and Purchased Energy Cost Recovery
Mechanisms —

NSP-Wisconsin does not
have an automatic electric fuel adjustment clause for Wisconsin retail
customers. Instead, it has a procedure that compares actual monthly and
anticipated annual fuel costs with those costs that were included in the latest
retail electric rates. If the comparison results in a difference of 2 percent
above or below base rates, the PSCW may hold hearings limited to fuel costs and
revise rates upward or downward. In 2006 only, the bandwidth was 2 percent
above and 0.5 percent below base rates. Any revised rates would remain in
effect until the next rate change. The adjustment approved is calculated on an
annual basis, but applied prospectively. NSP-Wisconsin’s wholesale electric
rate schedules provide for adjustments to billings and revenues for changes in
the cost of fuel and purchased energy.

NSP-Wisconsin’s retail electric rate schedules for Michigan customers
include power supply cost recovery factors, which are based on 12-month
projections. After each 12-month period, a reconciliation is submitted
whereby over-collections are refunded and any under-collections are collected
from the customers over the subsequent 12-month period.

Capacity and Demand

NSP-Wisconsin operates an integrated system with NSP-Minnesota. See
discussion of the system capacity and demand under NSP-Minnesota Capacity and
Demand discussed previously.

Energy Sources and Related Initiatives

NSP-Wisconsin operates an integrated system with NSP-Minnesota. See a
discussion of the system energy sources under NSP-Minnesota Energy Sources and

retail adjustment clauses that recover fuel, purchased energy and other
resource costs:

·

ECA —

The ECA, effective Jan. 1,
2004, is an incentive adjustment mechanism that compares actual fuel and
purchased energy expense in a calendar year to a benchmark formula. The ECA
also provides for an $11.25 million cap on any cost sharing over or under an
allowed ECA formula rate. The current ECA mechanism expired Dec. 31, 2006.
Effective Jan. 1, 2007 the ECA has been modified to include an incentive
adjustment to encourage efficient operation of base load coal plants and
encourage cost reductions through purchases of economical short-term energy. The
total incentive payment to PSCo in any calendar year will not exceed $11.25
million. The ECA mechanism will be revised quarterly and interest will accrue
monthly on the average deferred balance. The ECA will expire at the earlier of
rates taking effect after Comanche 3 is placed in service or Dec. 31,
2010.

·

PCCA —

The PCCA, which became
effective June 1, 2004, allows for recovery of purchased capacity payments
to certain power suppliers under specifically identified power purchase
agreements that are not included in the determination of PSCo’s base electric
rates or other recovery mechanisms. Effective Jan. 1, 2007, all prudently
incurred purchased capacity costs will be recovered through the PCCA. The PCCA
will expire at the earlier of rates taking effect after Comanche 3 is placed in
service or Dec. 31, 2010.

·

SCA —

The SCA allows PSCo to recover
the difference between its actual cost of fuel and the amount of these costs
recovered under its base steam service rates. The SCA rate is revised annually
on Jan. 1, as well as on an interim basis to coincide with changes in fuel
costs.

·

AQIR —

The AQIR recovers, over a 15-year
period, the incremental cost (including fuel and purchased energy) incurred by
PSCo as a result of a voluntary plan, effective Jan. 1, 2003, to reduce
emissions and improve air quality in the Denver metro area.

·

DSMCA —

The DSMCA clause permits PSCo
to recover DSM costs beginning Jan. 1, 2006 over eight years while
non-labor incremental expenses and carrying costs associated with deferred DSM
costs are recovered on an annual basis. DSM costs incurred prior to Jan. 1,
2006 are recovered over 5 years. PSCo also has a low-income energy assistance
program. The costs of this energy conservation and weatherization program for
low-income customers are recovered through the DSMCA.

·

Renewable Energy Service Adjustment (RESA)

—

The RESA recovers costs associated with complying with the
provisions of a citizen referred ballot initiative passed in 2004 that
establishes a renewable portfolio standard for PSCo’s electric customers. Currently,
the RESA recovers the incremental costs of compliance with the renewable energy
standard and is set at a level of 0.6 percent of the net costs.

·

Wind Energy Service Adjustment (WESA

)

—

The WESA provides for the recovery of certain costs
associated with the provision of wind energy resources from those customers
subscribed as WindSource renewable energy customers.

PSCo recovers fuel and purchased energy costs from its wholesale
electric customers through a fuel cost adjustment clause accepted for filing by
the FERC.

Performance-Based Regulation and Quality of
Service Requirements —

PSCo currently
operates under an electric and natural gas PBRP. The major components of this
regulatory plan include:

·

an
electric QSP that provides for bill credits to customers if PSCo does not
achieve certain performance targets relating to electric reliability and
customer service through 2010; and

·

a
natural gas QSP that provides for bill credits to customers if PSCo does not
achieve certain performance targets relating to natural gas leak repair time
and customer service through 2010.

PSCo regularly monitors and records as necessary an estimated customer
refund obligation under the PBRP. In April of each year following the
measurement period, PSCo files its proposed rate adjustment under the PBRP. The
CPUC conducts proceedings to review and approve these rate adjustments
annually.


Capacity and Demand

Uninterrupted system peak demand for PSCo’s
electric utility for each of the last three years and the forecast for 2007,
assuming normal weather, are listed below.

System Peak Demand (in MW)




2007 Forecast

PSCo

6,483

6,975

6,757

6,751

The peak demand for PSCo’s system typically occurs in the summer. The 2006
system peak demand for PSCo occurred on July 19, 2006.

Energy Sources and Related Transmission
Initiatives

PSCo expects to meet its system capacity requirements through existing
electric generating stations, purchases from other utilities, independent power
producers and power marketers, new generation facilities, demand-side
management options and phased expansion of existing generation at select power
plants.

Purchased Power

—

PSCo has
contractual arrangements to purchase power from other utilities and
nonregulated energy suppliers. Capacity is the measure of the rate at which a
particular generating source produces electricity. Energy is a measure of the
amount of electricity produced from a particular generating source over a
period of time. Long-term purchase power contracts typically require a periodic
payment to secure the capacity from a particular generating source and a charge
for the associated energy actually purchased from such generating source.

PSCo also makes short-term purchases to replace generation from
company-owned units that are unavailable due to maintenance and unplanned
outages, to comply with minimum availability requirements, to obtain energy at
a lower cost than that which could be produced by other resource options,
including company-owned generation and/or long-term purchase power contracts,
and for various other operating requirements.

PSCo Resource Plan

—

PSCo
estimates it will purchase approximately 39 percent of its total electric
system energy needs for 2007 and generate the remainder with PSCo-owned
resources. Additional capacity has been secured under contract making
additional energy available for purchase, if required. PSCo currently has under
contract or through owned generation, the resources necessary to meet its anticipated
2007 load obligation.

In 2004, PSCo
filed a least-cost resource plan (LCP) with the CPUC. PSCo proposed to meet
future resource needs through a combination of utility built generation, DSM,
and power purchases. The CPUC approved PSCo’s plan to construct a 750 MW
pulverized coal-fired unit at the existing Comanche power station located near
Pueblo, Colo. and install additional emission control equipment on the two
existing Comanche station units. The CPUC also called for PSCo to acquire the
remaining resource needs through an all-source competitive bidding process.

PSCo began
construction of the facility in the fall of 2005, which is planned for
completion in the fall of 2009. Based on CPUC approval, construction costs are
limited for the Comanche 3 project (i.e., the new unit and the emission
controls on existing units 1 and 2). The CPUC also approved a regulatory plan
that authorizes PSCo to increase the equity component of its capital structure
up to 60 percent to offset the debt equivalent value of PSCo’s existing power
purchase contracts and to otherwise improve PSCo’s financial strength. Depending
upon PSCo’s senior unsecured debt rating during the time of PSCo general rate
cases, the approved settlement permits PSCo to include various amounts of
construction work in progress that are associated with the Comanche 3 project
in rate base without an offset for allowance for funds used during
construction.

PSCo has
signed agreements with Intermountain Rural Electric Association (IREA) that
define the respective rights and obligations of PSCo and IREA in the transfer
of capacity ownership in the Comanche 3 unit. PSCo and Holy Cross have agreed
to terms for Holy Cross ownership of a share of Comanche 3 and Holy Cross has
been making its agreed-upon contributions toward construction of the plant.

For the remaining resource needs, PSCo selected bids for approximately
30 MW of DSM resources, approximately 1,300 MW of gas-fired generation
resources and approximately 775 MW of wind generation resources. These bids,
together with Comanche 3, and the additional DSM agreed to in the LCP
settlement agreement, are expected to meet PSCo’s resource needs through 2012.

Renewable Energy Portfolio Standards

—

In November 2004,
an amendment to the Colorado statutes was passed by referendum requiring
implementation of a renewable energy portfolio standard (RES) for electric
service. The law requires


PSCo to generate, or cause to
be generated, a certain level of electricity from eligible renewable resources.
During 2006, the CPUC determined that compliance with the RES should be
measured through the acquisition of renewable energy credits either with or
without the accompanying renewable energy; that the utility purchaser owns the
renewable energy credits associated with existing contracts where the power
purchase agreement is silent on the issue; that Colorado utilities should be
required to file implementation plans and the methods utilities should use for
determining the budget available for renewable resources. In April 2006,
the CPUC issued rules that establish the process utilities are to follow
in implementing the RES. PSCo filed its first annual compliance plan under
these rules on Aug. 31, 2006. The plan demonstrates that PSCo is
expected to meet the RES beginning in 2007 as required.

On Aug. 31, 2006, PSCo filed with the CPUC an application for
approval of its 2007 compliance plan for the RES rules. As a part of its plan,
PSCo requested approval to continue its existing 0.60 percent RES adjustment
rider. Through its existing resources and contracts entered into in 2006, PSCo
anticipates having sufficient non-solar renewable energy resources to meet the
standard through at least 2016. In June 2006, PSCo issued a request for
proposal to provide solar renewable energy credits and expects to enter into
contracts to meet its obligation for on-site solar resources. On Sept. 1, 2006,
PSCo executed a twenty-year solar power purchase agreement, which are expected
to provide about 16,000 MW hours per year and accompanying solar renewable
energy credits beginning in 2008.

RESA

—

On Dec. 1,
2005, PSCo filed with the CPUC to implement a new one percent rider that would
apply to each customer’s total electric bill, providing approximately $22
million in annual revenue. The revenues collected under the RESA will be used
to acquire sufficient solar resources to meet the on-site solar system
requirements in the Colorado statutes. On Feb. 14, 2006, PSCo and the
other parties to the case filed a stipulation agreeing to reduce the RESA rider
to 0.60 percent and to provide monthly reports. The RESA rider was approved by
the CPUC effective March 1, 2006.

Purchased
Transmission Services

—

PSCo has
contractual arrangements with regional transmission service providers to
deliver power and energy to PSCo’s native load customers, which are retail and
wholesale load obligations with terms of more than one year.

Fuel Supply and Costs

The following table shows the delivered cost

Fuel Sources

—

Coal
inventory levels may vary widely among plants. However, PSCo normally maintains
approximately 30 days of coal inventory at each plant site. Coal supply
inventories at Dec. 31, 2006, were approximately 30 days usage, based on
the maximum burn rate for all of PSCo’s coal-fired plants. PSCo’s generation
stations use low-sulfur western coal purchased primarily under long-term
contracts with suppliers operating in Colorado and Wyoming. During 2006, PSCo’s
coal requirements for existing plants were approximately 10 million tons.

PSCo has
contracted for coal suppliers to supply approximately 98 percent of its coal
requirements in 2007, 70 percent of its coal requirements in 2008 and 60
percent of its coal requirements in 2009. Any remaining requirements will be
purchased on the spot market.

PSCo has coal
transportation contracts that provide for delivery for approximately 100
percent of 2007 coal requirements, 100 percent of 2008 coal requirements and 40
percent of 2009 coal requirements. Coal delivery may be subject to short-term
interruptions or reductions due to transportation problems, weather, and
availability of equipment.

PSCo uses both firm and interruptible natural gas and standby oil in
combustion turbines and certain boilers. Natural gas supplies for PSCo’s power
plants are procured under short- and intermediate- term contracts. This natural
gas is transported to the plants on various interstate pipeline systems with
contracts that expire in various years from 2007 through 2025. Certain natural
gas supply and transportation agreements include obligations for the purchase
and/or delivery of specified


volumes of natural gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery. At Dec. 31,
2006, PSCo’s commitments related to these contracts were approximately $328
million.

Commodity Marketing Operations

PSCo conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the
purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy and energy related products. PSCo
uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit
risk and hedge supplies and purchases. See additional discussion under Item 7A —
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

SPS

Ratemaking Principles

Summary of
Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction

—

The PUCT and
NMPRC regulate SPS’ retail operations as an electric utility and have
jurisdiction over its retail rates and services and the construction of
transmission or generation in their respective states. The municipalities in
which SPS operates in Texas have jurisdiction over SPS’ rates in those
communities. The NMPRC also has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities. SPS
is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to its wholesale
electric operations, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale and the
transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. SPS has received
authorization from the FERC to make wholesale electricity sales at market-based
prices, however, as discussed previously, SPS withdrew its market-based rate
authority with respect to sales in its own and affiliated operating company
control areas.

Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation Cost
Recovery Mechanisms

—

Fuel and
purchased energy costs are recovered in Texas through a fixed fuel and
purchased energy recovery factor, which is part of SPS’ retail electric rates. The
Texas retail fuel factors change each November and May based on the
projected cost of natural gas.

If it appears
that SPS will materially over-recover or under-recover these costs, the factor
may be revised upon application by SPS or action by the PUCT. The regulations
require refunding or surcharging over- or under-recovery amounts, including
interest, when they exceed 4 percent of the utility’s annual fuel and purchased
energy costs, if this condition is expected to continue.

PUCT
regulations require periodic examination of SPS fuel and purchased energy
costs, the efficiency of the use of fuel and purchased energy, fuel acquisition
and management policies and purchased energy commitments. SPS is required to
file an application for the PUCT to retrospectively review at least every three
years the operations of SPS’ electric generation and fuel management activities
as it relates to fuel and purchased energy costs.

The NMPRC
regulations provide for a fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause for
SPS’ New Mexico retail jurisdiction. SPS files monthly and annual reports of
its fuel and purchased power costs with the NMPRC. The NMPRC authorized SPS to
implement a monthly adjustment factor.

SPS recovers fuel and purchased energy costs from its wholesale
customers through a wholesale fuel and purchased economic energy cost
adjustment clause (FCAC) accepted for filing by the FERC.

Capacity and Demand

Uninterrupted system peak demand for SPS for
each of the last three years and the forecast for 2007, assuming normal
weather, are listed below.

Energy Sources and Related Transmission
Initiatives

SPS expects to use existing electric generating stations, purchases
from other utilities, independent power producers and power marketers, and
demand-side management options to meet its net dependable system capacity
requirements.


Purchased Power

—

SPS has
contractual arrangements to purchase power from other utilities and
nonregulated energy suppliers. Capacity is the measure of the rate at which a
particular generating source produces electricity. Energy is a measure of the
amount of electricity produced from a particular generating source over a
period of time. Long-term purchase power contracts typically require a periodic
payment to secure the capacity from a particular generating source and a charge
for the associated energy actually purchased from such generating source.

SPS also makes short-term purchases to replace generation from
company-owned units that are unavailable due to maintenance and unplanned
outages, to comply with minimum availability requirements, to obtain energy at
a lower cost than that which could be produced by other resource options,
including company-owned generation and/or long-term purchase power contracts,
and for various other operating requirements.

SPS Resource
Planning

—

In June 2006, NMPRC
initiated a series of workshops for the purpose of drafting rules for
integrated resource planning. In August 2006, workshop participants
completed a consensus rule that was forwarded by the Hearing Examiner on Oct. 3,
2006, to the NMPRC for consideration. The proposed rules would apply to
jurisdictional electric and gas utilities, such as SPS, that operate within the
state. A final rule is expected to be adopted in early 2007.

Purchased Transmission Services

—

SPS has
contractual arrangements with regional transmission service providers to
deliver power and energy to the subsidiaries’ native load customers, which are
retail and wholesale load obligations with terms of more than one year.

All of the transmission arrangements for the SPS system are through
FERC approved Open Access Transmission Tariffs (OATT). SPS also has several
transmission arrangements through the SPP OATT. The SPP is a RTO that, among
other things, administers an OATT for all its members. SPS’ entire service
territory is within the SPP footprint, and SPS is a member of the SPP. The SPP
owns no transmission facilities. Rather, the SPP is responsible for ensuring
that transmission service across facilities owned by others, including SPS, is
made available and used on a reliable and non-discriminatory basis. These OATTs
contain policies and procedures for reliable use of the transmission systems
for transmission, generation and load variations.

SPS purchases
all of its coal requirements for its two coal facilities, Harrington and Tolk
electric generating stations, from TUCO, Inc. in the form of crushed,
ready-to-burn coal delivered to the plant bunkers. TUCO arranges for the
purchase, receiving, transporting, unloading, handling, crushing, weighing, and
delivery of coal to the plant bunkers to meet SPS’ requirements. TUCO is
responsible for negotiating and administering contracts with coal suppliers,
transporters, and handlers. For the Harrington station, the coal supply
contract with TUCO expires in 2016. For the Tolk station, the coal supply
contract with TUCO expires in 2017. At Dec. 31, 2006, coal supplies at the
Harrington and Tolk sites were approximately 37 and 37 days supply,
respectively. TUCO has coal agreements to supply 100 percent of SPS’ coal
requirements in 2007, 2008 and 2009 for the Harrington and Tolk stations. TUCO
has long-term contracts for supply of coal in sufficient quantities to meet the
primary needs of the Harrington and Tolk stations.

SPS uses both firm and interruptible natural gas and standby oil in
combustion turbines and certain boilers. Natural gas suppliers for SPS’ power
plants are procured under short- and intermediate-term contracts to provide an
adequate supply of fuel. These contracts expire in various years from 2007
through 2011. Certain natural gas supply and transportation agreements include
obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of natural
gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery. At Dec. 31, 2006, SPS’
commitments related to these contracts were approximately $30 million.


Commodity Marketing Operations

SPS conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the

NATURAL GAS
UTILITY OPERATIONS

Natural Gas Utility Trends

The most significant recent developments in the natural gas operations
of the utility subsidiaries were the continued volatility in wholesale natural
gas market prices and the continued trend toward declining use per customer by
residential customers as a result of improved building construction
technologies and higher appliance efficiencies. From 1996 to 2006, average
annual sales to the typical residential customer declined from 103 MMBtu per
year to 82 MMBtu per year on a weather-normalized basis. Although recent
wholesale price increases do not directly affect earnings because of natural
gas cost recovery mechanisms, the high prices are expected to encourage further
efficiency efforts by customers.

NSP-Minnesota

Ratemaking Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction

—

Retail rates,
services and other aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s operations are regulated by the
MPUC and the NDPSC within their respective states. The MPUC has regulatory
authority over aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s financial activities, including security
issuances, certain property transfers, mergers with other utilities and
transactions between NSP-Minnesota and its affiliates. In addition, the MPUC
reviews and approves NSP-Minnesota’s natural gas supply plans for meeting
customers’ future energy needs.


Purchased Gas and Conservation Cost Recovery
Mechanisms

—

NSP-Minnesota’s retail natural
gas rates for Minnesota and North Dakota include a PGA clause that provides for
prospective monthly rate adjustments to reflect the forecasted cost of
purchased natural gas. The annual difference between the natural gas costs
collected through PGA rates and the actual natural gas costs are collected or
refunded over the subsequent 12-month period. The MPUC and NDPSC have the
authority to disallow recovery of certain costs if they find the utility was
not prudent in its procurement activities.

NSP-Minnesota is required by Minnesota law to spend a minimum of 0.5
percent of Minnesota natural gas revenue on conservation improvement programs.
These costs are recovered through an annual cost recovery mechanism for natural
gas conservation and energy management program expenditures. NSP-Minnesota is
required to request a new cost recovery level annually.

Capability and Demand

Natural gas
supply requirements are categorized as firm or interruptible (customers with an
alternate energy supply). The maximum daily send-out (firm and interruptible)
for NSP-Minnesota was 601,336 MMBtu for 2006, which occurred on Feb. 17,
2006.

NSP-Minnesota
purchases natural gas from independent suppliers. These purchases are generally
priced based on market indices that reflect current prices. The natural gas is
delivered under natural gas transportation agreements with interstate pipelines.
These agreements provide for firm deliverable pipeline capacity of 526,013
MMBtu/day. In addition, NSP-Minnesota has contracted with providers of
underground natural gas storage services. These storage agreements provide
storage for approximately 30 percent of winter natural gas requirements and 37
percent of peak day, firm requirements of NSP-Minnesota.

NSP-Minnesota
also owns and operates one LNG plant with a storage capacity of 2.13 Bcf
equivalent and three propane-air plants with a storage capacity of 1.4 Bcf
equivalent to help meet its peak requirements. These peak-shaving facilities
have production capacity equivalent to 250,300 MMBtu of natural gas per day, or
approximately 34 percent of peak day firm requirements. LNG and propane-air
plants provide a cost-effective alternative to annual fixed pipeline transportation
charges to meet the peaks caused by firm space heating demand on extremely cold
winter days.

NSP-Minnesota is required to file for a change in natural gas supply
contract levels to meet peak demand, to redistribute demand costs among
classes, or to exchange one form of demand for another. The 2006-2007
entitlement levels are pending MPUC action.

Natural Gas Supply and Costs

NSP-Minnesota
actively seeks natural gas supply, transportation and storage alternatives to
yield a diversified portfolio that provides increased flexibility, decreased
interruption and financial risk, and economical rates. In addition,
NSP-Minnesota conducts natural gas price hedging activity that has been
approved by the MPUC. This diversification involves numerous domestic and Canadian
supply sources with varied contract lengths.

The following table summarizes the average
delivered cost per MMBtu of natural gas purchased for resale by NSP-Minnesota’s
regulated retail natural gas distribution business:


$

8.32


$

8.90


$

6.88

The cost of
natural gas supply, transportation service and storage service is recovered
through the PGA cost recovery mechanism.

NSP-Minnesota
has firm natural gas transportation contracts with several pipelines, which
expire in various years from 2007 through 2027.

NSP-Minnesota
has certain natural gas supply, transportation and storage agreements that
include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of
natural gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery. At Dec. 31, 2006,
NSP-Minnesota was committed to approximately $722 million in such obligations
under these contracts.

NSP-Minnesota
purchases firm natural gas supply utilizing long-term and short-term agreements
from approximately 25 domestic and Canadian suppliers. This diversity of
suppliers and contract lengths allows NSP-Minnesota to maintain competition
from suppliers and minimize supply costs.

Results of Continuing Operations in Management’s Discussion and Analysis under
Item 7.

NSP-Wisconsin

Ratemaking Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of
Jurisdiction

—

NSP-Wisconsin is regulated
by the PSCW and the MPSC.

The PSCW has a
biennial base-rate filing requirement. By June of each odd-numbered year,
NSP-Wisconsin must submit a rate filing for the test year period beginning the
following January. The filing procedure and review generally allow the PSCW
sufficient time to issue an order and implement new base rates effective with
the start of the test year.

Natural Gas Cost Recovery Mechanisms

—

NSP-Wisconsin
has a retail PGA natural gas cost recovery mechanism for Wisconsin operations
to recover changes in the actual cost of natural gas and transportation and
storage services. The PSCW has the authority to disallow certain costs if it
finds the utility was not prudent in its procurement activities.

NSP-Wisconsin’s natural gas rate schedules for Michigan customers
include a natural gas cost recovery factor, which is based on 12-month
projections. After each 12-month period, a reconciliation is submitted
whereby over-collections are refunded and any under-collections are collected
from the customers over the subsequent 12-month period.

Capability and Demand

Natural gas
supply requirements are categorized as firm or interruptible (customers with an
alternate energy supply). The maximum daily send-out (firm and interruptible)
for NSP-Wisconsin was 135,362 MMBtu for 2006, which occurred on Feb. 17,
2006.

NSP-Wisconsin
purchases natural gas from independent suppliers. These purchases are generally
priced based on market indices that reflect current prices. The natural gas is
delivered under natural gas transportation agreements with interstate pipelines.
These agreements provide for firm deliverable pipeline capacity of
approximately 130,887 MMBtu/day. In addition, NSP-Wisconsin has contracted with
providers of underground natural gas storage services. These storage agreements
provide storage for approximately 27 percent of winter natural gas requirements
and 27 percent of peak day, firm requirements of NSP-Wisconsin.

NSP-Wisconsin
also owns and operates one LNG plant with a storage capacity of 270,000 Mcf
equivalent and one propane-air plant with a storage capacity of 2,700 Mcf
equivalent to help meet its peak requirements. These peak-shaving facilities
have production capacity equivalent to 18,408 MMBtu of natural gas per day, or
approximately 14 percent of peak day firm requirements. LNG and propane-air
plants provide a cost-effective alternative to annual fixed pipeline
transportation charges to meet the peaks caused by firm space heating demand on
extremely cold winter days.

NSP-Wisconsin is required to file a natural gas supply plan with the
PSCW annually to change natural gas supply contract levels to meet peak demand.
NSP-Wisconsin’s winter 2006-2007 supply plan was approved by the PSCW in October 2006.

Natural Gas Supply and Costs

NSP-Wisconsin
actively seeks natural gas supply, transportation and storage alternatives to
yield a diversified portfolio that provides increased flexibility, decreased
interruption and financial risk, and economical rates. In addition,
NSP-Wisconsin conducts natural gas price hedging activity that has been
approved by the PSCW. This diversification involves numerous domestic and
Canadian supply sources with varied contract lengths.

delivered cost per MMBtu of natural gas purchased for resale by NSP-Wisconsin’s
regulated retail natural gas distribution business:


$

8.42


$

8.64


$

7.00

The cost of
natural gas supply, transportation service and storage service is recovered
through various cost recovery adjustment mechanisms.

NSP-Wisconsin
has firm natural gas transportation contracts with several pipelines, which
expire in various years from 2007 through 2027.


NSP-Wisconsin
has certain natural gas supply, transportation and storage agreements that
include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of
natural gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery. At Dec. 31, 2006,
NSP-Wisconsin was committed to approximately $127 million in such obligations
under these contracts.

NSP-Wisconsin
purchased firm natural gas supply utilizing short-term agreements from
approximately 25 domestic and Canadian suppliers. This diversity of suppliers
and contract lengths allows NSP-Wisconsin to maintain competition from
suppliers and minimize supply costs.

Results of Continuing Operations in Management’s Discussion and Analysis under
Item 7.

PSCo

Ratemaking Principles

Summary of
Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction

—

PSCo is
regulated by the CPUC with respect to its facilities, rates, accounts, services
and issuance of securities. PSCo holds a FERC certificate that allows it to
transport natural gas in interstate commerce without PSCo becoming subject to
full FERC jurisdiction under the federal Natural Gas Act.

Purchased Gas
and Conservation Cost Recovery Mechanisms

—

PSCo has two retail adjustment
clauses that recover purchased gas and other resource costs:

·

GCA

—

The
GCA mechanism allows PSCo to recover its actual costs of purchased gas,
including costs for upstream pipeline services PSCo incurs to meet the
requirements of its local distribution system customers. The GCA is revised
monthly to allow for changes in gas rates.

·

DSMCA

—

PSCo
has a low-income energy assistance program. The costs of this energy
conservation and weatherization program for low-income customers are recovered
through the gas DSMCA.

Performance-Based
Regulation and Quality of Service Requirements

—

The
CPUC established a combined electric and natural gas quality of service plan. See
further discussion under Item 1, Electric Utility Operations.

Capability and Demand

PSCo projects
peak day natural gas supply requirements for firm sales and backup
transportation, which include transportation customers contracting for firm
supply backup, to be 1,816,362 MMBtu. In addition, firm transportation customers
hold 534,761 MMBtu of capacity for PSCo without supply backup. Total firm
delivery obligation for PSCo is 2,351,123 MMBtu per day. The maximum daily
deliveries for PSCo in 2006 for firm and interruptible services were 1,872,640
MMBtu on Feb. 17, 2006.

PSCo purchases
natural gas from independent suppliers. These purchases are generally priced
based on market indices that reflect current prices. The natural gas is
delivered under natural gas transportation agreements with interstate pipelines.
These agreements provide for firm deliverable pipeline capacity of
approximately 1,618,864 MMBtu/day, which includes 831,866 MMBtu of supplies
held under third-party underground storage agreements. In addition, PSCo
operates three company-owned underground storage facilities, which provide
about 40,000 MMBtu of natural gas supplies on a peak day. The balance of the
quantities required to meet firm peak day sales obligations are primarily
purchased at PSCo’s city gate meter stations and a small amount is received
directly from wellhead sources.

PSCo has
closed the Leyden Storage Field and is in the monitoring phase of the
abandonment process, which is expected to continue until December 2007. See
further discussion under Item 1, Environmental Matters.

PSCo is required by CPUC regulations to file a natural gas purchase
plan by June of each year projecting and describing the quantities of
natural gas supplies, upstream services and the costs of those supplies and
services for the period beginning July 1 through June 30 of the
following year. PSCo is also required to file a natural gas purchase report by October of
each year reporting actual quantities and costs incurred for natural gas
supplies and upstream services for the 12-month period ending the
previous June 30.

Natural Gas Supply and Costs

PSCo actively
seeks natural gas supply, transportation and storage alternatives to yield a
diversified portfolio that provides increased flexibility, decreased
interruption and financial risk, and economical rates. In addition, PSCo
conducts natural gas


price hedging
activities that have been approved by the CPUC. This diversification involves
numerous supply sources with varied contract lengths.

PSCo has
certain natural gas supply, transportation and storage agreements that include
obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of natural
gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery. At Dec. 31, 2006, PSCo was
committed to approximately $1.2 billion in such obligations under these
contracts, which expire in various years from 2007 through 2025.

PSCo purchases
natural gas by optimizing a balance of long-term and short-term natural gas
purchases, firm transportation and natural gas storage contracts. During 2006,
PSCo purchased natural gas from approximately 37 suppliers.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Certain of
Xcel Energy’s subsidiary facilities are regulated by federal and state
environmental agencies. These agencies have jurisdiction over air emissions,
water quality, wastewater discharges, solid wastes and hazardous substances.
Various company activities require registrations, permits, licenses,
inspections and approvals from these agencies. Xcel Energy has received all
necessary authorizations for the construction and continued operation of its
generation, transmission and distribution systems. Company facilities have been
designed and constructed to operate in compliance with applicable environmental
standards.

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries strive to comply with all
environmental regulations applicable to its operations. However, it is not
possible to determine when or to what extent additional facilities or modifications
of existing or planned facilities will


be required as a result of changes to environmental regulations,
interpretations or enforcement policies or, what effect future laws or
regulations may have upon Xcel Energy’s operations. For more information on
environmental contingencies, see Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, environmental matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis under
Item 7 and the matters discussed below.

Leyden Gas
Storage Facility

—

In February 2001, the CPUC approved PSCo’s plan
to abandon the Leyden natural gas storage facility (Leyden) after 40 years of
operation. In July 2001, the CPUC decided that the recovery of all Leyden
costs would be addressed in a future rate proceeding when all costs were known.
In 2003, PSCo began flooding the facility with water, as part of an overall
plan to convert Leyden into a municipal water storage facility owned and
operated by the city of Arvada, Colo. In August 2003, the Colorado Oil and
Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) approved the closure plan, the last formal
regulatory approval necessary before conversion. On Dec. 31, 2005, PSCo’s
leases of the Leyden properties were terminated and the city of Arvada took
custody of the facility. PSCo is obligated to monitor the site for two years
after closure. As of Dec. 31, 2005, PSCo has incurred approximately $5.7
million of costs associated with engineering buffer studies, damage claims paid
to landowners and other initial closure costs. PSCo has accrued an additional
$0.2 million of costs expected to be incurred through 2006 to complete the
decommissioning and closure of the facility. PSCo has deferred these costs as a
regulatory asset. In May 2005, PSCo filed a natural gas rate case with the
CPUC requesting recovery of the Leyden costs totaling $4.8 million to be
amortized over four years. Xcel Energy has reached a settlement agreement with
the parties in the case. The CPUC approved the settlement agreement on Jan. 19,
2006, and the final order became effective on Feb. 3, 2006. In November 2006,
PSCo filed a natural gas rate case with the CPUC requesting recovery of
additional Leyden costs, plus unrecovered amounts previously authorized from
the last rate case, which amounted to $5.9 million to be amortized over four
years. The total amount PSCo is requesting be recovered from customers is $7.7
million.

Item 1A — Risk Factors

Risks Associated with Our Business

Our profitability
depends in part on the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover their
costs from their customers and there may be changes in circumstances or in the
regulatory environment that impair the ability of our utility subsidiaries to
recover costs from their customers.

We are subject
to comprehensive regulation by several federal and state utility regulatory
agencies. The utility commissions in the states where our utility subsidiaries
operate regulate many aspects of our utility operations, including siting and
construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that we can charge
customers.  The FERC has jurisdiction,
among other things, over wholesale rates for electric transmission service and
the sale of electric energy in interstate commerce.


The
profitability of our utility operations is dependent on our ability to recover
costs related to providing energy and utility services to our customers.  Our utility subsidiaries currently provide
service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  These rates are generally regulated based on
an analysis of the utility’s expenses incurred in a test year.  Thus, the rates a utility is allowed to
charge may or may not match its expenses at any given time.  While rate regulation is premised on
providing a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on
invested capital, there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory
commission will judge all the costs of our utility subsidiaries to have been
prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined
will always result in rates that will produce full recovery of such costs.   Rising fuel costs could increase the risk
that our utility subsidiaries will not be able to fully recover their
under-recovered fuel costs from their customers.  Furthermore, there could be changes in the
regulatory environment that would impair the ability of our utility
subsidiaries to recover costs historically collected from their customers.  If all of the costs of our utility subsidiaries
are not recovered through customer rates, they could incur financial operating
losses, which, over the long term, could jeopardize their ability to pay us
dividends and our ability to meet our financial obligations.

We are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from the
future regulatory activities of any of these agencies. Changes in regulations
or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our
results of operations and hence could materially and adversely affect our
ability to meet our financial obligations, including paying dividends on our
common stock.

Any reductions
in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs and the cost of
maintaining certain contractual relationships.

We cannot be assured that any of our current ratings or our
subsidiaries’ ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or
that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if,
in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant.  In addition, our credit ratings may change as
a result of the differing methodologies or change in the methodologies used by
the various rating agencies.  For
example, Standard and Poor’s calculates an imputed debt associated with
capacity payments from purchased power contracts.   An increase in the overall level of capacity
payments would increase the amount of imputed debt, based on Standard and
Poor’s methodology.  Therefore, Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries credit ratings could be adversely affected based on
the level of capacity payments associated with purchased power contracts or
changes in how imputed debt is determined. 
Any downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs.

We are subject
to commodity risks and other risks associated with energy markets.

We engage in
wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity, energy and energy-related
products and are subject to market supply and commodity price risk.  Commodity price changes can affect the value
of our commodity trading derivatives.  We
mark certain derivatives to estimated fair market value on a daily basis
(mark-to-market accounting), which may cause earnings variability. We utilize
quoted market prices to the maximum extent possible in determining the value of
these derivative commodity instruments. 
For positions for which market prices are not available, we utilize
models based on forward price curves. These models incorporate estimates and
assumptions as to a variety of factors such as pricing relationships between
various energy commodities and geographic locations. Actual experience can vary
significantly from these estimates and assumptions and significant changes from
our assumptions could cause significant earnings variability.

If we encounter market supply shortages, we may be unable to fulfill
contractual obligations to our retail, wholesale and other customers at
previously authorized or anticipated costs. 
Any such supply shortages could cause us to seek alternative supply
services at potentially higher costs or suffer increased liability for
unfulfilled contractual obligations.  Any
significantly higher energy or fuel costs relative to corresponding sales
commitments would have a negative impact on our cash flows and could
potentially result in economic losses.

We are subject
to interest rate risk.

If interest rates increase, we may incur increased interest expense on
variable interest debt or short-term borrowings, which could have an adverse
impact on our operating results.

We are subject
to credit risks.

Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or
product will breach their obligations. Should the counterparties to these
arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative
arrangements. In that event, our financial results could be adversely affected
and we could incur losses.


Our
subsidiary, PSCo, has received a notice from the IRS proposing to disallow
certain interest expense deductions that PSCo claimed under a COLI policy.
Should the IRS ultimately prevail on this issue, our liquidity position and
financial results could be materially adversely affected.

PSCo’s wholly
owned subsidiary PSR Investments, Inc. (PSRI) owns and manages permanent life
insurance policies on some of PSCo’s employees, known as COLI. At various
times, borrowings have been made against the cash values of these COLI policies
and deductions taken on the interest expense on these borrowings. The IRS has
challenged the deductibility of such interest expense deductions and has
disallowed the deductions taken in tax years 1993 through 2003.

In April 2004,
Xcel Energy filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Minnesota to establish its right to deduct the
interest expense that had accrued during tax years 1993 and 1994 on policy
loans related to the COLI policies.

After Xcel
Energy filed this suit, the IRS sent two statutory notices of deficiency of
tax, penalty and interest for 1995 through 1999. Xcel Energy has filed U.S. Tax
Court petitions challenging those notices. Xcel Energy anticipates the dispute
relating to its interest expense deductions will be resolved in the refund suit
that is pending in the Minnesota Federal District Court and the Tax Court
petitions will be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the refund
litigation. In the third quarter of 2006, Xcel Energy also received a statutory
notice of deficiency from the IRS for tax years 2000 through 2002 and timely
filed a Tax Court petition challenging the denial of the COLI interest expense
deductions for those years.

On Oct. 12,
2005, the district court denied Xcel Energy’s motion for summary judgment on
the grounds that there were disputed issues of material fact that required a
trial for resolution. At the same time, the district court denied the
government’s motion for summary judgment that was based on its contention that
PSCo had lacked an insurable interest in the lives of the employees insured
under the COLI policies. However, the district court granted Xcel Energy’s
motion for partial summary judgment on the grounds that PSCo did have the
requisite insurable interest.

On May 5,
2006, Xcel Energy filed a second motion for summary judgment. On Aug. 18, 2006,
the U.S. government filed a second motion for summary judgment.  On Feb. 14, 2007, the Magistrate Judge issued
his Report and Recommendation (R&R) to the Judge concerning both motions.
In his R&R the Magistrate Judge recommends both motions be denied due to
fact issues in dispute. Both parties will have an opportunity to file
objections by March 5, 2007 to the Magistrate Judge’s recommendations. The
Judge will then have broad authority to, among other things, accept or reject
the recommendations in whole or in part. 
If both sides’ motions are ultimately denied, a trial is set to begin on
July 24, 2007.

Xcel Energy
believes that the tax deduction for interest expense on the COLI policy loans
is in full compliance with the tax law. Accordingly, PSRI has not recorded any
provision for income tax or related interest or penalties, and has continued to
take deductions for interest expense on policy loans on its income tax returns
for subsequent years. The litigation could require several years to reach final
resolution. Defense of Xcel Energy’s position may require significant cash
outlays, which may or may not be recoverable in a court proceeding. The
ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and could have a material
adverse effect on Xcel Energy’s financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.

Should the IRS ultimately prevail on this issue, tax and interest
payable through Dec. 31, 2006, would reduce earnings by an estimated $421
million. Xcel Energy has received formal notification that the IRS will seek
penalties. If penalties (plus associated interest) also are included, the total
exposure through Dec. 31, 2006, is approximately $499 million. In addition,
Xcel Energy’s annual earnings for 2007 would be reduced by approximately $49
million, after tax, or 11 cents per share, if COLI interest expense deductions
were no longer available.

We are subject
to environmental laws and regulations, compliance with which could be difficult
and costly.

We are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations that
affect many aspects of our past, present and future operations, including air
emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges and the management of wastes
and hazardous substances.  These laws and
regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of
environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other
approvals.  Environmental laws and
regulations can also require us to restrict or limit the output of certain facilities
or the use of certain fuels, to install pollution control equipment at our
facilities, clean up spills and correct environmental hazards and other
contamination.  Both public officials and
private individuals may seek to enforce the applicable environmental laws and
regulations against us.  We must pay all
or a portion of the cost to remediate (i.e. clean-up) sites where our past
activities, or the activities of certain other parties, caused environmental contamination.  At Dec. 31, 2006, these sites included:

·

the
sites of former manufactured gas plants operated by our subsidiaries or
predecessors; and


·

third
party sites, such as landfills, to which we are alleged to be a potentially
responsible party that sent hazardous materials and wastes.

In addition,
existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised, new laws or
regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become
applicable to us and we may incur additional unanticipated obligations or
liabilities under existing environmental laws and regulations.  Revised or additional laws or regulations
which result in increased compliance costs or additional operating
restrictions, or currently unanticipated costs or restrictions under existing
laws or regulations, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from
our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

For further discussion see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Our
subsidiary, NSP-Minnesota, is subject to the risks of nuclear generation.

NSP-Minnesota’s
two nuclear stations, Prairie Island and Monticello, subject it to the risks of
nuclear generation, which include:

·

the
risks associated with storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials
and the current lack of a long-term disposal solution for radioactive
materials;

·

limitations
on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses
that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and

·

uncertainties
with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning
nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.

The NRC has
authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation
of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has
the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its
assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.
Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate
substantial capital expenditures at NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear plants.

If an incident did occur, it could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations or financial condition. Furthermore, the
non-compliance of other nuclear facilities operators with applicable
regulations or the occurrence of a serious nuclear incident at other facilities
could result in increased regulation of the industry as a whole, which could
then increase NSP-Minnesota’s compliance costs and impact the results of
operations of its facilities.

Economic
conditions could negatively impact our business.

Our operations are affected by local and national economic
conditions.  The consequences of a
prolonged recession may include a lower level of economic activity and
uncertainty regarding energy prices and the capital and commodity markets.  A lower level of economic activity might
result in a decline in energy consumption, which may adversely affect our
revenues and future growth.  Instability
in the financial markets, as a result of recession or otherwise, also may
affect the cost of capital and our ability to raise capital.

Our operations
could be impacted by war, acts of terrorism or threats of terrorism.

The conflict
in Iraq and any other military strikes or sustained military campaign may
affect our operations in unpredictable ways and may cause disruptions of fuel
supplies and markets, particularly with respect to natural gas and purchased
energy.  War and the possibility of
further war may have an adverse impact on the economy in general.

Our generation
plants, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities and
information systems may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt
our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products. Any
such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues and
significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets, which could have
a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  The potential for terrorism has subjected our
operations to increased risks and could have a material adverse effect on our
business.  While we have already incurred
increased costs for security and capital expenditures in response to these risks,
we may experience additional capital and operating costs to implement security
for our plants, including our nuclear power plants under the NRC’s design basis
threat requirements, such as additional physical plant security and additional
security personnel.


The insurance industry has also been affected by these events and the
availability of insurance covering risks we and our competitors typically
insure against may decrease.  In
addition, the insurance we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles,
higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.

A disruption
or black-out of the regional electric transmission grid could negatively impact
our business.

Because our generation and transmission systems are part of an
interconnected regional grid, we face the risk of possible loss of business due
to a disruption or black-out caused by an event (severe storm, generator or
transmission facility outage) on a neighboring system or the actions of a
neighboring utility, similar to the Aug. 14, 2003 black-out in portions of the
eastern U.S. and Canada.  Any such
disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant
additional costs to repair assets, which could have a material adverse impact
on our financial condition and results of operations.

Reduced coal
availability could negatively impact our business.

Our coal generation portfolio is heavily dependent on coal supplies
located in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. 
Approximately 85 percent of our annual coal requirement comes from this
area. Coal generation comprises approximately 60 percent to 85 percent of our
annual generation for the operating utilities. 
We have recently experienced disruptions in the delivery of Powder River
Basin coal to our facilities and such disruptions could occur again in the
future.  Coal delivery may be subject to
short-term interruptions or reductions due to various factors, including
transportation problems, weather and availability of equipment.  Failure or delay by our suppliers of coal
deliveries could disrupt our ability to deliver electricity and require us to
incur additional expenses to meet the needs of our customers.  In addition, as agreements expire with our
suppliers, we may not be able to enter into new agreements for coal delivery on
equivalent terms.

Rising energy
prices could negatively impact our business.

Higher fuel costs could significantly impact our results of operations,
if requests for recovery are unsuccessful. 
In addition, the higher fuel costs could reduce customer demand or
increase bad debt expense, which could also have a material impact on our
results of operations.  Delays in the
timing of the collection of fuel cost recoveries as compared with expenditures
for fuel purchases could have an impact on our cash flows.  We are unable to predict the future prices or
the ultimate impact of such prices on our results of operations or cash flows.

Our operating
results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely
affected by milder weather.

Our electric and natural gas utility businesses are seasonal businesses
and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance.
Demand for electricity is often greater in the summer and winter months
associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is heavily used for
residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily
upon weather patterns throughout our service territory, and a significant
amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters
related to the heating season. Accordingly, our operations have historically
generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the
winter and cooler in the summer. Unusually mild winters and summers could have
an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our natural
gas distribution activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents
and other operating risks and costs.

There are
inherent in our natural gas distribution activities a variety of hazards and
operating risks, such as leaks, explosions and mechanical problems that could
cause substantial financial losses.  In
addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to
property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial
losses to us.  In accordance with
customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all,
of these risks and losses.

The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance
could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of
operations.  For our distribution lines
located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business
centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the level of damages
resulting from these risks is greater.

Increase risks
of regulatory penalties

The Energy Act increased FERC’s civil penalty authority for violation
of FERC statutes, rules and orders.  FERC
can now impose penalties of $1 million per violation per day.  Effective June 1, 2007, approximately 80
electric reliability standards that were historically subject to voluntary
compliance will become mandatory and subject to potential civil penalties for


violations.  If a serious
reliability incident did occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our
operations or financial results.

Increasing
costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans and other
employee-related benefits may adversely affect our results of operations,
financial position, or liquidity.

We have defined benefit and postretirement plans that cover
substantially all of our employees. 
Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest
rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding
requirements related to these plans.  These
estimates and assumptions may change based on actual stock market performance,
changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.  In addition, the Pension Protection Act of
2006 changed the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans
beginning in 2008.  Therefore, our
funding requirements may change and our contributions could be required in the
future.

Increasing
costs associated with health care plans may adversely affect our results of
operations, financial position or liquidity.

The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and
retirees have increased substantially in recent years.  We believe that our employee benefit costs,
including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former
employees, will continue to rise.  The
increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our health care plans
may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, or
liquidity.

Risks
Associated with Our Holding Company Structure

We must rely
on cash from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments.

We are a
holding company and thus our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary
assets. Substantially all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries.
Consequently, our operating cash flow and our ability to service our
indebtedness and pay dividends, depends upon the operating cash flow of our
subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends.
Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any
amounts due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that
purpose or for dividends on our common stock, whether by dividends or
otherwise. In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends
on any statutory and/or contractual restrictions that may be applicable to such
subsidiary, which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of equity
ratios, working capital or other assets. 
Our utility subsidiaries are regulated by various state utility
commissions, which generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of
the utility customers are being met.

If our utility subsidiaries were to cease making dividend payments, it
could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and
preferred stock or otherwise meet our financial obligations.

Certain
provisions of law, as well as provisions in our bylaws and shareholder rights
plan, may make it more difficult for others to obtain control of us, even
though some shareholders might consider this favorable.

We are a Minnesota corporation and certain anti-takeover provisions of
Minnesota law apply to us and create various impediments to the acquisition of
control of us or to the consummation of certain business combinations with
us.  In addition, our shareholder rights
plan contains provisions, which may make it more difficult to effect certain
business combinations with us without the approval of our board of directors.  Finally, certain federal and state utility
regulatory statutes may also make it difficult for another party to acquire a
controlling interest in us.  These
provisions of law and of our corporate documents, individually or in the
aggregate, could discourage a future takeover attempt which individual shareholders
might deem to be in their best interests or in which shareholders would receive
a premium for their shares over current prices.

Nuclear Waste Disposal Litigation

—

The federal
government has the responsibility to dispose of domestic spent nuclear fuel and
other high-level radioactive substances. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (the Act)
requires the DOE to implement this disposal program. This includes the siting,
licensing, construction and operation of a permanent repository for
domestically produced spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors
and other high-level radioactive substances. The Act and contracts between the
DOE and domestic utilities obligated the DOE to begin to dispose of these
materials by Jan. 31, 1998. The federal government has designated the site
as Yucca Mountain in Nevada. The nuclear waste disposal program has resulted in
extensive litigation.


On June 8,
1998, NSP-Minnesota filed a complaint in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims
against the United States requesting breach of contract damages, past and as
projected into the future, in excess of $1 billion for the DOE’s failure to
meet the 1998 deadline. NSP-Minnesota has demanded damages consisting of the
added costs of storage of spent nuclear fuel at the Prairie Island and
Monticello nuclear generating plants, costs related to the Private Fuel
Storage, LLC and certain costs relating to the 1994 and 2003 state legislation
relating to the storage of spent nuclear fuel at Prairie Island. On July 31,
2001, the Court granted NSP-Minnesota’s motion for partial summary judgment on
liability. A subsequent court decision determined that the utilities were
precluded from making a claim for future damages, a utility could claim damages
up to some point prior to the trial, and separate claims would have to be made
in the future as damages accumulated. In response to this decision,
NSP-Minnesota filed an amended complaint seeking damages through Dec. 31,
2004.

NSP-Minnesota
currently claims total damages in excess of $100 million through Dec. 31,
2004 (damages after 2004 will be claimed in subsequent proceedings). A trial on
the damages issue commenced on Oct. 24, 2006, and concluded on Dec. 11,
2006. NSP-Minnesota’s initial post-trial brief was filed pursuant to the court’s
scheduling order on Feb. 9, 2007 and additional briefs and reply briefs are
expected to be filed by April 30, 2007. Closing arguments are set for May 31,
2007.

On July 9,
2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a
decision in consolidated cases challenging regulations and decisions on the
federal nuclear waste program. The Court of Appeals rejected challenges by the
state of Nevada and other intervenors with respect to most of the NRC’s
challenged repository licensing regulations, the congressional resolution approving
Yucca Mountain as the site of the permanent repository, and the DOE and
presidential actions leading to the approval of the Yucca Mountain site. The
Court of Appeals vacated the 10,000 year compliance period adopted by EPA
regulations governing spent nuclear fuel disposal at Yucca Mountain and
incorporated in the NRC regulations. Xcel Energy has not ascertained the impact
of the decision on its nuclear operations and storage of spent nuclear fuel;
however, the decision may result in additional delay and uncertainty
around disposal of spent nuclear fuel. In July 2006 the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management indicated that under the “best achievable
repository construction schedule”, Yucca Mountain would be able to begin
accepting spent nuclear fuel in March 2017.

Lamb County Electric Cooperative —

On
July 24, 1995, LCEC petitioned the PUCT for a cease and desist order
against SPS alleging that SPS was unlawfully providing service to oil field
customers in LCEC’s certificated area. On May 23, 2003, the PUCT issued an
order denying LCEC’s petition based on its determination that SPS was granted a
certificate in 1976 to serve the disputed customers. LCEC appealed the decision
to the District Court in Travis County, Texas and on Aug. 12, 2004, the District
Court affirmed the decision of the PUCT. On Sept. 9, 2004, LCEC appealed the
District Court’s decision to the Court of Appeals for the Third Supreme
Judicial District of the state of Texas, which appeal is currently pending. Oral
arguments in the case were heard March 23, 2005. SPS is awaiting the Court
of Appeals decision.

On Oct. 18,
1996, LCEC filed a suit for damages against SPS in the District Court in Lamb
County, Texas, based on the same facts alleged in the petition for a cease and
desist order at the PUCT. This suit has been dormant since it was filed,
awaiting a final determination at the PUCT of the legality of SPS providing
electric service to the disputed customers. The PUCT order of May 23,
2003, found that SPS was legally serving the disputed customers, thus
collaterally determining the issue of liability contrary to LCEC’s position in
the suit. An adverse ruling on the appeal of May 23, 2003 PUCT order could
result in a re-determination of the legality of SPS’ service to the disputed customers.

Manufactured Gas Plant Insurance Coverage
Litigation

—

In October 2003,
NSP-Wisconsin initiated discussions with its insurers regarding the
availability of insurance coverage for costs associated with the remediation of
four former MGP sites located in Ashland, Chippewa Falls, Eau Claire, and
LaCrosse, Wis. In lieu of participating in discussions, on Oct. 28, 2003,
two of NSP-Wisconsin’s insurers, St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co.
and St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co., commenced litigation against NSP-Wisconsin
in Minnesota state district court. On Nov. 12, 2003, NSP-Wisconsin
commenced suit in Wisconsin state circuit court against St. Paul Fire &
Marine Insurance Co. and its other insurers. Subsequently, the Minnesota court
enjoined NSP-Wisconsin from pursuing the Wisconsin litigation. Although the
Wisconsin action has not been dismissed, the January 2007 trial date was
adjourned and has not been rescheduled.

NSP-Wisconsin
has entered into confidential settlements with St. Paul Mercury Insurance
Company, St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company and the Phoenix Insurance
Company (“St. Paul Companies”), Associated Electric & Gas Insurance
Services Limited, Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company, INSCO, Ltd. (on its own
behalf and on behalf of the insurance companies subscribing per Britamco,
Ltd.), Allstate Insurance Company and Compagnie Europeene D’ Assurances
Industrielles S.A. and these insurers have been dismissed from the Minnesota
and Wisconsin actions. These settlements are not expected to have a material
effect on Xcel Energy’s financial results.


NSP-Wisconsin
has reached settlements in principle with Admiral Insurance Company; certain
underwriters at Lloyd’s, London and certain London Market Insurance Companies (“London
Market Insurers”), General Reinsurance Corporation and First State and Twin
City Fire Insurance Companies. These settlements are not expected to have a
material effect on Xcel Energy’s financial results.

On Oct. 6,
2006, the trial court issued a memorandum and order on various summary judgment
motions. The court ruled that Minnesota law on allocation applies and ordered
dismissal, without prejudice, of 15 carriers whose coverage would not be
triggered under such an allocation method. The court denied the insurers’ motions
for summary judgment on the sudden and accidental and absolute pollution
exclusions; late notice; legal expenses and costs; certain specific lost
policies; and miscellaneous coverage issues under several individual policies. The
court granted the motions of Fidelity and Casualty Insurance Company and
Continental Insurance Company related to certain specific lost policies. On
Oct. 13, 2006, the trial court denied NSP-Wisconsin’s request for leave to file
a motion for reconsideration of the court’s allocation decision. The Nov. 6,
2006 trial date was also adjourned to allow for additional discovery and
potential motions in light of the Minnesota Supreme Court’s recent allocation
decision in Wooddale Builders, Inc. v. Maryland Casualty Company, 722 N. W.2d
283 (Minn. 2006). The trial has been set for a four-week period commencing on
July 16, 2007.

The PSCW has
established a deferral process whereby clean-up costs associated with the
remediation of former MGP sites are deferred and, if approved by the PSCW,
recovered from ratepayers. Carrying charges associated with these clean-up
costs are not subject to the deferral process and are not recoverable from
ratepayers. Any insurance proceeds received by NSP-Wisconsin will operate as a
credit to ratepayers, therefore, these lawsuits are not expected to have a
material effect on Xcel Energy’s financial results.

Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) Storage and
Disposal —

In August 2004, Xcel
Energy received notice from the EPA contending SPS violated PCB storage and
disposal regulations with respect to storage of a drained transformer and
related solids. The EPA contended the fine for the alleged violation was
approximately $1.2 million. Xcel Energy contested the fine and submitted a
voluntary disclosure to the EPA. On April 17, 2006, SPS received a notice
of determination from the EPA stating that the voluntary disclosure had been
reviewed and that SPS had met all conditions of the EPA’s audit policy.
Accordingly, the EPA will mitigate 100 percent of the gravity-based penalty for
the disclosed violation, and no economic penalty will be assessed.

Cornerstone Propane Partners, L.P. et al. vs.
e prime, inc. et al. —

On Feb. 2,
2004, a purported class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against e prime and three other
defendants by Cornerstone Propane Partners, L.P., Robert Calle Gracey and
Dominick Viola on behalf of a class who purchased or sold one or more New
York Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures and/or options contracts during
the period from Jan. 1, 2000, to Dec. 31, 2002. The complaint alleges
that defendants manipulated the price of natural gas futures and options and/or
the price of natural gas underlying those contracts in violation of the
Commodities Exchange Act. In February 2004, the plaintiff requested that
this action be consolidated with a similar suit involving Reliant Energy
Services. In February 2004, defendants, including e prime, filed motions
to dismiss. In September 2004, the U.S. District Court denied the motions
to dismiss. On Jan. 25, 2005, plaintiffs filed a motion for
class certification, which defendants opposed. On Sept. 30, 2005, the U.S.
District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On Oct. 17,
2005, defendants filed a petition with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals
challenging the class certification. On Dec. 5, 2005, e prime reached
a tentative settlement with the plaintiffs that received final court approval
in May 2006. The settlement was paid by e prime and it did not have a
material financial impact on Xcel Energy.

Department of Labor Audit

—

In 2001, Xcel
Energy received notice from the U.S. DOL Employee Benefit Security
Administration that it intended to audit the Xcel Energy pension plan. After
multiple on-site meetings and interviews with Xcel Energy personnel, the DOL
indicated on Sept. 18, 2003, that it was prepared to take the position that
Xcel Energy, as plan sponsor and through its delegate, the Pension Trust
Administration Committee, breached its fiduciary duties under ERISA with
respect to certain investments made in limited partnerships and hedge funds in
1997 and 1998. The DOL has offered to conclude the audit if Xcel Energy is
willing to contribute to the plan the full amount of losses from the questioned
investments, or approximately $7 million. On July 19, 2004, Xcel Energy
formally responded with a letter to the DOL that asserted no fiduciary
violations have occurred and extended an offer to meet to discuss the matter
further. In 2005, and again in January 2006, the DOL submitted two
additional requests for information related to the investigation, and Xcel
Energy submitted timely responses to each request.

On June 12,
2006, the DOL issued a letter to the Xcel Energy Pension Trust Administration Committee
indicating that, although there may have been a breach of the Committee’s
fiduciary obligations under ERISA, the DOL will not pursue


any action
against the Committee or the pension plan with respect to these alleged
breaches due, in part, to the steps the Committee has taken in outsourcing
certain investment management and administration functions to third parties.

NewMech vs.
Northern States Power Company —

On May 16,
2006, NewMech served and filed a complaint against NSP-Minnesota, Southern
Minnesota Municipal Power Agency (SMMPA), and Benson Engineering in the
Minnesota State District Court, Sherburne County, alleging entitlement to
payment in the amount of approximately $4.2 million for unpaid costs allegedly
associated with construction work done by NewMech at NSP-Minnesota and SMMPA’s
jointly owned Sherco 3 generating plant in 2005. NewMech had previously served
a mechanic’s lien, and sought, through this action, foreclosure of the lien and
sale of the property. NewMech additionally sought the claimed damages as a
result of an alleged breach of contract by NSP-Minnesota. NSP-Minnesota, SMMPA
and Benson filed answers denying NewMech’s allegations. Additionally,
NSP-Minnesota and SMMPA counterclaimed for damages in excess of $7 million for
breach of contract, delay in contract performance, misrepresentation and
fraudulent inducement to enter into the contract and slander of title. A
confidential settlement of the dispute was reached on Sept. 29, 2006 and it did
not have a material financial impact on Xcel Energy.

Item 7 — Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Segments and Organizational O

verview

Continuing
Operations

Xcel Energy is
a public utility holding company. In 2006, Xcel Energy continuing operations included
the activity of four utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas
customers in 8 states. These utility subsidiaries are NSP-Minnesota;
NSP-Wisconsin; PSCo; and SPS. These utilities serve customers in portions of
Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas
and Wisconsin. Along with WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline, these
companies comprise the continuing regulated utility operations.

Xcel Energy’s nonregulated subsidiary reported in continuing operations
is Eloigne, which invests in rental housing projects that qualify for
low-income housing tax reported credits.

Discontinued
Operations

2006 and Exhibit 99.01 to Xcel Energy’s Form 10-K for the year
ended Dec. 31, 2006.

Management’s Strategic P

lan

Xcel Energy’s
strategy, called Building the Core, is to invest in the core utility businesses
and earn a reasonable return on invested capital. We’re a vertically integrated
utility and intend to stay that way. Investments of approximately $9 billion
are planned over the next five years in our core operations to grow our
business in response to growing customer demand and environmental initiatives. The
need for additional energy supply is expected throughout our service territory.
Many of the states in which we operate are considering renewable portfolio
standards, requiring incremental investment in wind generation and transmission
facitlities. Additionally, we continue to focus on enhancing electric system
reliability including making significant investments in transmission and
distribution systems. These customer driven requirements create investment opportunities
for us.

The strategy
of Building the Core has three phases. The first phase is obtaining legislative
and regulatory support for large investment initiatives prior to making the
investment. To avoid excessive risk for the company, it is critical to reduce
regulatory uncertainty before making large capital investments. We accomplished
this for both the MERP in Minnesota and the Comanche 3 coal plant in Colorado. Transmission
legislation has been passed in Minnesota, allowing that state’s regulatory
commission to approve recovery for transmission investments without filing a
general rate case. In Texas, the legislature authorized annual recovery for
transmission infrastructure improvements. Both legislative initiatives support
necessary new investment in our transmission system.


The second phase is making those investments. In a normal year, we
spend approximately $1 billion on capital projects. In addition to a base level
of capital investment, we expect to have significant investment opportunity. Among
those opportunities are:

·

approximately
$1 billion through 2010 for MERP, a project to convert two aging coal-fired
plants to natural gas plants and to install pollution control equipment at a
third coal plant;

·

approximately
$1 billion through 2010 for Comanche 3, a project to build a coal plant in
Colorado;

·

a
proposed $1 billion through 2015 to extend the lives and increase the output of
our two nuclear plants, Monticello and Prairie Island;

·

a
proposed $900 million investment through 2012 to add capacity and reduce
emissions at our Sherco coal-fired plant;

·

a
planned investment by the CapX 2020 coalition of utilities of $1.3 billion
between 2008 and 2012 to expand the transmission system in the upper Midwest,
of which our share of the investment would be approximately $700 million,
representing the first phase of CapX 2020; and

·

the
potential of building an IGCC plant in Colorado and owning wind generation.

As a result of
these investments, as well as continued investments in our transmission and
distribution system, we expect that our rate base, or the amount on which we
earn a return, will grow annually by more than 5 percent on average.

The third
phase is earning a fair return on utility system investments. To this end, our
regulatory strategy is to receive regulatory approval for rate riders as well
as general rate cases. A rate rider is a mechanism that allows recovery of
certain costs and returns on investments without the costs and delays of filing
a rate case. These riders allow for timely revenue recovery and are good
mechanisms to recover the costs of large projects or other costs that vary over
time. As an example, a rider for MERP went into effect in January 2006,
allowing us to earn a return on the project while the facility is being
constructed.

General rate cases have been filed to increase revenue recovery in most
of the states in which we operate. In 2006, several rate cases were filed as
part of our regulatory strategy. These rate cases, and others planned for 2007,
are some of the building blocks of our earnings growth plan. Following is the
current status of these initiatives:

·

Constructive
decisions were received in the Minnesota electric rate case, Colorado natural
gas rate case and Wisconsin electric and natural gas cases, which increased
revenue in 2006.

·

A
constructive decision was received in the Colorado electric rate case, which
will increase 2007 revenue. (see Factors Affecting Results of Continuing
Operations for the further discussion)

·

An
electric rate case was filed in Texas and gas rate cases in Minnesota, Colorado
and North Dakota were filed. We expect decisions in these cases later this
year, which should increase revenue in 2007 and 2008.

·

Later
this year, we plan to file electric and gas cases in Wisconsin and will
consider filing cases in other states. If successful, these cases should
increase revenue and earnings in 2008.

Our regulatory
strategy is based on filing reasonable rate requests designed to provide
recovery of legitimate expenses and a return on utility investments. We believe
that our commissions will provide reasonable recovery, and it’s important to
note that our financial plans include this assumption. Recent constructive
results, along with past rulings, are evidence of reasonable regulatory treatment
and give us confidence that we are pursuing the right strategy.

With any strategic plan, there are goals and objectives. We feel the
following financial objectives are both realistic and achievable:

·

Annual
earnings-per-share growth rate target of 5 percent to 7 percent;

·

Annual
dividend increases of 2 percent to 4 percent; and

·

Senior
unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range.

Successful execution of our Building the Core strategic plan should
allow us to achieve our financial objectives, which in turn should provide
investors with an attractive total return on a low-risk investment.

Earnings from
continuing operations for 2006 were higher than in 2005. The increase in 2006
earnings was primarily due to stronger base electric utility margin. The higher
margin reflects electric rate increases in various jurisdictions,
weather-adjusted retail electric sales growth and revenue associated with
investments in MERP. In addition, earnings increased due to the recognition of
income tax benefits. Partially offsetting these positive factors were expected
increases in expenses for operations, maintenance and depreciation and lower
short-term wholesale margins.

Earnings from continuing
operations for 2005 were lower than in 2004. The 2005 results had higher
operating margins, which were offset by higher operating and maintenance
expenses, including scheduled nuclear plant outages in 2005, higher employee
benefit costs, higher uncollectible receivable expense and higher depreciation
expense. In addition, tax expense recorded in 2005 was higher than 2004,
primarily attributable to tax benefits recorded in 2004 related to the
successful resolution of various income tax audit issues.

Income from
discontinued operations in 2005 includes the positive impact of a $17 million
tax benefit recorded to reflect the final resolution of Xcel Energy’s divested
interest in NRG. This was partially offset by Seren’s operating losses during
2005.

The loss from discontinued operations in 2004
is largely due to an after-tax impairment charge of $143 million, or 34 cents
per share, related to Seren. In addition, the loss from discontinued operations
in 2004 is attributable in part to an after-tax loss of $13 million, or 3 cents
per share, associated with the disposition of Cheyenne.

Weather

—

Xcel Energy’s
earnings can be significantly affected by weather. Unseasonably hot summers or
cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, but also can increase
expenses. Unseasonably mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales, but
may not reduce expenses. The impact of weather on earnings is based on the
number of customers, temperature variances and the amount of natural gas or
electricity the average customer historically uses per degree of temperature.

The following summarizes the estimated impact on the earnings of the
utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy due to temperature variations from
historical averages:

·

Weather
in 2006 increased earnings by an estimated 2 cents per share;

·

Weather
in 2005 increased earnings by an estimated 3 cents per share; and

·

Weather in 2004 decreased
earnings by an estimated 8 cents per share.

Statement of
Operations Analysis — Continuing Operations

The following discussion summarizes the items that affected the
individual revenue and expense items reported in the Consolidated Statements of
Income.

Electric Utility,
Short-Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margins

Electric fuel
and purchased power expenses tend to vary with changing retail and wholesale
sales requirements and unit cost changes in fuel and purchased power. Due to
fuel and purchased energy cost-recovery mechanisms for customers in most
states, the fluctuations in these costs do not materially affect electric
utility margin.

Xcel Energy
has two distinct forms of wholesale sales: short-term wholesale and commodity
trading. Short-term wholesale refers to energy-related purchase and sales
activity, and the use of financial instruments associated with the fuel
required for, and energy produced from, Xcel Energy’s generation assets or the
energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Commodity trading is not
associated with Xcel Energy’s generation assets or the energy and capacity
purchased to serve native load. Short-term wholesale and commodity trading
activities are considered part of the electric utility segment.


Short-term
wholesale and commodity trading margins reflect the estimated impact of
regulatory sharing of margins, if applicable. Commodity trading revenues are
reported net of related costs (i.e., on a margin basis) in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Commodity trading costs include purchased power,
transmission, broker fees and other related costs.

margin for base electric utility, short-term wholesale and commodity trading

Base electric
utility margins, which are primarily derived from retail customer sales,
increased due to rate increases in Minnesota and Wisconsin, weather-normalized
retail sales growth, the implementation of the MERP rider, and higher firm
wholesale margins. Partially offsetting the increase, is a transmission fee
classification change from other operating and maintenance expenses-utility in
2005 to electric utility margin in 2006, which did not impact operating income
or net income. The change resulted from an analysis conducted in conjunction
with the expiration and renegotiation of certain transmission agreements,
resulting in better alignment of reporting such costs consistent with MISO
classification. In addition, the ECA incentive earned in Colorado in 2006
resulted in a loss, as compared to a gain in 2005.

and purchased energy costs not recovered through direct pass-through recovery
mechanisms.

Short-Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margin

2006 Comparison to 2005 —

As
expected, short-term wholesale and commodity trading margins declined by $43
million for 2006 compared with 2005, due to retail sales growth, which reduced
surplus generation available for sale in the wholesale market, reductions in
the availability of the coal-fired King plant due to the MERP project,
decreased opportunities to sell due to the MISO centralized dispatch market,
and the Minnesota rate case settlement agreement to refund to customers the
majority of short-term wholesale margins attributable to Minnesota jurisdiction
customers starting in 2006.

Comparison to 2004 —

Short-term
wholesale and commodity trading margins decreased $25 million for 2005 compared
with 2004. The higher 2004 results reflect the impact of more favorable market
conditions and higher levels of surplus generation available to sell. In
addition, a preexisting contract contributed $17 million of margin in the first
quarter of 2004 and expired at that time.

Natural Gas Utility Revenue and Margins

The following table details the changes in
natural gas utility revenue and margin. The cost of natural gas tends to vary
with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of wholesale natural gas
purchases. However, due to purchased natural gas cost-recovery mechanisms for
sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the wholesale cost of natural gas
have little effect on natural gas margin. See further discussion under Factors
Affecting Results of Continuing Operations.

2006 Comparison to 2005 —

Natural
gas revenue decreased primarily due to lower natural gas costs in 2006, which
are recovered from customers. Retail natural gas weather-normalized sales
declined when compared to 2005, largely due to declining use per customer.

2005 Comparison to 2004 —

Natural
gas revenue increased primarily due to higher natural gas costs in 2005, which
are recovered from customers. Retail natural gas weather-normalized sales were
flat when compared to 2004, largely due to the rising cost of natural gas and
its impact on customer usage.

2006 Comparison to 2005

—

Natural
gas margins increased in 2006 due to rate increases in Colorado, Wisconsin and
Minnesota. Base rate changes include a full year of new rates for Minnesota in
2006 as compared to two months of increase in 2005.

Comparison to 2004

—

Natural
gas margin increased in 2005 due to rate changes in Minnesota and North Dakota,
and higher transportation margins, partially offset by the impact of warmer
winter temperatures in 2005 compared with 2004.

2005 Comparison to 2004

—

Other
utility operating and maintenance expenses for 2005 increased by approximately
$87 million, or 5.5 percent, compared with 2004. An outage at the
Monticello nuclear plant and higher outage costs at Prairie Island in 2005
increased costs by approximately $26 million. Employee benefit costs were
higher in 2005, primarily due to increased pension benefits and long-term
disability costs. Also contributing to the increase was higher uncollectible
receivable costs, attributable in part, to modifications to the bankruptcy
laws, higher fuel prices and certain changes in the credit and collection
process.

Other Nonregulated Operating and Maintenance
Expenses —

Other nonregulated
operating and maintenance expenses decreased $16 million, or 35.4 percent, in
2005 compared with 2004, primarily due to the accrual of $18 million in 2004
for a settlement agreement related to shareholder lawsuits.

Depreciation and Amortization —

Depreciation
and amortization expense

increased by
approximately $55 million, or 7.1 percent, for 2006 compared with 2005.

Decommissioning
accruals increased $20 million in 2006. Normal plant additions accounted for
the remaining increase in depreciation expense for 2006 over 2005

.

Depreciation
and amortization expense for 2005 increased by approximately $61 million, or
8.7 percent, compared with 2004. The changes were primarily due to the
installation of new steam generators at Unit 1 of the Prairie Island nuclear
plant and software system additions, both of which have relatively short
depreciable lives compared with other capital additions. The Prairie Island
steam generators are being depreciated over the remaining life of the plant
operating license, which expires in 2013. In addition, the Minnesota Renewable
Development Fund and renewable cost-recovery amortization, which is recovered
in revenue as a non-fuel rider and does not have an impact on net income,
increased over 2004. The increase was partially offset by the changes in useful
lives and net salvage rates approved by the MPUC in August 2005.

AFDC

—

AFDC increased in total by
approximately $14 million for 2006 when compared to 2005. The increase was due
primarily to large capital projects beginning in 2005 and 2006, including MERP
and Comanche 3, with long construction periods. The increase was partially
offset by the current recovery from customers of the financing costs related to
MERP through a MERP rider resulting in a lower recognition of AFDC.

AFDC decreased
by approximately $15 million in 2005, compared with 2004, due to generally
lower AFDC rates and construction work in progress balances.

Interest and Other Income (Expense) Net —

Interest
and other income (expense) net increased $3 million in 2006 compared to 2005. The
increase is due primarily to higher interest income on temporary cash
investments, and the deferred fuel assets in Texas.

Interest and
other income (expense) net decreased $8 million in 2005 compared with 2004. The
decrease is due to interest income related to the finalization of prior-period
IRS audits of $11 million in 2004, partially offset by a $2 million gain on the
sale of water rights in 2005.

Interest and Financing Costs —

Interest charges increased by approximately
$24 million, or 5.1 percent, for 2006 compared with 2005. The increase
is due to higher levels of both short-term and long-term debt and higher
short-term interest rates.

The

2005 interest charges and
financing costs increased approximately $8 million, or 1.9 percent, when
compared with 2004, primarily due to increased short term borrowing levels.

Income Tax Expense —

Income
taxes for continuing operations increased by $8 million for 2006, compared with
2005. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 24.2 percent for
2006, compared with 25.8 percent for 2005. The increase in income tax expense
was primarily due to an increase in pretax income, partially offset by $30
million of tax benefits from the reversal of a regulatory reserve and realized
capital loss carryforwards. Without these tax benefits the effective tax rate
for 2006 would have been 28.2 percent.

The effective
income tax rate for continuing operations was 25.8 percent for 2005, compared
with 23.7 percent in 2004. Income taxes recorded in 2005 reflect tax benefits
of $10 million, primarily from increased research credits and a net operating
loss carry back. Excluding the tax benefits, the effective rate for 2005 would
have been 27.3 percent.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financing Costs and Preferred Dividends —

Holding company and other results include

which are incurred at the Xcel Energy and intermediate holding company levels,
and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries.

The earnings-per-share impact of financing costs and preferred
dividends for 2006, 2005 and 2004 included above reflects dilutive securities,
as discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The
impact of the dilutive securities, if converted, is a reduction of interest
expense resulting in an increase in net income of approximately $15 million in
2006; $14 million in 2005; and $15 million in 2004.

Regulated Utility Results — Discontinued
Operations

In January 2004, Xcel Energy agreed to sell Cheyenne. Consequently,
Xcel Energy reported Cheyenne results as a component of discontinued operations
for all periods presented. The sale was completed in January 2005 and resulted
in an after-tax loss of approximately $13 million, or 3 cents per share, which
was accrued in December 2004. In 2006, the Cheyenne basis study was
updated resulting in the recognition of $2.3 million in tax benefits. This plus
other Cheyenne related tax benefits totaled $3.3 million or 1 cent per share.

Other and Nonregulated Results — Discontinued
Operations

In April 2005,
Zachry Group, Inc. (Zachry) acquired all of the outstanding shares of UE,
a nonregulated subsidiary. The majority of Quixx Corp., including Borger Energy
Associates and Quixx Power Services, Inc., was sold in October 2006
to affiliates of Energy Investors Funds.

In November 2005,
Xcel Energy sold Seren’s California assets to WaveDivision Holdings, LLC. In January 2006,
Xcel Energy sold Seren’s

Minnesota assets to Charter Communications.

During 2004,
Xcel Energy completed the sales of the Argentina subsidiaries of Xcel Energy
International and e prime ceased conducting business.

2005 Nonregulated Results Compared with 2004 —

Results of discontinued nonregulated
operations in 2005 include the impact of a $5 million reduction to the original
asset impairment for Seren and the
positive impact of a $17 million tax benefit recorded to reflect the final
resolution of Xcel Energy’s divested interest in NRG. In 2004, the NRG
tax basis study was updated and previously recognized tax benefits were reduced
by $13 million.

Tax Benefits Related to Investment in NRG —

Xcel Energy has recognized tax benefits
related to the divestiture of NRG of approximately $1.1 billion. Since these
tax benefits are related to Xcel Energy’s investment in discontinued NRG
operations, they are reported as discontinued operations.

Based on current forecasts of taxable income and tax liabilities, Xcel
Energy expects to realize approximately $1.1 billion of cash savings from these
tax benefits through a refund of taxes paid in prior years and reduced taxes
payable in future years. Xcel Energy used $404 million of these tax benefits
through 2005, an additional $223 million in 2006, and expects to use
approximately $123 million in 2007. The remainder of the tax benefit carry
forward is expected to be used over subsequent years.

Factors Affecting Results of Continuing
Operations

Xcel Energy’s utility revenues depend on customer usage, which varies
with weather conditions, general business conditions and the cost of energy
services. Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and
natural gas service within their respective jurisdictions and affect Xcel
Energy’s ability to recover its costs from customers. The historical and future
trends of Xcel Energy’s operating results have been, and are expected to be,
affected by a number of factors, including the following:

General Economic
Conditions

Economic conditions may have a material impact on Xcel Energy’s
operating results. Management cannot predict the impact of a future economic
slowdown, fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of
war. However, Xcel Energy could experience a material adverse impact to its
results of operations, future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from
a general slowdown in future economic growth or a significant increase in
interest rates.

Sales Growth

In addition to the impact of weather, customer sales levels in Xcel
Energy’s utility businesses can vary with economic conditions, energy prices,
customer usage patterns and other factors. Weather-normalized sales growth for
retail electric utility customers was 1.8 percent in 2006, and 1.4 percent in
2005. Weather-normalized sales growth for firm natural gas utility customers
was approximately (2.8) percent in 2006, and 0.2 percent in 2005. Weather-normalized
sales for 2007 are projected to grow between 1.7 percent and 2.2 percent for
retail electric utility customers and a sales decline of 1.0 percent to 2.0
percent for retail natural gas utility customers.


Fuel Supply and Costs

Coal

Deliverability

—

Xcel Energy’s operating utilities
have varying dependence on coal-fired generation. Coal-fired generation
comprises between 60 percent and 85 percent of the total annual generation.
Approximately 85 percent of the annual coal requirements are supplied from the
Powder River Basin in Wyoming.

Delivery of
coal was hampered during early 2006 due to disruptions caused by train
derailments and continuing operational problems that started during the summer
of 2005 along a key rail line in Wyoming. Coal conservation was necessary at
several plants during this time that included increased purchased power and
increasing the use of natural gas for electric generation.

However, coal inventory improved significantly during the latter part
of 2006, due in large part to rail transportation improvements. In addition,
Xcel Energy acquired higher capacity railcars that facilitated inventory
rebuilding. For 2007, inventory sustainability will be a critical goal,
however, no mitigation efforts are expected.

Pension Plan Costs and Assumptions

Xcel Energy’s
pension costs are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of
key assumptions, most notably the annual return level that pension investment
assets will earn in the future and the interest rate used to discount future
pension benefit payments to a present value obligation for financial reporting.
In addition, the actuarial calculation uses an asset-smoothing methodology to
reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. Note 9 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the rate of return and discount
rate used in the calculation of pension costs and obligations in the
accompanying financial statements.

Pension costs
have been increasing in recent years, but are expected to decrease over the
next several years, due to higher-than-expected investment returns experienced
in recent years, as well as, voluntary company contributions. While investment
returns exceeded the assumed level of 8.75 percent in 2006 and 2005 and 9.0
percent in 2004, investment returns in 2003 and 2002 were below the assumed
level of 9.25 and 9.5 percent respectively, and discount rates have declined to
5.75 percent used in 2006. Xcel Energy continually reviews its pension assumptions
and, in 2007, expects to maintain the investment return assumption at 8.75
percent and to increase the discount rate assumption to 6.00 percent.

The investment
gains or losses resulting from the difference between the expected pension
returns assumed on asset levels and actual returns earned are deferred in the
year the difference arises and recognized over the subsequent five-year period.
This gain or loss recognition occurs by using a five-year, moving-average value
of pension assets to measure expected asset returns in the cost-determination
process, and by amortizing deferred investment gains or losses over the
subsequent five-year period. Based on current assumptions and the recognition
of past investment gains and losses over the next five years, Xcel Energy
currently projects that the pension costs recognized for financial reporting
purposes in continuing operations will decrease from an expense, of $15.3
million in 2006 to an expense of $11.8 million in 2007 and $6.3 million in
2008.

Xcel Energy
bases its discount rate assumption on benchmark interest rates from Moody’s. At
Dec. 31, 2006, the annualized Moody’s Baa index rate was 6.35 percent, and
the Aaa index rate was 5.46 percent. Accordingly, Xcel Energy increased the
discount rate to 6.00 percent as of Dec. 31, 2006. This rate was used to
value the actuarial benefit obligations at that date, and will be used in 2007
pension cost determinations. At Dec. 31, 2005, the annualized Moody’s Baa
index rate was 6.21 percent and the Aaa index rate was 5.26 percent. The
corresponding pension discount rate was 5.75 percent.

If Xcel Energy were to use alternative assumptions for pension cost
determinations, a 1-percent change would result in the following impact on the
estimated pension costs recognized by Xcel Energy:

·

A
100 basis point higher rate of return, 9.75 percent, would decrease 2007
recognized pension costs by $20.2 million;

·

A
100 basis point lower rate of return, 7.75 percent, would increase 2007
recognized pension costs by $20.2 million;

·

A
100 basis point higher discount rate, 7.00 percent, would decrease 2007
recognized pension costs by $4.6 million; and

·

A
100 basis point lower discount rate, 5.00 percent, would increase 2007
recognized pension costs by $5.5 million.

The Pension Protection Act changed the minimum funding requirements for
defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008. Xcel Energy projects that no
cash funding would be required for 2007 or 2008. However, the Company expects
to make voluntary contributions in 2007 to maintain a level of funded status
that allows for future funding flexibility and reduces cash flow volatility
under the Pension Protection Act. These expected contributions are summarized
in Note 9 to


the Consolidated Financial Statements. These amounts are estimates and
may change based on actual market performance, changes in interest rates and
any changes in governmental regulations. Therefore, additional contributions
could be required in the future.

Regulation

PUHCA 2005 —

The Energy Act significantly
changed many federal statutes and repealed the PUHCA as of Feb. 8, 2006. However,
the FERC was given authority to review the books and records of holding
companies and their nonutility subsidiaries, authority to review service
company accounting and cost allocations, and more authority over the merger and
acquisition of public utilities. State commissions have similar authority to
review the books and records of holding companies and their nonutility
subsidiaries.

The Energy Act
is also expected to have substantial long-term effects on energy markets,
energy investment and regulation of public utilities and holding company
systems by the FERC and the DOE. The FERC and the DOE are in various stages of
rulemaking in implementing the Energy Act.

Customer Rate Regulation —

The FERC and various state regulatory
commissions regulate Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries. Decisions by these
regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energy’s results of operations. Xcel
Energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing energy
market and general economic conditions.

The electric
and natural gas rates charged to customers of Xcel Energy’s utility
subsidiaries are approved by the FERC and the regulatory commissions in the
states in which they operate. The rates are generally designed to recover plant
investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. Xcel Energy
requests changes in rates for utility services through filings with the
governing commissions. Because comprehensive general rate changes are requested
infrequently in some states, changes in operating costs can affect Xcel Energy’s
financial results. In addition to changes in operating costs, other factors
affecting rate filings are new investments, sales growth, conservation and
demand-side management efforts, and the cost of capital. In addition, the
return on equity authorized is set by regulatory commissions in rate
proceedings. The most recently authorized electric utility returns are 10.54
percent for NSP-Minnesota; 11.0 percent for NSP-Wisconsin; 10.5 percent for
PSCo; and 11.5 percent for SPS. The most recently authorized natural gas
utility returns are 10.4 percent for NSP-Minnesota, 11.0 percent for
NSP-Wisconsin and 10.5 percent for PSCo.

Wholesale Energy Market Regulation —

In April 2005,
a Day 2 wholesale energy market operated by MISO was implemented to centrally
dispatch all regional electric generation and apply a regional transmission
congestion management system. MISO now centrally issues bills and payments for
many costs formerly incurred directly by NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin. NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin expect to recover MISO charges through either base rates or
various recovery mechanisms. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion.

Capital Expenditure Regulation —

Xcel
Energy’s utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions
to build and upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the reliability of
the energy transmission and distribution systems. In addition to filing for
increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated
with such investments, the CPUC and MPUC approved proposals to recover, through
a rate rider, costs to upgrade generation plants, lower emissions and increased
transmission. These rate riders are expected to provide significant cash flows
to enable recovery of costs incurred on a timely basis.

Future Cost Recovery —

Regulated public
utilities are allowed to record as regulatory assets certain costs that are
expected to be recovered from customers in future periods, and to record as
regulatory liabilities certain income items that are expected to be refunded to
customers in future periods. In contrast, other companies would expense these
costs and recognize the income in the current period. If restructuring or other
changes in the regulatory environment occur, Xcel Energy may no longer be
eligible to apply this accounting treatment, and may be required to eliminate
such regulatory assets and liabilities from its balance sheet. This could have
a material effect on Xcel Energy’s results of operations in the period the
write-off is recorded.

At Dec. 31, 2006, Xcel Energy reported on its balance sheet
regulatory assets of approximately $1.2 billion and regulatory liabilities of
approximately $1.4 billion that would be recognized in the statement of
operations in the absence of regulation. In addition to a potential write-off
of regulatory assets and liabilities, restructuring and competition may require
recognition of certain stranded costs not recoverable under market pricing. See
Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion
of regulatory deferrals.


Tax Matters

Interest

Expense
Deductibility —

In April 2004, Xcel Energy
filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Minnesota to establish its right to deduct the interest expense
that had accrued during tax years 1993 and 1994 on policy loans related to the
COLI policies.

After Xcel
Energy filed this suit, the IRS sent two statutory notices of deficiency of
tax, penalty and interest for 1995 through 1999. Xcel Energy has filed U.S. Tax
Court petitions challenging those notices. Xcel Energy anticipates the dispute
relating to its interest expense deductions will be resolved in the refund suit
that is pending in the Minnesota Federal District Court and the Tax Court
petitions will be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the refund
litigation. In the third quarter of 2006, Xcel Energy also received a statutory
notice of deficiency from the IRS for tax years 2000 through 2002 and timely
filed a Tax Court petition challenging the denial of the COLI interest expense
deductions for those years.

On Oct. 12,
2005, the district court denied Xcel Energy’s motion for summary judgment on
the grounds that there were disputed issues of material fact that required a
trial for resolution. At the same time, the district court denied the
government’s motion for summary judgment that was based on its contention that
PSCo had lacked an insurable interest in the lives of the employees insured
under the COLI policies. However, the district court granted Xcel Energy’s
motion for partial summary judgment on the grounds that PSCo did have the
requisite insurable interest.

On May 5,
2006, Xcel Energy filed a second motion for summary judgment. On Aug. 18,
2006, the U.S. government filed a second motion for summary judgment. On Feb. 14,
2007, the Magistrate Judge issued his Report and Recommendation (R&R) to
the Judge concerning both motions. In his R&R the Magistrate Judge
recommends both motions be denied due to fact issues in dispute. Both parties
will have an opportunity to file objections by March 5, 2007 to the
Magistrate Judge’s recommendations. The Judge will then have broad authority
to, among other things, accept or reject the recommendations in whole or in
part. If both sides’ motions are ultimately denied, a trial is set to begin on July 24,
2007.

Xcel Energy
believes that the tax deduction for interest expense on the COLI policy loans
is in full compliance with the tax law. Accordingly, PSRI has not recorded any
provision for income tax or related interest or penalties, and has continued to
take deductions for interest expense on policy loans on its income tax returns
for subsequent years. The litigation could require several years to reach final
resolution. Defense of Xcel Energy’s position may require significant cash
outlays, which may or may not be recoverable in a court proceeding. The
ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and could have a material
adverse effect on Xcel Energy’s financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.

Should the IRS
ultimately prevail on this issue, tax and interest payable through Dec. 31,
2006, would reduce earnings by an estimated $421 million. Xcel Energy has
received formal notification that the IRS will seek penalties. If penalties
(plus associated interest) also are included, the total exposure through Dec. 31,
2006, is approximately $499 million. In addition, Xcel Energy’s annual earnings
for 2007 would be reduced by approximately $49 million, after tax, or 11 cents
per share, if COLI interest expense deductions were no longer available.

COLI Dow Chemical Court Decision

—

On Jan. 23, 2006, the 6

th

Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals issued an
opinion in a federal income tax case involving the interest deductions for a
COLI program at Dow Chemical Company. The 6th Circuit denied the tax deductions
and reversed the decision of the trial court in the case.

Xcel Energy has analyzed the impact of the Dow decision on its pending
COLI litigation and concluded there are significant factual differences between
its case and the Dow case. The court’s opinion in the Dow case outlined three
indicators of potential economic benefits to be examined in a COLI case and
noted that the outcome of COLI cases is very fact determinative.

These indicators are:

·

Positive pre-deduction cash flows;

·

Mortality gains; and

·

The buildup of cash values.

In a split decision, the 6th Circuit found
that the Dow COLI plans possessed none of these indicators of economic
substance. However, in Xcel Energy’s COLI case, the plans were projected to
have sizeable pre-deduction cash flows, based upon the relevant assumptions
when purchased. Moreover, the plans presented the opportunity for mortality
gains that were not eliminated either retroactively or prospectively. Xcel
Energy’s COLI plans had no provision for giving back any mortality gains that
it might realize. In addition, Xcel Energy’s plans had large cash value
increases that were not encumbered by loans during the first seven years of the
policies. Consequently,

Xcel Energy believes that the facts and
circumstances of its case are stronger than Dow’s case and

continues to believe its case has strong
merits.


Environmental Matters

Environmental
costs include payments for nuclear plant decommissioning, storage and ultimate
disposal of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and waste,
remediation of contaminated sites and monitoring of discharges to the
environment. A trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly
stringent regulation has caused, and may continue to cause, higher operating
expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance.

In addition to nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal
expenses, costs charged to operating expenses for environmental monitoring and
disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately:

·

$152
million in 2006;

·

$147
million in 2005; and

·

$133
million in 2004.

Xcel Energy
expects to expense an average of approximately $176 million per year from 2007
through 2011 for similar costs. However, the precise timing and amount of
environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of
hazardous materials, are currently unknown. Additionally, the extent to which
environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates is not
certain.

Capital expenditures for environmental improvements at regulated
facilities were approximately:

·

$571.2
million in 2006;

·

$327.7
million in 2005; and

·

$57.6
million in 2004.

Xcel Energy
expects to incur approximately $323 million in capital expenditures for
compliance with environmental regulations and environmental improvements in
2007, and approximately $575 million of related expenditures from 2008 through
2011. Included in these amounts are expenditures to reduce emissions of
generating plants in Minnesota and Colorado. Approximately $213 million and
$232 million of these expenditures, respectively, are related to modifications
to reduce the emissions of NSP-Minnesota’s generating plants pursuant to the
MERP. Expected expenditures related to environmental modifications on Comanche
Units 1 and 2 are approximately $41 million in 2007 and $26 million from 2008
through 2011. The remaining expected capital expenditures relate to various
other environmental projects. In addition, NSP-Minnesota has proposed a $905
million upgrade at the Sherburne County (Sherco) coal-fired power plant. The
project will increase capacity and reduce emissions. The MPUC is expected to rule on
the project in 2008. If approved, construction would start in late 2008 and be
completed in 2012. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion of Xcel Energy’s environmental contingencies.

The EPA’s CAIR
impacts Xcel Energy generating facilities in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Texas.
The MPCA and WDNR are working on drafting rules that will require more
stringent emission reductions than required by the federal program in Minnesota
and Wisconsin. Currently, there is litigation concerning whether the EPA should
reconsider the inclusion of West Texas in CAIR. The outcome of this litigation
will impact compliance options for the Texas generating facilities.

States throughout
the Xcel Energy territory are implementing the federal mercury rule in
various ways. In Minnesota mercury emissions from A.S. King and Sherburne
County generating facilities will be regulated by the Minnesota Mercury
Legislation, while the remaining Minnesota generating facilities will be
regulated by the CAMR. In Colorado the Air Pollution Control Commission
recently passed a mercury emissions rule. Texas implemented the EPA’s CAMR.

The EPA
requires states to develop implementation plans to comply with the
BART/Regional amendments by December 2007. The MPCA has not responded to
NSP-Minnesota’s BART alternatives analysis submittal. In response to the BART
regulations promulgated by the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission, PSCo
submitted its BART alternatives analysis. PSCo is discussing its BART
alternatives analysis with the CAPCD. The TCEQ has determined that compliance
with CAIR is a substitute for BART for NO

x

and SO


.

In January NSP-Minnesota
made a filing to the MPUC concerning an emissions reduction project at the
Sherco generating facility. The improvement project would include generating
capacity upgrades for all three units; additional SO


emission reductions on Units 1 and 2 to
improve mercury emission controls; and the installation of additional NO

x

controls.


The issue of
global climate change is receiving increased attention. There is considerable
debate regarding the public policy approach that the United States should
follow to address the issue. Several members of Congress have also proposed
legislation to regulate carbon dioxide, and several states are developing their
own programs to address climate change.

While it is not possible to know the eventual outcome, Xcel Energy is
taking prudent steps to address the risk of potential climate regulation. Xcel
Energy’s initiatives to prepare for potential carbon dioxide regulation include
the following:

·

Xcel
Energy is participating in a voluntary carbon management program and has
established goals to reduce its volume of carbon dioxide emissions by 12
million tons by 2009, and to reduce carbon intensity by 7 percent by 2012.

·

In
certain regulatory jurisdictions, Xcel Energy uses an evaluation process for
future generating resources that incorporates the risk of future carbon limits
through the use of a carbon cost adder or externality costs.

·

PSCo
is in the process of developing an IGCC plant that generates electricity using
gasified coal and will be the first plant of its kind to capture and sequester
a portion of the carbon dioxide generated by the plant.

·

Xcel
Energy is the largest retail provider of wind generated energy in the nation
and continues to grow its wind portfolio.

·

Xcel
Energy is involved in initiatives to manage carbon dioxide, including the use
of biosequestration and the study of geological sequestration.

·

Xcel
Energy continues to develop and expand its customer conservation and demand
side management programs.

·

Xcel
Energy is working with public policy makers to support the development of a
national climate policy to require the deployment of electric generation
technology that emits little or no carbon dioxide.

Xcel Energy believes that it is well positioned for a variety of
possible outcomes.

Impact of Nonregulated Investments

In the past, Xcel Energy’s investments in nonregulated operations had a
significant impact on its results of operations. As a result of the divestiture
of NRG and other nonregulated operations, Xcel Energy does not expect that its
investments in nonregulated operations will continue to have a significant
impact on its results.

Inflation

Inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect
Xcel Energy’s prices or returns to shareholders.


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related
disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of accounting rules and
guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies
necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood
of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and
anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments could materially impact the
Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures, based on varying
assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have
a significant effect on the operation of the business and on the results
reported even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not
changed. The following is a list of accounting policies that are most
significant to the portrayal of Xcel Energy’s financial condition and results,
and that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.
Each of these has a higher potential likelihood of resulting in materially
different reported amounts under different conditions or using different
assumptions. Each critical accounting policy has been discussed with the audit
committee of the Xcel Energy board of directors.

Xcel Energy continually makes judgments and estimates related to these
critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the varying
assumptions and uncertainties for each area. For example:

·

Probable
outcomes of regulatory proceedings are assessed in cases of requested cost
recovery or other approvals from regulators.

·

The
ability to operate plant facilities and recover the related costs over their
useful operating lives, or such other period designated by Xcel Energy’s
regulators, is assumed.

·

Probable
outcomes of reviews and challenges raised by tax authorities, including appeals
and litigation where necessary, are assessed.

·

Projections
are made regarding earnings on pension investments, and the salary increases
provided to employees over their periods of service.


The
information and assumptions underlying many of these judgments and estimates
will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise
change over time. This may require adjustments to recorded results to better
reflect the events and updated information that becomes available. The
accompanying financial statements reflect management’s best estimates and
judgments of the impact of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2006.

For a discussion of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pending Accounting Changes

FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) —

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.”
FIN 48 prescribes how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose
uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take in its
income tax returns. FIN 48 requires that only income tax benefits that meet the
“more likely than not” recognition threshold be recognized or continue to be
recognized on its effective date. Initial derecognition amounts would be
reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Following
implementation, the ongoing recognition of changes in measurement of uncertain
tax positions would be reflected as a component of income tax expense.

FIN 48 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2006.

Xcel Energy has substantially
completed its analysis and does not expect the cumulative effect of the
adoption to be material.

Fair Value
Measurements (SFAS No. 157) —

In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, which provides a single definition of fair
value, together with a framework for measuring it, and requires additional
disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157
also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, and sets out a
fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active
markets. Fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy.
SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after Nov. 15, 2007. Xcel Energy is evaluating the impact of
SFAS No. 157 on its financial condition and results of operations and does
not expect the impact of implementation to be material.

Derivatives, Risk Management and Market R

isk

In the normal
course of business, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to a variety
of market risks. Market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result
of changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity.
All financial and commodity-related instruments, including derivatives, are subject
to market risk. These risks, as applicable to Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries,
are discussed in further detail later.

Commodity Price Risk —

Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their
electric and natural gas operations. Commodity price risk is managed by
entering into both long- and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts
for electric capacity, energy and energy-related products, and for various
fuels used in generation and distribution activities. Commodity price risk is
also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. Xcel Energy’s
risk-management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each
rate-regulated operation to the extent such exposure exists, as allowed by
regulation.

Short-Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading
Risk

—

Xcel Energy’s subsidiaries conduct various short-term wholesale and
commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of capacity,
energy and energy-related instruments. These marketing activities have terms of
generally less than one year in length. Xcel Energy’s risk-management policy
allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations
as approved by its risk management committee, which is made up of management personnel
not directly involved in the activities governed by the policy.

Certain
contracts and financial instruments within the scope of these activities
qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133 — “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” (SFAS No. 133).

The fair value of the commodity trading
contracts as of Dec. 31, 2006, was as follows:

  contractual terms. The models reflect management’s estimates, taking into account
  observable market prices, estimated market prices in the absence of quoted
  market prices, the risk-free market discount rate, volatility factors,
  estimated correlations of commodity prices and contractual volumes. Market
  price uncertainty and other risks also are factored into the model.

*

—

SPS conducts an inconsequential amount of commodity trading. Margins
  from commodity trading activity are partially redistributed to SPS,
  NSP-Minnesota, and PSCo, pursuant to the JOA approved by the FERC. As a result
  of the JOA, margins received pursuant to the JOA are reflected as part of the
  fair values by source for the commodity trading net asset or liability
  balances.

Normal
purchases and sales transactions, as defined by SFAS No. 133 and certain
other long-term power purchase contracts are not included in the fair values by
source tables as they are not recorded at fair value as part of commodity
trading operations and are not qualifying hedges.

At Dec. 31,
2006, a 10-percent increase in market prices over the next 12 months for
commodity trading contracts would increase pretax income from continuing
operations by approximately $0.9 million, whereas a 10-percent decrease
would decrease pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $1.1
million.


Xcel Energy’s
short-term wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding
risk exposure to price changes on transactions, contracts and obligations that
have been entered into, but not closed, using an industry standard methodology
known as VaR. VaR expresses the potential change in fair value on the
outstanding transactions, contracts and obligations over a particular period of
time, with a given confidence interval under normal market conditions. Xcel
Energy utilizes the variance/covariance approach in calculating VaR. The VaR
model employs a 95-percent confidence interval level based on historical
price movement, lognormal price distribution assumption, delta half-gamma
approach for non-linear instruments and a three-day holding period for both
electricity and natural gas.

VaR is calculated on a consolidated basis. The
VaRs for the commodity trading operations were:

Interest Rate Risk

—

Xcel Energy
and its subsidiaries are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in
the normal course of business. Xcel Energy’s policy allows interest rate risk
to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and
interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options.

Xcel Energy
engages in hedges of cash flow and fair value exposure. The fair value of
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is initially recorded in
Other Comprehensive Income. Reclassification of unrealized gains or losses on
cash flow hedges of variable rate debt instruments from Other Comprehensive
Income into earnings occurs as interest payments are accrued on the debt
instrument, and generally offsets the change in the interest accrued on the
underlying variable rate debt. Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into
to hedge the fair value of debt instruments. Changes in the derivative fair
values that are designated as fair value hedges are recognized in earnings as
offsets to the changes in fair values of debt instruments. To test the
effectiveness of such swaps, a hypothetical swap is used to mirror all the
critical terms of the underlying debt and regression analysis is utilized to
assess the effectiveness of the actual swap at inception and on an ongoing
basis. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined through counterparty
valuations, internal valuations and broker quotes. There have been no material
changes in the techniques or models used in the valuation of interest rate
swaps during the periods presented.

At Dec. 31,
2006 and 2005, a 100-basis-point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel
Energy’s variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense by
approximately $7.0 million and $10.3 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries’ interest rate swaps.

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries also maintain trust funds, as required
by the NRC, to fund costs of nuclear decommissioning. These trust funds are
subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk. As of Dec. 31, 2006
and 2005, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international
equity securities and fixed-rate fixed-income securities. These funds may be
used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. The accounting for
nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through rates;
therefore fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates do not have an impact
on earnings.

Credit Risk

—

Xcel Energy
and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to
the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a counterparty of its
contractual obligations. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies
intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to
reflect changes and scope of operations.

Xcel Energy
and its subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties.
Xcel Energy employs additional credit risk control mechanisms, such as letters
of credit, parental guarantees, standardized master netting agreements and


termination
provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures. The
credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the activity with a specific
counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided.

At Dec. 31, 2006, a 10-percent increase in prices would have
resulted in a net mark-to-market increase in credit risk exposure of $8.1
million, while a decrease of 10 percent would have resulted in a decrease of
$7.3 million.

Cash provided
by operating activities for continuing operations increased $598 million during
2006. The increase is primarily due to the timing of working capital activity. Specifically,
the collection of receivables and the collection of recoverable purchased
natural gas and electric energy costs increased in 2006. The increase in cash
provided by operations was partially offset by the timing of cash expenditures
for accounts payable. Cash provided by operating activities for discontinued
operations increased $150 million during 2006, largely due to the recognition
of deferred tax assets related to NRG.

Cash provided by operating activities for
continuing operations was basically unchanged for 2005 and 2004. Cash provided
by operating activities for discontinued operations increased $368 million
during 2005 compared with 2004. During 2004, Xcel Energy paid $752 million
pursuant to the NRG settlement agreement, which was partially offset by tax
benefits received.

Many of the
states in which Xcel Energy has operations are considering renewable portfolio
standards, which would require significant increases in investment in renewable
generation and transmission. Xcel Energy would generally be able to meet these
standards by either purchasing renewable power from an independent party or by
owning the assets. Therefore, these standards may present Xcel Energy with the
opportunity to increase its investment in wind generation and transmission
assets. As a result, Xcel Energy’s capital expenditure forecast, as detailed
above, may increase due to the potential increased investments for wind
generation, IGCC and transmission assets.

The capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to
continuing review and modification. Actual utility construction expenditures
may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas
projected load growth, regulatory decisions and approvals, the desired reserve
margin and the availability of purchased power, as well as alternative plans
for meeting Xcel Energy’s long-term energy needs. In addition, Xcel Energy’s
ongoing evaluation of restructuring requirements, compliance with future
environmental requirements and renewable portfolio standards to install
emission-control equipment, and merger, acquisition and divestiture
opportunities to support corporate strategies may impact actual capital
requirements.

(a)

Under some leases, Xcel Energy would
have to sell or purchase the property that it leases if it chose to terminate
before the scheduled lease expiration date. Most of Xcel Energy’s railcar,
vehicle and equipment and aircraft leases have these terms. At Dec. 31,
2006, the amount that Xcel Energy would have to pay if it chose to terminate
these leases was approximately $186.1 million. In addition, at the end of the
equipment leases’ terms, each lease must be extended, equipment purchased for
the greater of the fair value or unamortized value or equipment sold to a third
party with Xcel Energy making up any deficiency between the sales price and the
unamortized value.

(b)

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries have
contracts providing for the purchase and delivery of a significant portion of
its current coal, nuclear fuel and natural gas requirements. Additionally, the
utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy have entered into agreements with utilities
and other energy suppliers for purchased power to meet system load and energy
requirements, replace generation from company-owned units under maintenance and
during outages, and meet operating reserve obligations. Certain contractual
purchase obligations are adjusted based on indices. However, the effects of
price changes are mitigated through cost-of-energy adjustment mechanisms.

(c)

Xcel
Energy also has outstanding authority under contracts and blanket purchase
orders to purchase up to approximately $1.3 billion of goods and services
through the year 2021, in addition to the amounts disclosed in this table and
in the forecasted capital expenditures.

Common Stock Dividends

—

Future
dividend levels will be dependent on Xcel Energy’s results of operations,
financial position, cash flows and other factors, and will be evaluated by the
Xcel Energy board of directors. Xcel Energy’s objective is to increase the
annual dividend in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent per year. Xcel Energy’s
dividend policy balances:

·

Projected
cash generation from utility operations;

·

Projected
capital investment in the utility businesses;

·

A
reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment; and

·

The
impact on Xcel Energy’s capital structure and credit ratings.

In addition,
there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels. Federal
law places certain limits on the ability of public utilities within a holding
company system to declare dividends.

Specifically,
under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any
funds properly included in a capital account. The cash to pay dividends to Xcel
Energy shareholders is primarily derived from dividends received from its
utility subsidiaries. The utility subsidiaries are generally limited in the
amount of dividends allowed by state regulatory commissions to be paid to the
holding company. The limitation is imposed through equity ratio limitations that
range from 30 percent to 60 percent. Some utility subsidiaries must comply with
bond indenture covenants or restrictions under credit agreements for debt to
total capitalization ratios.

The Articles of Incorporation of Xcel Energy place restrictions on the
amount of common stock dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding.
Under the provisions, dividend payments may be restricted if Xcel Energy’s
capitalization ratio (on a holding company basis only, not on a consolidated
basis) is less than 25 percent. For these purposes, the capitalization ratio is
equal to common stock plus surplus, divided by the sum of common stock plus
surplus plus long-term debt. Based on this definition, Xcel Energy’s
capitalization ratio at Dec. 31, 2006, was 81 percent. Therefore, the
restrictions do not place any effective limit on Xcel Energy’s ability to pay
dividends.


Capital Sources

Xcel Energy
expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing
short-term debt, long-term debt, common stock, preferred securities and hybrid
securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios.

Short-Term Funding Sources

—

Historically,
Xcel Energy has used a number of sources to fulfill short-term funding needs,
including operating cash flow, notes payable, commercial paper and bank lines
of credit. The amount and timing of short-term funding needs depend in large
part on financing needs for construction expenditures and working capital. Another
significant short-term funding need is the dividend payment.

As of Feb. 20, 2007, Xcel Energy and its
utility subsidiaries had the following committed credit facilities available to
meet its liquidity needs:

Operating cash
flow as a source of short-term funding is affected by such operating factors as
weather; regulatory requirements, including rate recovery of costs;
environmental regulation compliance; changes in the trends for energy prices;
and supply and operational uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict.
See further discussion of such factors under Statement of Operations Analysis.

Short-term borrowing as a source of funding
is affected by regulatory actions and access to reasonably priced capital
markets. For additional information on Xcel Energy’s short-term borrowing
arrangements, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Access to
reasonably priced capital markets is dependent in part on credit agency reviews
and ratings. The following ratings reflect the views of Moody’s, Standard &
Poor’s, and Fitch. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold securities, and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the
rating agency. As of Feb. 20, 2007, the following represents the credit
ratings assigned to various Xcel Energy companies:

for commercial paper range from P-1 to P-3. Standard &
Poor’s ratings for commercial paper range from A-1 to A-3. Fitch’s
ratings for commercial paper range from F1 to F3.

In the event of a downgrade of its credit ratings to below investment
grade, Xcel Energy may be required to provide credit enhancements in the form
of cash collateral, letters of credit or other security to satisfy all or a part
of its exposures under guarantees outstanding. See a list of guarantees at Note
12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Xcel Energy has no explicit credit
rating requirements in its debt agreements.

Money Pool

—

Xcel Energy
received SEC and the FERC approval to establish a utility money pool
arrangement with the utility subsidiaries, subject to receipt of required state
regulatory approvals. The utility money pool allows for short-term loans
between the utility subsidiaries and from the holding company to the utility
subsidiaries at market-based interest rates.


The utility money pool arrangement does not allow loans from the
utility subsidiaries to the holding company. NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS
participate in the money pool pursuant to approval from their respective state
regulatory commissions. Borrowing limits are $250 million, $250 million and
$100 million, respectively. No borrowings or loans were outstanding at Dec. 31,
2006.

Registration
Statements

—

Xcel Energy’s Articles of
Incorporation authorize the issuance of 1 billion shares of common stock. As of
Dec. 31, 2006, Xcel Energy had approximately 407 million shares of common
stock outstanding. In addition, Xcel Energy’s Articles of Incorporation
authorize the issuance of 7 million shares of $100 par value preferred stock. On
Dec. 31, 2006, Xcel Energy had approximately 1 million shares of preferred
stock outstanding. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries have the following
registration statements on file with the SEC, pursuant to which they may sell,
from time to time, securities:

·

Xcel Energy has $700
million available under its currently effective registration statement.

·

NSP-Minnesota
has $390 million available under its currently effective registration
statement.

·

PSCo has approximately $225
million available under its currently effective registration statement.

Future Financing Plans

To facilitate potential long-term debt issuances at the utility
subsidiaries, PSCo intends to file a long-term debt shelf registration
statement with the SEC in 2007, and NSP-Wisconsin may file a long-term debt
shelf registration for up to $125 million.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

Xcel Energy does not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements, other
than those currently disclosed, that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Management Report on Internal Controls Over Financial
R

eporting

The management
of Xcel Energy is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Xcel Energy’s internal control
system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management
and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
published financial statements.

All internal
control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Xcel Energy
management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of Dec. 31, 2006. In making this assessment, it
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment, we
believe that, as of Dec. 31, 2006, the company’s internal control over
financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Xcel Energy’s independent auditors have
issued an audit report on our assessment of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Their report appears on the following page.

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting F

irm

Board of
Directors and Stockholders

Xcel Energy Inc.

We have
audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying

Management Report on Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting

, that Xcel Energy Inc. and subsidiaries maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under
the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s
board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the
inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,
material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based
on the criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules

as of and for the year ended December 31,

of the Company and our report
dated February 22, 2007

,

expressed
an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement
schedules and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s
adoption of a new accounting standard.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

Board of
Directors and Stockholders

Xcel Energy Inc.

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
statements of capitalization of Xcel Energy Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements
of income, common stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at
Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on
our audits.

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Xcel Energy Inc. and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein.

As discussed
in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,” as of December 31,
2006.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Business and
System of Accounts

—

Xcel Energy’s
utility subsidiaries are engaged principally in the generation, purchase,
transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and in the purchase,
transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas. The utility subsidiaries
are subject to regulation by the FERC and state utility commissions. All of the
utility companies’ accounting records conform to the FERC uniform system of
accounts or to systems required by various state regulatory commissions, which
are the same in all material respects.

Principles of Consolidation

—

In 2006, Xcel
Energy continuing operations included the activity of four utility subsidiaries
that serve electric and natural gas customers in 8 states. These utility
subsidiaries are NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS. These utilities
serve customers in portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Along with WGI, an interstate
natural gas pipeline, and WYCO, a natural gas pipeline and storage company in
Colorado, these companies comprise our continuing regulated utility operations.

Xcel Energy’s
nonregulated subsidiary in continuing operations is Eloigne (investments in
rental housing projects that qualify for low-income housing reported tax
credits). Xcel Energy owns the following additional direct subsidiaries, some
of which are intermediate holding companies with additional subsidiaries: Xcel
Energy Wholesale Energy Group Inc., Xcel Energy Markets Holdings Inc., Xcel
Energy Ventures Inc., Xcel Energy Retail Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy
Communications Group Inc., Xcel Energy WYCO Inc. and Xcel Energy O&M
Services Inc. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as
Xcel Energy.

Xcel Energy in
the past had several other subsidiaries, which were sold or divested. For more
information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2004, Xcel
Energy began consolidating the financial statements of subsidiaries in which it
has a controlling financial interest, pursuant to the requirements of FIN No. 46.
Historically, consolidation has been required only for subsidiaries in which an
enterprise has a majority voting interest. As a result, Xcel Energy is required
to consolidate a portion of its affordable housing investments made through
Eloigne. As of Dec. 31, 2006, the assets of the affordable housing
investments consolidated as a result of FIN No. 46, as revised, were
approximately $134 million and long-term liabilities were approximately $77
million, including long-term debt of $70 million. Investments of $51 million,
previously reflected as a component of investments in unconsolidated
affiliates, have been consolidated with the entities’ assets initially recorded
at their carrying amounts as of Jan. 1, 2004. The long-term debt is
collateralized by the affordable housing projects and is nonrecourse to Xcel
Energy.

Xcel Energy uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in
partnerships, joint ventures and certain projects for which it does not have a
controlling financial interest. Under this method, a proportionate share of
pretax income is recorded as equity earnings from investments in affiliates. In
the consolidation process, all intercompany transactions and balances are
eliminated. Xcel Energy has investments in several plants and transmission
facilities jointly owned with other utilities. These projects are accounted for
on a proportionate consolidation basis, consistent with industry practice. See
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

—

Revenues
related to the sale of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered
or energy is delivered to customers. However, the determination of the energy
sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meter, which
occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month,
amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter
reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated.

Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries have various rate-adjustment
mechanisms in place that currently provide for the recovery of certain
purchased natural gas and electric fuel and purchased energy costs. These
cost-adjustment tariffs may increase or decrease the level of costs recovered
through base rates and are revised periodically, as prescribed by the
appropriate regulatory agencies, for any difference between the total amount
collected under the clauses and the recoverable costs incurred. In addition,
Xcel Energy presents its revenue net of any excise or other fiduciary-type
taxes or fees. A summary of significant rate-adjustment mechanisms follows:

·

NSP-Minnesota’s
rates include a cost-of-fuel-and-purchased-energy and a cost-of-gas recovery
mechanism allowing dollar-for-dollar recovery of the respective costs, which
are trued-up on a two-month and annual basis, respectively.

F-9

The electric
cost-of-fuel-and-purchased-energy mechanism also provides a sharing among
shareholders and customers of certain margins on short-term wholesale sales and
commodity trading.

·

NSP-Wisconsin’s
rates include a cost-of-gas adjustment clause for purchased natural gas, but
not for purchased electric energy or electric fuel. In Wisconsin, requests can
be made for recovery of those electric costs prospectively through the rate
review process, which normally occurs every two years, and an interim fuel-cost
hearing process.

·

PSCo
generally recovers all prudently incurred electric fuel and purchased energy
costs through the ECA. The ECA, effective Jan. 1, 2004, is an incentive
adjustment mechanism that compares actual fuel and purchased energy expense in
a calendar year to a benchmark formula. The ECA also provides for an $11.25
million cap on any cost sharing over or under an allowed ECA formula rate. The
current ECA mechanism expired Dec. 31, 2006. Effective Jan. 1, 2007,
the ECA has been modified to include an incentive adjustment to encourage
efficient operation of base load coal plants and encourage cost reductions
through purchases of economical short-term energy. The total incentive payment
to PSCo in any calendar year will not exceed $11.25 million. The ECA mechanism
will be revised quarterly and interest will accrue monthly on the average
deferred balance. The ECA will expire at the earlier of rates taking effect
after Comanche 3 is placed in service or Dec. 31, 2010.

·

In
Texas, SPS may request periodic adjustments to provide electric fuel and
purchased energy cost recovery. In New Mexico, SPS has a monthly fuel and
purchased power cost-recovery factor.

·

In
Colorado, PSCo operates under an annual earnings test in which earnings above
the authorized return on equity are refunded to customers. NSP-Minnesota and PSCo
operate under various service quality standards in Minnesota and Colorado,
respectively, which could require customer refunds if certain criteria are not
met. NSP-Minnesota and PSCo’s rates in Minnesota and Colorado, respectively,
also include monthly adjustments for the recovery of conservation and
energy-management program costs, which are reviewed annually. PSCo is allowed
to recover certain costs associated with renewable energy resources through a
specific retail rate rider. NSP-Minnesota is allowed to recover certain costs
associated with new transmission facilities to deliver renewable energy
resources through a rate rider.

·

NSP-Minnesota,
NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS sell firm power and energy in wholesale markets,
which are regulated by the FERC. Certain of these rates include monthly
wholesale fuel cost-recovery mechanisms.

Commodity Trading Operations

—

All
applicable gains and losses related to commodity trading activities, whether or
not settled physically, are shown on a net basis in the Consolidated Statements
of Income.

Xcel Energy’s commodity trading operations are conducted by
NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS. Commodity trading activities are not associated
with energy produced from Xcel Energy’s generation assets or energy and
capacity purchased to serve native load. Commodity trading contracts are
recorded at fair market value in accordance with SFAS No. 133. In
addition, commodity trading results include the impact of all pertinent
margin-sharing mechanisms.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

—

Xcel Energy
and its subsidiaries utilize a variety of derivatives, including commodity
forwards, futures and options, index or fixed price swaps and basis swaps, to
reduce exposure to commodity price and interest rate risks and to enhance its
operations. For further discussion of Xcel Energy’s risk management and
derivative activities, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Property, Plant and Equipment and
Depreciation

—

Property, plant and equipment is
stated at original cost. The cost of plant includes direct labor and materials,
contracted work, overhead costs and applicable interest expense. The cost of
plant retired is charged to accumulated depreciation and amortization. Removal
costs associated with regulatory obligations are recorded as regulatory
liabilities. Significant additions or improvements extending asset lives are
capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Maintenance and replacement of items determined to be less than units of
property are charged to operating expenses. Planned major maintenance
activities are charged to operating expense unless the cost represents the
acquisition of an additional unit of property or the replacement of an existing
unit of property. Property, plant and equipment also includes costs associated
with property held for future use.

Xcel Energy records depreciation expense related to its plant by using
the straight-line method over the plant’s useful life. Actuarial and
semi-actuarial life studies are performed on a period basis and submitted to
the state and federal commissions for review. Upon acceptance by the various
commissions, the resulting lives and net salvage rates are used to calculate
depreciation. Depreciation expense, expressed as a percentage of average
depreciable property, was approximately 3.2 percent, 3.2 percent and 3.1
percent for the years ended Dec. 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

F-10

AFDC

—

AFDC
represents the cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity. AFDC
is computed by applying a composite pretax rate to qualified construction work
in progress. The amount of AFDC capitalized as a utility construction cost is
credited to other nonoperating income (for equity capital) and interest charges
(for debt capital). AFDC amounts capitalized are included in Xcel Energy’s rate
base for establishing utility service rates. In addition to
construction-related amounts, AFDC also is recorded to reflect returns on
capital used to finance conservation programs in Minnesota.

Generally, AFDC costs are recovered from customers as the related
property is depreciated. In December 2003, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s
MERP proposal to convert two coal-fueled electric generating plants to natural
gas, and to install advanced pollution control equipment at a third coal-fired
plant. The MPUC has approved a more current recovery of the financing costs
related to the MERP. The in-service plant costs, including the financing costs
during construction, are recovered from customers through a MERP rider
resulting in a lower recognition of AFDC.

Decommissioning

—

Xcel Energy
accounts for the future cost of decommissioning, or retirement, of its nuclear
generating plants through annual depreciation accruals using an annuity
approach designed to provide for full rate recovery of the future
decommissioning costs. The decommissioning calculation covers all expenses,
including decontamination and removal of radioactive material, and extends over
the estimated lives of the plants. The calculation assumes that NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin will recover those costs through rates. The fair value of
external nuclear decommissioning fund investments are estimated based on quoted
market prices for those or similar investments. Unrealized gains or losses are
included with Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more
information on nuclear decommissioning, see Note 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Nuclear Fuel
Expense

—

Nuclear fuel expense, which is
recorded as the nuclear generating plants use fuel, includes the cost of fuel
used in the current period (including AFDC), as well as future disposal costs
of spent nuclear fuel, costs associated with the end-of-life fuel segments, and
fees assessed by the DOE for NSP-Minnesota’s portion of the cost of
decommissioning the DOE’s fuel-enrichment facility.

Environmental Costs

—

Environmental
costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable Xcel Energy is
liable for the costs and the liability can reasonably be estimated. Costs may be
deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that the costs will be
recovered from customers in future rates. Otherwise, the costs are expensed. If
an environmental expense is related to facilities currently in use, such as
emission-control equipment, the cost is capitalized and depreciated over the
life of the plant, assuming the costs are recoverable in future rates or future
cash flow.

Estimated remediation costs, excluding inflationary increases, are
recorded. The estimates are based on experience, an assessment of the current
situation and the technology currently available for use in the remediation.
The recorded costs are regularly adjusted as estimates are revised and as
remediation proceeds. If several designated responsible parties exist, only
Xcel Energy’s expected share of the cost is estimated and recorded. Any future
costs of restoring sites where operation may extend indefinitely are treated as
a capitalized cost of plant retirement. The depreciation expense levels
recoverable in rates include a provision for removal expenses, which may
include final remediation costs. Removal costs recovered in rates are
classified as a regulatory liability.

Legal Costs

—

Legal costs
are not accrued, but expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes

—

Xcel Energy
and its domestic subsidiaries file consolidated federal income tax returns.
Xcel Energy and its domestic subsidiaries file combined and separate state
income tax returns.

Federal income
taxes paid by Xcel Energy, as parent of the Xcel Energy consolidated group, are
allocated to the Xcel Energy subsidiaries based on separate company
computations of tax. A similar allocation is made for state income taxes paid
by Xcel Energy in connection with combined state filings. The holding company
also allocates its own net income tax benefits to its direct subsidiaries based
on the positive tax liability of each company.

Xcel Energy
defers income taxes for all temporary differences between pretax financial and
taxable income, and between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
Xcel Energy uses the tax rates that are scheduled to be in effect when the
temporary differences are expected to turn around, or reverse.

Due to the effects of past regulatory practices, when deferred taxes
were not required to be recorded, the reversal of some temporary differences
are accounted for as current income tax expense. Investment tax credits are
deferred and their benefits amortized over the estimated lives of the related
property. Utility rate regulation also has created certain regulatory assets
and liabilities related to income taxes, which are summarized in Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

F-11

Use of
Estimates

—

In recording transactions and
balances resulting from business operations, Xcel Energy uses estimates based
on the best information available. Estimates are used for such items as plant
depreciable lives, asset retirement obligations, decommissioning, tax
provisions, uncollectible amounts, environmental costs, unbilled revenues,
jurisdictional fuel and energy cost allocations and actuarially determined
benefit costs. The recorded estimates are revised when better information
becomes available or when actual amounts can be determined. Those revisions can
affect operating results. The depreciable lives of certain plant assets are
reviewed annually and revised, if appropriate.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

—

Xcel Energy considers
investments in certain instruments, including commercial paper and money market
funds, with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of
purchase to be cash equivalents.

Inventory

—

All inventory
is recorded at average cost.

Regulatory
Accounting

—

Our regulated utility
subsidiaries account for certain income and expense items in accordance with
SFAS No. 71 — “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation.” Under SFAS No. 71:

·

Certain
costs, which would otherwise be charged to expense, are deferred as regulatory
assets based on the expected ability to recover them in future rates; and

·

Certain
credits, which would otherwise be reflected as income, are deferred as
regulatory liabilities based on the expectation they will be returned to
customers in future rates.

Estimates of
recovering deferred costs and returning deferred credits are based on specific
ratemaking decisions or precedent for each item. Regulatory assets and
liabilities are amortized consistent with the period of expected regulatory
treatment.

If restructuring or other changes in the regulatory environment occur,
our regulated utility subsidiaries may no longer be eligible to apply this
accounting treatment, and may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets
and liabilities from their balance sheets. Such changes could have a material
effect on Xcel Energy’s results of operations in the period the write-offs are
recorded. See more discussion of regulatory assets and liabilities at Note 16
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Deferred
Financing Costs

—

Other assets
included deferred financing costs, net of amortization, of approximately $47
million and $42 million at Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Xcel
Energy is amortizing these financing costs over the remaining maturity periods
of the related debt.

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Uncollectibles

—

Accounts
receivable are stated at the actual billed amount net of write-offs and
allowance for uncollectibles. Xcel Energy establishes an allowance for
uncollectibles based on a reserve policy that reflects its expected exposure to
the credit risk of customers.

Emission
Allowances

—

Emission allowances are recorded
at cost, including the annual SO


and NOx emission allowance entitlement
received at no cost from the Federal EPA. Xcel Energy follows the inventory
model for all allowances. The sales of allowances are reported in the Operating
Activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The net margin
on sales of emission allowances is included in Electric Utility Operations
Revenue as it is integral to the production process of energy and our revenue
optimization strategy for our utility operations.

Reclassifications

—

The balance
sheet and the statements of cash flows have been reclassified from prior-period
presentation to conform to the 2006 presentation. These reclassifications had
no effect on net income or earnings per share. The reclassifications were
related to the presentation of regulatory assets and liabilities for ARO and
decommissioning activities on a net basis. These reclassifications did not
affect total operating, investing or financing within the statements of cash
flows.

FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48)

—

In July 2006,
the FASB issued FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 prescribes how a company
should recognize, measure, present and disclose uncertain tax positions that
the company has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns. FIN 48
requires that only income tax benefits that meet the “more likely than not”
recognition threshold be recognized or continue to be recognized on its effective
date. Initial derecognition amounts would be reported as a cumulative effect of
a change in accounting principle. Following implementation, the ongoing
recognition of changes in the measurement of uncertain tax positions would be
reflected as a component of income tax expense.

FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15,
2006.

Xcel
Energy has substantially completed its analysis and does not expect the
cumulative effect of the adoption to be material.

F-12

Fair Value
Measurements (SFAS No. 157)

—

In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, which provides a single definition of fair
value, together with a framework for measuring it, and requires additional
disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157
also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, and sets out a
fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active
markets. Fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy.
SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after Nov. 15, 2007. Xcel Energy is evaluating the impact of
SFAS No. 157 on its financial condition and results of operations and does
not expect the impact of implementation to be material.

2.

Discontinued
Operations

Xcel Energy
classified and accounted for certain assets as held for sale at Dec. 31,
2006 and 2005. Assets held for sale are valued on an asset-by-asset basis at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. In applying
those provisions, management considered cash flow analyses, bids and offers
related to those assets and businesses. Assets held for sale are not
depreciated.

Results of operations for divested businesses and the results of
businesses held for sale are reported for all periods presented on a net basis
as discontinued operations. In addition, the assets and liabilities of the
businesses divested and held for sale in 2006 and 2005 have been reclassified
to assets and liabilities held for sale in the accompanying Balance Sheet.

Regulated Utility Subsidiaries

In 2005, Black Hills Corp. purchased all the common stock of Cheyenne,
including the assumption of outstanding debt of approximately $25 million, for
approximately $90 million, plus a working capital adjustment finalized in 2005.
The sale resulted in an after-tax loss of approximately $13 million, or 3 cents
per share.

Nonregulated Subsidiaries

Utility
Engineering

—

In April 2005, Zachry
acquired all of the outstanding shares of UE. Xcel Energy recorded an
insignificant loss in the first quarter of 2005 as a result of the transaction.
The majority of Quixx Corp., including Borger Energy Associates and Quixx Power
Services, Inc., was sold in October 2006 to affiliates of Energy
Investors Funds.

Seren

—

In November 2005,
Xcel Energy sold Seren’s California assets to WaveDivision Holdings, LLC. In January 2006,
Xcel Energy sold Seren’s Minnesota assets to Charter Communications. An
estimated after-tax impairment charge, including disposition costs, of $143
million, or 34 cents per share, was recorded in 2004. Based on the sales
agreements entered into in 2005, the estimate was adjusted in 2005 to reflect a
total asset impairment of $140 million.

Xcel Energy
International and e prime

—

The exit of all
business conducted by e prime was completed in 2004. The results of
discontinued nonregulated operations in 2004 include the impact of the sale of
the Argentina subsidiaries of Xcel Energy International, for a sales price of
approximately $31 million. In addition to the sales price, Xcel Energy also
received approximately $21 million at the closing of one transaction as
redemption of its capital investment. The sales resulted in a gain of
approximately $8 million, including the realization of approximately $7 million
of income tax benefits realizable upon the sale of the Xcel Energy
International assets.

NRG

—

With NRG’s
emergence from bankruptcy in December 2003, Xcel Energy divested its
ownership interest in NRG. Xcel Energy recognized $13 million tax expense and
$17 million tax benefit related to the divestiture of NRG in 2004 and 2005,
respectively. These tax expenses and benefits are reported as discontinued
operations.

Net of
credit facility borrowings, issued and outstanding letters of credit and
commercial paper borrowings

The lines of
credit provide short-term financing in the form of notes payable to banks,
letters of credit and back-up support for commercial paper borrowings. Each
credit facility has one financial covenant requiring that the
debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of each entity be less than or equal to 65
percent with which all were in compliance. The interest rates under these lines
of credit are based on either the agent bank’s prime rate or the applicable
LIBOR, plus a borrowing margin based on the applicable debt rating.

Xcel Energy
has an $800 million, five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that
matures in December 2011. Xcel Energy has the right to request an
extension of the final maturity date by one year. The maturity extension is
subject to majority bank group approval. As of Dec. 31, 2006, Xcel Energy
had no direct borrowings on this line of credit, however the credit facility
was used to provide backup for $113.8 million of commercial paper outstanding
and $0.7 million of letters of credit. As discussed in Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, $43.8 million of letters of credit were
outstanding at Dec. 31, 2006, of which $0.7 million were supported by the
Xcel Energy credit facility and are included in the above table.

Xcel Energy’s
2007 and 2008 series convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of
Xcel Energy common stock at a conversion price of $12.33 per share. Conversion
is at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity. In addition, Xcel
Energy must make additional payments of interest, referred to as protection
payments, on the notes in an amount equal to any portion of regular quarterly
per share dividends on common stock that exceeds 18.75 cents per share that
would have been payable to the holders of the notes if such holders had
converted their notes on the record date for such dividend. On May 17, 2006,
the board of directors of Xcel Energy voted to raise the quarterly dividend on
its common stock from 21.50 cents per share to 22.25 cents per share. Consequently,
as of Dec. 31, 2006, a total of $3.1 million in additional interest
expense has been recorded.

All property
of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin and the electric property of PSCo are
subject to the liens of their first mortgage indentures. In addition, certain
SPS payments under its pollution-control obligations are pledged to secure
obligations of the Red River Authority of Texas.

Preferred
Stock

Xcel Energy
has authorized 7,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a $100 par value. At Dec. 31,
2006, Xcel Energy had six series of preferred stock outstanding, redeemable at
its option at prices ranging from $102.00 to $103.75 per share plus accrued
dividends.

The holders of
the $3.60 series preferred stock are entitled to three votes per each share
held. The holders of the other series of preferred stock are entitled to one
vote per share. In the event dividends payable on the preferred stock of any
series outstanding is in arrears in an amount equal to four quarterly
dividends, the holders of preferred stocks, voting as a class, are

F-15

entitled to
elect the smallest number of directors necessary to constitute a majority of
the board of directors. The holders of common stock, voting as a class, are
entitled to elect the remaining directors.

The charters of some of Xcel Energy’s
subsidiaries also authorize the issuance of preferred stock. However, at Dec. 31,
2006, there are no preferred shares of subsidiaries outstanding.

NSP-Minnesota
is part owner of Sherco 3, an 860-MW, coal-fueled electric generating
unit. NSP-Minnesota is the operating agent under the joint ownership agreement.
NSP-Minnesota’s share of operating expenses and construction expenditures are
included in the applicable utility accounts. Each of the respective owners is
responsible for funding its portion of the construction costs. For Sherco
Common Facilities Units 1, 2 and 3, the ownership percentage for Xcel Energy
increased from 65.6 percent to 75 percent in January 2006 on new capital
investments.

PSCo’s current operational assets include approximately 320 MWs of
jointly owned generating capacity. PSCo’s share of operating expenses and
construction expenditures are included in the applicable utility accounts. PSCo
began major construction on a new jointly owned 750 MW, coal-fired unit in
Pueblo, Colo. in January 2006. Major construction on the new unit,
Comanche 3, is expected to be completed in the fall of 2009. PSCo is the
operating agent under the joint ownership agreement. Each of the respective
owners is responsible for the issuance of its own securities to finance its
portion of the construction costs. For Comanche unit 3, the ownership
percentage for Xcel Energy decreased in May 2006 from 74.7 percent to 66.7
percent for the project life-to-date and going forward.

Nuclear Plant Operation

—
The NMC is an operating company that manages the operations, maintenance and
physical security of several nuclear generating units, including three
units/two sites owned by NSP-Minnesota. NSP-Minnesota continues to own the
plants, controls all energy produced by the plants and retains responsibility
for nuclear property, liability insurance, spent fuel and decommissioning costs.

As of Dec. 31, 2006, all members of
the NMC, other than Xcel Energy, have chosen to sell their units and exit the
NMC. Regarding the remaining members of the NMC, the sales transaction of CMS
Energy Corp Palisades Nuclear Power Plant is targeted to close in the first
quarter of 2007. In December 2006, Wisconsin Electric Power Co., announced
its intent to

sell its Point
Beach Nuclear Plant to FPL Energy with the sale expected to close in the
third or fourth quarter of 2007.

Following
consummation of the sale transactions, NSP-Minnesota will be the sole remaining
member of the NMC. NSP-Minnesota is evaluating the situation. One option under
consideration is to transition the NMC to a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel
Energy. To facilitate implementation of this option, Xcel Energy plans are
progressing to restructure the

F-16

NMC to support
a two-site organization, as well as reabsorb the administrative functions
within Xcel Energy by the end of 2007

In accordance with the Nuclear Power Plant Operating Services
Agreement, NSP-Minnesota also pays its proportionate share of the operating
expenses and capital improvement costs incurred by NMC. NSP-Minnesota paid the
NMC $292.5 million in 2006, $257.1 million in 2005 and $314.7 million in 2004.

Income
Taxes

Xcel Energy’s
federal net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards are estimated to be
$731 million and $135 million, respectively. A portion of the net operating
loss in the amount of $505.9 million and a portion of the tax credit carry
forward in the amount of $46.1 million are accounted for in discontinued
operations. The carry forward periods expire in 2023 and 2024. Xcel Energy also
has state  net operating loss and tax
credit carry forwards of $1.5 billion and $10 million, respectively. The state
carry forward periods expire between 2014 and 2024. A valuation allowance recorded
in prior years against deferred tax assets for capital loss carry forwards
related to discontinued operations was reduced to zero during 2006 due to
capital gains. The valuation allowance was $44 million as of Dec. 31,
2005.

Total income tax expense from continuing
operations differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal
income tax rate to income before income tax expense. The following is a table

Xcel Energy
has common stock equivalents consisting of convertible senior notes, 401(k) equity
awards, restricted stock units and stock options, as discussed later.

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, Xcel Energy had
approximately 11.0 million, 13.3 million and 14.3 million options outstanding,
respectively, that were antidilutive and, therefore, excluded from the earnings
per share calculation. The dilutive impact of common stock equivalents affected

Stock-Based Compensation

—

Xcel Energy
has incentive compensation plans under which stock options and other
performance incentives are awarded to key employees. The weighted average
number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate
Xcel Energy’s earnings per share include the dilutive effect of stock options
and other stock awards based on the treasury stock method. The options normally
have a term of 10 years and generally become exercisable from three to five
years after grant date or upon specified circumstances.

Certain
employees also may elect to receive shares of common or restricted stock under
the Xcel Energy Inc. Executive Annual Incentive Award Plan. Restricted stock
vests in equal annual installments over a three-year period from the date of
grant. Xcel Energy reinvests dividends on the restricted stock it holds while
restrictions are in place. Restrictions also apply to the additional shares of
restricted stock acquired through dividend reinvestment. Restricted stock has a
value equal to the market-trading price of Xcel Energy’s stock at the grant
date. Xcel Energy granted 10,481 shares of restricted stock in 2006 when the
grant-date market price was $19.10. Xcel Energy granted 28,626 shares of
restricted stock in 2005 when the grant-date market price was $17.81. Xcel
Energy granted 65,090 shares of restricted stock in 2004 when the grant-date
market price was $17.40. Compensation expense related to these awards was not
material.

On March 28,
2003, Xcel Energy’s board of directors granted restricted stock units and
performance shares under the Xcel Energy Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan approved
by the shareholders in 2000. Restrictions on the restricted stock units lapse
upon the achievement of a 27-percent total shareholder return (TSR) for
10 consecutive business days and other criteria relating to Xcel Energy’s
common equity ratio. Under no circumstances will the restrictions lapse until
one year after the grant date. TSR is measured using the market price per share
of Xcel Energy common stock, which at the grant date was $12.93, plus common
dividends declared after grant date. The performance share award is entirely
dependent on a single measure, the TSR. Xcel Energy’s TSR is measured over a
three-year period. Xcel Energy’s TSR is compared to the TSR of other companies
in the Edison Electric Institute’s Electrics Index. At the end of the
three-year period, potential payouts of the performance shares range from 0
percent to 200 percent, depending on Xcel Energy’s TSR compared to the peer
group. The 2003 performance share award met the TSR as of Dec. 31, 2005. Approximately
0.4 million shares were issued in February 2006 after approximately 0.3
million shares were withheld for tax purposes and $8 million was settled in
cash.

The TSR
related to the restricted stock units was met in the fourth quarter of 2003, and
approximately $31 million of compensation expense was recorded at Dec. 31,
2003. The remaining cost of $10 million related to the 2003 restricted stock
units was recorded in the first quarter of 2004. In January 2004, Xcel
Energy’s board of directors approved the repurchase of up to 2.5 million shares
of common stock to fulfill the requirements of the restricted stock unit
exercise.  On March 29, 2004, the
restrictions lapsed on the restricted stock units, and Xcel Energy issued
approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock after approximately 0.9
million shares were withheld for tax purposes.

On Jan. 2,
2004, Xcel Energy granted 836,186 restricted stock units and performance shares
under the Xcel Energy Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan. The grant-date market price
used to calculate the TSR for this grant is $17.03. On Aug. 2, 2006, the
restrictions lapsed on the restricted stock units, and Xcel Energy issued
approximately 0.4 million shares of common stock after approximately 0.2
million shares were withheld for tax purposes. The 2004 performance share award
met the TSR as of Dec. 31, 2006 and will be settled in shares and cash in February 2007.

On Jan. 1,
2005, Xcel Energy granted 519,362 restricted stock units and 323,889
performance shares under the Xcel Energy Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan. Payout of
the units and the lapsing of restrictions on the transfer of units are based on
two separate performance criteria. A portion of the awarded units plus
associated earned dividend equivalents will be settled, and the restricted
period will lapse after Xcel Energy achieves a specified earnings per share
growth (adjusted for corporate-owned life insurance) measured against year-end
earnings per share (adjusted for corporate-owned life insurance). Additionally,
Xcel Energy’s annual dividend paid on its common stock must remain at $0.83 per
share or greater. Earnings per share growth will be measured annually at the
end of each fiscal year. However, in no event will the restrictions lapse

F-


prior to two
years after the date of grant. The remaining awarded units plus associated
earned dividend equivalents will be settled, and the restricted period will
lapse after the average of actual performance results (adjusted for actual MW
hours) for the three components of an environmental index measured as a
percentage of target performance meets or exceeds 100 percent. The
environmental index will be measured annually at the end of each fiscal year.
However, in no event will the restrictions lapse prior to two years after the
date of grant. If the performance criteria have not been met within four years
of the date of grant, all associated units shall be forfeited.  The 2005 environmental restricted stock units
met their target as of Dec. 31, 2006 and will be settled in shares in February 2007.

Xcel Energy granted approximately 542,000 and 653,000 restricted stock
units and performance shares under the Xcel Energy Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan
in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004) — “Share
Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) —

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R related to equity-based
compensation. This statement replaces the original SFAS No. 123 — “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.”

Under SFAS No. 123R, companies are no longer allowed
to account for their share-based payment awards using the intrinsic value
method, which did not require any expense to be recorded on stock options
granted with an equal to or greater than fair market value exercise price.
Instead, equity-based compensation arrangements will be measured and recognized
based on the grant-date fair value using an option-pricing model (such as
Black-Scholes or Binomial) that considers at least six factors identified in
SFAS No. 123R. An expense related to the difference between the grant-date
fair value and the purchase price would be recognized over the vesting period
of the options. Under previous guidance, companies were allowed to initially
estimate forfeitures or recognize them as they actually occurred. SFAS No. 123R
requires companies to estimate forfeitures on the date of grant and to adjust
that estimate when information becomes available that suggests actual
forfeitures will differ from previous estimates. Revisions to forfeiture
estimates will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
estimate in the period in which the revision occurs.

Previous
accounting guidance allowed for compensation expense related to share-based
payment awards to be reversed if the target was not met. However, under SFAS No. 123R,
compensation expense for share-based payment awards that expire unexercised due
to the company’s failure to reach a certain target stock price cannot be
reversed. Any accruals made for Xcel Energy’s restricted stock unit award that
was granted in 2004 and is based on a total shareholder return (TSR) cannot be
reversed if the target is not met. As required, Xcel Energy adopted the
provisions in the first quarter of 2006 using the modified prospective
application. Since stock options had vested and other awards were recorded at
their fair values prior to implementation of SFAS No. 123R, implementation
did not have a material impact on net income or earnings per share. Pro forma
net income under SFAS No. 123R for the quarter and twelve months ended Dec. 31,
2006 would not have been materially different than what was recorded.

Since the
vesting of the 2004 restricted stock units is predicated on the achievement of
a market condition, the achievement of a TSR, the fair value used to calculate
the expense related to this award is based on the stock price on the date of
grant adjusted for the uncertainty surrounding the achievement of the TSR.
Since the vesting of the 2005 and 2006 restricted stock units is predicated on
the achievement of a performance condition, the achievement of an earnings per
share or environmental measures target, fair values used to calculate the
expense on these plans are based on the amount of the award calculated as a
percentage of salaries and approved by Xcel Energy’s board of directors. The performance
share plan awards have been historically settled partially in cash and
therefore do not qualify as an equity award, but are accounted for as a
liability award. As a liability award, the fair value on which expense is based
is remeasured each period based on the current stock price, and final expense
is based on the market value of the shares on the date the award is settled. Compensation
expense related to share-based awards of approximately $47 million and $33
million was recorded in 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of Dec. 31, 2006,
there was approximately $19 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to non-vested share-based compensation awards. Total unrecognized
compensation expense will be adjusted for future changes in estimated
forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted-average period of
1.7 years. The amount of cash used to settle these awards was $11 million and
$4 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively.

F-


Prior to 2006, Xcel Energy applied Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 — “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” in accounting for stock-based compensation and, accordingly, no
compensation cost was recognized for the issuance of stock options, as the
exercise price of the options equaled the fair-market value of Xcel Energy’s
common stock at the date of grant. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148 —
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure,”
amending SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation, and requiring disclosure in both annual and interim
Consolidated Financial Statements about the method used and the effect of the
method used on results. The pro forma impact of applying SFAS No. 148 was
as follows at Dec. 31:

Dividend and Other Capital-Related
Restrictions —

The Articles of
Incorporation of Xcel Energy place restrictions on the amount of common stock
dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding. Under the provisions,
dividend payments may be restricted if Xcel Energy’s capitalization ratio (on a
holding company basis only and not on a consolidated basis) is less than 25
percent. For these purposes, the capitalization ratio is equal to (i) common
stock plus surplus divided by (ii) the sum of common stock plus surplus
plus long-term debt. Based on this definition, the capitalization ratio at Dec. 31,
2006, was 81 percent. Therefore, the restrictions do not place any effective
limit on Xcel Energy’s ability to pay dividends because the restrictions are
only triggered when the capitalization ratio is less than 25 percent or will be
reduced to less than 25 percent through dividends (other than dividends payable
in common stock), distributions or acquisitions of Xcel Energy common stock.

In addition,
NSP-Minnesota’s first mortgage indenture places certain restrictions on the
amount of cash dividends it can pay to Xcel Energy, the holder of its common
stock. Even with these restrictions, NSP-Minnesota could have paid more than
$905 million in additional cash dividends on common stock at Dec. 31,
2006.

The issuance
of securities by Xcel Energy generally is not subject to regulatory approval. However,
utility financings and certain intra-system financings are subject to the
jurisdiction of the applicable state regulatory commissions and/or the FERC
under the Federal Power Act. PSCo currently has authorization to issue up to
$1.2 billion of long-term debt and $800 million of short-term debt. SPS will
seek authority for long-term debt as needed. SPS currently has authorization to
issue up to $250 million in short-term debt. NSP-Wisconsin currently has
authorization to issue up to $125 million of long-term debt and $75 million of
short-term debt. NSP-Minnesota has authorization to issue long-term securities
provided the equity ratio remain between 45.99 percent and 56.21 percent and to
issue short-term debt provided it does not exceed 15 percent of total
capitalization. Total capitalization for NSP-Minnesota cannot exceed $5.5
billion. Xcel Energy believes these authorizations are adequate and will seek
additional authorization when necessary, however, there can be no assurance
that additional authorization will be granted on the timeframe or in the
amounts requested.

The FERC has granted a blanket authorization for certain intra-system
financings involving holding companies. In addition, Xcel Energy’s utility
subsidiaries have received FERC authorization through June 30, 2008 to
engage in

F-


intra-system financings, including through the money pool, in
amounts ranging from $250 million for each of NSP-Minnesota and PSCo, to $100
million for SPS and $75 million for NSP-Wisconsin.

Stockholder
Protection Rights Agreement

—

In June 2001,
Xcel Energy adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement. Each share of
Xcel Energy’s common stock includes one shareholder protection right. Under the
agreement’s principal provision, if any person or group acquires 15 percent or
more of Xcel Energy’s outstanding common stock, all other shareholders of Xcel
Energy would be entitled to buy, for the exercise price of $95 per right,
common stock of Xcel Energy having a market value equal to twice the exercise
price, thereby substantially diluting the acquiring person’s or group’s
investment. The rights may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that
acquires 15 percent or more of Xcel Energy’s common stock. The rights should
not interfere with a transaction that is in the best interests of Xcel Energy
and its shareholders because the rights can be redeemed prior to a triggering
event for $0.01 per right.

Benefit
Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

Xcel Energy offers various benefit plans to its benefit employees.
Approximately 56 percent of benefiting employees are represented by several
local labor unions under several collective-bargaining agreements. At Dec. 31,
2006, NSP-Minnesota had 2,094 and NSP-Wisconsin had 409 bargaining employees
covered under a collective-bargaining agreement, which expires at the end of
2007. PSCo had 2,165 bargaining employees covered under a collective-bargaining
agreement, which expires in May 2009. SPS had 733 bargaining employees
covered under a collective-bargaining agreement, which expires in October 2008.

“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
88, 106, and 132(R)” (SFAS No. 158)

— In September
2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, which requires companies to fully
recognize the funded status of each pension and other postretirement benefit
plan as a liability or asset on their balance sheets with all unrecognized
amounts to be recorded in other comprehensive income.  The following table shows the impact of the
implementation on the consolidated statement of financial position.  Xcel Energy applied regulatory accounting
treatment, which allowed recognition of this item as a regulatory asset or
liability rather than as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income, as
future costs are expected to be included in rates.  The table reflects the deferral of these
amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities. 
This table also includes noncontributory, defined benefit supplemental
retirement income plans.

Pension Benefits

Xcel Energy
has several noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans that cover almost
all employees. Benefits are based on a combination of years of service, the
employee’s average pay and Social Security benefits.

Xcel Energy’s policy is to fully fund into an external trust the
actuarially determined pension costs recognized for ratemaking and financial
reporting purposes, subject to the limitations of applicable employee benefit
and tax laws.

Pension Plan Assets

—

Plan assets
principally consist of the common stock of public companies, corporate bonds
and U.S. government securities. The target range for our pension asset
allocation is 60 percent in equity investments, 20 percent in fixed income
investments and 20 percent in nontraditional investments, such as real estate,
private equity and a diversified commodities index.

F-


The actual composition of pension plan assets
at Dec. 31 was:



Equity

%

  securities



Real estate



Cash



Nontraditional
  investments




%


%

Xcel Energy bases its investment-return assumption on expected
long-term performance for each of the investment types included in its pension
asset portfolio. Xcel Energy considers the actual historical returns achieved
by its asset portfolio over the past 20-year or longer period, as well as
the long-term return levels projected and recommended by investment experts.
The historical weighted average annual return for the past 20 years for the
Xcel Energy portfolio of pension investments is 11.3 percent, which is greater
than the current assumption level. The pension cost determination assumes the
continued current mix of investment types over the long term. The Xcel Energy
portfolio is heavily weighted toward equity securities and includes
nontraditional investments that can provide a higher-than-average return. A
higher weighting in equity investments can increase the volatility in the
return levels achieved by pension assets in any year. Investment returns in
2006, 2005 and 2004 exceeded the assumed level of 8.75, 8.75 and 9.0 percent,
respectively. Xcel Energy continually reviews its pension assumptions. In 2007,
Xcel Energy will continue to use an investment-return assumption of 8.75 percent.

During 2002,
one of Xcel Energy’s pension plans became underfunded, and at Dec. 31,
2006, had projected benefit obligations of $728.1 million, which exceeded plan
assets of $658.2 million. At Dec. 31, 2005, the projected benefit
obligations of $739.5 million, exceeded plan assets of $609.8 million. All
other Xcel Energy plans in the aggregate had plan assets of $2.5 billion and
projected benefit obligations of $1.9 billion on Dec. 31, 2006.

Cash Flows —

Cash funding requirements can be impacted
by changes to actuarial assumptions, actual asset levels and other calculations
prescribed by the funding requirements of income tax and other pension-related
regulations. These regulations did not require cash funding in the years 2003
through 2006 for Xcel Energy’s pension plans, and are not expected to require
cash funding in 2007. PSCo elected to make voluntary contributions to its
pension plan for bargaining employees of $29 million, $15 million and $10
million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, Xcel Energy
voluntarily contributed $2 million and $5 million to the NCE non-bargaining
plan in 2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2007, Xcel Energy expects to
voluntarily contribute approximately $20 million to the PSCo pension plan for
bargaining employees and approximately $8 million to the NCE non-bargaining
plan.

Plan Changes —

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA)
was reflected effective December 31, 2006. PPA requires a change in the
conversion basis for lump-sum payments, three-year vesting for plans with
account balance or pension equity

F-


benefits, as well as the repeal of the

Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation
Act of 2001 sunset provisions. These changes are reflected as a plan amendment
for purposes of SFAS No. 87.

Pension costs
include an expected return impact for the current year that may differ from
actual investment performance in the plan. The return assumption used for 2007
pension cost calculations will be 8.75 percent. The cost calculation uses a
market-related valuation of pension assets, which reduces year-to-year
volatility by recognizing the differences between assumed and actual investment
returns over a five-year period.

Xcel Energy also maintains noncontributory, defined benefit
supplemental retirement income plans for certain qualifying executive
personnel. Benefits for these unfunded plans are paid out of Xcel Energy’s
operating cash flows.

Defined Contribution Plans

Xcel Energy maintains 401(k) and other defined contribution plans
that cover substantially all employees. Total contributions to these plans were
approximately $18.3 million in 2006, $19.6 million in 2005 and $21.9 million in
2004.

Postretirement Health Care Benefits

Xcel Energy
has a contributory health and welfare benefit plan that provides health care
and death benefits to most Xcel Energy retirees. The former NSP discontinued
contributing toward health care benefits for nonbargaining employees retiring
after 1998 and for bargaining employees of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin who
retired after 1999. Xcel Energy discontinued contributing toward health care
benefits for former NCE nonbargaining employees retiring after June 30,
2003. Employees of NCE who retired in 2002 continue to receive
employer-subsidized health care benefits. Nonbargaining employees of the former
NSP who retired after 1998, bargaining employees of the former NSP who retired
after 1999 and nonbargaining employees of NCE who retired after June 30,
2003, are eligible to participate in the Xcel Energy health care program with
no employer subsidy.

In conjunction
with the 1993 adoption of SFAS No. 106 — “Employers’ Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension,” Xcel Energy elected to amortize
the unrecognized accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) on a
straight-line basis over 20 years.

Regulatory agencies for nearly all of Xcel Energy’s retail and
wholesale utility customers have allowed rate recovery of accrued benefit costs
under SFAS No. 106. The Colorado jurisdictional SFAS No. 106 costs
deferred during the transition period are being amortized to expense on a
straight-line basis over the 15-year period from 1998 to 2012. NSP-Minnesota
also transitioned to full accrual accounting for SFAS No. 106 costs, with
regulatory differences fully amortized prior to 1997.

F-


Plan
Assets —

Certain state agencies that
regulate Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries also have issued guidelines related
to the funding of SFAS No. 106 costs. SPS is required to fund SFAS
No. 106 costs for Texas and New Mexico jurisdictional amounts collected in
rates, and PSCo is required to fund SFAS No. 106 costs in irrevocable
external trusts that are dedicated to the payment of these postretirement
benefits. In 2004, the investment strategy for the union asset fund was changed
to increase the investment mix in equity funds. Also, a portion of the assets
contributed on behalf of nonbargaining retirees has been funded into a
sub-account of the Xcel Energy pension plans. These assets are invested in a
manner consistent with the investment strategy for the pension plan.

The actual composition of postretirement
benefit plan assets at Dec. 31 was:



Equity and
  equity mutual fund securities


%


%

Fixed
  income/debt securities



Cash
  equivalents



Nontraditional
  Investments




%


%

Xcel Energy bases its investment-return assumption for the
postretirement health care fund assets on expected long-term performance for
each of the investment types included in its postretirement health care asset
portfolio. Investment-return volatility is not considered to be a material
factor in postretirement health care costs.

Effective Dec. 31,

to 9.0 percent and lowered the ultimate trend assumption from 5.5 percent to
5.0 percent. The period until the ultimate rate is reached also was increased
from two years to six years. Xcel Energy bases its medical trend assumption on
the long-term cost inflation expected in the health care market, considering
the levels projected and recommended by industry experts, as well as recent
actual medical cost increases experienced by Xcel Energy’s retiree medical
plan.

11.   Derivative
Instruments

In the normal
course of business, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to a variety
of market risks. Market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result
of changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity.
Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries utilize, in accordance with approved risk
management policies, a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate market
risk and to enhance our operations. The use of these derivative instruments is
discussed in further detail below.

Utility Commodity Price Risk —

Xcel
Energy’s utility subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their
electric and natural gas operations. Commodity price risk is managed by
entering into both long- and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts
for electric capacity, energy and other energy-related products, and for
various fuels used for generation of electricity and in the natural gas utility
operations. Commodity risk also is managed through the use of financial
derivative instruments. Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries utilize these
derivative instruments to reduce the volatility in the cost of commodities
acquired on behalf of our retail customers even though regulatory jurisdiction
may provide for a dollar-for-dollar recovery of actual costs. In
these instances, the use of derivative instruments is done consistently with
the state regulatory cost-recovery mechanism. Xcel Energy’s risk-management
policy allows it to manage market price risk within each rate-regulated
operation to the extent such exposure exists, as allowed by regulations.

Short-Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading
Risk —

Xcel Energy’s utility
subsidiaries conduct various short-term wholesale and commodity trading
activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy and
other energy-related instruments. Xcel Energy’s risk-management policy
allows management to conduct the marketing activity within guidelines and
limitations as approved by our risk-management committee, which is made up of
management personnel not directly involved in the activities governed by this
policy.

Interest Rate
Risk —

Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the
normal course of business. Xcel Energy’s risk-management policy allows interest
rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed-rate debt, floating-rate debt
and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or call
options.

Types of and Accounting for Derivative
Instruments

Xcel Energy
and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments in connection with its utility
commodity price, interest rate, short-term wholesale and commodity trading
activities, including forward contracts, futures, swaps and options. All

F-


derivative
instruments not qualifying for the normal purchases and normal sales exception,
as defined by SFAS No. 133, are recorded at fair value. The classification
of the fair value for these derivative instruments is dependent on the
designation of a qualifying hedging relationship. The adjustment to fair value
of derivative instruments not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship
is reflected in current earnings or as a regulatory balance. This
classification is dependent on the applicability of specific regulation. This
includes certain instruments used to mitigate market risk for the utility
operations and all instruments related to the commodity trading operations. The
designation of a cash flow hedge permits the classification of fair value to be
recorded within Other Comprehensive Income, to the extent effective. The
designation of a fair value hedge permits a derivative instrument’s gains or
losses to offset the related results of the hedged item in the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

SFAS No. 133
requires that the hedging relationship be highly effective and that a company
formally designate a hedging relationship to apply hedge accounting. Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries formally document hedging relationships, including,
among other factors, the identification of the hedging instrument and the
hedged transaction, as well as the risk-management objectives and
strategies for undertaking the hedged transaction. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries
also formally assess, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, if required,
whether the derivative instruments being used are highly effective in
offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged items.

Gains or
losses on hedging transactions for the sales of energy or energy-related
products are primarily recorded as a component of revenue; hedging transactions
for fuel used in energy generation are recorded as a component of fuel costs;
hedging transactions for natural gas purchased for resale are recorded as a
component of natural gas costs; and interest rate hedging transactions are
recorded as a component of interest expense. Certain utility subsidiaries are
allowed to recover in electric or natural gas rates the costs of certain
financial instruments purchased to reduce commodity cost volatility.

Qualifying hedging relationships are designated as either a hedge of a
forecasted transaction or future cash flow (cash flow hedge), or a hedge of a
recognized asset, liability or firm commitment (fair value hedge). The types of
qualifying hedging transactions that Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are
currently engaged in are discussed below.

Cash Flow Hedges

The effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument
qualifying as a cash flow hedge is recorded as a component of Other
Comprehensive Income or deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, and
reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative
instrument’s change in fair value is recognized in current earnings.

Commodity Cash Flow Hedges —

Xcel
Energy’s utility subsidiaries enter into derivative instruments to manage
variability of future cash flows from changes in commodity prices. These
derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting
purposes. At Dec. 31, 2006, Xcel Energy had various commodity-related
contracts classified as cash flow hedges extending through December 2009. The
fair value of these cash flow hedges is recorded in either Other Comprehensive
Income or deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. This classification is
based on the regulatory recovery mechanisms in place. Amounts deferred in these
accounts are recorded in earnings as the hedged purchase or sales transaction
is settled. This could include the purchase or sale of energy or energy-related
products, the use of natural gas to generate electric energy or gas purchased
for resale.

As of Dec. 31,
2006, Xcel Energy had no amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
related to commodity cash flow hedge contracts that are expected to be
recognized in earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged transactions
settle.

Xcel Energy had immaterial ineffectiveness related to commodity cash
flow hedges during the year ended Dec. 31, 2006 and no ineffectiveness
during the year ended Dec. 31, 2005.

Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges —

Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries enter into various instruments that effectively fix
the interest payments on certain floating rate debt obligations or effectively
fix the yield or price on a specified benchmark interest rate for a specific
period. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges for
accounting purposes.

As of Dec. 31,
2006, Xcel Energy had net gains related to interest rate swaps of approximately
$1.1 million in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income that it expects to
recognize in earnings during the next 12 months.

Xcel Energy
and its subsidiaries also enter into interest rate lock agreements, including
treasury-rate locks and forward starting swaps, that effectively fix the yield
or price on a specified treasury security for a specific period. These
derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting
purposes.

F-


As of Dec. 31,
2006, Xcel Energy had net gains related to settled interest rate lock
agreements of approximately $1.4 million in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income that it expects to recognize in earnings during the next 12 months.

Xcel Energy had no ineffectiveness related to interest rate cash flow
hedges during the years ended Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005.

Financial
Impact of Qualifying Cash Flow Hedges —

The
impact of qualifying cash flow hedges on Xcel Energy’s Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income, included in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’
Equity and Comprehensive Income, is detailed in the following table:

Fair Value Hedges

The effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative
instrument qualifying as a fair value hedge is offset against the change in the
fair value of the underlying asset, liability or firm commitment being hedged. That
is, fair value hedge accounting allows the gains or losses of the derivative
instrument to offset, in the same period, the gains and losses of the hedged
item. The ineffective portion of a derivative instrument’s change in fair value
is recognized in current earnings.

Interest Rate
Fair Value Hedges —

Xcel Energy enters
into interest rate swap instruments that effectively hedge the fair value of
fixed-rate debt. The fair market value of Xcel Energy’s interest rate swaps at Dec. 31,
2006, was a liability of approximately $8.3 million.

Normal Purchases or Normal Sales Contracts

Xcel Energy’s
utility subsidiaries enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of
commodities for use in their business operations. SFAS No. 133 requires a
company to evaluate these contracts to determine whether the contracts are
derivatives. Certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative may be
exempted from SFAS No. 133 as normal purchases or normal sales.

Xcel Energy
evaluates all of its contracts when such contracts are entered to determine if
they are derivatives and, if so, if they qualify to meet the normal designation
requirements under SFAS No. 133. None of the contracts entered into within
the commodity trading operations qualify for a normal designation.

In 2003, as a
result of FASB Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. C20, Xcel Energy
began recording several long-term power purchase agreements at fair value due
to accounting requirements related to underlying price adjustments. As these
purchases are recovered through normal regulatory recovery mechanisms in the
respective jurisdictions, the changes in fair value for these contracts were
offset by regulatory assets and liabilities. During the first quarter of 2006,
Xcel Energy qualified these contracts under the normal purchase exception. Based
on this qualification, the contracts are no longer adjusted to fair value and
the previous carrying value of these contracts will be amortized over the
remaining contract lives along with the offsetting regulatory balances.

Normal
purchases and normal sales contracts are accounted for as executory contracts.

The following discussion briefly describes the use of derivative
commodity and financial instruments at Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, and
discloses the respective fair values at Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005.

Commodity
Trading Instruments —

At Dec. 31,
2006 and 2005, the fair value of commodity trading contracts was $(1.2) million
and $3.9 million, respectively.

Hedging
Contracts —

The fair value of
qualifying cash flow hedges at Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17.6 million
and $4.1 million, respectively.

F-


Financial
Instruments —

Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries had interest rate swaps outstanding with a fair value that was a
liability of approximately $20.9 million at Dec. 31, 2006. On Dec. 31,
2005, subsidiaries of Xcel Energy had interest rate swaps outstanding with a
fair value that was a liability of approximately $44.7 million.

accounts payable are not materially different from their carrying amounts. The
fair values of Xcel Energy’s debt securities in an external nuclear
decommissioning fund and other investments are estimated based on quoted market
prices for those or similar investments. The fair values of Xcel Energy’s
long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or
similar issues, or the current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities
and credit quality.

The fair value
estimates presented are based on information available to management as of Dec. 31,
2006 and 2005. These fair value estimates have not been comprehensively
revalued for purposes of these Consolidated Financial Statements since that

Xcel Energy
provides guarantees and bond indemnities supporting certain of its
subsidiaries. The guarantees issued by Xcel Energy guarantee payment or
performance by its subsidiaries under specified agreements or transactions. As
a result, Xcel Energy’s exposure under the guarantees is based upon the net
liability of the relevant subsidiary under the specified agreements or
transactions. Most of the guarantees issued by Xcel Energy limit the exposure
of Xcel Energy to a maximum amount stated in the guarantee. Unless otherwise
indicated below, the guarantees require no liability to be recorded, contain no
recourse provisions and require no collateral.

Matters

NSP-Minnesota

Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings —
FERC

MISO Operations

—

NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin are members of the MISO. The MISO is a FERC-regulated RTO
that provides regional transmission tariff administration services for electric
transmission systems, including those of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin. MISO
also operates a regional wholesale energy market using Locational Marginal
Pricing and financial congestion relief which is also known as a Day 2 market.
NSP-Minnesota recovers most MISO regional market charges through the FCA. NSP-Wisconsin
currently has requested recovery of these costs within its jurisdiction. For
further discussion, see Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings

—

MPUC and
Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings

—

PSCW.

Within MISO, an independent market monitor (IMM) reviews market bids
and prices to identify any unusual activity. Xcel Energy and other market
participants continue to work with MISO, the IMM and the FERC to resolve Day 2
market implementation issues such as dispatch methods and settlement
calculation details.

MISO Long-Term Transmission Pricing

—

In
October 2005, MISO filed a proposed change to its TEMT to regionalize
future cost recovery of certain high voltage (345 KV) transmission projects to
be constructed for reliability improvements. The proposal, called the Regional
Expansion Criteria Benefits phase 1 (RECB I) proposal, would recover 20 percent
of eligible transmission costs from all transmission service customers in the
MISO 15 state region, with 80 percent recovered on a sub-regional basis. The
proposal would exclude certain projects that had been planned prior to the October 2005
filing, and would require new generators to fund 50 percent of the cost of
network upgrades associated with their interconnection. In February 2006,
the FERC generally approved the RECB I proposal, but set the 20 percent
limitation on regionalization for additional proceedings. Various parties filed
requests for rehearing. On Nov. 29, 2006, the FERC issued an order on
rehearing upholding the February 2006 order and approving the 20 percent
limitation. On Dec. 13, 2006, the PSCW filed an appeal of the RECB I
order.

In addition,
in October 2006, MISO filed additional changes to its TEMT to regionalize
future recovery of certain transmission projects (230 KV and above) constructed
for “economic” reasons (e.g., to provide access to lower cost generation
supplies). The filing, known as RECB II, would provide regional recovery of 20
percent of the project costs and sub-regional recovery of 80 percent, based on
a benefits analysis. MISO proposed that the RECB II tariff be effective April 1,
2007. Initial comments were filed at FERC on Dec. 22, 2006. The date FERC
will take initial action is not known.

Transmission
service rates in the MISO region presently use a rate design, in which the
transmission cost depends on the location of the load being served. Costs of
existing transmission facilities are not regionalized. MISO is required to file
a replacement rate methodology in August 2007, to be effective Feb. 1,
2008. It is possible MISO will propose to regionalize the recovery of the costs
of existing transmission facilities. Proposals to regionalize transmission
costs could shift the costs of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin transmission
investments to other MISO transmission service customers, but would also shift
the costs of transmission investments in other parts of MISO to NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin.

MISO/PJM SECA

—

On Nov. 18, 2004, the FERC
issued an order approving portions of a plan providing for continued use of location
based rates for the MISO/PJM region, but rejecting proposed transition payments
to compensate transmission owners for reductions in transmission revenues. The
FERC instead ordered the MISO and PJM to each file a Seams Elimination Charge
Adjustment (SECA) transition mechanism. The replacement compliance filings were
effective Dec. 1, 2004, subject to refund.

The competing SECA compliance proposals were the subject of litigated
hearings at the FERC. Certain parties proposed a regional average SECA charge,
which could shift costs to NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin. On Aug. 10,
2006, the ALJ in the case issued an initial decision recommending that all the
SECA compliance filings be rejected and recommending adoption of a regional SECA,
which could shift approximately $13 million in charges to NSP-Minnesota and
NSP-Wisconsin. Xcel Energy, through the MISO transmission owners, filed
exceptions to the ALJ initial decision, arguing the decision directly violates
the 2004 FERC orders. In addition, the MISO transmission owners have executed
settlements

F-33

with several parties in the litigation. The settlement resolves
specific claims and would limit any regionalization to unresolved claims. Final
FERC action is expected in the SECA litigation in 2007.

Revenue
Sufficiency Guarantee Charges

—

On
April 25, 2006, the FERC issued an order determining that MISO had
incorrectly applied its TEMT regarding the application of the revenue
sufficiency guarantee (RSG) charge to certain transactions. The FERC ordered
MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to April 1, 2005.
The RSG charges are collected from certain MISO customers and paid to others.
Based on the FERC order, NSP-Minnesota could be required to make net payments
to MISO. On Oct. 26, 2006, the FERC issued an order granting rehearing in
part and reversed the prior ruling requiring MISO to issue retroactive refunds
and ordered MISO to implement prospective changes. In late November 2006,
however, certain parties filed further requests for rehearing challenging the
reversal regarding refunds. The date of a final FERC decision is unknown, and
one appeal has been filed. Xcel Energy reserved $6.1 million in response to the
April 25, 2006, FERC order.

NSP-Minnesota Electric Rate Case

—

In November 2005,
NSP-Minnesota requested an electric rate increase of $168 million or 8.05
percent. This increase was based on a requested 11 percent return on common
equity, a projected common equity to total capitalization ratio of 51.7 percent
and a projected electric rate base of $3.2 billion. On Dec. 15, 2005, the
MPUC authorized an interim rate increase of $147 million, subject to refund,
which became effective on Jan. 1, 2006.

On Sept. 1, 2006, the MPUC issued a written order granting an electric
revenue increase of approximately $131 million for 2006 based on an authorized
return on equity of 10.54 percent. The scheduled rate increase will be reduced
in 2007 to $115 million to reflect the return of Flint Hills Resources, a large
industrial customer, to the NSP-Minnesota system. The MPUC approved the
wholesale margin settlement in which NSP-Minnesota returns most margins from
unused generating capacity back to customers through the FCA mechanism. NSP-Minnesota
is allowed to earn an incentive on sales related to ancillary service
obligations. The MPUC Order became effective in November 2006, and final
rates were implemented on February 1, 2007. A citizen intervenor has
appealed the MPUC’s decision.

NSP-Minnesota
Natural Gas Rate Case

—

On Nov. 9,
2006, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with MPUC to increase Minnesota natural gas
rates by $18.5 million annually, which represents an increase of 2.4 percent. The
request was based on 11.0 percent ROE, a projected equity ratio of 51.98
percent and a natural gas rate base of $439 million. Interim rates, subject to
refund, were set at a $15.9 million annual increase and went into effect on Jan. 8,
2007. A final decision is expected in the third quarter of 2007.

North Dakota
Gas Rate Case

—

On
Dec. 15, 2006, NSP-Minnesota filed a notice of rate change with the NDPSC
requesting an increase of natural gas distribution rates of $2.8 million
annually, or 3 percent. In February 2007, the NDPSC approved interim rates
of $2.2 million. Interim rates would remain in effect until the NDPSC makes its
final determination in the summer of 2007. Final natural gas rates will be put
into place after the decision.

Renewable
Transmission Cost Recovery

—

Since
December 2004, NSP-Minnesota has recovered certain transmission costs
related to wind generation projects through a RCR rider. In November 2006,
the MPUC approved the replacement of the RCR rider with a TCR rider pursuant to
2005 legislation. The TCR mechanism would allow recovery of incremental
transmission investments between rate cases. On Oct. 27, 2006,
NSP-Minnesota filed for approval of recovery of $14.8 million in 2007
revenue requirements under the TCR tariff. Final MPUC action is expected later
in the first quarter of 2007. The RCR rate factors will remain in effect until
the TCR factors are implemented.

MISO Day 2 Market Cost Recovery

—

On Dec. 18,
2004, NSP-Minnesota filed with the MPUC a petition to seek recovery of the
Minnesota jurisdictional portion of all net costs associated with the
implementation of the MISO Day 2 market through its FCA. A Dec. 21, 2006
MPUC order ruled that all MISO costs, except Schedule 16 and 17, can be
recovered through the FCA. Schedules 16 and 17 costs were recovered through the
FCA in 2005. However, the MPUC’s Dec. 21, 2006 order requires
NSP-Minnesota to refund these costs to customers through the FCA in equal
monthly installments beginning March 2007. It also provided the
opportunity to defer 100 percent of the 2005 costs for a three-year period
before starting the amortization. A refund liability was recorded for $4.4
million.

In March 2005, NSP-Minnesota filed petitions similar to the December 2004
Minnesota filing with the NDPSC and the SDPUC proposing changes to allow
recovery of the applicable North Dakota and South Dakota jurisdictional
portions of the MISO Day 2 market costs. The SDPUC approved the proposed tariff
changes, effective April 1, 2005, as requested. The NDPSC granted interim
recovery through the FCA beginning April 1, 2005, but conditioned the
relief as being

F-34

subject to refund until the merits of the case are determined. Since April 1,
2005, NSP-Minnesota has collected approximately $28 million of MISO Day 2
charges through its North Dakota FCA.

NSP-Wisconsin

Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings —
FERC

Wholesale Rate
Case Application

—

On July 31,
2006, NSP-Wisconsin filed a rate case at the FERC requesting a base rate
increase of approximately $4 million, or 15 percent, for its ten wholesale
municipal electric sales customers. NSP-Wisconsin’s wholesale customers are
currently served under a bundled full requirements tariff, with rates based on
embedded costs, and a monthly fuel
cost adjustment clause (FCAC).
NSP-Wisconsin proposes to unbundle transmission service and revise the
FCAC to reflect current FERC regulatory policies, the advent of MISO operations
and the MISO Day 2 energy market. In August 2006, ten customers filed a
joint protest of the rate case, requesting the increase be suspended until March 1,
2007 and the request be set for litigated hearings. On Sept. 28, 2006, the FERC
issued an order accepting the filing, suspending the effective date of the
rates to March 1, 2007, and setting the filing for hearing and settlement
judge procedures. In February 2007, NSP-Wisconsin reached a settlement
with customers that provides for full cost recovery of MISO Day 2 and renewable
energy costs through the FCA and a $2.4 million base rate increase.

MISO Cost Recovery

—

On
March 29, 2005, NSP-Wisconsin received an order from the PSCW granting its
request to defer the costs and benefits attributable to the start-up of the
MISO Day 2 energy market.

On June 16,
2006, the PSCW issued its written order regarding the joint request for escrow
accounting treatment of MISO Day 2 costs made by NSP-Wisconsin and other
Wisconsin utilities. The order confirms continued deferred accounting treatment
for congestion costs, net line losses, and costs of acquiring FTRs not received
in the MISO allocation process, as previously authorized by the PSCW. The order
also clarifies that deferral is authorized for several additional MISO Day 2
cost and revenue types not explicitly addressed in the original PSCW order
issued March 29, 2005.

On June 29,
2006, the PSCW opened a proceeding to address the proper amount of MISO Day 2
deferrals that the state’s utilities should be allowed to recover and the
proper method of rate recovery.

On Sept. 1,
2006, NSP-Wisconsin detailed its calculation methodology and reported that, as
of June 30, 2006, it had deferred approximately $6.2 million. PSCW staff
and intervenors filed testimony in December 2006, arguing that the various
methodologies used by the utilities to calculate the deferrals were
inconsistent, and to varying degrees incorrect. Further, the testimony argued
that some or all of the deferred costs are being recovered in current rates and
were, therefore, inappropriately deferred and the utilities should be required
to write off balances that were inappropriately deferred. The potential impact
of PSCW Staff recommendations on NSP-Wisconsin is unknown at this time but
could be material. NSP-Wisconsin currently anticipates that the ultimate
decision on the amount of costs to be recovered in rates could be delayed until
its next general rate case to be filed on June 1, 2007.

As of Dec. 31, 2006 NSP-Wisconsin has deferred a total of
approximately $11.2 million of MISO Day 2 costs.

2006 General
Rate Case

—

In 2005, NSP-Wisconsin, requested an electric
revenue increase of $58.3 million and a natural gas revenue increase of $8.1
million, based on a 2006 test year, an 11.9 percent return on equity and a common
equity ratio of 56.32 percent. On Jan. 5, 2006, the PSCW approved an
electric revenue increase of $43.4 million and a natural gas revenue increase
of $3.9 million, based on an 11.0 percent return on equity and a 54-percent
common equity ratio target. The new rates were effective Jan. 9, 2006. The
order also prohibits NSP-Wisconsin from paying dividends above $42.7 million,
if its actual calendar year average common equity ratio is or will fall below
54.03 percent. It also imposes an asymmetrical electric fuel clause bandwidth
of positive 2 percent to negative 0.5 percent outside of which NSP-Wisconsin
would be permitted to request or be required to change rates.

2006 Fuel Cost
Recovery

—

Fuel costs for the Wisconsin
retail jurisdiction in 2006 were $14.4 million, or 9.7 percent lower than the
fuel-related component of base electric rates authorized in the 2006 general
rate case. Under the provisions of the Wisconsin Fuel Rules and a May 4,
2006 order from the PSCW, NSP-Wisconsin is required to refund, with interest,
that portion of the over-recovery that occurred subsequent to the May 4
order. Accordingly, NSP-Wisconsin established a $10.1 million fuel refund
provision during 2006. On Jan. 30, 2007, NSP-Wisconsin filed its 2006
year-end fuel cost recovery report and a proposed refund plan with the PSCW. On
Feb. 8, 2007, the PSCW approved the refund and NSP-Wisconsin began
crediting customers Feb. 15, 2007.

F-35

2007 Fuel Cost
Recovery

—

On Aug. 4, 2006,
NSP-Wisconsin filed an application to reset the 2007 fuel base and monitoring
range, and to increase electric base rates for 2007 by $22.7 million, or 5.0
percent, on an annual basis. The requested increase was driven primarily by
higher renewable energy purchases and increases in coal commodity and
transportation costs. On Dec. 22, 2006 the PSCW issued an order approving
an electric rate increase of $13.8 million, reflecting decreases in natural gas
and purchased power costs on an annual basis, and authorized the return to a
symmetrical fuel clause bandwidth of plus or minus 2 percent. New rates became
effective Jan. 1, 2007.

Fuel Cost
Recovery Rulemaking

—

On June 22,
2006, the PSCW opened a rulemaking docket to address potential revisions to the
electric fuel cost recovery rules. Wisconsin statutes prohibit the use of
automatic adjustment clauses by large investor-owned electric public utilities.
Instead, the statutes authorize the PSCW to approve, after a hearing, a rate
increase for these utilities to allow for the recovery of costs caused by an
emergency or extraordinary increase in the cost of fuel. In opening this
rulemaking, the PSCW recognized the increased volatility of fuel costs, citing
events such as the implementation of the MISO Day 2 Market, increased demand on
some fuels, increased transportation costs of some fuels, and the effects of
hurricanes on the availability of some fuels. On Sept. 7, 2006, Wisconsin’s
large investor-owned utilities, including NSP-Wisconsin, jointly filed proposed
revisions to the rules. The utilities’ proposal incorporates a plan year
forecast and an after-the-fact reconciliation to eliminate regulatory lag, and
ensure recovery of prudently incurred costs. On Nov. 3, 2006, a coalition
of customer and intervenor groups submitted a counter proposal that included
only minor revisions to the existing rules. At this time it is not certain
what, if any, changes to the existing rules will be recommended by the
PSCW.

PSCo

Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings —
CPUC

Electric Rate Case

—

In April 2006,
PSCo filed with the CPUC to increase electricity rates by $208 million
annually, beginning Jan. 1, 2007. The request was based on two components,
including an increase in base rate revenues of $178 million and an
estimated $30 million increase in PCCA revenue. The base rate request was based
on a return on equity of 11 percent, an equity ratio of 59.9 percent and an
electric rate base of $3.4 billion. No interim rate increase was implemented. The
PCCA request was based on 2007 projected costs.

On Oct. 20, 2006, PSCo entered into a comprehensive settlement
agreement with several of the parties to the case. On Nov. 20, 2006, the
CPUC issued a written order approving the settlement with new rates effective Jan. 1,
2007. The settlement provides for an increase in base rates of $107 million,
based on a 10.50 percent return on equity, an estimated $39.4 million in PCCA
revenue and an estimated $4.6 million in ECA revenue to recover certain
WindSource program costs for a total increase of $151 million. In addition,
PSCo is permitted an incentive for its performance on achieving fuel and
purchased energy savings as well as for its generation based wholesale margins.

Natural Gas
Rate Case

—

On Dec. 1, 2006, PSCo filed with the CPUC
a request to increase natural gas rates that would increase annual revenues by
$41.5 million, representing an overall increase of 2.96 percent. The request is
based on a requested capital structure of 60.17 percent common equity, a return
on common equity of 11 percent and a rate base of approximately $1.1 billion. It
is anticipated that new rates will become effective in the third quarter of
2007.

Quality of
Service Plan

—

The
PSCo QSP provides for bill credits to Colorado retail customers, if PSCo does
not achieve certain operational performance targets. During the second quarter
of 2006, PSCo filed its calendar year 2005 operating performance results for
electric service unavailability, phone response time, customer complaints,
accurate meter reading and natural gas leak repair time measures. PSCo did not
achieve the 2005 performance targets for the electric service unavailability
measure creating a bill credit obligation of $13.6 million. Additionally, in
accordance with a prior agreement, PSCo invested an additional $11 million in
2006 toward improving reliability. As a result, PSCo will not be required to
pay any bill credits that may be owed for 2006 performance results for electric
service unavailability. The maximum potential bill credit obligation for 2006
related to permanent natural gas leak repair and natural gas meter reading
errors is approximately $1.6 million. PSCo does not anticipate any bill credits
will be due customers based on the 2006 performance targets.

SPS

Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings —
FERC

Wholesale Rate Complaints

—

In November 2004, Golden
Spread Electric, Lyntegar Electric, Farmer’s Electric, Lea County Electric,
Central Valley Electric and Roosevelt County Electric, wholesale cooperative
customers of SPS, filed a rate

F-36

complaint at the FERC.

The complaint alleged that SPS’ rates for
wholesale service were excessive and that SPS had incorrectly calculated
monthly fuel cost adjustments using the FCAC provisions contained in SPS’
wholesale rate schedules. Among other things, the complainants asserted that
SPS was not properly calculating the fuel costs that are eligible for FCAC
recovery to reflect fuel costs recovered from certain wholesale sales to other
utilities, and that SPS had inappropriately allocated average fuel and
purchased power costs to other of SPS’ wholesale customers, effectively raising
the fuel costs charges to complainants. Cap Rock Energy Corporation (Cap Rock),
another full-requirements customer, Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM)
and Occidental Permian Ltd. and Occidental Power Marketing, L.P. (Occidental)
intervened in the proceeding.

On May 24,
2006, a FERC ALJ issued an initial recommended decision in the proceeding. The
FERC will review the initial recommendation and issue a final order. SPS and
others have filed exceptions to the ALJ’s initial recommendation. FERC’s order
may or may not follow any of the ALJ’s recommendation. In the recommended
decision, the ALJ found that SPS should recalculate its FCAC billings for the
period beginning Jan. 1, 1999, to reduce the fuel and purchased power
costs recovered from the complaining customers by allocating incremental fuel
costs incurred by SPS in making wholesale sales of system firm capacity and
associated energy to other firm customers at market-based rates during this
period based on the view that such sales should be treated as opportunity
sales.

SPS believes
the ALJ erred on significant and material issues that contradict FERC policy or
rules of law. Specifically, SPS believes, based on FERC rules and
precedent, that it has appropriately applied its FCAC tariff to the proper
classes of customers. These market-based sales were of a long-term duration
under FERC precedent and were made from SPS’ entire system. Accordingly, SPS
believes that the ALJ erred in concluding that these transactions were
opportunity sales, which require the assignment of incremental costs.

The FERC has
approved system average cost allocation treatment in previous filings by SPS
for sales having similar service characteristics and previously accepted for
filing certain of the challenged agreements with average fuel cost pricing.

Moreover, SPS
believes that the ALJ’s recommendation constituted a violation of the Filed
Rate Doctrine in that it effectively results in a retroactive amendment to the
SPS FERC-approved FCAC tariff provisions. Under existing regulations, the FERC
may modify a previously approved FCAC on a prospective basis. Accordingly, SPS
believes it has applied its FCAC correctly and has sought review of the
recommended decision by the FERC by filing a brief on the exceptions.

SPS has
evaluated all sales made from Jan. 1, 1999, to Dec. 31, 2005. While
SPS believes it should ultimately prevail in this proceeding, SPS has accrued
approximately $7 million, related to both the base-rate and fuel items. However,
if the FERC were to adopt the majority of the ALJ’s recommendations, SPS’
refund exposure could be approximately $50 million. FERC action is pending.

On Sept. 15, 2005, PNM filed a separate complaint at the FERC in which
it contended that its demand charge under an existing interruptible power
supply contract with SPS is excessive and that SPS has overcharged PNM for fuel
costs under three separate agreements through erroneous FCAC calculations. PNM’s
arguments were consistent with those that it made as an intervenor in the
cooperatives’ complaint case. In July 2006, SPS and PNM reached a
settlement in principle and a settlement agreement was filed for approval on
Sept. 19, 2006. As a consequence, SPS has accrued approximately $1.3 million
to settle all related base rate issues for this complaint. Several intervenors
have protested the settlement. The settlement is pending.

Wholesale
Power Base Rate Application

—

On Dec. 1, 2005, SPS filed
for a $2.5 million increase in wholesale power rates to certain electric
cooperatives. On Jan. 31, 2006, the FERC conditionally accepted the
proposed rates for filing, and the $2.5 million power rate increase became
effective on July 1, 2006, subject to refund. The FERC also set the rate
increase request for hearing and settlement judge procedures. The case is
presently in the settlement judge procedures and an agreement in principle has
been reached for base rates for the full-requirements customers and PNM. One
other wholesale customer has not settled, however. On Sept. 7, 2006, the offer
of settlement with respect to the full-requirements customer was filed for
approval and on Sept. 19, 2006, the offer of settlement with respect to PNM was
filed for approval. Hearings have been scheduled for April 2007 for the
base rates applicable to the remaining non-settling wholesale customer.

SPP Energy
Imbalance Service

—

On June 15,
2005, SPP, the RTO for the SPS system, filed proposed tariff provisions to
establish an Energy Imbalance Service (EIS) wholesale energy market for the SPP
region. This market is the first step in a phased approach toward the
development of a more comprehensive regional energy market, which is expected
to eventually include an ancillary services component and perhaps financial
congestion costs known as FTRs. SPP implemented the EIS

F-37

market Feb. 1, 2007. Xcel Energy and other market participants are
working with the SPP to resolve implementation issues related to the new
market.

Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings —
PUCT

Fuel Cost
Recovery Mechanisms

—

Fuel and
purchased energy costs are recovered in Texas through a fixed-fuel and
purchased energy recovery factor, which is part of SPS’ retail electric rates.
The Texas retail fuel factors change each November and May based on
the projected cost of natural gas. If it appears SPS will materially
over-recover or under-recover these costs, the factor may be revised based on
application by SPS or action by the PUCT.

Texas Retail
Fuel Surcharge Case

—

On May 5,
2006, SPS requested authority to surcharge approximately $45.5 million of Texas
retail fuel and purchased energy cost under-collection that accrued from October 2005
through March 2006. The case was referred to the State Office of
Administrative Hearing (SOAH) for a contested hearing. During the course of
this proceeding, certain customers challenged whether a wholesale firm sales
contract that SPS has with El Paso Electric Company (EPE) satisfied the terms
of a non-unanimous stipulation, dated April 25, 2005, and the PUCT’s final
order, dated Dec. 19, 2005. This order established the terms under which
SPS would be allowed to recover system average fuel cost from certain wholesale
firm sales contracts until the issue is addressed in SPS’ base rate case. In October 2006,
the PUCT announced its decision that the contract with EPE, which was entered
into in July 2004 did not conform to the non-unanimous stipulation and the
PUCT’s December 2005 final order. As a result, the PUCT disallowed
approximately $1.8 million in fuel costs for the period covering October 2005
through March 2006. The PUCT rejected two requests for rehearing on the
EPE contract. SPS has accrued $8.1 million as of Dec. 31, 2006. The order
will remain in effect until the end of SPS’ general rate case proceeding at
which time the terms of the non-unanimous settlement on the treatment of
wholesale sales are set to expire. Recovery of the remaining portion of the
surcharge of approximately $39 million began on Oct. 1, 2006.

Texas Retail
Fuel Factor Change

—

On Oct. 6,
2006, SPS filed an application to change its fuel factors effective Nov. 1,
2006, to more accurately track fuel cost during the winter months. On Oct. 16,
2006, the PUCT granted interim approval of the factor changes effective Nov. 2006.
On Nov. 30, 2006, the PUCT granted final approval.

Texas Retail Base Rate And Fuel
Reconciliation Case

—

On May 31,
2006, SPS filed a Texas retail electric rate case requesting an increase in
annual revenues of approximately $48 million, or 6.0 percent. The rate filing
is based on a historical test year, an electric rate base of $943 million, a
requested return on equity of 11.6 percent and a common equity ratio of 51.1
percent.

In addition,
SPS has a pending fuel reconciliation filing, which seeks approval of
approximately $957 million of Texas jurisdictional fuel and purchased power
costs for 2004 through 2005. The fuel reconciliation case was transferred to
the SOAH with the base rate case and has the same procedural schedule. As a
part of the fuel reconciliation case, fuel and purchased energy costs, which
are recovered in Texas through a fixed-fuel and purchased energy recovery
factor as a part of SPS’ retail electric rates, will be reviewed.

Various
parties have filed testimony on base rate and fuel issues, including the Office
of Public Utility Counsel; the state of Texas; Texas Industrial Energy
Consumers; Alliance of Xcel Municipalities; Occidental Permian; and the PUCT
staff. Intervenors recommendations ranged from a base rate reduction of $56
million to a base rate increase of $31 million.

In the fuel
reconciliation portion of the proceeding, the parties recommended several
adjustments related to SPS’s fuel reconciliation filing, including the
methodology for assigning average fuel costs to certain firm wholesale sales,
coal mitigation activities, the treatment of fuel losses and other items. The
recommendation for disallowances ranged from $8 million to a disallowance
of $120 million. In addition, the Alliance of Xcel Municipalities challenged
the prudence of the decision to enter into certain coal contracts in 2005 and
2006. The proposed disallowances over the life of two contracts through 2010
and 2017, respectively, is in excess of $100 million.

SPS’ rebuttal testimony was filed in January 2007. SPS is confident
that the rebuttal case adequately addressed many of the concerns raised by
intervenors. As of Dec. 31, 2006 SPS has recognized what it believes is an
appropriate level of reserves for this potential liability.

New Mexico
Fuel Review

—

On Jan. 28, 2005, the NMPRC
accepted the staff petition for a review of SPS’ fuel and purchased power cost.
The staff requested a formal review of SPS’ fuel and purchased power cost
adjustment clause (FPPCAC) for the period of Oct. 1, 2001 through August 2004.
The hearing in the fuel review case was held April 22,

F-38

2006. A proposed recommended decision was filed by the parties on July 28,
2006, and the hearing examiner’s recommendation and a NMPRC decision are
expected in early 2007.

New Mexico
Fuel Factor Continuation Filing

—

On Aug. 18, 2005, SPS filed
with the NMPRC requesting continuation of the use of SPS’ FPPCAC and current
monthly factor cost recovery methodology. This filing was required by NMPRC
rule. Testimony has been filed in the case by staff and intervenors objecting
to SPS’ assignment of system average fuel costs to certain wholesale sales and
the inclusion of ineligible purchased power capacity and energy payments in the
FPPCAC. The testimony also proposed limits on SPS’ future use of the FPPCAC.
Related to these issues some intervenors have requested disallowances for past
periods, which in the aggregate total approximately $45 million. Other issues
in the case include the treatment of renewable energy certificates and sulfur
dioxide allowance credit proceeds in relation to SPS’ New Mexico retail fuel
and purchased power recovery clause. The hearing was held in April 2006,
and the hearing examiner’s recommended decision and a NMPRC decision is
expected in early 2007.

and Contingent Liabilities

Commitments

Capital
Commitments

—

The estimated cost as of Dec. 31,
2006 of capital requirements of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries and the
capital expenditure programs is approximately $1.9 billion in 2007, $1.9
billion in 2008 and $1.7 billion in 2009. Xcel Energy’s capital forecast
includes the following major projects:

CAPX 2020

—

In June 2006, CapX 2020, an
alliance of electric cooperatives, municipals and investor-owned utilities in
the upper Midwest, including Xcel Energy, announced that it had identified
three groups of transmission projects that proposed to be complete by 2020.

Group 1 project investments are expected
to total approximately $1.3 billion, with major construction targeted to begin
in 2009 or 2010 and ending three or four years later. Xcel Energy’s investment
is expected to be approximately $700 million. Approximately 75 percent of the
capital expenditures and return on investment for transmission projects are
expected to be recovered under an NSP-Minnesota transmission cost recovery
tariff rider mechanism authorized by Minnesota legislation and pending MPUC
approval. Similar transmission cost recovery mechanisms have been proposed in
North Dakota and South Dakota. Cost recovery by NSP-Wisconsin is expected to
occur through the biennial PSCW rate case process.

Nuclear Capacity Increases and Life Extension

—

In August 2004,
NSP-Minnesota announced plans to pursue 20-year license renewals for the
Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants, whose licenses will expire
between 2010 and 2014. License renewal applications for Monticello were
submitted to the NRC and the MPUC in early 2005. License renewal was approved
by the NRC in November 2006, and the MPUC issued its approval in October 2006
allowing additional spent fuel storage. The MPUC stayed the order until June 2007,
following the Minnesota legislative session. Similar applications will be
submitted for Prairie Island in 2008, with approval expected in 2010.

At the direction of the MPUC, NSP-Minnesota is pursuing capacity
increases of all three units that will total approximately 250 MW, to be
implemented, if approved, between 2009 and 2015. The life extension and a
capacity increase for Prairie Island Unit 2 is contingent on replacement of
Unit 2’s original steam generators, currently planned for replacement during
the refueling outage in 2013. Total capital investment for these activities is
estimated to be approximately $1 billion between 2006 and 2015. NSP-Minnesota
plans to seek approval for an alternative recovery mechanism from customers of
its nuclear costs. It is NSP-Minnesota’s plan to submit the certificate of need
for Monticello in the second quarter of 2007 and the certificate of need for
Prairie Island in the third quarter of 2007.

MERP Project

—

In December 2003,
the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s MERP proposal to convert two coal-fueled
electric generating plants to natural gas, and to install advanced pollution
control equipment at a third coal-fired plant. These improvements are expected
to significantly reduce air emissions from these facilities, while increasing
the capacity at system peak by 300 MW. Major construction for the MERP project
began in 2005, and these projects are expected to come on line between 2007 and
2009. The cumulative investment is approximately $1 billion. The MPUC has
approved a more current recovery of the financing costs related to the MERP. The
in-service plant costs, including the financing costs during construction, are
recovered from customers through a MERP rider, which was effective Jan. 1,
2006.

Comanche 3

— Comanche 3, a 750 MW
coal-fired plantbeing built in Colorado, is expected to cost approximately
$1.35 billion, with major construction initiated in 2006 and completed in
the fall of 2009. The CPUC has approved sharing one-third ownership of this
plant with other parties. Consequently, PSCo’s investment in Comanche 3 will be
approximately $1 billion.

F-39

Sherco Project

—

NSP-Minnesota has proposed a $905
million upgrade at the Sherburne County (Sherco) coal-fired power plant. The
project will increase capacity and reduce emissions. The MPUC is expected to rule on
the project in 2008. If approved, construction would start in late 2008 and be
completed in 2012.

Wind Generation

—

NSP-Minnesota
plans to invest $205 million to acquire 100-MW of wind generation. The
project would be eligible for rider recovery in Minnesota. The project requires
approval by the MPUC.

The capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to
continuing review and modification. Actual utility construction expenditures
may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas
projected load growth regulatory decisions, the desired reserve margin and the
availability of purchased power, as well as alternative plans for meeting Xcel
Energy’s long-term energy needs. In addition, Xcel Energy’s ongoing evaluation
of compliance with future requirements to install emission-control equipment,
and merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities to support corporate
strategies may impact actual capital requirements.

Leases

—

Xcel Energy
and its subsidiaries lease a variety of equipment and facilities used in the
normal course of business. Two of these leases qualify as capital leases and
are accounted for accordingly. The capital leases contractually expire in 2025
and 2028. The assets and liabilities acquired under capital leases are recorded
at the lower of fair market value or the present value of future lease
payments, and are amortized over their actual contract term in accordance with
practices allowed by regulators.

option, although there are financial penalties for early termination. In 2006,
Xcel Energy paid IBM $129.2 million under the contract and $0.6 million for
other project business. The contract also has a committed minimum payment each
year from 2007 through September 2015.

F-40

Fuel Contracts

—

Xcel Energy
and its subsidiaries have contracts providing for the purchase and delivery of
a significant portion of its current coal, nuclear fuel and natural gas
requirements. These contracts expire in various years between 2007 and 2027. In
total, Xcel Energy is committed to the minimum purchase of approximately $3.4
billion of coal, $386.6 million of nuclear fuel and $2.5 billion of natural
gas, including $1.5 billion of natural gas storage and transportation, or to
make payments in lieu thereof, under these contracts. In addition, Xcel Energy
is required to pay additional amounts depending on actual quantities shipped
under these agreements. Xcel Energy’s risk of loss, in the form of increased
costs from market price changes in fuel, is mitigated through the use of
natural gas and energy cost rate adjustment mechanisms, which provide for
pass-through of most fuel, storage and transportation costs to customers.

Purchased Power Agreements

—

The utility
subsidiaries of Xcel Energy have entered into agreements with utilities and
other energy suppliers for purchased power to meet system load and energy
requirements, replace generation from company-owned units under maintenance and
during outages, and meet operating reserve obligations. NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and
SPS have various pay-for-performance contracts with expiration dates through
the year 2033. In general, these contracts provide for capacity payments,
subject to meeting certain contract obligations, and energy payments based on
actual power taken under the contracts. Certain contractual payment obligations
are adjusted based on indices. However, the effects of price adjustments are
mitigated through cost-of-energy rate adjustment mechanisms.

At Dec. 31, 2006, the estimated future
payments for capacity that the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy are
obligated to purchase, subject to availability, are as follows:

Environmental Contingencies

Xcel Energy
and its subsidiaries have been, or are currently involved with, the cleanup of
contamination from certain hazardous substances at several sites. In many situations,
the subsidiary involved believes it will recover some portion of these costs
through insurance claims. Additionally, where applicable, the subsidiary
involved is pursuing, or intends to pursue, recovery from other potentially
responsible parties and through the rate regulatory process. New and changing
federal and state environmental mandates can also create added financial
liabilities for Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, which are normally recovered
through the rate regulatory process. To the extent any costs are not recovered
through the options listed above, Xcel Energy would be required to recognize an
expense.

Site
Remediation

—

Xcel Energy must pay all or a
portion of the cost to remediate sites where past activities of its
subsidiaries and some other parties have caused environmental contamination. Environmental
contingencies could arise from various situations, including the following
categories of sites:

·

Sites
of former MGPs operated by Xcel Energy subsidiaries or predecessors; and

·

Third-party
sites, such as landfills, to which Xcel Energy is alleged to be a potentially
responsible party (PRP) that sent hazardous materials and wastes.

Xcel Energy
records a liability when enough information is obtained to develop an estimate
of the cost of environmental remediation and revises the estimate as
information is received. The estimated remediation cost may vary materially.

To estimate
the cost to remediate these sites, assumptions are made when facts are not
fully known. For instance, assumptions may be made about the nature and extent
of site contamination, the extent of required cleanup efforts, costs of
alternative cleanup methods and pollution-control technologies, the period over
which remediation will be performed and paid for, changes in environmental
remediation and pollution-control requirements, the potential effect of
technological improvements, the number and financial strength of other PRPs and
the identification of new environmental cleanup sites.

Estimates are revised as facts become known. At Dec. 31, 2006, the
liability for the cost of remediating these sites was estimated to be $30.8
million, of which $5.3 million was considered to be a current liability. Some
of the cost of remediation may be recovered from:

·

Insurance
coverage;

F-41

·

Other
parties that have contributed to the contamination; and

·

Customers.

Neither the total remediation cost nor the final method of cost
allocation among all PRPs of the unremediated sites has been determined. Estimates
have been recorded for Xcel Energy’s future costs for these sites.

Manufactured
Gas Plant Sites

Ashland Manufactured Gas Plant Site

—

NSP-Wisconsin
was named a PRP for creosote and coal tar contamination at a site in Ashland,
Wis. The Ashland site includes property owned by NSP-Wisconsin, which was
previously an MGP facility, and two other properties: an adjacent city
lakeshore park area, on which an unaffiliated third party previously operated a
sawmill, and an area of Lake Superior’s Chequemegon Bay adjoining the park.

On Sept. 5,
2002, the Ashland site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL). A
determination of the scope and cost of the remediation of the Ashland site is
not currently expected until late 2007 or

2008 following the submission of the remedial
investigation report and feasibility study in 2007. NSP-Wisconsin continues to
work with the WDNR to access state and federal funds to apply to the ultimate
remediation cost of the entire site. In November 2005, the EPA Superfund Innovative Technology
Evaluation Program (SITE) accepted the Ashland site into its program. As part
of the SITE program, NSP-Wisconsin proposed to perform a site demonstration of
an in situ, chemical oxidation technique to treat upland ground water and
contaminated soil. During the third quarter of 2006, the proposal was favorably
reviewed by EPA, and in November 2006 the demonstration study was
initiated. In 2006,
NSP-Wisconsin spent $2.0 million in the development of the work plan, the
interim response action and other matters related to the site.

The WDNR and
NSP-Wisconsin have each developed several estimates of the ultimate cost to
remediate the Ashland site. The estimates vary significantly, between $4
million and $93 million, because different methods of remediation and different
results are assumed in each. The EPA and WDNR have not yet selected the method
of remediation to use at the site. Until the EPA and the WDNR select a
remediation strategy for the entire site and determine NSP-Wisconsin’s level of
responsibility, NSP-Wisconsin’s liability for the cost of remediating the
Ashland site is not determinable. NSP-Wisconsin has recorded a liability of $25.0
million for its potential liability for remediating the Ashland site and for
external legal and consultant costs. Since NSP-Wisconsin cannot currently
estimate the cost of remediating the Ashland site, that portion of the recorded
liability related to remediation is based upon the minimum of the estimated
range of remediation costs, using information available to date and reasonably
effective remedial methods.

On Oct. 19,
2004, the WDNR filed a lawsuit in Wisconsin state court for reimbursement of
past oversight costs incurred at the Ashland site between 1994 and March 2003
in the approximate amount of $1.4 million. The lawsuit has been stayed. NSP-Wisconsin
has recorded an estimate of its potential liability. All costs paid to the WDNR
are expected to be recoverable in rates.

In addition to
potential liability for remediation and WDNR oversight costs, NSP-Wisconsin may
also have liability for natural resource damages (NRDA) at the Ashland site. NSP-Wisconsin
has indicated to the relevant natural resource trustees its interest in
engaging in discussions concerning the assessment of natural resources injuries
and in proposing various restoration projects in an effort to fully and finally
resolve all NRDA claims. NSP-Wisconsin is not able to estimate its potential
exposure for natural resource damages at the site, but has recorded an estimate
of its potential liability based upon the minimum of its estimated range of
potential exposure.

NSP-Wisconsin
has deferred, as a regulatory asset, the costs accrued for the Ashland site
based upon an expectation that the PSCW will continue to allow NSP-Wisconsin to
recover payments for MGP-related environmental remediation from its customers. The
PSCW has consistently authorized recovery in NSP-Wisconsin rates of all
remediation costs incurred at the Ashland site, and has authorized recovery of
similar remediation costs for other Wisconsin utilities. External MGP remediation
costs are subject to deferral in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction and are
reviewed for prudence as part of the Wisconsin biennial retail rate case
process.

In addition,
in 2003, the Wisconsin Supreme Court rendered a ruling that reopens the possibility
that NSP-Wisconsin may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs
from its insurance carriers. Any insurance proceeds received by NSP-Wisconsin
will operate as a credit to ratepayers.

Fort Collins Manufactured Gas Plant Site

—

Prior to
1926, Poudre Valley Gas Co., a predecessor of PSCo, operated an MGP in Fort
Collins, Colo., not far from the Cache la Poudre River. In 1926, after
acquiring the Poudre Valley Gas Co., PSCo shut down the MGP site and has sold
most of the property. An oily substance similar to MGP byproducts was

F-42

discovered in the Cache la
Poudre River. On Nov. 10, 2004, PSCo entered into an agreement with the
EPA, the city of Fort Collins and Schrader Oil Co., under which PSCo performed
remediation and monitoring work. PSCo has substantially completed work at the
site, with the exception of ongoing maintenance and monitoring. In May 2005,
PSCo filed a natural gas rate case with the CPUC requesting recovery of cleanup
costs at the Fort Collins MGP site spent through March 2005, which
amounted to $6.2 million, to be amortized over four years. PSCo reached a
settlement agreement with the parties in the case. The CPUC approved the
settlement agreement on Jan. 19, 2006 and the final order became effective
on Feb. 3, 2006, with rates effective Feb. 6, 2006. In November 2006,
PSCo filed a natural gas rate case with the CPUC requesting recovery of
additional clean-up costs at the Fort Collins MGP site spent through September 2006,
plus unrecovered amounts previously authorized from the last rate case, which
amounted to $10.8 million to be amortized over four years. The total amount
PSCo is requesting be recovered from customers is $13.1 million.

In April 2005, PSCo brought a contribution action against Schrader
Oil Co. and related parties alleging Schrader Oil Co. released hazardous
substances into the environment and these releases caused MGP byproducts to
migrate to the Cache La Poudre River, thereby substantially increasing the
scope and cost of remediation. PSCo requested damages, including a portion of
the costs PSCo incurred to investigate and remove contaminated sediments from
the Cache la Poudre River. On Dec. 14, 2005, the court denied Schrader’s
request to dismiss the PSCo suit. On Jan. 3, 2006, Schrader filed a
response to the PSCo complaint and a counterclaim against PSCo for its response
costs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability
Act (CERCLA) and under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Schrader
has alleged as part of its counterclaim an “imminent and substantial
endangerment” of its property as defined by RCRA. In September 2006, PSCo
filed a Motion For Partial Summary Judgment to dismiss Schrader’s RCRA claim. PSCo
believes the allegations with respect to PSCo are without merit and will
vigorously defend itself.

Third Party
and Other Environmental Site Remediation

Asbestos Removal

—

Some of our
facilities contain asbestos. Most asbestos will remain undisturbed until the
facilities that contain it are demolished or renovated. Xcel Energy has
recorded an estimate for final removal of the asbestos as an asset retirement
obligation. See additional discussion of asset retirement obligations in Note
14. It may be necessary to remove some asbestos to perform maintenance or make
improvements to other equipment. The cost of removing asbestos as part of other
work is immaterial and is recorded as incurred as operating expenses for
maintenance projects, capital expenditures for construction projects or removal
costs for demolition projects.

Cunningham Station Groundwater

—

Cunningham
Station is a natural gas-fired power plant constructed in the 1960s by SPS and
has 28 water wells installed on its water rights. The well field provides water
for boiler makeup, cooling water and potable water. Following an acid release
in 2002, groundwater samples revealed elevated concentrations of inorganic salt
compounds not related to the release. The contamination was identified in wells
located near the plant buildings. The source of contamination is thought to be
leakage from ponds that receive blow down water from the plant. In response to
a request by the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED), SPS prepared a
corrective action plan to address the groundwater contamination. Under the plan
submitted to the NMED, SPS agreed to control leakage from the plant blow down
ponds through construction of a new lined pond, additional irrigation areas to
minimize percolation, and installation of additional wells to monitor
groundwater quality. On June 23, 2005, NMED issued a letter approving the
corrective action plan. The action plan is subject to continued compliance with
New Mexico regulations and oversight by the NMED. SPS is evaluating
implementation of a similar project at Maddox Station. These actions for
Cunningham and Maddox are estimated to cost approximately $4.2 million through
2008 and will be capitalized or expensed as incurred.

Construction and liner installation of the new pond has been completed.
A permit application for discharges from the pond has been submitted to the
NMED. It is expected that the pond will be ready to be placed into service when
the NMED issues Cunningham a permit. The permitting process for Maddox has
begun.

Other
Environmental Requirements

CAIR

—

In March 2005,
the EPA issued the CAIR to further regulate SO2 and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. The objective of CAIR is to
cap emissions of SO2 and NOx in
the eastern United States, including Minnesota, Texas and Wisconsin, which are
within Xcel Energy’s service territory. Xcel Energy generating facilities in
other states are not affected. CAIR addresses the transportation of fine
particulates, ozone and emission precursors to nonattainment downwind states. CAIR
has a two-phase compliance schedule, beginning in 2009 for NOx and 2010 for SO2, with a final compliance deadline in
2015 for both emissions. Under CAIR, each affected state will be allocated an
emissions budget for SO2 and NOX that will result in significant
emission reductions. It will be based on stringent emission controls and forms
the basis

F-43

for a cap-and-trade program. State
emission budgets or caps decline over time. States can choose to implement an
emissions reduction program based on the EPA’s proposed model program, or they
can propose another method, which the EPA would need to approve.

On July 11,
2005, SPS, the City of Amarillo, Texas and Occidental Permian LTD filed a
lawsuit against the EPA and a request for reconsideration with the agency to
exclude West Texas from the CAIR. El Paso Electric Co. joined in the request
for reconsideration. Xcel Energy and SPS advocated that West Texas should be
excluded from CAIR because it does not contribute significantly to
nonattainment with the fine particulate matter National Ambient Air Quality
Standard in any downwind jurisdiction.

On March 15,
2006, the EPA denied the petition for reconsideration. On June 27, 2006,
Xcel Energy and the other parties filed a petition for review of the denial of
the petition for reconsideration, as well as a petition for review of the
Federal Implementation Plan, with the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. Pursuant to the court’s scheduling order,
briefing is expected to be finalized in September 2007.

Under CAIR’s
cap-and-trade structure, SPS can comply through capital investments in emission
controls or purchase of emission “allowances” from other utilities making
reductions on their systems. Based on the preliminary analysis of various
scenarios of capital investment and allowance purchase, Xcel Energy currently
believes that with the installation of low NOx burners on Harrington 3 in 2006,
there are capital investments estimated at $23 million remaining for NOx
controls in the SPS region. Annual purchases of SO


allowances are estimated in the range of $12
million to $26 million each year, beginning in 2012, for phase I, based on
allowance costs and fuel quality as of December 2006.

In addition,
Minnesota and Wisconsin will be included in CAIR, and Xcel Energy has
generating facilities in these states that will be impacted. Preliminary
estimates of capital expenditures associated with compliance with CAIR in
Minnesota and Wisconsin range from $30 million to $40 million. Xcel Energy is
not challenging CAIR in these states.

These cost
estimates represent one potential scenario on complying with CAIR, if West
Texas is not excluded. There is uncertainty concerning implementation of CAIR. States
are required to develop implementation plans within 18 months of the issuance
of the new rules and have a significant amount of discretion in the
implementation details. Legal challenges to CAIR rules could alter their
requirements and/or schedule. The uncertainty associated with the final CAIR rules makes
it difficult to project the ultimate amount and timing of capital expenditures
and operating expenses.

While Xcel
Energy expects to comply with the new rules through a combination of
additional capital investments in emission controls at various facilities and
purchases of emission allowances, it is continuing to review the alternatives. Xcel
Energy believes the cost of any required capital investment or allowance
purchases will be recoverable from customers.

CAMR

—

In March 2005, the EPA issued the CAMR, which
regulates mercury emissions from power plants for the first time. The EPA’s
CAMR uses a national cap-and-trade system, where compliance may be
achieved by either adding mercury controls or purchasing allowances or a
combination of both and is designed to achieve a 70 percent reduction in
mercury emissions. It affects all coal- and oil-fired generating units across
the country that are greater than 25 MW. Compliance with this rule occurs
in two phases, with the first phase beginning in 2010 and the second phase in
2018. States will be allocated mercury allowances based on coal type and their
baseline heat input relative to other states. Each electric generating unit
will be allocated mercury allowances based on its percentage of total coal heat
input for the state. Similar to CAIR, states can choose to implement an
emissions reduction program based on the EPA’s proposed model program, or they
can propose another method, which the EPA would need to approve.

Xcel Energy
continues to evaluate the strategy for complying with CAMR. NSP-Minnesota
currently estimates the capital cost for compliance to be $10.3 million for
mercury control and continuous monitoring equipment and increased operating and
maintenance expenses of approximately $4.8 million. Recent testing
indicates that NSP-Wisconsin facilities will be low mass mercury emitters:
therefore, compliance with CAMR is not expected to require mercury controls or
purchases of allowances. In February 2007, the Colorado Air Quality
Control Commission passed a mercury rule. The rule was based on a negotiated
rule that was agreed upon by participating environmental groups,
utilities, local government coalitions, and the CAPCD. The rule requires
controls to be installed at Pawnee Station in 2012 and all other Colorado units
by 2014. Xcel Energy is evaluating the emission controls required to meet the
new rule and is currently unable to provide a capital cost estimate. SPS
continues to evaluate the strategy for complying with CAMR and estimates
capital costs of $14.5 million for mercury control equipment.

Minnesota Mercury Legislation

—

On May 2,
2006 the Minnesota Legislature enacted the Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of
2006 (Act) providing a process for plans, implementation and cost recovery for
utility efforts to curb mercury

F-44

emissions at certain power
plants. For Xcel Energy, the Act covers units at the A. S. King and Sherco
generating facilities. Under the Act, Xcel Energy must install, maintain and
operate continuous mercury emission monitoring systems or other monitoring
methods approved by the MPCA at these units by July 1, 2007. The
information obtained will be used to establish a baseline from which to measure
mercury emission reductions. Mercury emission reduction plans must be filed by
utilities by Dec. 31, 2007 (dry scrubbed units) and Dec. 31, 2009
(wet scrubbed units) that propose to implement technologies most likely to
reduce emissions by 90 percent. Implementation would occur by Dec. 31,
2009 for one of the dry scrubbed units, Dec.31, 2010 for the remaining dry
scrubbed unit and Dec. 31, 2014 for wet scrubbed units. The cost of
controls will be determined as part of the engineering analysis portion of the
mercury reduction plans and is currently estimated at $10.3 million for the
mercury control and continuous monitoring equipment and increased operating and
maintenance expenses of approximately $11.3 million, beginning in 2010. Utilities
subject to the Act may also submit plans to address non-mercury pollutants
subject to federal and state statutes and regulations, which became effective
after Dec. 31, 2004. Cost recovery provisions of the Act also apply to
these other environmental initiatives. On Sept. 15, 2006, NSP-Minnesota filed a
request with the MPUC for deferred accounting of up to $6.3 million of certain
environmental improvement costs that are expected to be recoverable under the
Act. On Jan. 11 2007, the MPUC approved this request for deferred
accounting with a cap of $6.3 million.

Regional Haze Rules

—

On June 15,
2005, the EPA finalized amendments to the July 1999 regional haze rules.
These amendments apply to the provisions of the regional haze rule that
require emission controls, known as BART, for industrial facilities emitting
air pollutants that reduce visibility by causing or contributing to regional
haze. Xcel Energy generating facilities in several states will be subject to
BART requirements. Some of these facilities are located in regions where CAIR
is effective. CAIR has precedence over BART. Therefore, BART requirements will
be deemed to be met through compliance with CAIR requirements.

The EPA
required states to develop implementation plans to comply with BART by December 2007.
States are required to identify the facilities that will have to reduce
emissions under BART and then set BART emissions limits for those facilities.
On May 30, 2006, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission promulgated
BART regulations requiring certain major stationary sources to evaluate and
install, operate and maintain BART technology or an approved BART alternative
to make reasonable progress toward meeting the national visibility goal. On Aug. 1,
2006, PSCo submitted its BART alternatives analysis to the CAPCD. As set forth
in its analysis, PSCo estimates that implementation of the BART alternatives
will cost approximately $211 million in capital costs, which includes
approximately $62 million in environmental upgrades for the existing Comanche
Station project, which are included in the capital budget. Xcel Energy expects
the cost of any required capital investment will be recoverable from customers.
Emissions controls are expected to be installed between 2008 and 2012.

Minnesota has
also begun implementing its BART strategy as the first step toward the December 2007
deadline. NSP-Minnesota submitted its BART alternatives analysis for Sherco
units 1 and 2 on Oct. 26, 2006. The expected cost associated with the
range of alternatives for additional emission controls for SO


and NOx is a capital investment of $7 million
to $617 million. NSP- Minnesota supports the alternative with the associated
cost estimate of $7 million; however, NSP-Minnesota has not yet received a
response from the MPCA concerning its preferred alternative. Xcel Energy
expects that the costs of any required capital investment will be recoverable
from customers. All BART issues are addressed by the voluntary capacity
upgrades noted below.

Voluntary Capacity Upgrade and Emissions
Reduction Filing

—

On Jan. 2, 2007, NSP-Minnesota made a filing to the MPUC for a major
emissions reduction project at the Sherco Units 1, 2 and 3 to reduce emissions
and expand capacity by installing NOx controls (low NOx burners, overfire air
and Selective Catalytic Reduction), installing mercury control systems,
replacing the wet scrubbers on units 1 and 2 with semi-dry scrubbers, retrofitting
different sections of the turbines on all three units, replacing generators and
other associated equipment on all three units, and installing additional
cooling capacity. The projected cost of this project is approximately $905
million and encompasses the BART capital investment of $7 million to $617
million noted above. NSP-Minnesota’s investments are subject to the MPUC
approval of a cost recovery mechanism.

Federal Clean Water Act

—

The federal
Clean Water Act requires the EPA to regulate cooling water intake structures to
assure that these structures reflect the “best technology available” for
minimizing adverse environmental impacts. In July 2004, the EPA published
phase II of the rule, which applies to existing cooling water intakes at
steam-electric power plants. Several lawsuits were filed against the EPA in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit challenging the phase II
rulemaking. On Jan. 25, 2007, the court issued its decision and remanded
virtually every aspect of the rule to the EPA for reconsideration. It is
unclear whether the EPA will stay the deadlines in the rule until the
remanded rulemaking

F-45

is finished. As a result, the
rule’s compliance requirements and associated deadlines are currently unknown.
It is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the overall cost of this
rulemaking at this time due to the many uncertainties involved.

PSCo Notice of
Violation

—

On July 1, 2002, PSCo received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA
alleging violations of the New Source Review (NSR) requirements of the Clean
Air Act (CAA) at the Comanche and Pawnee plants in Colorado. The NOV
specifically alleges that various maintenance, repair and replacement projects
undertaken at the plants in the mid- to late-1990s should have required a
permit under the NSR process. PSCo believes it has acted in full compliance
with the CAA and NSR process. It believes that the projects identified in the
NOV fit within the routine maintenance, repair and replacement exemption
contained within the NSR regulations or are otherwise not subject to the NSR
requirements. PSCo also believes that the projects would be expressly
authorized under the EPA’s NSR equipment replacement rulemaking promulgated in October 2003.
PSCo disagrees with the assertions contained in the NOV and intends to
vigorously defend its position. As required by the CAA, the EPA met with Xcel
Energy in September 2002 to discuss the NOV.

Asset Retirement Obligations

Xcel Energy
records future plant removal obligations as a liability at fair value with a
corresponding increase to the carrying values of the related long-lived assets
in accordance with SFAS No. 143 — “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations” (SFAS No. 143). This liability will be increased over time by
applying the interest method of accretion to the liability, and the capitalized
costs will be depreciated over the useful life of the related long-lived assets.
The recording of the obligation for regulated operations has no income
statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the
establishment of a regulatory asset pursuant to SFAS No. 71.

Recorded ARO

—

Asset
retirement obligations have been recorded for plant related to nuclear
production, steam production, electric transmission and distribution, natural
gas transmission and distribution and office buildings. The steam production
obligation includes asbestos, ash-containment facilities and decommissioning. The
asbestos recognition associated with the steam production includes certain
plants at NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS. NSP-Minnesota also recorded asbestos
recognition for its general office building. Generally, this asbestos abatement
removal obligation originated in 1973 with the CAA, which applied to the
demolition of buildings or removal of equipment containing asbestos that can
become airborne on removal. Asset retirement obligations also have been
recorded for NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS steam production related to
ash-containment facilities such as bottom ash ponds, evaporation ponds and
solid waste landfills. The origination date on the ARO recognition for
ash-containment facilities at steam plants was the in-service date of various
facilities.

Xcel Energy
recognized an ARO for the retirement costs of natural gas mains at NSP-Minnesota,
NSP- Wisconsin and PSCo. In addition, an ARO was recognized for the removal of
electric transmission and distribution equipment at NSP-Minnesota,
NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS. The electric transmission and distribution ARO
consists of many small potential obligations associated with polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs), mineral oil, storage tanks, treated poles, lithium batteries,
mercury and street lighting lamps. These electric and natural gas assets have
many in-service dates for which it is difficult to assign the obligation to a
particular year. Therefore, the obligation was measured using an average
service life.

For the
nuclear assets, the ARO associated with the decommissioning of two
NSP-Minnesota nuclear generating plants, Monticello and Prairie Island,
originates with the in-service date of the facility. Monticello began operation
in 1971. Prairie Island units 1 and 2 began operation in 1973 and 1974,
respectively. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of nuclear obligations.

F-46

If Xcel Energy
had implemented FIN No. 47 at Jan. 1, 2005, the liability for asset
retirement obligations would have increased by $55.2 million.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending
aggregate carrying amounts of Xcel Energy’s asset retirement obligations is
shown in the table below for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2006 and Dec. 31,
2005, respectively:

funded amounts.

Indeterminate Asset Retirement Obligations

—

PSCo has
underground natural gas storage facilities that have special closure
requirements for which the final removal date cannot be determined.

Removal Costs

—

Xcel Energy accrues
an obligation for plant removal costs for other generation, transmission and
distribution facilities of its utility subsidiaries. Generally, the accrual of
future non-ARO removal obligations is not required. However, long-standing
ratemaking practices approved by applicable state and federal regulatory
commissions have allowed provisions for such costs in historical depreciation
rates. These removal costs have accumulated over a number of years based on
varying rates as authorized by the appropriate regulatory entities. Given the
long periods over which the amounts were accrued and the changing of rates
through time, the utility subsidiaries have estimated the amount of removal
costs accumulated through historic depreciation expense based on current
factors used in the existing depreciation rates.

Accordingly, the recorded amounts of
estimated future removal costs are considered Regulatory Liabilities under SFAS No. 71.
Removal costs by entity are as follows at Dec. 31:

Nuclear Insurance

—

NSP-Minnesota’s
public liability for claims resulting from any nuclear incident is limited to
$10.8 billion under the 1988 Price-Anderson amendment to the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954. NSP-Minnesota has secured $300 million of coverage for its public
liability exposure with a pool of insurance companies. The remaining $10.5
billion of exposure is funded by the Secondary Financial Protection Program,
available from assessments by the federal government in case of a nuclear
accident. NSP-Minnesota is subject to assessments of up to $100.6 million for
each of its three licensed reactors, to be applied for public liability arising
from a nuclear incident at any licensed nuclear facility in the United States.
The maximum funding requirement is $15 million per reactor during any one year.

NSP-Minnesota purchases insurance for property damage and site
decontamination cleanup costs from Nuclear Electric Insurance Ltd. (NEIL). The
coverage limits are $2.1 billion for each of NSP-Minnesota’s two nuclear plant
sites. NEIL also provides business interruption insurance coverage, including
the cost of replacement power obtained during certain prolonged accidental
outages of nuclear generating units. Premiums are expensed over the policy
term. All companies insured with NEIL are subject to retroactive premium
adjustments if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds. Capital has been
accumulated in the reserve funds of NEIL to the extent that NSP-Minnesota would
have no exposure for retroactive premium assessments in case of a single
incident under the business interruption and the property damage insurance
coverage. However, in each calendar year, NSP-Minnesota could be subject to
maximum assessments of approximately $16.1 million for business interruption
insurance and $26.1 million for property damage insurance if losses exceed
accumulated reserve funds.

Legal Contingencies

In the normal course of business, Xcel Energy is subject to claims and
litigation arising from prior and current operations. Xcel Energy is actively
defending these matters and has recorded a reasonable liability related to the
probable cost of settlement or other disposition when it can be reasonably
estimated. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be
determined. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a
material adverse effect on Xcel Energy’s financial position and results of
operations.

Bender et al. vs. Xcel Energy

—

On July 2,
2004, five former NRG officers filed a lawsuit against Xcel Energy in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Minnesota. The lawsuit alleges, among other things,
that Xcel Energy violated the ERISA by refusing to make certain deferred
compensation payments to the plaintiffs. The complaint also alleges
interference with ERISA benefits, breach of contract related to the nonpayment
of certain stock options and unjust enrichment. The complaint alleges damages
of approximately $6 million. Xcel Energy believes the suit is without merit. On
Jan. 19, 2005, Xcel Energy filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 26,
2005, the court issued an order granting Xcel Energy’s motion for summary
judgment in part with respect to claims for interference with ERISA benefits,
breach of contract for nonpayment of stock options and unjust enrichment. The
court denied Xcel Energy’s motion in part with respect to the allegations of
nonpayment of deferred compensation benefits. Plaintiffs and Xcel Energy filed
additional cross motions for summary judgment, with oral arguments presented on
Feb. 24, 2006.

On May 17, 2006, the court granted Xcel Energy’s motion for summary
judgment in full and denied the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment in
full. Plaintiffs have appealed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral
arguments were presented Jan. 11, 2007.

Carbon Dioxide
Emissions Lawsuit

—

On July 21,
2004, the attorneys general of eight states and New York City, as well as
several environmental groups, filed lawsuits in U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York against five utilities, including Xcel Energy, to
force reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The other utilities include
American Electric Power Co., Southern Co., Cinergy Corp. and Tennessee Valley
Authority. CO2 is emitted whenever fossil fuel is combusted, such as in
automobiles, industrial operations and coal- or natural gas-fired power plants.
The lawsuits allege that CO2 emitted by each company is a public nuisance as
defined under state and federal common law because it has contributed to global
warming. The lawsuits do not demand monetary damages. Instead, the lawsuits ask
the court to order each utility to cap and reduce its CO2 emissions. In October 2004,
Xcel Energy and four other utility companies filed a motion to dismiss the
lawsuit, contending, among other reasons, that the lawsuit is an attempt to
usurp the policy-setting role of the U.S. Congress and the president. On Sept.
19, 2005, the judge granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss on constitutional
grounds. Plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
Oral arguments were presented on June 7, 2006 and a decision on the appeal
is pending.

the appeal were heard on Feb. 13, 2007.

Sinclair Oil
Corporation vs. e prime, inc. and Xcel Energy Inc.

—

On July 18,
2005, Sinclair Oil Corporation filed a lawsuit against Xcel Energy and its
former subsidiary e prime, inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Oklahoma alleging liability and damages for purported misreporting
of price information for natural gas to trade publications in an effort to
artificially increase natural gas prices. The complaint also alleges that e
prime and Xcel Energy engaged in a conspiracy with other natural gas sellers to
inflate prices through alleged false reporting of natural gas prices. In
response, e prime and Xcel Energy filed a motion with the Multi-District
Litigation (MDL) panel to have the matter transferred to U.S. District Judge
Pro, who is the judge assigned to western area wholesale natural gas marketing
litigation and filed a second motion to dismiss the lawsuit. In response to
this motion, this matter was conditionally transferred to U.S. District Court
Judge Pro. Judge Pro granted the motion to dismiss, and Sinclair appealed to
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Sinclair’s appeal has been stayed pending
the Ninth Circuit’s disposition of the Abelman Art Glass and Texas-Ohio
appeals.

—

On June 21,
2005, a class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of California by Ever-Bloom, Inc. The lawsuit names
as defendants, among others, Xcel Energy and e prime. The lawsuit, filed on
behalf of a purported class of natural gas purchasers, alleges that defendants
falsely reported natural gas trades to market trade publications in an effort
to artificially raise natural gas prices in California, purportedly in
violation of the Sherman Act. This matter has been stayed pending the outcome
of cases on appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Learjet, Inc.
vs. e prime and Xcel Energy et al.

—

On Nov. 4,
2005, a purported class action complaint was filed in State Court for Wyandotte
County of Kansas on behalf of all natural gas producers in Kansas. The lawsuit
alleges that e prime, Xcel Energy and other named defendants conspired to raise
the market price of natural gas in Kansas by, among other things, inaccurately
reporting price and volume information to the market trade publications. On Dec. 7,
2005, the state court granted the defendants motion to remove this matter to
the U.S. District Court in Kansas. Plaintiffs have filed a

F-


motion for remand, which was denied on Aug. 3, 2006. Plaintiffs in
this matter and in the J.P. Morgan Trust case, discussed below, have moved the
judicial panel on MDL for a separate MDL docket to be set up in Kansas Federal
Court. Xcel Energy’s motion to dismiss the complaint is pending.

J.P. Morgan
Trust Company vs. e prime and Xcel Energy Inc. et al.

—

On Oct. 17,
2005, J.P. Morgan Trust Company, in its capacity as the liquidating trustee for
Farmland Industries Liquidating Trust, filed an amended complaint in Kansas
State Court adding defendants, including Xcel Energy and e prime, to a
previously filed complaint alleging that the defendants inaccurately reported
natural gas trades to market trade publications in an effort to artificially
raise natural gas prices. The lawsuit was removed to the U.S. District Court in
Kansas and subsequently transferred to U.S. District Court Judge Pro in Nevada
pursuant to an order from the MDL panel. A motion to remand to state court
filed by plaintiffs has been denied. A motion to dismiss plaintiff’s case was
granted in December 2006. Plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to amend
the judgment and defendents filed an opposition to that motion in February 2007.

Breckenridge
Brewery vs. e prime and Xcel Energy Inc. et al.

—

In May, 2006,
Breckenridge Brewery, a Colorado corporation, filed a complaint in Colorado
State District Court for the City and County of Denver alleging that the
defendants, including e prime and Xcel Energy, unlawfully prevented full and
free competition in the trading and sale of natural gas, or controlled the
market price of natural gas, and engaged in a conspiracy in constraint of
trade. Notice of removal to federal court on behalf of Xcel Energy Inc. and e
prime, inc. was filed in June 2006. On July 6, 2006, the
Colorado State District Court granted an enlargement of time within which to
file a pleading in response to the complaint. Plaintiffs filed a motion to
remand the matter to state court, which was denied in October 2006, and
the matter has been transferred to U.S. District Court Judge Pro, in Nevada.

Missouri
Public Service Commission vs. e prime, inc. and Xcel Energy Inc.

—

On Oct. 24,
2006, the Missouri Public Utilities Commission filed a complaint in State Court
for Jackson County of Missouri alleging that e prime, Xcel Energy and 21 other
defendants falsely reported natural gas trades to market trade publications in
an effort to artificially raise natural gas prices. The complaint further
alleges that such conduct constitutes a violation of the Missouri Antitrust
Law, fraud and unjust enrichment. This matter has been removed to U.S. District
Court, and plaintiffs have indicated they intend to file a motion to remand to
state court. Xcel Energy and e prime deny plaintiffs’ allegations and intend to
vigorously defend themselves in this action.

Payne et al.
vs. PSCo et al.

—

In late October 2003,
there was a wildfire in Boulder County, Colorado. There was no loss of life,
but there was property damage associated with this fire. On Oct. 28, 2005,
an action against PSCo relating to this fire was filed in Boulder County
District Court. There are 22 plaintiffs, including individuals, the City of
Jamestown and two companies, and three co-defendants, including PSCo.
Plaintiffs have asserted that a tree falling into PSCo distribution lines may
have caused the fire. Discovery is nearly complete, and the case is set to go
to trial commencing July 30, 2007. A motion for partial summary judgment
has been filed by PSCo and its co-defendants. PSCo is continuing to vigorously
defend itself against the claims asserted in this lawsuit. This lawsuit is not
expected to have a material financial impact on Xcel Energy and PSCo believes
that its insurance coverage will cover any liability in this matter.

Comanche 3
Permit Litigation

—

On Aug. 4,
2005, Citizens for Clean Air and Water in Pueblo and Southern Colorado and
Clean Energy Action filed a complaint against the Colorado Air Pollution
Control Division alleging that the Division improperly granted permits to PSCo
under Colorado’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration program for the
construction and operation of Comanche 3. PSCo intervened in the case. On June 20,
2006, the court ruled in PSCo’s favor and held that the Comanche 3 permits had
been properly granted and plaintiffs’ claims to the contrary were without merit.
Plaintiffs have appealed this decision. On Nov. 22, 2006, plaintiffs filed
their opening briefs. PSCo’s response was filed Dec. 22, 2006. The
Colorado Court of Appeals is expected to rule on the appeal in 2007.

Fru-Con
Construction Corporation vs. Utility Engineering et al.

—

On March 28,
2005, Fru-Con Construction Corporation (Fru-Con) commenced a lawsuit in U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of California against UE and the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) for damages allegedly suffered
during the construction of a natural gas-fired, combined-cycle power plant in
Sacramento County. Fru-Con’s complaint alleges that it entered into a contract
with SMUD to construct the power plant and further alleges that UE was
negligent with regard to the design services it furnished to SMUD. UE denies
this claim and intends to vigorously defend itself. Because this lawsuit was
commenced prior to the April 8, 2005, closing of the sale of UE to Zachry,
Xcel Energy is obligated to indemnify Zachry for damages related to this case
up to $17.5 million. Pursuant to the terms of its professional liability
policy, UE is insured up to $35 million. On June 1, 2005, UE filed a
motion to dismiss Fru-Con’s complaint. A hearing concerning this motion was
held on July 18, 2005, with the court taking the matter under advisement. On
Aug. 4, 2005, the court granted UE’s motion to dismiss.

F-


Because SMUD remains a defendant in this action, the court has not
entered a final judgment subject to an appeal with respect to its order to
dismiss UE from the lawsuit.

Metropolitan
Airports Commission vs. Northern States Power Company

—

On Dec. 30,
2004, the Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) filed a complaint in Minnesota
State District Court in Hennepin County asserting that NSP-Minnesota is
required to relocate facilities on MAC property at the expense of
NSP-Minnesota. MAC claims that approximately $7.1 million charged by
NSP-Minnesota over the past five years for relocation costs should be repaid.
Both parties asserted cross motions for partial summary judgment on a separate
and less significant claim concerning legal obligations associated with rent
payments allegedly due and owing by NSP-Minnesota to MAC for the use of its
property for a substation that serves MAC. A hearing regarding these cross
motions was held in January 2006. In February 2006, the court granted
MAC’s motion on this issue, finding that there was a valid lease and that the
past course of action between the parties required NSP-Minnesota to continue
making rent payments. NSP-Minnesota had made rent payments for 45 years.
Depositions of key witnesses took place in February, March and April of
2006. The parties entered into meaningful settlement negotiations in May 2006,
and in August 2006 reached an oral settlement of the dispute. The parties
are negotiating over the final form of the settlement documents and it is
expected that the action will be formally dismissed in the near future.

Siewert vs.
Xcel Energy

—

Plaintiffs, the owners and operators
of a Minnesota dairy farm, brought an action against NSP-Minnesota
alleging negligence in the handling, supplying, distributing and selling of
electrical power systems; negligence in the construction and maintenance of
distribution systems; and failure to warn or adequately test such systems. Plaintiffs
allege decreased milk production, injury, and damage to a dairy herd as a
result of stray voltage resulting from NSP-Minnesota’s distribution system. Plaintiffs’
expert report on the economic damage to their dairy farm states that the total
present value of plaintiffs’ loss is $6.8 million. Trial is scheduled to
commence in January 2008. NSP-Minnesota denies these allegations and will
vigorously defend itself in this matter.

Hoffman vs.
Northern States Power Company

—

On March 15,
2006, a purported class action complaint was filed in Minnesota State District
Court in Hennepin County, on behalf of NSP-Minnesota’s residential customers in
Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota for alleged breach of a contractual
obligation to maintain and inspect the points of connection between
NSP-Minnesota’s wires and customers’ homes within the meter box. Plaintiffs
claim NSP-Minnesota’s alleged breach results in an increased risk of fire and
is in violation of tariffs on file with the MPUC. Plaintiffs seek injunctive
relief and damages in an amount equal to the value of inspections plaintiffs
claim NSP-Minnesota was required to perform over the past six years.
NSP-Minnesota filed a motion for dismissal on the pleadings, which was heard on
Aug. 16, 2006. In November 2006, the court issued an order denying
NSP-Minnesota’s motion. On Nov. 28, 2006, pursuant to a motion by
NSP-Minnesota, the court certified the issues raised in NSP-Minnesota’s
original motion as important and doubtful. This certification permits
NSP-Minnesota to file an appeal, and it has done so.

Comer vs. Xcel
Energy Inc. et al.

—

On April 25,
2006, Xcel Energy received notice of a purported class action lawsuit filed in
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. The lawsuit names
more than 45 oil, chemical and utility companies, including Xcel Energy, as
defendants and alleges that defendants’ CO2 “were a proximate and direct cause
of the increase in the destructive capacity of Hurricane Katrina.” Plaintiffs
allege in support of their claim, several legal theories, including negligence
and public and private nuisance and seek damages related to the loss resulting
from the hurricane. Xcel Energy believes this lawsuit is without merit and
intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims. On July 19,
2006, Xcel Energy filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in its entirety.

Qwest vs. Xcel
Energy Inc.

—

On June 24, 2004, an employee of
PSCo, was injured when a pole, owned by Qwest malfunctioned. The employee is
seeking damages of approximately $7 million. On Sept. 6, 2005, an action
against Qwest relating to incident was filed in Denver District Court by the
employee. On April 18, 2006, Qwest filed a third party complaint against
PSCo based on terms in a joint pole use agreement between Qwest and PSCo. Pursuant
to this agreement, Qwest has asserted that PSCo had an affirmative duty to
properly train and instruct its employees on pole safety, including testing the
pole for soundness before climbing. PSCo filed a counterclaim on May 15,
2006, against Qwest asserting Qwest had a duty to PSCo and an obligation under
the contract to maintain its poles in a safe and serviceable condition. This
case is still in the discovery phase and set for a 7 day jury trial beginning May 14,
2007.

Other Contingencies

Tax Matters

—

In April 2004,
Xcel Energy filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Minnesota to establish its right to deduct the
interest expense that had accrued during tax years 1993 and 1994 on policy
loans related to the COLI policies.

After Xcel
Energy filed this suit, the IRS sent two statutory notices of deficiency of
tax, penalty and interest for 1995 through 1999. Xcel Energy has filed U.S. Tax
Court petitions challenging those notices. Xcel Energy anticipates the dispute
relating to its interest expense deductions will be resolved in the refund suit
that is pending in the Minnesota Federal District Court and the Tax Court
petitions will be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the refund
litigation. In the third quarter of 2006, Xcel Energy also received a statutory
notice of deficiency from the IRS for tax years 2000 through 2002 and timely
filed a Tax Court petition challenging the denial of the COLI interest expense
deductions for those years.

On Oct. 12,
2005, the district court denied Xcel Energy’s motion for summary judgment on
the grounds that there were disputed issues of material fact that required a
trial for resolution. At the same time, the district court denied the
government’s motion for summary judgment that was based on its contention that
PSCo had lacked an insurable interest in the lives of the employees insured
under the COLI policies. However, the district court granted Xcel Energy’s motion
for partial summary judgment on the grounds that PSCo did have the requisite
insurable interest.

On May 5,
2006, Xcel Energy filed a second motion for summary judgment. On Aug. 18,
2006, the U.S. government filed a second motion for summary judgment. On Feb. 14,
2007, the Magistrate Judge issued his Report and Recommendation (R&R) to
the Judge concerning both motions. In his R&R the Magistrate Judge
recommends both motions be denied due to fact issues in dispute. Both parties
will have an opportunity to file objections by March 5, 2007 to the
Magistrate Judge’s recommendations. The Judge will then have broad authority
to, among other things, accept or reject the recommendations in whole or in
part. If both sides’ motions are ultimately denied, a trial is set to begin on July 24,
2007.

Xcel Energy
believes that the tax deduction for interest expense on the COLI policy loans
is in full compliance with the tax law. Accordingly, PSRI has not recorded any
provision for income tax or related interest or penalties, and has continued to
take deductions for interest expense on policy loans on its income tax returns
for subsequent years. The litigation could require several years to reach final
resolution. Defense of Xcel Energy’s position may require significant cash
outlays, which may or may not be recoverable in a court proceeding. The
ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and could have a material
adverse effect on Xcel Energy’s financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.

Should the IRS ultimately prevail on this issue, tax and interest
payable through Dec. 31, 2006, would reduce earnings by an estimated $421
million. Xcel Energy has received formal notification that the IRS will seek
penalties. If penalties (plus associated interest) also are included, the total
exposure through Dec. 31, 2006, is approximately $499 million. In
addition, Xcel Energy’s annual earnings for 2007 would be reduced by
approximately $49 million, after tax, or 11 cents per share, if COLI interest
expense deductions were no longer available.

Energy Efficiency and Renewables Law

—

On March 17,
2006, Governor Doyle signed into law 2005 Wisconsin Act 141 containing the
Governor’s Task Force recommendations on energy efficiency and renewables. The
bill sets a statewide renewable portfolio standard (RPS) of 10 percent by 2015
and revises the funding mechanism and administrative responsibilities for the
state’s energy efficiency program.

Two rulemaking dockets were subsequently initiated at the PSCW to
provide the regulatory framework for administering this statute. Docket 1-AC-220
will create Wisconsin Administrative Code PSC Chapter 137 to establish a
structure under which energy utilities collectively establish and fund
statewide energy efficiency and renewable resource programs. The funding
mechanism will include a contribution from the utilities totaling 1.2 percent
of annual operating revenues, which will be fully recoverable in customer rates.
Docket 1-AC-221 will revise Wisconsin Administrative Code PSC
Chapter 118 that allows for the creation and tracking of renewable resource
credits (RRCs). RRCs can be created and used by a utility to meet its renewable
obligation under the recently revised RPS, or sold to another utility for its
use in meeting its RPS requirement. NSP-Wisconsin anticipates it will be able
to meet the RPS with its pro-rata share of existing and planned renewable
generation on the NSP System. Both of these rules are expected to be
adopted in early 2007.

Energy Legislation

—

In 2005, the
Minnesota Legislature passed and the Governor signed an Omnibus Energy Bill,
effective July 1, 2005. Among other things, the new law provides authority
for the MPUC to approve rate rider recovery for transmission investments that
have been approved through a certificate of need, the biennial transmission
plan, or are associated with compliance with the state’s renewable energy
objective. The statute provides that the rate rider may include recovery of the
revenue requirement associated with qualifying projects, including a current
return on construction work in

F-


progress. NSP-Minnesota’s
filing to the MPUC for approval of a new TCR tariff to implement this statute
was approved in 2006 and the filing to establish initial TCR rates is pending
MPUC approval.

The 2005 Texas Legislature passed a law, effective June 18, 2005,
establishing statutory authority for electric utilities outside of the electric
reliability council of Texas in the SPP or the Western Electricity Coordinating
Council to have timely recovery of transmission infrastructure investments. After
notice and hearing, the PUCT may allow recovery on an annual basis of the
reasonable and necessary expenditures for transmission infrastructure
improvement costs and changes in wholesale transmission charges under a tariff
approved by the FERC. In Dec. 2006, PUCT Staff issued a draft rule for
comment. The PUCT will initiate a formal rulemaking for this process in 2007.

Nuclear Obligations

Fuel Disposal

—

NSP-Minnesota is
responsible for temporarily storing used or spent nuclear fuel from its nuclear
plants. The DOE is responsible for permanently storing spent fuel from
NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear plants as well as from other U.S. nuclear plants.
NSP-Minnesota has funded its portion of the DOE’s permanent disposal program
since 1981. The fuel disposal fees are based on a charge of 0.1 cent per
kilowatt-hour sold to customers from nuclear generation. Fuel expense includes
the DOE fuel disposal assessments of approximately $13 million in 2006, $12
million in 2005 and $13 million in 2004. In total, NSP-Minnesota had paid
approximately $360 million to the DOE through Dec. 31, 2006. However, it
is not determinable whether the amount and method of the DOE’s assessments to
all utilities will be sufficient to fully fund the DOE’s permanent storage or
disposal facility.

The Nuclear
Waste Policy Act of 1982 required the DOE to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel
no later than Jan. 31, 1998. In 1996, the DOE notified commercial
spent-fuel owners of an anticipated delay in accepting spent nuclear fuel by
the required date and conceded that a permanent storage or disposal facility
will not be available until at least 2010. NSP-Minnesota and other utilities
have commenced lawsuits against the DOE to recover damages caused by the DOE’s
failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations.

NSP-Minnesota
has its own temporary on-site storage facilities for spent fuel at its
Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants, which consist of storage pools at
both sites and a dry cask facility at Prairie Island. With the dry cask storage
facility licensed by the NRC, approved in 1994 and again in 2003, management
believes it has adequate storage capacity to continue operation of its Prairie
Island nuclear plant until at least the end of its current license terms in
2013 and 2014. The Monticello nuclear plant has storage capacity in the storage
pool to continue operations until 2010. In 2005, NSP-Minnesota filed a
certificate of need to allow interim storage of spent fuel at the Monticello
nuclear plant to support license renewal and operation for an additional 20
years, and in October 2006, the MPUC issued its approval allowing
additional interim spent fuel storage. Minnesota Statutes provide that the MPUC
decision becomes effective June 1, 2007, which allows the legislature the
opportunity to review the MPUC action if desired. All of the alternatives for
spent fuel storage are being investigated until a DOE facility is available,
including pursuing the establishment of a private facility for interim storage
of spent nuclear fuel as part of a consortium of electric utilities.

Nuclear fuel expense includes payments to the DOE for the
decommissioning and decontamination of the DOE’s uranium-enrichment facilities.
In 1993, NSP-Minnesota recorded the DOE’s initial assessment of $46 million,
which is payable in annual installments for 15 years to 2007. NSP-Minnesota is
amortizing each installment to expense on a monthly basis. The most recent
installment paid in 2006 was $4.9 million; future installments are subject to
inflation adjustments under the DOE rules. NSP-Minnesota is obtaining rate
recovery of these DOE assessments through the cost-of-energy adjustment clause
as the assessments are amortized. Accordingly, the unamortized assessment of
$3.7 million at Dec. 31, 2006, is deferred as a regulatory asset.

Regulatory Plant Decommissioning Recovery

—

Decommissioning of
NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear facilities, as last approved by the MPUC, is planned
for the period from cessation of operations through 2050, assuming the prompt
dismantlement method. NSP-Minnesota is currently accruing the regulatory costs
for decommissioning over the MPUC-approved cost-recovery period and including
the accruals in a regulatory liability account. The total decommissioning cost
obligation is recorded as an asset retirement obligation in accordance with
SFAS No. 143.

Monticello
began operation in 1971 with an original license to operate until 2010. Prairie
Island units 1 and 2 began operation in 1973 and 1974, respectively, and are licensed
to operate until 2013 and 2014, respectively. In 2003, the Minnesota
Legislature changed a law that had limited expansion of on-site storage. On
Sept. 28, 2006, the MPUC approved Xcel Energy’s request for a certificate
of need to authorize construction and operation of a dry spent fuel storage
facility at Monticello. Minnesota statutes provide that the order is not
effective until June 1, 2007. The purpose of

F-


the stay is to
give the state legislature the opportunity to review the MPUC action if lawmakers
wish. On Nov. 8, 2006, the NRC renewed the operating license of the
Monticello nuclear plant for an additional 20 years to 2030. Plant assessments
and other work for the Prairie Island applications started in 2006. The Prairie
Island operating license extension for an additional 20 years of operation will
be filed in 2008 with the NRC.

The total
obligation for decommissioning currently is expected to be funded 100 percent
by external funds, as approved by the MPUC. The MPUC last approved
NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear decommissioning study request in March 2006, using
2005 cost data. The MPUC approval decreasing 2006 decommissioning funding for
Minnesota retail customers resulted from an extension of remaining life for the
Monticello unit by 10 years (from 2010 to 2020). Contributions to the external
fund started in 1990 and are expected to continue until plant decommissioning
begins. The assets held in trusts as of Dec. 31, 2006, primarily consisted
of investments in fixed income securities, such as tax-exempt municipal bonds
and U.S. government securities that mature in one to 20 years, and common
stock of public companies. NSP-Minnesota plans to reinvest matured securities
until decommissioning begins.

Consistent
with cost recovery in utility customer rates, NSP-Minnesota records annual
decommissioning accruals based on periodic site-specific cost studies and a
presumed level of dedicated funding. Cost studies quantify decommissioning
costs in current dollars. Current authorized funding presumes that costs will
escalate in the future at a rate of 3.61 percent per year. The total estimated
decommissioning costs that will ultimately be paid, net of income earned by
external trust funds, is currently being accrued using an annuity approach over
the approved plant-recovery period. This annuity approach uses an assumed rate
of return on funding, which is currently 5.4 percent, net of tax, for external
funding. The net unrealized gain on nuclear decommissioning investments is
deferred as a regulatory liability based on the assumed offsetting against
decommissioning costs in current ratemaking treatment.

In 2006, the
Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) fund also recorded the sale of certain
investments in the non-qualified fund and the reinvestment of the proceeds into
the qualified fund. The sale and reinvestment, along with the transfer of
securities was part of a transaction intended to consolidate trust fund
accounts into an income tax advantaged fund, resulting from the Energy Act. The
transfer of funds was completed in the fourth quarter of 2006.

At Dec. 31, 2006, NSP-Minnesota had
recorded and recovered in rates cumulative decommissioning accruals of $1.1 billion.
The following table summarizes the funded status of NSP-Minnesota’s
decommissioning obligation based on approved regulatory recovery parameters.
Xcel Energy believes future decommissioning cost accruals will continue to be
recovered in customer rates. These amounts are not those recorded in the
financial statements for the asset retirement obligation in accordance with
SFAS No. 143.

Negative accruals for internally funded portions in 2004 and 2005
reflect the impact of the 2002 decommissioning study approved in 2003, which
approved an assumption of 100-percent external funding of future costs. The
2005 nuclear decommissioning filing approved in 2006 has been used for the
regulatory presentation and all the updated parameters were used for the 2005
ARO layer for SFAS No. 143 recognition.

Regulatory Assets and
Liabilities

Xcel Energy’s regulated businesses prepare
their Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 71, as discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Under SFAS No. 71, regulatory assets and liabilities can be
created for amounts that regulators may allow to be collected, or may require
to be paid back to customers in future electric and natural gas rates. Any
portion of Xcel Energy’s business that is not regulated cannot use SFAS No. 71
accounting. If changes in the utility industry or the business of Xcel Energy
no longer allow for the application of SFAS No. 71 under GAAP, Xcel
Energy would be required to recognize the write-off of regulatory assets and
liabilities in its statement of income. The components of unamortized
regulatory assets and liabilities of continuing operations shown on the balance
sheet at Dec. 31 are:

Segments and Related
Information

Xcel Energy has the following reportable segments: Regulated Electric
Utility, Regulated Natural Gas Utility and All Other.

·

Xcel
Energy’s Regulated Electric Utility segment generates, transmits and
distributes electricity in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, South
Dakota, Colorado, Texas and New Mexico. In addition, this segment includes
sales for resale and provides wholesale transmission service to various
entities in the United States. Regulated Electric Utility also includes
commodity trading operations.

In October 2005, SPS reached a definitive agreement to sell its
delivery system operations in Oklahoma, Kansas and a small portion of Texas to
Tri-County Electric Cooperative. Effective July 31, 2006, SPS completed
the sale to Tri-County Electric Cooperative for $24.5 million and a gain of
$6.1 million was recognized. SPS now provides wholesale service to Tri-County
Electric Cooperative.

·

Xcel
Energy’s Regulated Natural Gas Utility segment transports, stores and
distributes natural gas primarily in portions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North
Dakota, Michigan and Colorado.

Revenues from
operating segments not included above are below the necessary quantitative
thresholds and are therefore included in the All Other category. Those
primarily include steam revenue, appliance repair services, nonutility real
estate activities, revenues associated with processing solid waste into
refuse-derived fuel and investments in rental housing projects that qualify for
low-income housing tax credits.

To report income from continuing operations for Regulated Electric and
Regulated Natural Gas Utility segments, Xcel Energy must assign or allocate all
costs and certain other income. In general, costs are:

·

directly
assigned wherever applicable;

·

allocated
based on cost causation allocators wherever applicable; and

·

allocated
based on a general allocator for all other costs not assigned by the above two
methods.

The accounting policies of the segments are
the same as those described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
These segments are managed separately because the revenue streams are dependent
upon regulated rate recovery, which are separately determined for each segment.
Xcel Energy evaluates performance by each legal entity based on profit or loss
generated from the product or service provided.

Item 9 — Changes in and Disagreements
With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

During 2005 and 2006, and through the date of this report, there were
no disagreements with the independent public accountants on accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosures, or auditing scope or
procedures.

Item 9A — Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Xcel Energy maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that it
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and
forms. In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures ensure that
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to
management, including the chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial
officer (CFO), allowing timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of Dec. 31,
2006, based on an evaluation carried out under the supervision and with the
participation of Xcel Energy’s management, including the CEO and the CFO, of
the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and the procedures, the CEO and
CFO have concluded that Xcel Energy’s disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

No change in
Xcel Energy’s internal control over financial reporting has occurred during the
most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, Xcel Energy’s internal control over financial
reporting.

Xcel Energy maintains internal control over financial reporting to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial
reporting. Xcel Energy has evaluated and documented its controls in process
activities, in general computer activities, and on an entity-wide level. During
the year and in preparation for issuing its report for the year ended Dec. 31,
2006 on internal controls under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, Xcel Energy conducted testing and monitoring of its internal control over
financial reporting. Based on the control evaluation, testing and remediation

F-


performed, Xcel Energy did not identify any material control
weaknesses, as defined under the standards and rules issued by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and as approved by the SEC and as
indicated in Management Report on Internal Controls herein. Xcel Energy has
concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective.
