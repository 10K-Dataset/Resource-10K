DEFINITION OF ABBREVIATIONS AND INDUSTRY TERMS






COMPANY OVERVIEW

Xcel Energy was incorporated
under the laws of Minnesota in 1909 and is a registered holding company under
the PUHCA. Xcel Energy is subject to the regulatory oversight of the SEC under
PUHCA. The rules and regulations under PUHCA impose a number of restrictions on
the operations of registered holding company systems. These restrictions include,
subject to certain exceptions, a requirement that the SEC approve securities
issuances, payments of dividends out of capital or unearned surplus, sales and
acquisitions of utility assets or of securities of utility companies and
acquisitions of other businesses. PUHCA also generally limits the operations of
a registered holding company to a single integrated public utility system, plus
additional energy-related businesses. PUHCA rules require that transactions
between affiliated companies in a registered holding company system be
performed at cost, with limited exceptions. See additional discussion of PUHCA
requirements under Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations and
Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management’s Discussion and Analysis under
Item 7.

In 2004, Xcel Energy
continuing operations included the activity of four wholly owned utility
subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in 10 states. These
utility subsidiaries are NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS. These
utilities serve customers in portions of Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota,
New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin.  Along with WestGas InterState Inc. (WGI), an
interstate natural gas pipeline company, these companies comprise our
continuing regulated utility operations. 
Discontinued utility operations include the activity of Viking, which
was sold in January 2003; BMG, which was sold in October 2003; and Cheyenne,
which was sold in January 2005.

Xcel Energy’s nonregulated
subsidiaries in continuing operations include UE, Eloigne and Planergy. Planergy
closed and began selling a majority of its business operations in 2003 with all
operations ceasing in 2004. On March 2, 2005, Xcel Energy agreed to sell UE. See
further discussion under Nonregulated Subsidiaries.

During 2004, Xcel Energy’s
board of directors approved management’s plan to pursue the sale of Seren Innovations,
Inc. (broadband communications services). Earnings per share for 2004 of $0.87 includes
revisions to the impairment reserve associated with Seren, as well as the
completed sale of Cheyenne, compared to the previously reported earnings per
share of $0.97.

During 2003, Xcel Energy
divested its ownership interest in NRG. On May 14, 2003, NRG and certain of its
affiliates filed for bankruptcy to restructure their debt.  As a result of the reorganization, Xcel
Energy relinquished its ownership interest in NRG.  Xcel Energy made payments of $752 million to
NRG in 2004.  During 2003, the board of
directors of Xcel Energy also approved management’s plan to exit certain
businesses conducted by the nonregulated subsidiaries Xcel Energy International
Inc. (an international independent power producer, primarily in Argentina) and
e prime inc. (a natural gas marketing and trading company).  NRG, Xcel Energy International, e prime and
Seren are accounted for as a component of discontinued operations.

For more information
regarding Xcel Energy’s discontinued operations, see Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Xcel Energy’s executive
offices are located at 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minn. 55402.  Its Web site address is
www.xcelenergy.com.  Xcel Energy makes
available, free of charge through its Web site, its annual report on Form 10-K,

material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  In addition, the Xcel Energy Guidelines on
Corporate Governance and Code of Conduct also are available on its Web site.

NSP-Minnesota

NSP-Minnesota was
incorporated in 2000 under the laws of Minnesota. Prior to 2000, the regulated
utility operations currently conducted by NSP-Minnesota were conducted by the
legal entity now operating under the name Xcel Energy. NSP-Minnesota is an
operating utility engaged in the generation, purchase, transmission,
distribution and sale of electricity in Minnesota, North Dakota and South
Dakota.  NSP-Minnesota also purchases,
transports, distributes and sells natural gas to retail customers and
transports customer-owned natural gas in Minnesota and North Dakota.  NSP-Minnesota provides electric utility
service to approximately 1.4 million customers and gas utility service to
approximately 454,000 customers.

The electric production and
transmission system of NSP-Minnesota is managed as an integrated system with
that of NSP-Wisconsin, jointly referred to as the NSP System. The electric
production and transmission costs of the entire NSP System are shared by
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin.  A
FERC-approved agreement between the two companies, called the Interchange
Agreement, provides for the sharing of all costs of generation and transmission
facilities of the NSP System, including capital costs.


NSP-Minnesota owns the
following direct subsidiaries: United Power and Land Co., which holds real
estate; and NSP Nuclear Corp., which holds NSP-Minnesota’s interest in the
NMC.  NSP-Minnesota owned NSP Financing
I, a special purpose financing trust, for which a certificate of cancellation
was filed for dissolution on Sept. 15, 2003.

NSP-Wisconsin

NSP-Wisconsin was
incorporated in 1901 under the laws of Wisconsin. NSP-Wisconsin is an operating
utility engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
to approximately 240,000 customers in portions of northwestern Wisconsin and in
the western portion of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. NSP-Wisconsin also
purchases, transports, distributes and sells natural gas to retail customers
and transports customer-owned natural gas in the same service territory to
approximately 97,000 customers.  See the
discussion of the integrated management of the electric production and
transmission system of NSP-Wisconsin under NSP-Minnesota, discussed previously.

NSP-Wisconsin owns the
following direct subsidiaries: Chippewa and Flambeau Improvement Co., which
operates hydro reservoirs; Clearwater Investments Inc., which owns interests in
affordable housing; and NSP Lands, Inc., which holds real estate.

PSCo

PSCo was incorporated in
1924 under the laws of Colorado. PSCo is an operating utility engaged primarily
in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of
electricity.  PSCo also purchases,
transports, distributes and sells natural gas to retail customers and
transports customer-owned natural gas. 
PSCo serves approximately 1.3 million electric customers and
approximately 1.2 million natural gas customers in Colorado.

PSCo owns the following
direct subsidiaries: 1480 Welton, Inc., which owns certain real estate
interests for PSCo; PSRI, which owns and manages permanent life insurance
policies on certain current and former employees; and Green and Clear Lakes
Company, which owns water rights. PSCo also holds a controlling interest in
several other relatively small ditch and water companies whose capital
requirements are not significant. PS Colorado Credit Corp., a finance company
that was owned by PSCo and financed certain of PSCo’s current assets, was
dissolved in 2002. PSCo owned PSCo Capital Trust I, a special purpose financing
trust, for which a certificate of cancellation was filed for dissolution on
Dec. 29, 2003.

SPS

SPS was incorporated in 1921
under the laws of New Mexico. SPS is an operating utility engaged primarily in
the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity.
SPS serves approximately 395,000 electric customers in portions of Texas, New
Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas. The wholesale customers served by SPS comprise
approximately 35 percent of the total Kwh sales in 2004.  A major portion of SPS’ retail electric
operating revenues is derived from operations in Texas.  SPS owned a direct subsidiary, Southwestern
Public Service Capital I, a special purpose financing trust, for which a
certificate of cancellation was filed for dissolution on Jan. 5, 2004.

Other
Regulated Subsidiaries

Utility Trends

Overview

Utility Industry Growth

— After a decade of cost cutting and efficiency gains in anticipation
of industry restructuring and competition; areas of growth for the utility industry
are limited.  The most significant areas
for earnings growth include increasing regulated rates, increased investment in
rate base, diversification, acquisition or modification of rate structures to
implement performance-based rates. 
Though remaining open to all opportunities to increase shareholder
value, Xcel Energy intends to focus on growing through investments in electric
and natural gas rate base to meet growing customer demands and to maintain or
increase reliability and quality of service to customers and rate case filings
with state and federal regulators to increase rates congruent with increasing
costs of operations associated with such investments.

Utility Restructuring and Retail Competition

—
The structure of the utility industry has been subject to change.  Merger and acquisition activity in the past
had been significant as utilities combined to capture economies of scale or
establish a strategic niche in preparing for the future, although such activity
slowed substantially after 2001.  All
investor-owned utilities were required to provide nondiscriminatory access to
the use of their transmission systems in 1996. 
Beginning in the late 1990s, many states began studying or implementing
some form of retail electric utility competition.  These states included many of the
jurisdictions in which the Xcel Energy Utility Subsidiaries operate.  Much of Texas has implemented retail
competition, but it is presently limited to utilities within the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas.  Under the
current law, SPS can file a plan to implement competition, subject to
regulatory approval, in Texas on or after Jan. 1, 2007.  However, SPS has no plan to implement retail
competition in its service area.  In
2002, NSP-Wisconsin began providing its Michigan electric customers with the
opportunity to select an alternative electric energy provider.  To date, no NSP-Wisconsin customers have
selected an alternative electric energy provider.  As a result of the failure of the California
power market structure and nonregulated investments of many utilities, as well
as other factors, most utility retail market restructuring has ceased.  No significant activity has occurred or is
expected to occur in the retail jurisdictions in which Xcel Energy Utility
Subsidiaries operate, except as noted previously.

The
retail electric business does face some competition as industrial and large
commercial customers have some ability to own or operate facilities to generate
their own electricity. In addition, customers may have the option of
substituting other fuels, such as natural gas or steam/chilled water for
heating, cooling and manufacturing purposes, or the option of relocating their
facilities to a lower cost region.  While
each of Xcel Energy’s Utility Subsidiaries face these challenges, these
subsidiaries believe their rates are competitive with currently available
alternatives.

Summary
of Recent Federal Regulatory Developments

The FERC has jurisdiction
over rates for electric transmission service in interstate commerce and
electric energy sold at wholesale, hydro facility licensing, accounting
practices and certain other activities of Xcel Energy’s Uutility
Subsidiaries.  State and local agencies
have jurisdiction over many of Xcel Energy’s activities, including regulation
of retail rates and environmental matters.


Market Based Rate Authority

— The FERC regulates the wholesale sale of
electricity.  In addition to FERC’s
traditional cost of service methodology for determining the rates allowed to be
charged for wholesale electric sales, in the 1990’s FERC began to allow
utilities to make sales at market-based rates. 
In order to obtain market-based rate authorization from the FERC,
utilities such as the Utility Subsidiaries have been required to submit
analyses demonstrating that they did not have market power in the relevant
markets.  Xcel Energy and the Utility
Subsidiaries have been granted market-based rate authority by FERC.

In November 2001, after the
market disruptions in California and other regions, the FERC issued an order
under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act initiating a generic investigation
proceeding against all jurisdictional electric suppliers making sales in
interstate commerce at market-based rates. 
In November 2003, the FERC issued a final order requiring amendments to
the market-based wholesale tariffs of all FERC jurisdictional electric
utilities to impose new market behavior rules and requiring submission of
compliance tariff amendments in December 2003. 
NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS each made a timely compliance
filing.  Violations of the new tariffs
could result in the loss of certain wholesale sales revenues or the loss of
authority to make sales at market-based rates.

In 2004, FERC initiated a
new proceeding on future market-based rate authorizations and issued interim
requirements for FERC jurisdictional electric utilities that have been granted
authority to make wholesale sales at market-based rates.  The FERC adopted a new interim methodology to
assess generation market power and modified measures to mitigate market power
where it is found.  The FERC upheld and
clarified the interim requirements on rehearing in an order issued on July 8,
2004.  This methodology is to be applied
to all initial market-based rate applications and triennial reviews.  Under this methodology, the FERC has adopted
two indicative screens (an uncommitted pivotal supplier analysis and an
uncommitted market share analysis) to assess market power.  Passage of the two screens creates a
rebuttable presumption that an applicant does not have market power, while the
failure creates a rebuttable presumption that the utility does have market
power.  An applicant or intervenor can
rebut the presumption by performing a more extensive delivered-price test
analysis.  If an applicant is determined
to have generation market power, the applicant has the opportunity to propose
its own mitigation plan or may implement default mitigation established by the
FERC.  The default mitigation limits
prices for sales of power to cost-based rates within areas where an applicant
is found to have market power.

As required by the FERC,
Xcel Energy filed the required analysis applying the FERC’s two indicative
screens on behalf of itself and the Utility Subsidiaries with the FERC on Feb.
7, 2005.  This analysis demonstrated that
all of the Utility Subsidiaries, with the exception of PSCo, passed the pivotal
supplier analysis in their own control areas and all adjacent markets, but that
all failed the market share analysis in their own control areas, and in the
case of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin, which jointly operate a single control
area and accordingly are analyzed as one company, in certain adjacent markets.  It is accordingly expected that the FERC will
set the market-rate authorizations for the Utility Subsidiaries and Xcel Energy
for investigation and hearing under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  At that time, the Utility Subsidiaries expect
to submit a delivered-price test analysis to support the continuance of
market-based rate authority in their control areas.  Xcel Energy also expects that upon the
commencement of the MISO Day 2 market (see Electric Transmission Rate
Regulation, below for further discussion), NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin will
be analyzed as part of the larger MISO market, and that those companies will
pass both of the FERC’s indicative screens in the larger MISO market.  Xcel Energy does not expect the mitigation
measures imposed, if any, to have a significant financial impact on its
commodity marketing operations.

In order to enable it and
interested parties to monitor each individual utility’s market-based rate
authority, the FERC on Feb. 10, 2005 issued a final rule requiring that a
utility with market-based rate authority file reports notifying the FERC of
changes in status (

e.g.

,
additions of certain generating resources) that reflect a departure from the
characteristics that the FERC relied upon in granting that utility market-based
rate authority within thirty days of the occurrence of a triggering event.

Electric Transmission Rate Regulation

— The FERC also regulates the rates charged
and terms and conditions for electric transmission services.  Since 1996, the FERC has required the Utility
Subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at rates and tariffs
on file with the FERC.  In addition, FERC
policy encourages utilities to turn over the functional control over their
electric transmission assets and the related responsibility for the sale of
electric transmission services to an RTO. 
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin are members of the MISO, which began RTO
operations in early 2002.  SPS is a
member of the SPP, which proposes to begin RTO operations in October 2005.  SPS has been a member of SPP’s regional
transmission tariff since 2001.  Each RTO
separately files for regional transmission tariff rates for approval by
FERC.  All members within that RTO are
then subjected to those rates.  PSCo is
currently participating with other utilities in the development of an RTO.

Generation Interconnection Rules —

In August 2003, the FERC issued final rules
requiring the standardization of generation interconnection procedures and
agreements for interconnection of new electric generators of 20 megawatts or
more to the transmission systems of all FERC-jurisdictional electric utilities,
including Xcel Energy’s Utility Subsidiaries. The FERC also established pricing
rules for interconnections and related transmission system upgrades, which
allow the transmission-owning utility to require the


interconnecting customer to
fund the interconnection costs and network upgrades required by the new
generator, but require the transmission utility to provide transmission service
credits, with interest, for the full amount of prepayment. The FERC required
compliance filings for detailing proposed changes to Xcel Energy Utility
Subsidiaries’ tariff, the MISO regional tariff, and the SPP regional tariff,
which will govern most generation interconnections to the Xcel Energy Utility
Subsidiaries’ transmission system.  I

n
October 2004, the FERC accepted proposed tariff changes for Xcel Energy’s
Utility Subsidiaries, subject to certain conditions.  In November 2004, the Utility Subsidiaries
submitted a compliance filing.  In
December 2004, the FERC issued further modifications to the interconnection
rules on rehearing and required Xcel Energy’s Utility Subsidiaries to submit a
further compliance filing by February 2005. 
The required compliance filing was submitted on Feb. 18, 2005.

NSP-Minnesota

Ratemaking
Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction

— Retail rates, services and other aspects of
NSP-Minnesota’s operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPUC, the
NDPSC and the SDPUC within their respective states. The MPUC has regulatory
authority over aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s financial activities, including
security issuances, certain property transfers, mergers with other utilities
and transactions between NSP-Minnesota and its affiliates. In addition, the
MPUC reviews and approves NSP-Minnesota’s electric resource plans for meeting
customers’ future energy needs. The MPUC also certifies the need for generating
plants greater than 50 MW and transmission lines greater than 100 KV.
NSP-Minnesota is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to its
wholesale electric operations, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale
and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. NSP-Minnesota has
received authorization from the FERC to make wholesale electric sales at
market-based prices and is a transmission-owner member of the MISO RTO.

The MEQB is empowered to
select and designate sites for new power plants with a capacity of 50 MW or
more and wind energy conversion plants with a capacity of five MW or more. It
also designates routes for electric transmission lines with a capacity of 100
KV or more. No power plant or transmission line may be constructed in Minnesota
except on a site or route designated by the MEQB. The NDPSC and SDPUC have
regulatory authority over the need for certain generating and transmission
facilities, and the siting and routing of certain new generation and
transmission facilities in North Dakota and South Dakota, respectively.

Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation Cost Recovery Mechanisms

— NSP-Minnesota’s retail electric rate
schedules in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota jurisdictions include a
FCA that provides for monthly adjustments to billings and revenues for changes
in prudently incurred cost of fuel, fuel related items and purchased
energy.  NSP-Minnesota is permitted to
recover these costs through FCA mechanisms individually approved by the
regulators in each jurisdiction.  The FCA
mechanisms allow NSP-Minnesota to bill customers for the cost of fuel and fuel
related costs used to generate electricity at its plants and energy purchased
from other suppliers.  In general,
capacity costs are not recovered through the FCA.  NSP-Minnesota’s electric wholesale customers
also have a FCA provision in their contracts.

The MPUC has opened an
investigation to consider the continuing usefulness of fuel clause adjustments
for electric utilities in Minnesota.  No
action has been proposed.  The MPUC has
the authority to disallow recovery of certain costs if it finds the utility was
not prudent in its procurement activities.

NSP-Minnesota is required by
Minnesota law to spend a minimum of 2 percent of Minnesota electric revenue on
conservation improvement programs.  These
costs are recovered through an annual cost recovery mechanism for electric
conservation and energy management program expenditures. NSP-Minnesota is
required to request a new cost recovery level annually.

Performance-Based Regulation

— In December 2003, the MPUC voted to approve
NSP-Minnesota’s MERP proposal to convert two coal-fueled electric generating
plants to natural gas, and to install advanced pollution control equipment at a
third coal-fired plant.  All three plants
are located in the Minneapolis - St. Paul metropolitan area. These improvements
are expected to significantly reduce air emissions from these facilities, while
increasing the capacity at system peak by 300 MW. The projects are expected to
come on line between 2007 and 2009, at a cumulative investment of approximately
$1 billion.  The MPUC also approved
NSP-Minnesota’s proposal to recover prudent costs of the projects through a
rate adjustment provision applicable to retail electric rates beginning Jan. 1,
2006, including a rate of return on the construction work in progress.  The MPUC approval has a sliding ROE scale
based on actual construction cost compared with a target level of construction
costs (based on an equity ratio of 48.5 percent and debt of 51.5 percent) to
incentivize NSP-Minnesota to control construction costs.


Pending
and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings

- FERC

MISO
Operations

—

In August 2000, NSP-Minnesota and
NSP-Wisconsin joined the MISO. In December 2001, the FERC approved the MISO as
the first RTO in the United States under FERC Order No. 2000. On Feb. 1, 2002,
the MISO began interim operations, including regional transmission tariff
administration services for the NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin electric
transmission systems. In 2002, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin received all
required regulatory approvals to transfer functional control of their high
voltage (100 KVand above) transmission systems to the MISO. The MISO membership
grants MISO functional control over the operations of these facilities and the
facilities of certain neighboring electric utilities.

On March 31, 2004, the MISO
filed its proposed TEMT, which would establish regional wholesale energy
markets using locational marginal cost pricing and FTRs.  NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin’s generation
plants and transmission systems would operate subject to the TEMT.  The MISO proposed a Dec. 1, 2004 effective
date.

On May 26, 2004, the FERC
issued an initial procedural order.  The
FERC found that certain pre-Order 888 “grandfathered” agreements (GFAs) for
transmission service could negatively affect implementation of the TEMT, so
FERC delayed the effective date of the energy market to March 1, 2005.  NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin submitted
compliance filings regarding their approximately 50 GFAs on June 25, 2004.  Approximately 10 GFAs were disputed, and
hearings were held June 30, 2004 and July 1, 2004.  The other GFAs are not disputed.  The primary disputed issues related to
responsibility for TEMT charges for loads served under the GFAs.  On Sept. 16, 2004, the FERC issued an order
ruling that certain GFAs would be “carved out” of the MISO market but that
transmission owners would be subject to the TEMT charges for other GFAs.  The FERC has not issued a final decision on
rehearing.  On Jan. 13, 2005, several
transmission-owning members of the MISO, including NSP-Minnesota and
NSP-Wisconsin, filed revisions to the MISO tariff to recover TEMT charges from
the customers subject to the “carved out” GFAs, effective March 1, 2005.  NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin expect to
file for rate changes under certain GFAs to recover TEMT charges from these GFA
customers later in 2005.

On Aug. 6, 2004, after
completion of the GFA hearings and submission of the ALJ report, the FERC
issued its initial substantive order regarding the TEMT.  The FERC approved the TEMT and reaffirmed the
March 1, 2005 effective date, but ordered various changes to the filed
tariff.  On Sept. 7, 2004, numerous
requests for rehearing were filed contesting various FERC decisions.  On Nov. 8, 2004, the FERC issued its order on
rehearing largely upholding the August 6

th

order.  On or before Jan. 6, 2005, several appeals of
the two FERC orders were filed with the District of Columbia Court of
Appeals.  Xcel Energy does not believe
the outcome of the appeals will have a material financial impact.  In addition, various parties, including
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin, have documented their concerns to MISO
regarding MISO’s readiness to initiate the new energy market on March 1,
2005.  On Jan. 27, 2005, MISO announced a
delay in the full market start date until April 1, 2005.

Xcel Energy opposes certain
aspects of the TEMT-related implementation practices as presently designed, and
believes the MISO should implement the new market mechanisms only after it
demonstrates that it has fully developed all operating procedures necessary to
protect reliability.  Xcel Energy cannot
at this time estimate the total financial impact of the new market
structure.  Xcel Energy also cannot
predict at this time whether the numerous remaining issues will be resolved in
time to allow the MISO market to commence on the new April 1, 2005 start date,
as proposed.

Wisconsin
Public Service Corp. vs. MISO

— On Dec. 27, 2004, Wisconsin Public Service Corp. (WPS) filed a
complaint with the FERC alleging that certain FTRs allocated to NSP-Minnesota
in MISO’s FTR nomination and allocation process, associated with the
implementation of the new MISO TEMT, improperly granted NSP-Minnesota FTRs to
the detriment of WPS.  WPS alleged the
FTR allocation to NSP-Minnesota would increase costs to WPS and its customers.  WPS requested accelerated processing of the
complaint.  On Jan. 15, 2005, MISO and
NSP-Minnesota filed answers asking that the WPS complaint be dismissed.  The complaint is now pending resolution by
the FERC.  In a related matter, WPS
appealed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia previous FERC
orders upholding NSP-Minnesota’s right to the underlying transmission service
at issue in the MISO FTR allocation.  The
appeal is scheduled to be heard by the court in April 2005.


MISO Long
Term Pricing

—

On Nov. 18, 2004, FERC issued an order
approving portions of a plan providing for continued use of “license plate”
rates for the MISO/PJM region, but rejecting proposed transition payments.  FERC instead ordered the MISO and PJM to file
a Seams Elimination Charge Adjustment (SECA) transition mechanism.  The replacement compliance filings were
submitted Nov. 24, 2004, to be effective December 1, 2004.  The FERC order eliminates any transition
payments and the SECA filings instead provide for both revenues and payments
that net to approximately $117,000 in revenues per month to NSP-Minnesota and
NSP-Wisconsin in the first three months of 2005.  MISO and PJM are required to update the SECA
charges effective April 1, 2005.  The
magnitude of the new charges and payments is unknown at this time, but is
expected to be similar to the charges and payments for the first three months
of 2005.

Various parties sought
rehearing of the Nov. 18, 2004 order and/or filed objections to the Nov. 24,
2004 SECA compliance filings.  On Feb.
10, 2005, the FERC issued an order accepting the SECA filings effective Dec. 1,
2004, subject to refund, and set the proposals for hearings.  Therefore, the final resolution of the SECA
issue and its impact on NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin, is not fully known at
this time.

Pending
and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings

- MPUC

Minnesota Service Quality Investigation

— In 2002, the MPUC directed the Office of the
Attorney General and the Minnesota Department of Commerce (state agencies) to
investigate the accuracy of NSP-Minnesota’s electric reliability records, which
are summarized and reported to the MPUC on a monthly and annual basis, subject
to penalty for not meeting threshold requirements, under the terms of the
merger settlement agreements.

In 2003, NSP-Minnesota and
the state agencies announced that they had reached a settlement agreement,
which was approved with modifications by the MPUC in January 2004.  The settlement required NSP-Minnesota to
refund $1 million to customers in Minnesota, which was paid in 2004.  In addition, it required NSP-Minnesota to
incur at least $15 million of costs for actions to improve system reliability
above amounts being recovered in 2004 rates by Jan. 1, 2005, for which $19 million
was expended in 2004.  The MPUC modified
the settlement to include an additional under-performance payment for any
future finding of inaccurate reliability data.

NRG Tax Complaint

—

In
November 2003, an NSP-Minnesota customer filed a complaint with the MPUC
alleging that ratepayers are entitled to a share of the tax benefits
attributable to NRG. The customer subsequently supplemented this complaint with
sufficient signatures from customers to warrant a formal complaint process by
the MPUC. NSP-Minnesota responded to the complaint, arguing that the requested
treatment is not allowed by law and is inconsistent with the MPUC’s directives
to ensure full separation of NSP-Minnesota and NRG. In August 2004, the MPUC
decided not to pursue this complaint. The MPUC affirmed the long-standing
precedent to view each utility as a stand-alone business that does not
experience positive or negative effects from its affiliates.  The customer filed an appeal of this decision
on Jan. 7, 2005, and NSP-Minnesota filed a responsive statement of the case on
Jan. 18, 2005.  The Attorney General’s
office petitioned to file an advisory brief to the customer’s case.

Renewable
Transmission Cost Recovery —

In 2002, NSP-Minnesota filed for MPUC approval to establish an RCR
adjustment mechanism to recover the costs of transmission investments incurred
to deliver renewable energy resources. 
The RCR adjustment mechanism provides for annual filings to set the RCR
adjustment rates using updated transmission cost information.  The MPUC approved the RCR adjustment
mechanism and the two-phase filing mechanism in April 2003.  In February 2004, the MPUC conditionally
approved the initial Phase 1 facility eligibility determination filing.  NSP-Minnesota then filed for approval to
recover annual additional transmission costs from May 2004 to December 2004,
which were approximately $6 million. The request was approved and the RCR was
implemented Dec. 1, 2004.  NSP-Minnesota
collected approximately $0.2 million in 2004. 
NSP-Minnesota submitted a filing to determine the eligibility of
additional transmission projects and to establish the RCR factors for 2005 in
February 2005, seeking recovery of $12.9 million of additional revenues in
2005.

Time-of-Use
Pilot Project —

As
required by MPUC orders, NSP-Minnesota has been working to develop a
time-of-use pilot project that would attempt to measure customer response and
conservation potential of such a program. This pilot project explores providing
customers with pricing signals and information that could better inform
customers about their use of electricity and its costs. NSP-Minnesota has
petitioned the MPUC for recovery of program costs. The 2002 program costs were
approximately $2 million. The Department of Commerce has supported deferred
accounting to provide for recovery of prudent, otherwise unrecovered and
appropriate costs, subject to a normal prudence review process. The Office of
the Attorney General has argued that cost recovery should be denied for several
reasons. A MPUC hearing was held in January 2004 and requested NSP-Minnesota to
further substantiate the prudence and appropriateness of the costs
incurred.  The MPUC has voted to allow
recovery of the program costs.  An order
of the


MPUC is expected in early
2005.

MISO Cost
Recovery Petition

—
On Dec. 18, 2004, NSP-Minnesota filed a petition to seek recovery of all net
costs associated with the implementation of the MISO TEMT through its FCA
mechanism.  Under the current mechanism,
NSP-Minnesota is allowed full recovery of its fuel and purchased energy
costs.  The proposal would allow recovery
of locational marginal pricing market costs, including congestion and marginal
loss costs, which would be netted by FTR revenues and revenues received that
are related to marginal compensation loss costs, as well as MISO energy market
operations costs.  NSP-Minnesota has
sought recovery effective with the beginning of the Day 2 energy market,
scheduled for April 1, 2005 and the deferral of costs incurred prior to MPUC
action.  A decision is expected in the
second quarter of 2005.

Capacity
and Demand

Assuming normal weather
during 2005, system peak demand for the NSP System’s electric utility for each
of the last three years and the forecast for 2005 is listed below.

The peak demand for the NSP
System typically occurs in the summer. The 2004 system peak demand for the NSP
System occurred on July 21, 2004.

Energy
Sources and Related Initiatives

NSP-Minnesota expects to use
existing electric generating stations; purchases from other utilities,
independent power producers and power marketers; demand-side management options
and phased expansion of existing generation at select power plants to meet its
net dependable system capacity requirements.

Purchased Power

— NSP-Minnesota has contractual arrangements to purchase power from
other utilities and nonregulated energy suppliers. Capacity, typically measured
in KW or MW, is the measure of the rate at which a particular generating source
produces electricity. Energy, typically measured in Kwh or Mwh, is a measure of
the amount of electricity produced from a particular generating source over a
period of time. Long-term purchase power contracts typically require a periodic
payment to secure the capacity from a particular generating source and a charge
for the associated energy actually purchased from such generating source.

NSP-Minnesota also makes
short-term firm and non-firm purchases to replace generation from company-owned
units that are unavailable due to maintenance and unplanned outages, to provide
each utility’s reserve obligation, to obtain energy at a lower cost than that
which could be produced by other resource options, including company-owned
generation and/or long-term purchase power contracts, and for various other
operating requirements.

NSP System Resource Plan

— On Nov. 1, 2004, NSP-Minnesota filed its 2004 resource plan with
MPUC.  The resource plan projects a need
for an additional 3,100 MW of electricity resources during the next 15 years,
based on an anticipated growth in demand of 1.61 percent annually, or
approximately 170 MW per year, during the period.  The resource plan:

•

identifies the need for adding up to 1,125 MW
of new base-load electricity generation by 2015;

•

recommends a new resource acquisition process
that includes multiple options for consideration, including generation built by
NSP-Minnesota;

•

recommends increasing energy-saving goals for
demand-side energy management programs by nearly 17 percent;

•

recommends extending the operating licenses
for the Prairie Island and Monticello nuclear plants by 20 years (on Jan. 18,
2005, NSP-Minnesota applied for a certificate of need in Minnesota for a dry
spent-fuel storage facility at the Monticello plant, and plans to file an
application with the federal government to extend the Monticello plant’s
license and to make similar filings for the Prairie Island plant in 2008);

•

assumes nearly 1,700 MW of wind power with
most developed on NSP-Minnesota’s system;

•

identifies the need for obtaining up to 550
MW of new power resources for peak usage times by 2015 depending on the amount
and timing of any base-load resources acquired; and

•

cites the importance of ensuring that
sufficient transmission resources are available to move electricity from
generation sources.


The MPUC initially
established a comment period on NSP-Minnesota’s proposed resource acquisition
strategy with comments due Dec. 28, 2004 and reply comments due Jan. 17,
2005.  The Department of Commerce has
requested an extension to June 1, 2005 to file comments on the overall resource
plan.  NSP-Minnesota did not object to
this request.

NSP-Minnesota Transmission Certificates of Need

— In December 2001, NSP-Minnesota proposed
construction of various transmission system upgrades to provide transmission
outlet capacity for up to 825 MW of renewable energy generation (wind and
biomass) being constructed in southwest and western Minnesota. In March 2003,
the MPUC granted four certificates of need to NSP-Minnesota, thereby approving
construction, subject to certain conditions. The initial projected cost of the
transmission upgrades was approximately $160 million.  The MEQB granted a routing permit for the
first major transmission facilities in the development program in 2004.  The remaining route permit proceedings are
underway and expected to be completed in 2005. 
In 2003, the MPUC also approved an RCR adjustment that allows
NSP-Minnesota to recover the revenue requirements associated with certain
transmission investments associated with delivery of renewable energy resources
through an automatic adjustment mechanism that started in 2004.  See the Pending and Recently Concluded
Regulatory Proceedings — MPUC, Renewable Transmission Cost Recovery section for
further discussion.

Purchased Transmission Services

—NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contractual
arrangements with MISO to deliver power and energy to NSP System native load
customers, which are retail and wholesale load obligations with terms of more
than one year.  Point-to-point
transmission services typically include a charge for the specific amount of
transmission capacity being reserved, although some agreements may base charges
on the amount of metered energy delivered. Network transmission services
include a charge for the metered demand at the delivery point at the time of
the provider’s monthly transmission system peak, usually calculated as a
12-month rolling average.

Nuclear Power Operations and Waste Disposal -

NSP-Minnesota owns two nuclear generating
plants: the Monticello plant and the Prairie Island plant. See additional
discussion regarding the nuclear generating plants at Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nuclear power plant
operation produces gaseous, liquid and solid radioactive substances. The
discharge and handling of such substances are controlled by federal
regulation.  High-level radioactive
substances primarily include used nuclear fuel. Low-level radioactive substance
consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags,
tools and equipment that have become contaminated through use in the plant.

Low-Level
Radioactive Waste Disposal

—

Federal law places responsibility on each
state for disposal of its low-level radioactive substance. Low-level
radioactive substance from NSP-Minnesota’s Monticello and Prairie Island
nuclear plants is currently disposed of at the Barnwell facility located in
South Carolina (all classes of low-level substance), and the Clive facility
located in Utah (class A low-level substance only). Chem Nuclear is the owner
and operator of the Barnwell facility, which has been given authorization by
South Carolina to accept low-level radioactive substance from out of
state.  Envirocare, Inc. operates the
Clive facility.  NSP-Minnesota has an
annual contract with Barnwell, while NSP-Minnesota uses the Envirocare facility
through various low-level substance processors. 
NSP-Minnesota has low-level storage capacity available on-site at
Prairie Island and Monticello that would allow both plants to continue to
operate until the end of their licensed lives, if off-site low-level disposal
facilities were not available to NSP-Minnesota.

High-Level
Radioactive Waste Disposal

—

The federal government has the responsibility
to dispose of, or permanently store, domestic spent nuclear fuel and other
high-level radioactive substances. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the
DOE to implement a program for nuclear substance management. This includes the
siting, licensing, construction and operation of a repository for domestically
produced spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors and other
high-level radioactive substances at a permanent storage or disposal facility.
The DOE has accepted none of NSP-Minnesota’s spent nuclear fuel.  See Item 3 — Legal Proceedings and Note 17 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this
matter.  The National Commission on
Energy Policy, a privately funded coalition, has recommended that the federal
government continue to pursue a nuclear waste storage facility in Nevada’s
Yucca Mountain and urged them to build multiple above ground dry cask storage
sites in the eastern and western United States in case the Yucca Mountain
project is delayed or cancelled.

NSP-Minnesota has on-site
storage for spent nuclear fuel at its Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear
plants. The Prairie Island plant is licensed by the federal NRC to store up to
48 casks of spent fuel at the plant. In 1994, the Minnesota Legislature adopted
a limit on dry cask storage of 17 casks for the entire state. The 17 casks,
which stand outside the Prairie Island plant, are now full. On May 29,


2003, the Minnesota
Legislature enacted legislation that allows NSP-Minnesota to continue to
operate the facility and store spent fuel there until its licenses with NRC
expire in 2013 and 2014. This will enable NSP-Minnesota to store at least 12
more casks of spent fuel outside the Prairie Island nuclear generating plant.
The legislation transfers the primary authority concerning future spent-fuel
storage issues from the state Legislature to the MPUC. It also allows for
additional storage without the requirement of an affirmative vote from the
state Legislature, if the NRC extends the licenses of the Prairie Island and
Monticello plants and the MPUC grants a certificate of need for such additional
storage. See Note 17 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of the matter.

Visual
Inspections

—

Required visual inspections have been
performed on the Prairie Island Unit 2 upper and lower reactor vessel heads,
and the Unit 1 upper head. Reactor vessel heads for both units were found to be
in compliance with all NRC requirements. Xcel Energy has placed orders and
plans to replace the reactor vessel upper heads of Prairie Island Unit 2 during
the 2005 refueling outage and Unit 1 during the 2006 refueling outage.

Private
Fuel Storage (PFS)

—

NSP-Minnesota is part of a consortium of
private parties working to establish a private facility for interim storage of
spent nuclear fuel. In 1997, PFS filed a license application with the NRC for a
temporary storage site for spent nuclear fuel on the Skull Valley Indian
Reservation in Utah. The NRC license review process includes formal evidentiary
hearings before an ASLB and opportunities for public input. Evidentiary
hearings were held in 2000 and 2002.  In
December 2004, the state of Utah claimed a representative of the DOE stated
that it would not accept waste sealed in the type of containers planned by PFS.  PFS responded by providing documents that the
DOE will accept fuel stored in dry casks. 
The ASLB ruled in February 2005 that it would not reopen the hearing
record to consider this issue, indicating it was instead worthy of NRC
consideration. The ASLB also issued its decision on the last remaining issue
regarding the facility, finding in favor of PFS. NRC commissioners will decide
whether to officially issue a license for the site.  The state of Utah has asked the U.S. Supreme
Court to consider whether the state of Utah can block PFS from locating a spent
fuel storage facility in the state, if the federal government has exclusive
control over the storage and transportation of nuclear waste.  The court neither accepted nor declined the
appeal filed by the state of Utah, but has sought additional information.  Due to uncertainty regarding NRC and other
regulatory and governmental approvals, it is possible that this interim storage
may be delayed or not available at all.

Prairie
Island Steam Generator Replacement

—

In the fall of 2004, NSP-Minnesota spent approximately
$132 million to successfully replace the steam generators at Unit 1 of the
Prairie Island nuclear generating plant. 
The steam generators at Unit 2 have not yet been replaced, but will be
inspected during a scheduled 2005 outage.

NSP-Minnesota Nuclear Plant Re-licensing

— On Aug. 25, 2004, the Xcel Energy
board of directors authorized the pursuit of renewal of the operating licenses
for the Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants. Monticello’s current
40-year license expires in 2010, and Prairie Island’s licenses for its two
units expire in 2013 and 2014. 
NSP-Minnesota filed its application for Monticello with the MPUC in
January 2005 seeking a certificate of need for dry spent fuel storage and plans
to file an application in 2005 with the NRC for an operating license extension
of up to 20 years.  A decision regarding
Monticello re-licensing is expected in 2007. Plant assessments and other work
for the Prairie Island applications are planned in the next two or three years.

Nuclear
Management Co. (NMC)

—
During 1999, NSP-Minnesota, Wisconsin Electric Power Co., WPS and Alliant
Energy Corp. established NMC. The objective in creating NMC was to enhance
operational excellence in nuclear plant operations by consolidating resources,
combining talent and gaining efficiencies. The Consumers Power subsidiary of
CMS Energy Corp. joined NMC during 2000, and transferred operating authority
for the Palisades nuclear plant to NMC in 2001. The five affiliated companies
own eight nuclear units on six sites, with total generation capacity exceeding
4,500 MW. WPS is seeking regulatory approval to sell its Kewaunee Nuclear Power
Plant to a subsidiary of Dominion Resources, Inc., and may not continue to
participate in NMC.  In addition, Alliant
Energy has announced that it intends to seek bids to potentially sell the Duane
Arnold nuclear plant and, therefore, may not continue to participate in the
NMC.

The NRC has approved
requests by NMC’s affiliated utilities to transfer operating authority for
their nuclear plants to NMC, formally establishing NMC as an operating company.
NMC manages the operations and maintenance at the plants, and is responsible
for physical security. NMC’s responsibilities also include oversight of on-site
dry storage facilities for used nuclear fuel at the Prairie Island nuclear
plant. Utility plant owners, including NSP-Minnesota, continue to own the
plants, control all energy produced by the plants, and retain responsibility
for nuclear liability insurance and decommissioning costs. Existing personnel
continue to provide day-to-day plant operations, with the additional benefit of
implementing best practices from all NMC-operated plants for improved safety,
reliability and operational performance.

For further discussion of
nuclear issues, see Notes 16 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Fuel Supply
and Costs

The following table shows
the delivered cost per MMBtu of each significant category of fuel consumed for
electric generation, the percentage of total fuel requirements represented by
each category of fuel and the total weighted average cost of all fuels during
such years.

*Includes refuse-derived
fuel and wood

Fuel Sources

— The NSP System normally maintains between 30 and 50 days of coal
inventory at each plant site.  Estimated
coal requirements at NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin’s major coal-fired
generating plants are approximately 13.1 million tons per year. NSP-Minnesota
and NSP-Wisconsin have long-term contracts providing for the delivery of up to
97 percent of 2005 coal requirements and up to 59 percent of the 2006
requirements. Coal delivery may be subject to short-term interruptions or
reductions due to transportation problems, weather, and availability of equipment.

NSP-Minnesota and
NSP-Wisconsin expect that all of the coal burned in 2005 will have an average
sulfur content of less than 0.5 percent. 
The NSP System has contracts for a maximum of 22.9 million tons of
low-sulfur coal for the next 3 years. 
The contracts are with 1 Montana coal supplier, 3 Wyoming suppliers and
1 Minnesota oil refinery, with expiration dates ranging between 2006 and
2007.  The NSP System could purchase
approximately 20 percent of coal requirements in the spot market in 2006 if
spot prices are more favorable than contracted prices.

To operate NSP-Minnesota’s
nuclear generating plants, NSP-Minnesota secures contracts for uranium
concentrates, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment and fuel fabrication. The
contract strategy involves a portfolio of spot purchases and medium- and
long-term contracts for uranium, conversion and enrichment.

•

Current nuclear fuel supply contracts cover
46 percent of uranium requirements through 2006 with no coverage of
requirements for 2007 and beyond.

•

Current contracts for conversion services
requirements cover 32 percent of the requirements through 2007 with no coverage
of requirements for 2008 and beyond.

•

Current enrichment services contracts cover
55 percent of the requirements through 2010 with no coverage of requirements
for 2011 and beyond. These current contracts expire at varying times between
2005 and 2010.

•

Fuel fabrication for Monticello is covered
through 2010.  Fuel fabrication is 100
percent committed for Prairie Island Unit 1 through 2006 and through 2005 for
Prairie Island Unit 2.  Both Prairie
Island Units are not contracted for fuel fabrication beyond those dates.  NSP-Minnesota and NMC are currently in negotiations
with Westinghouse to pursue fuel fabrication for Prairie Island plant needs
beyond the current fuel contracts.

NSP-Minnesota expects
sufficient uranium, conversion and enrichment to be available for the total
fuel requirements of its nuclear generating plants. Contracts for additional
uranium and enrichment services are currently being negotiated that would
provide additional supply requirements through 2010 for uranium and enrichment
services.

The NSP System uses both
firm and interruptible natural gas and standby oil in combustion turbines and
certain boilers.  Natural gas supplies
for power plants are procured under short- and intermediate-term contracts to
provide an adequate supply of fuel.  The
NSP System has current fuel oil inventory adequate to meet anticipated 2005
requirements and also has access to the spot market to buy more oil, if needed.

Commodity
Marketing Operations

NSP-Minnesota conducts
various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of
electric capacity, energy and energy related products. Participation in
short-term wholesale energy markets provides market intelligence and
information that supports the energy management of NSP-Minnesota.  NSP-Minnesota uses physical and financial
instruments to minimize commodity


price and credit risk and
hedge supplies and purchases. Engaging in short-term sales and purchase
commitments results in an efficient use of our plants and the capturing of
additional margins from non-traditional customers. NSP-Minnesota also uses
these marketing operations to capture arbitrage opportunities created by
regional pricing differentials, supply and demand imbalances and changes in
fuel prices.  See additional discussion
under Item 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

NSP-Wisconsin

Ratemaking
Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction

— Retail rates, services and other aspects of
NSP-Wisconsin’s operations are subject to regulation by the PSCW and the MPSC,
within their respective states.  In
addition, each of the state commissions certifies the need for new generating
plants and electric and retail gas transmission lines of designated capacities
to be located within the respective states before the facilities may be sited
and built.  NSP-Wisconsin is subject to
the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to its wholesale electric operations,
accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale and the transmission of
electricity in interstate commerce. NSP-Wisconsin has received authorization
from the FERC to make wholesale electric sales at market-based prices.

The PSCW has a biennial
base-rate filing requirement.  By June of
each odd-numbered year, NSP-Wisconsin must submit a rate filing for the test
year period beginning the following January. The filing procedure and review
generally allow the PSCW sufficient time to issue an order and implement new
base rates effective with the start of the test year.

Fuel and Purchased Energy Cost Recovery Mechanisms

— NSP-Wisconsin does not have an automatic
electric fuel adjustment clause for Wisconsin retail customers.  Instead, it has a procedure that compares
actual monthly and anticipated annual fuel costs with those costs that were
included in the latest retail electric rates. If the comparison results in a
difference outside a prescribed range, the PSCW may hold hearings limited to
fuel costs and revise rates upward or downward. Any revised rates would remain
in effect until the next rate change. The adjustment approved is calculated on
an annual basis, but applied prospectively. 
NSP-Wisconsin’s wholesale electric rate schedules provide for
adjustments to billings and revenues for changes in the cost of fuel and
purchased energy.

NSP-Wisconsin’s retail
electric rate schedules for Michigan customers include power supply cost
recovery factors, which are based on 12-month projections.  After each 12-month period, a reconciliation
is submitted whereby over-collections are refunded and any under-collections
are collected from the customers over the subsequent 12-month period.

Proceedings - PSCW

NSP-Wisconsin
2005 Fuel Cost Recovery Filing

—

On Aug. 2, 2004, NSP-Wisconsin filed an
application with the PSCW to reopen its 2004 rate case for the limited purpose
of resetting 2005 electric fuel monitoring costs, and to authorize an increase
in Wisconsin retail electric rates to recover forecast increases in fuel and
wholesale market purchased energy costs. 
In its August application, NSP-Wisconsin indicated an increase of $17.3
million was necessary to avoid under-recovering its 2005 fuel costs based on the
most recent forecast.  On Dec. 29, 2004,
the PSCW issued a final order in the case, authorizing an annual increase of
$18.6 million effective Jan. 1, 2005 and resetting the 2005 electric fuel
monitoring costs.  Because the PSCW used
updated market prices for natural gas, oil and purchased power to forecast 2005
costs, the amount of the increase authorized was greater than initially
requested by NSP-Wisconsin.

MISO Cost
Recovery

— In 2005,
NSP-Wisconsin filed a petition along with other Wisconsin utilities seeking
deferred accounting treatment for net costs of MISO Day 2 energy market
implementation, similar to relief already granted to Wisconsin Public Service
Company in their most recent rate case. 
In addition, the utilities requested that the PSCW begin the process to
change their fuel and energy cost recovery rules to accommodate MISO Day 2
charges.

Capacity
and Demand

Assuming normal weather
during 2005, system peak demand for the NSP System’s electric utility for each
of the last three years and the forecast for 2005 is listed below.


The peak demand for the NSP
System typically occurs in the summer. The 2004 system peak demand for the NSP
System occurred on July 21, 2004.

PSCo

Ratemaking
Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction

—
PSCo is subject to the jurisdiction of the CPUC with respect to its facilities,
rates, accounts, services and issuance of securities.  PSCo is subject to the jurisdiction of the
FERC with respect to its wholesale electric operations, accounting practices,
wholesale sales for resale and the transmission of electricity in interstate
commerce.  PSCo has received
authorization from the FERC to make wholesale electricity sales at market-based
prices.

Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation Cost Recovery Mechanisms

— PSCo has several retail adjustment clauses
that recover fuel, purchased energy and resource costs:

•

Electric Commodity
Adjustment (ECA)

— The ECA,
effective Jan. 1, 2004, is an incentive adjustment mechanism that compares
actual fuel and purchased energy expense in a calendar year to a benchmark
formula. The ECA then provides for an $11.25 million cap on any cost sharing
over or under an allowed ECA formula rate. 
The formula rate is revised annually and collected or refunded in the
following year, if necessary.

•

Incentive Cost Adjustment
(ICA) and Interim Adjustment Clause (IAC)

— The ICA allowed for an equal sharing between retail electric
customers and shareholders of certain fuel and purchased energy costs and
expired Dec. 31, 2002. The collection of prudently incurred 2002 ICA costs is
being amortized over the period June 1, 2002 through March 31, 2005.  For 2003, the IAC provided for the recovery
of prudently incurred fuel and energy costs not included in electric base
rates.

•

Purchased Capacity Cost
Adjustment (PCCA)

— The
PCCA, which became effective June 1, 2004, allows for recovery of purchased
capacity payments to certain power suppliers under specifically identified
power purchase agreements that are not included in the determination of PSCo’s
base electric rates or other recovery mechanisms.  The PCCA rider provided recovery of
$18 million of capacity costs in 2004 and is expected to provide recovery of
$31 million in 2005 and $20 million in 2006. 
The PCCA will expire on Dec. 31,
2006.  Purchased capacity costs both from
contracts included within the PCCA and from contracts not included within the
PCCA are expected to be eligible for recovery through base rates, when PSCo
files its next general rate case.

•

Steam Cost Adjustment (SCA)

— The SCA allows PSCo to
recover the difference between its actual cost of fuel and the amount of these
costs recovered under its base steam service rates. The SCA rate is revised at
least annually to coincide with changes in fuel costs.

•

Air-Quality Improvement
Rider (AQIR)

— The AQIR
recovers, over a 15-year period, the incremental cost (including fuel and
purchased energy) incurred by PSCo as a result of a voluntary plan to reduce
emissions and improve air quality in the Denver metro area.


•

Demand-Side Management Cost
Adjustment (DSMCA)

— The
DSMCA clause currently permits PSCo to recover DSM costs over five years while
non-labor incremental expenses and carrying costs associated with deferred DSM
costs are recovered on an annual basis. PSCo also has a low-income energy
assistance program. The costs of this energy conservation and weatherization
program for low-income customers are recovered through the DSMCA.

PSCo recovers fuel and
purchased energy costs from its wholesale customers through a fuel cost
adjustment clause accepted for filing by the FERC. In February 2004, the FERC
approved a revised wholesale fuel adjustment clause for PSCo, which PSCo
submitted as part of a settlement agreement with certain of its wholesale
customers contesting past charges under PSCo’s prior fuel adjustment clause.

Performance-Based Regulation and Quality of Service Requirements

— The CPUC established an electric and
natural gas PBRP under which PSCo operates. 
The major components of this regulatory plan include:

•

an annual
electric earnings test with the sharing between customers and shareholders of
earnings in excess of the following limits:

•

all earnings above an 11-percent return on
equity for 2001 and a 10.50-percent return on equity for 2002;

•

no earnings sharing for 2003 as PSCo
established new rates in its general rate case; and

•

an
annual electric earnings test with the sharing of earnings in excess of the
return on equity for electric operations of 10.75 percent for 2004 through
2006;

•

an
electric QSP that provides for bill credits to customers if PSCo does not
achieve certain performance targets relating to electric reliability and
customer service through 2006; and

•

a natural gas QSP that provides for bill
credits to customers if PSCo does not achieve certain performance targets
relating to natural gas leak repair time and customer service through 2007.

PSCo regularly monitors and
records as necessary an estimated customer refund obligation under the PBRP. In
April of each year following the measurement period, PSCo files its proposed
rate adjustment under the PBRP. The CPUC conducts proceedings to review and
approve these rate adjustments annually.

•

In 2002, PSCo did not earn a return on equity
in excess of 10.5 percent, so no refund liability was recorded.  PSCo did not achieve the 2002 performance
targets for the electric service unavailability measure, creating a bill credit
obligation for 2002 and increasing the maximum bill credit obligation for
subsequent years’ performance.  In
December 2004, the CPUC approved a settlement resolving the earnings test for
2002.

•

In 2003, PSCo did not achieve the performance
targets for the QSP electric service unavailability measure or the customer
complaint measure.  Targets were met for
the natural gas QSP.  There was no
sharing of earnings for 2003, as PSCo established new rates in its general rate
case.

•

In 2004, PSCo does not anticipate earning a
return on equity in excess of 10.75 percent and did not record a refund
liability.  QSP results will be filed
with the CPUC in April 2005.  An
estimated customer refund obligation under the electric QSP plan was recorded
in 2004 related to the electric service unavailability measure.  No refund under the natural gas QSP is
anticipated.

Proceedings - FERC

PSCo and SPS FERC Transmission Rate Case

— On Sept. 2, 2004, Xcel Energy filed
on behalf of PSCo and SPS an application to increase wholesale transmission
service and ancillary service rates within the Xcel Energy joint open access
transmission tariff (OATT). PSCo and SPS are seeking an increase in annual transmission
service and ancillary services revenues of $6.1 million.  As a result of a settlement with certain PSCo
wholesale power customers in 2003, their power sales rates would be reduced by
$1.4 million. The net increase in annual revenues proposed is $4.7 million, of
which $3.0 million is attributable to PSCo. 
In December 2004, the FERC suspended the filing and delayed the
effective date of the proposed increase to May 20, 2005.  The rate increase application also includes
PSCo and SPS adopting an annual formula rate for transmission service pricing
as previously approved by the FERC for other transmission providers. The case
has been set for hearing and settlement procedures.


California Refund Proceeding —

A number of
parties purchasing energy in markets operated by the California Independent
System Operator (California ISO) or the California Power Exchange (PX) have
asserted prices paid for such energy were unjust and unreasonable and that
refunds should be made in connection with sales in those markets for the period
Oct. 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001. PSCo supplied energy to these markets
during this period and has been an active participant in the proceedings. The
FERC ordered an investigation into the California ISO and PX spot markets and
concluded that the electric market structure and market rules for wholesale
sales of energy in California were flawed and have caused unjust and
unreasonable rates for short-term energy under certain conditions. The FERC
ordered modifications to the market structure and rules in California and
established an ALJ to make findings with respect to, among other things, the
amount of refunds owed by each supplier based on the difference between what
was charged and what would have been charged in a more functional market, i.e.,
the “market clearing price,” which is based on the unit providing energy in an
hour with the highest incremental cost. The initial proceeding related to
California’s demand for $8.9 billion in refunds from power sellers. The ALJ
subsequently stated that after assessing a refund of $1.8 billion for power
prices, power suppliers were owed $1.2 billion because the state was holding
funds owed to suppliers.

Certain
California parties sought rehearing of this decision. Among other things, they
asserted that the refund effective date should be set at an earlier date. They
have based this request in part on the argument that the use by sellers of
certain trading strategies in the California market resulted in unjust and
unreasonable rates, thereby justifying an earlier refund effective date. The
FERC subsequently allowed the purchasing parties to request from sellers,
including PSCo, additional information regarding the market participants’ use
of certain strategies and the effect those strategies may have had on the
market. Based on the additional information they obtained, these purchasing
entities argued to the FERC that use of these strategies did justify an earlier
refund effective date. These California entities have contended that PSCo would
owe approximately $17 million in refunds, if the FERC set the earlier refund
effective date. In October 2003, the FERC determined that the refund effective
date should not be reset to an earlier date, and gave clarification of how
refunds should be determined for the previously set refund period. Certain
California parties appealed the FERC’s decision not to establish an earlier
refund effective date to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit.

In a related case, certain California parties also appealed the FERC
orders dismissing a complaint by the California Attorney General challenging
market-based rates as inconsistent with the Federal Power Act. The California
Attorney General also argued that wholesale sellers, including PSCo, were
violating their market-based rate authorizations by not reporting their
market-based sales on an individual transaction basis. Prior to a clarification
of its rules, most sellers, including PSCo, reported their transactions on an
aggregate basis. On Sept. 9, 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit issued an opinion rejecting the California Attorney General’s
general challenge to market-based rates, but agreeing with its challenge
regarding the failure to report individual transactions. It remanded the case
to the FERC to consider action to take to address these failures and indicated
that the FERC could require refunds. 
Several of the intervenors in this appeal filed a petition for rehearing
of this decision in October 2004.  The
rehearing request is pending at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit.

Further,
several actions in California state courts involve similar issues, challenging
wholesale sales made at market-based rates in the California markets.  These proceedings, filed in federal court in
California and in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County
of San Francisco, allege, among other causes of action, violations of
California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 by Xcel Energy and a
number of other suppliers and traders of wholesale power.  The essence of the complaints are that the
defendants allegedly manipulated the market for electricity by fixing prices
and restricting supply into the California markets, or by engaging in other
conduct for the purpose of artificially inflating the price of electricity,
and/or by charging unlawful prices for such electricity.  Although these proceedings were dismissed, and
appeals were denied by the Ninth Circuit, Petitions for Writ of Certiorari have
been filed with the United States Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court has not yet acted on the
Writ Petitions.

PSCo has accrued its estimated minimum liability related to these
cases.  Because of the low volume of sales
that PSCo had into California, its exposure is estimated to be approximately $7
million.  The FERC has encouraged buyers
and sellers in the organized California markets to try to resolve these cases
through settlement, and PSCo is presently having settlement negotiations with
various California entities to try to reach a comprehensive resolution of these
cases.

FERC OMOI Compliance Audit

— On October 28,
2004, the OMOI sent a letter to Xcel Energy stating that OMOI had initiated a
routine audit of PSCo compliance with various FERC regulations, including PSCo’s
OATT, FERC’s Order No. 889 standards of conduct rules and PSCo’s code of
conduct for transactions in power and non-power goods with affiliates with
market-based rates.  Similar compliance
audits of other utilities have resulted in compliance orders and, in certain
cases, civil penalties.

FERC
Investigation Against Wholesale Electric Sellers —

On June 25, 2003, the FERC issued two show
cause orders addressing alleged improper market behavior in the California
electricity markets. In the first show cause order, the FERC found that 24
entities may have worked in concert through partnerships, alliances or other
arrangements to engage in activities that constitute gaming and/or anomalous
market behavior. The FERC initiated proceedings against these 24 entities
requiring that they show cause why their behavior did not constitute gaming
and/or anomalous market behavior. PSCo was not named in this order. In a second
show cause order, the FERC indicated that various California parties, including
the California ISO, have alleged that 43 entities individually engaged in one
or more of seven specific types of practices that the FERC has identified as
constituting gaming or anomalous market behavior within the meaning of the
California ISO and California Power Exchange tariffs. PSCo was listed in an
attachment to that show cause order as having been alleged to have engaged in
one of the seven identified practices, namely circular scheduling. Subsequent
to the show cause order, PSCo provided information to the FERC staff showing
PSCo did not engage in circular scheduling. Subsequently, certain California
parties requested that FERC make PSCo subject to the show cause proceeding
addressing


partnerships and expand the
scope of the show cause order addressing gaming and/or anomalous market
behavior to have PSCo address an allegation that it engaged in another of the
specified activities, namely “load shift.”

On Aug. 29, 2003, the FERC
trial staff filed a motion to dismiss PSCo from the show cause proceeding.  On Jan. 22, 2004, the FERC granted motions to
dismiss certain parties, including PSCo, of the show cause proceedings addressing
the use of gaming or anomalous market behavior. 
The FERC on that same day in a separate order also rejected requests to
expand the scope of the show cause proceedings addressing partnerships.  On Feb. 23, 2004, certain California parties
sought rehearing of the FERC’s order addressing gaming or anomalous market
behavior.  That matter is still pending
before the FERC.  Certain California
parties also filed appeals of the FERC’s order addressing partnerships, and
that matter is pending.

Pacific
Northwest FERC Refund Proceeding —

In July 2001, the FERC ordered a preliminary hearing to determine
whether there may have been unjust and unreasonable charges for spot market
bilateral sales in the Pacific Northwest for the period Dec. 25, 2000 through
June 20, 2001. PSCo supplied energy to the Pacific Northwest markets during
this period and has been an active participant in the hearings. In September
2001, the presiding ALJ concluded that prices in the Pacific Northwest during
the referenced period were the result of a number of factors, including the
shortage of supply, excess demand, drought and increased natural gas prices.
Under these circumstances the ALJ concluded that the prices in the Pacific
Northwest markets were not unreasonable or unjust and no refunds should be
ordered. Subsequent to the ruling the FERC has allowed the parties to request
additional evidence regarding the use of certain strategies and how they may
have impacted the markets in the Pacific Northwest markets. For the referenced
period, parties have claimed the total amount of transactions with PSCo subject
to refund are $34 million.

On June 25, 2003, the FERC
issued an order terminating the proceeding without ordering further
proceedings. On Nov. 10, 2003, in response to requests for rehearing, FERC
reaffirmed this ruling to terminate the proceeding without refunds. Certain
purchasers have filed appeals of the FERC’s orders in this proceeding.

Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory
Proceedings - CPUC

Electric Department Earnings Test and CPUC Reliability Inquiry

— As a part of PSCo’s annual electric
earnings test, the CPUC opened a docket to consider whether PSCo’s cost of debt
has been adversely affected by the financial difficulties at NRG and, if so,
whether any adjustments to PSCo’s cost of capital are appropriate.

In December
2004, the CPUC approved a settlement resolving the earnings test and providing
for PSCo’s recovery of the actual cost of debt. 
It requires PSCo to spend an incremental $38 million, which will be
included in rate base in future rate filings, in capital expenditures over the
next three years to improve system reliability and contribute $2 million to
Energy Outreach Colorado, a non-profit energy assistance organization.

Quality of Service Plan

— The PSCo QSP provides for bill
credits to Colorado retail customers, if PSCo does not achieve certain
operational performance targets. During the second quarter of 2004, PSCo filed
its calendar year 2003 operating performance results for electric service
unavailability, phone response time, customer complaints, accurate meter
reading and natural gas leak repair time measures. PSCo did not achieve the
2003 performance targets for the electric service unavailability measure or the
customer complaint measure. Additionally, PSCo filed revisions to its previously
filed 2002 electric QSP results for the service unavailability measure. Based
on the revised results, PSCo did not achieve the 2002 performance targets for
the electric service unavailability measure, creating a bill credit obligation
for 2002 and increasing the maximum bill credit obligation for subsequent years’
performance.

As of Dec. 31,
2003, PSCo had accrued an aggregate estimated bill credit obligation of $6.4
million for the 2002 and 2003 calendar years. Based on the updated information
and filings discussed above, during the second quarter of 2004, PSCo increased
its estimated bill credit liability for these years to $13.4 million. PSCo
posted the bill credits to retail customer accounts in the third quarter of
2004. For calendar year 2004, PSCo has evaluated its performance under the QSP
and has recorded a liability of $11 million. 
Under the electric QSP, the estimated maximum potential bill credit
obligation for calendar 2004 performance is approximately $15.2 million,
assuming none of the performance targets are met.  The maximum potential bill credit obligation
for the same period related to permanent natural gas leak repair and natural
gas meter reading errors is approximately $1.6 million.

Incentive
Cost Adjustment and Interim Adjustment Clause —

PSCo’s ICA mechanism was in place for periods
prior to 2003.  The costs included in the
ICA were subject to review by the CPUC. 
In a CPUC docket reviewing the 2001 ICA, the CPUC approved a settlement
that, among other things, provided for a prospective revenue adjustment related
to the maximum allowable natural gas hedging costs that would be a part of the
electric commodity adjustment for 2004, which reduced 2004 rates by $4.6
million.  In 2004,


the CPUC approved the 2002
fuel and purchased energy costs reflected in the ICA.  PSCo agreed to amortize the 2002 ICA costs
over the period of June 2002 through March 2005.  In 2003, PSCo’s prudently incurred fuel and
purchased energy costs were fully recoverable under the IAC and are still
subject to a future review by the CPUC. 
On Aug. 2, 2004, PSCo applied to the CPUC for approval of its 2003 fuel
and purchased energy costs.  This
application is pending before the CPUC.

Electric Trading Docket

— As part of the settlement of the
2002 PSCo general rate case, the parties agreed that PSCo would initiate a
docket regarding the status of wholesale electric trading after 2004. The
proceeding was initiated on Jan. 30, 2004. PSCo’s testimony proposed certain
revisions to the business rules governing trading transactions; to continue
electric trading on both a generation book and commodity book basis; to
establish a defined trading benefit for electric retail customers and to begin
trading natural gas as a risk mitigation measure in support of its electric
trading. On July 8, 2004, the staff of the CPUC filed testimony regarding
electric trading. The staff raised issues related to the computer model used to
allocate costs to trading transactions, PSCo’s ability to track transactions
individually, instead of in aggregate, for each hour and the allocation of
system costs. The staff requested additional reporting through 2006.

PSCo, the
staff of the CPUC and the OCC reached full settlement of the disputed issues on
Sept. 10, 2004. The CPUC approved the settlement on Oct. 5, 2004. The
settlement modifies the rules governing trading transactions to provide more
specificity as to transaction priorities, record retention and cost assignment.  The CPUC acknowledged the benefit of
commodity trading.  Consequently, the
settlement provides for continuation of electric commodity trading as currently
conducted by PSCo, and permits PSCo to begin trading natural gas as a risk
mitigation measure in support of its electric trading.  PSCo anticipates commencing natural gas
trading activities as permitted by the settlement in the first half of
2005.  The settlement also provides for
the margin sharing mechanisms that are currently in place in the PSCo retail
rates to continue through 2006. Finally, the settlement requires the
cooperative development of auditing processes to provide the staff of the CPUC
with information regarding PSCo’s trading operations and for the filing of
monthly reports with respect to these trading operations.  This proceeding is now complete.

Capacity
and Demand

Assuming normal weather
during 2005, system peak demand for the PSCo’s electric utility for each of the
last three years and the forecast for 2005 is listed below.

The peak demand for PSCo’s
system typically occurs in the summer. 
The 2004 system peak demand for PSCo occurred on July 13, 2004.

Energy
Sources and Related Transmission Initiatives

PSCo expects to meet its net
dependable system capacity requirements through existing electric generating
stations; purchases from other utilities, independent power producers and power
marketers; demand-side management options and phased expansion of existing
generation at select power plants.

Purchased Power

— PSCo has contractual arrangements to purchase power from other
utilities and nonregulated energy suppliers. 
Capacity, typically measured in KW or MW, is the measure of the rate at
which a particular generating source produces electricity.  Energy, typically measured in Kwh or Mwh, is
a measure of the amount of electricity produced from a particular generating
source over a period of time. Long-term purchase power contracts typically
require a periodic payment to secure the capacity from a particular generating
source and a charge for the associated energy actually purchased from such
generating source.

PSCo also makes short-term
firm and non-firm purchases to replace generation from company-owned units that
are unavailable due to maintenance and unplanned outages, to provide each
utility’s reserve obligation, to obtain energy at a lower cost than that which
could be produced by other resource options, including company-owned generation
and/or long-term purchase power contracts, and for various other operating
requirements.

PSCo Resource Plan

— PSCo estimates it will purchase approximately 40 percent of its total
electric system energy needs for 2005 and generate the remainder with PSCo-owned
resources.  Approximately 47 percent of
PSCo’s total system electric generation


capacity for 2005 will be
provided by purchased power.

On April 30, 2004, PSCo
filed its 2003 least-cost resource plan (LCRP) with the CPUC.  PSCo had identified that it needs to provide
for 3,600 MW of capacity through 2013 to meet load growth and replace expiring
contracts.  Of the amount needed, PSCo
believes 2,000 MW will come from new resources, and 1,600 MW will come from
entering into new contracts with existing suppliers whose contracts expire
during the resource acquisition period.

On Dec. 17,
2004, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement between PSCo and many
intervening parties concerning the LCRP. 
PSCo received the formal written decision of the CPUC in January
2005.  The CPUC approved PSCo’s plan to
construct a 750-MW pulverized coal-fired unit at the Comanche Station located
near Pueblo, Colo. and transfer up to 250 MW of capacity ownership from the 750-MW
unit to Intermountain Rural Electric Association and Holy Cross Energy, if
negotiations with those entities are successful.  The settlement agreement also enables PSCo to
acquire resources through an all-source competitive bidding process.

Among other things, the
approved settlement allows for additional emission controls to be installed and
associated costs to be collected from customers at Comanche Station’s two
existing coal-fired units.  The
settlement contains a confidential construction cost cap for the construction
of the 750-MW Comanche 3 unit.  It also
includes a regulatory plan that authorizes PSCo to increase the equity
component of its capital structure to 56 percent in its 2006 rate case to
offset the debt equivalent value of PSCo’s existing purchased power agreements
and to otherwise improve PSCo’s financial strength.  Depending upon PSCo’s senior unsecured debt
rating during the time of PSCo general rates cases, the approved settlement
permits PSCo to include various amounts of construction work in progress in
rate base without an allowance for funds used during construction offset
associated with the Comanche 3 generating unit, additional emission controls on
the Comanche 1 and 2 generating units and associated transmission.  PSCo agreed to invest in additional
demand-side management, accelerate the completion of an ongoing wind-saturation
study and fund environmental programs in Pueblo, Colo.

In a separate docket, the
CPUC granted PSCo’s request for approval of a 500-MW renewable energy
solicitation.  PSCo issued a request for
proposal, with bids to be submitted in November 2004.  PSCo is currently negotiating contracts with
bidders of approximately 328 MW of renewable energy.

Purchased Transmission Services

— PSCo has contractual arrangements with
regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to the
subsidiaries’ native load customers, which are retail and wholesale load
obligations with terms of more than one year. 
Point-to-point transmission services typically include a charge for the
specific amount of transmission capacity being reserved, although some
agreements may base charges on the amount of metered energy delivered.  Network transmission services include a
charge for the metered demand at the delivery point at the time of the provider’s
monthly transmission system peak, usually calculated as a 12-month rolling
average.

Fuel Supply
and Costs

The following table shows
the delivered cost per MMBtu of each significant category of fuel consumed for
electric generation, the percentage of total fuel requirements represented by
each category of fuel and the total weighted average cost of all fuels during
such years.

Fuel Sources

—

PSCo’s generation stations use low-sulfur
western coal purchased primarily under long-term contracts with suppliers
operating in Colorado and Wyoming. During 2004, PSCo’s coal requirements for
existing plants were approximately 9.8 million tons, a substantial portion of
which was supplied pursuant to long-term supply contracts. Coal supply
inventories at Dec. 31, 2004 were approximately 41 days usage, based on the
average burn rate for all of PSCo’s coal-fired plants.

PSCo operates the Hayden
generating plant in Colorado.  All of
Hayden’s coal requirements are supplied under a long-term agreement.  The Hayden facility is located in close
proximity to a coal mine, which has historically provided the coal to fulfill
Hayden’s fuel requirements under the long-term agreement.  The mine operator has announced that the mine
will close near the end of


2005.  PSCo is currently investigating a number of
alternatives to provide for an uninterrupted, economical fuel supply to the
facility.  It is anticipated that total
fuel costs will increase following the closure of the mine, however, the amount
of increased costs, if any, cannot be determined at this time.  In addition to Hayden, PSCo has partial
ownership in the Craig generating plant in Colorado.  Approximately 70 percent of PSCo’s coal
requirements for Craig are supplied by two long-term agreements.

PSCo has contracted for coal
suppliers to supply approximately 98 percent of the Cherokee, Cameo, Valmont
and remaining Craig stations’ projected requirements in 2005.

PSCo has long-term coal
supply agreements for the Pawnee and Comanche stations’ projected requirements.
Under the long-term agreements, the supplier has dedicated specific coal
reserves at the contractually defined mines to meet the contract quantity
obligations. In addition, PSCo has a coal supply agreement to supply
approximately 94 percent of Arapahoe station’s projected requirements for 2005.
Any remaining Arapahoe station requirements will be procured via spot market
purchases.

PSCo has a number of coal
transportation contracts, which expire over the course of 2005.  PSCo is currently in the process of
negotiating new transportation agreements. 
The ability to negotiate for coal transportation is not anticipated to
impede the operation of PSCo’s coal-based generation facilities.  However, it is expected that coal
transportation costs will increase. 
Currently, the impact or extent of the increase cannot be determined.

PSCo uses both firm and
interruptible natural gas and standby oil in combustion turbines and certain
boilers. Natural gas supplies for PSCo’s power plants are procured under short-
and intermediate-term contracts to provide an adequate supply of fuel.

Commodity
Marketing Operations

PSCo conducts various
wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric
capacity, energy and energy related products. Participation in short-term
wholesale energy markets provides market intelligence and information that
supports the energy management of PSCo. 
PSCo uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price
and credit risk and hedge supplies and purchases. Engaging in short-term sales
and purchase commitments results in an efficient use of our plants and the
capturing of additional margins from non-traditional customers.  PSCo also uses these marketing operations to
capture arbitrage opportunities created by regional pricing differentials,
supply and demand imbalances and changes in fuel prices.  See additional discussion under Item 7A —
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

SPS

Ratemaking
Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction

— The PUCT has jurisdiction over SPS’ Texas
operations as an electric utility and over its retail rates and services. The
municipalities in which SPS operates in Texas have original jurisdiction over
SPS’ rates in those communities. The NMPRC has jurisdiction over the issuance
of securities. The NMPRC, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission and the Kansas
Corporation Commission have jurisdiction with respect to retail rates and
services and construction of transmission or generation in their respective
states.  SPS is subject to the
jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to its wholesale electric operations,
accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale and the transmission of
electricity in interstate commerce.  SPS
has received authorization from the FERC to make wholesale electricity sales at
market-based prices.

Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation Cost Recovery Mechanisms

— Fuel and purchased energy costs are
recovered in Texas through a fixed fuel and purchased energy recovery factor,
which is part of SPS’ retail electric rates. 
In July 2003, a unanimous settlement was reached providing for the
implementation of an expedited procedure for revising the fixed fuel factors on
a semi-annual basis.  As a result, the
Texas retail fuel factors change each November and May based on the projected
cost of natural gas.

If it appears that SPS will
materially over-recover or under-recover these costs, the factor may be revised
upon application by SPS or action by the PUCT. The regulations require
refunding or surcharging over- or under-recovery amounts, including interest,
when they exceed 4 percent of the utility’s annual fuel and purchased energy
costs, as allowed by the PUCT, if this condition is expected to continue.

PUCT regulations require
periodic examination of SPS fuel and purchased energy costs, the efficiency of
the use of such fuel and purchased energy, fuel acquisition and management
policies and purchase energy commitments. 
Under the PUCT’s regulations, SPS is required to file an application for
the PUCT to retrospectively review at least every three years the operations of
SPS’ electric


generation and fuel
management activities.

The NMPRC regulations
provide for a fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause for SPS’ New
Mexico retail jurisdiction.  SPS files
monthly and annual reports of its fuel and purchased power costs with the
NMPRC.  The NMPRC authorized SPS to
implement a monthly adjustment factor beginning with the February 2002 billing
cycle.  In accordance with the NMPRC
regulations, SPS must file its next New Mexico fuel factor continuation case no
later than August 2005 for the period from October 2001 through April 2005.

SPS recovers fuel and purchased
energy costs from its wholesale customers through a fuel cost adjustment clause
accepted for filing by the FERC.

Performance-Based Regulation and Quality of Service Requirements

— In Texas, SPS is subject to a quality of
service plan requiring SPS to comply with electric service reliability,
telephone response and abandoned call performance targets.  If these targets are not met, SPS is required
to make refunds to its customers of up to $950,000 per year.  As of Dec. 31, 2004, SPS accrued  $800,000 to reflect the expected refund
obligation for those measures.

Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory
Proceedings - FERC

PSCo and SPS FERC Transmission Rate Case

— On Sept. 2, 2004, Xcel Energy filed
on behalf of PSCo and SPS an application to increase wholesale transmission
service and ancillary service rates within the Xcel Energy joint OATT. PSCo and
SPS are seeking an increase in annual transmission service and ancillary
services revenues of $6.1 million.  As a
result of a settlement with certain PSCo wholesale power customers in 2003,
their power sales rates would be reduced by $1.4 million. The net increase in
annual revenues proposed is $4.7 million, of which $1.7 million is attributable
to SPS.  In December 2004, the FERC
suspended the filing and delayed the effective date of the proposed increase to
May 20, 2005.  The FERC also initiated a
complaint proceeding against SPS, which would allow the FERC to order
reductions below SPS’ currently effective rates.  The rate increase application also includes
PSCo and SPS adopting an annual formula rate for transmission service pricing
as previously approved by the FERC for other transmission providers. The case
has been set for hearing and settlement procedures.

SPS
Wholesale Rate Complaint —

In November 2004, several wholesale cooperative customers of SPS filed
a $3 million rate complaint at the FERC requesting that the FERC investigate
SPS’ wholesale power base rates and fuel clause calculations.  In December 2004, the FERC accepted the
complaint filing and ordered SPS base rates subject to refund, effective Jan.
1, 2005.  Also in November 2004, SPS
filed revisions to its wholesale fuel cost adjustment clause.  The FERC set the proposed rate changes into
effect on Jan. 1, 2005, subject to refund, and consolidated the proceeding with
the wholesale cooperative customers’ complaint proceeding.  The FERC set the consolidated proceeding for
hearing and settlement judge procedures.

Southwest
Power Pool (SPP) Restructuring

—

SPS is a member of the SPP regional
reliability council, and SPP acts as transmission tariff administrator for the
SPS system. In October 2003, SPP filed for FERC authorization to transform its
operation into an RTO under FERC Order No. 2000. In addition, SPP made
unilateral changes to the existing SPP membership agreement, which increases
the current costs of SPS membership in SPP by approximately $1.5 million per
year, in order to fund the start of RTO operations. On Feb. 10, 2004, the FERC
conditionally approved SPP’s proposed formation as an RTO, subject to SPP
meeting certain requirements.  On Oct. 1,
2004, the FERC issued a further order granting the SPP status as an RTO.  SPP is expected to commence RTO operations on
Oct. 1, 2005.  SPS is required to obtain
NMPRC approval before it can transfer functional control of its electrical
transmission system.  When SPP begins RTO
operations and SPS obtains all required approvals, SPS will be required to
transfer functional control of its electric transmission system to SPP and take
all transmission services, including services required to serve retail native
loads, under the SPP regional tariff.

Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory
Proceedings - PUCT

Texas Retail Fuel Cost

—

Fuel and purchased energy costs are
recovered in Texas through a fixed fuel and purchased energy recovery
factor.  In May 2004, SPS filed with the
PUCT its periodic request for fuel and purchased power cost recovery for
electric generation and fuel management activities for the period from January
2002 through December 2003.  SPS
requested approval of approximately $580 million of Texas-jurisdictional fuel
and purchased power costs for the two-year period.  Intervenor and PUCT staff testimony was filed
in October 2004 and hearings were held in December 2004.  Intervenor testimony contained objections to
SPS’ methodology for assigning average fuel costs to wholesale sales, among
other things.  Recovery of $49 million to
$86 million of the requested amount was contested by multiple intervenors.  SPS has recorded its best estimate of any
potential liability related to the impact of this proceeding.  In January 2005, SPS filed its post-hearing
briefs disputing the intervenor objections. 
Reply briefs were


filed on Feb. 15, 2005, the administrative law judge is expected to
issue his recommended proposal for decision by the end of April 2005, and PUCT
action is expected by the end of May 2005. 
SPS is pursuing a settlement agreement with the parties involved.

In November 2003,
SPS submitted a fuel cost surcharge factor application in Texas to recover an
additional $25 million of fuel cost under-recoveries accrued during June
through September 2003.  In February
2004, the parties in the proceeding submitted a unanimous settlement allowing
SPS to collect net under-recoveries experienced through December 2003 of $22
million.  The surcharge, which was
approved by the PUCT in March 2004, went into effect May 2004 and will continue
for 12 months.

In May 2004,
SPS filed another fuel cost surcharge factor application in Texas to recover an
additional $32 million of fuel cost recoveries accrued during January through
March 2004.  In June 2004, the parties in
the proceeding submitted a unanimous settlement allowing SPS to collect the $32
million fuel cost under-recoveries surcharge factors for a 12-month period
beginning November 2004. The PUCT approved the settlement in September 2004.

On Nov. 5,
2004, SPS submitted another fuel cost surcharge application with the PUCT for
$30 million of fuel cost under-recoveries accrued from April 2004 through
September 2004.  These under-recoveries
under the Texas retail fixed fuel collection process are primarily the result
of higher than expected natural gas prices. 
SPS is also proposing in its November 2004 filing to increase its
semi-annual fuel factors to take into account the increased cost of natural gas
at its gas-fueled power plants.  In
January 2005, parties to the application reached a settlement agreement
allowing SPS to collect the $30 million fuel cost under-recoveries through a
surcharge during the 12-month period beginning May 2005.  The PUCT is expected to approve the
settlement in March 2005.

Lamb
County Electric Cooperative —

On July 24, 1995, Lamb County Electric Cooperative, Inc. (LCEC)
petitioned the PUCT for a cease and desist order against SPS. LCEC alleged that
SPS had been unlawfully providing service to oil field customers and their
facilities in LCEC’s singly-certificated area. The PUCT denied LCEC’s petition.
See further discussion under Item 3 — Legal Proceedings.

Capacity
and Demand

Assuming normal weather
during 2005, system peak demand for the SPS’ electric utility for each of the
last three years and the forecast for 2005 is listed below.

The peak demand for the SPS
system typically occurs in the summer. 
The 2004 system peak demand for SPS occurred on Aug. 4, 2004.

Energy
Sources and Related Transmission Initiatives

SPS expects to use existing
electric generating stations; purchases from other utilities, independent power
producers and power marketers and demand-side management options to meet its
net dependable system capacity requirements:

Purchased Power

— SPS has contractual arrangements to purchase power from other
utilities and nonregulated energy suppliers. Capacity, typically measured in KW
or MW, is the measure of the rate at which a particular generating source
produces electricity. Energy, typically measured in Kwh or Mwh, is a measure of
the amount of electricity produced from a particular generating source over a
period of time. Long-term purchase power contracts typically require a periodic
payment to secure the capacity from a particular generating source and a charge
for the associated energy actually purchased from such generating source.

SPS also makes short-term
firm and non-firm purchases to replace generation from company-owned units that
are unavailable due to maintenance and unplanned outages, to provide each
utility’s reserve obligation, to obtain energy at a lower cost than that which
could be produced by other resource options, including company-owned generation
and/or long-term purchase power contracts, and for various other operating
requirements.

Purchased Transmission Services

— SPS has contractual arrangements with
regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to the
subsidiaries’ native load customers, which are retail and wholesale load obligations
with terms of more than one


year.  Point-to-point transmission services
typically include a charge for the specific amount of transmission capacity
being reserved, although some agreements may base charges on the amount of
metered energy delivered.  Network
transmission services include a charge for the metered demand at the delivery
point at the time of the provider’s monthly transmission system peak, usually
calculated as a 12-month rolling average.

Fuel Supply
and Costs

The following table shows
the delivered cost per MMBtu of each significant category of fuel consumed for
electric generation, the percentage of total fuel requirements represented by
each category of fuel and the total weighted average cost of all fuels during
such years.

*The lower 2003 SPS coal
costs reflect a prior period fuel credit adjustment. The normalized cost per
MMBtu was approximately $1.14.

Fuel Sources

— SPS purchases all of its coal requirements for Harrington and Tolk electric
generating stations from TUCO, Inc. in the form of crushed, ready-to-burn coal
delivered to the plant bunkers. TUCO, in turn, arranges for the purchase,
receiving, transporting, unloading, handling, crushing, weighing, and delivery
of coal to the plant bunkers to meet SPS’s requirements. TUCO is responsible
for negotiating and administering contracts with coal suppliers, transporters,
and handlers. For the Harrington station, the coal supply contract with TUCO
expires Dec. 31, 2016. For the Tolk station, the coal supply contract with TUCO
expires Dec. 31, 2017.  At Dec. 31, 2004,
coal supplies at the Harrington and Tolk sites were approximately 25 and 24
days supply, respectively. TUCO has coal supply agreements to supply 100
percent of the projected 2005 requirements for Harrington and Tolk stations.
TUCO has long-term contracts for supply of coal in sufficient quantities to
meet the primary needs of the Harrington and Tolk stations.

SPS uses both firm and
interruptible natural gas and standby oil in combustion turbines and certain
boilers. Natural gas suppliers for SPS’ power plants are procured under short-
and intermediate-term contracts to provide an adequate supply of fuel.

Commodity
Marketing Operations

SPS conducts various
wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric
capacity, energy and energy related products. Participation in short-term
wholesale energy markets provides market intelligence and information that
supports the energy management of SPS. 
SPS uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price
and credit risk and hedge supplies and purchases. Engaging in short-term sales
and purchase commitments results in an efficient use of our plants and the
capturing of additional margins from non-traditional customers.  SPS also uses these marketing operations to
capture arbitrage opportunities created by regional pricing differentials,
supply and demand imbalances and changes in fuel prices.  See additional discussion under Item 7A —
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

NATURAL GAS
UTILITY OPERATIONS

Natural Gas Utility Trends

Changes in regulatory
policies and market forces have shifted the industry from traditional bundled
natural gas sales service to an unbundled transportation and market-based commodity
service at the wholesale level and for larger commercial and industrial retail
customers. These customers have greater ability to buy natural gas directly
from suppliers and arrange their own pipeline and retail LDC transportation
service.

The natural gas
delivery/transportation business has remained competitive as industrial and
large commercial customers have the ability to bypass the local natural gas
utility through the construction of interconnections directly with, and the
purchase of natural gas from, interstate pipelines, thereby avoiding the
delivery charges added by the local natural gas utility.

As LDCs, NSP-Minnesota,
NSP-Wisconsin and PSCo provide unbundled transportation service to large
customers. Transportation service does not have an adverse effect on earnings
because the sales and transportation rates have been designed to make them
economically indifferent to whether natural gas has been sold and transported
or merely transported. However, some transportation customers may have greater
opportunities or incentives to physically bypass the LDCs distribution system.

The most significant recent
developments in the natural gas operations of the Utility Subsidiaries are the
substantial and continuing increases in wholesale natural gas market prices and
the continued trend toward declining use per customer by residential customers
as a result of improved building construction technologies and higher appliance
efficiencies.  From 1994 to 2004, average
annual sales to the typical residential customer declined from 108 Dth per year
to 89 Dth per year on a weather-normalized basis.  Although recent wholesale price increases do
not directly affect earnings because of gas cost recovery mechanisms, the high
prices are expected to encourage further efficiency efforts by customers.

NSP-Minnesota

Ratemaking
Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction

— Retail rates, services and other aspects of
NSP-Minnesota’s operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPUC and the
NDPSC within their respective states. The MPUC has regulatory authority over
aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s financial activities, including security issuances,
certain property transfers, mergers with other utilities and transactions
between NSP-Minnesota and its affiliates. In addition, the MPUC reviews and
approves NSP-Minnesota’s gas supply plans for meeting customers’ future energy
needs.

Purchased Gas and Conservation Cost Recovery Mechanisms

—

NSP-Minnesota’s
retail natural gas rate schedules for Minnesota and North Dakota include a PGA
clause that provides for prospective monthly rate adjustments to reflect the
forecasted cost of purchased natural gas. The annual difference between the
natural gas costs collected through PGA rates and the actual natural gas costs
are collected or refunded over the subsequent 12-month period. The MPUC has the
authority to disallow recovery of certain costs if it finds the utility was not
prudent in its procurement activities.

NSP-Minnesota is required by
Minnesota law to spend a minimum of 0.5 percent of Minnesota natural gas
revenue on conservation improvement programs. These costs are recovered through
an annual cost recovery mechanism for natural gas conservation and energy
management program expenditures. NSP-Minnesota is required to request a new
cost recovery level annually.

Pending
and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings

NSP-Minnesota Retail Gas Rate Case

— On Sept. 17, 2004, NSP-Minnesota
submitted a $10 million natural gas general rate increase request to the MPUC
with a requested ROE of 11.5 percent.  An
interim rate increase, subject to refund, of approximately $6.4 million was
implemented effective Dec. 1, 2004.  The
administrative law judge held a pre-hearing conference and established a
procedural schedule, with an MPUC decision expected in mid-2005.  The Department of Commerce filed testimony in
February 2005 recommending an increase of $1 million.  NSP-Minnesota plans to file its rebuttal
testimony on March 15, 2005.

North Dakota Retail Gas Rate Case

— On Nov. 2, 2004, NSP-Minnesota submitted a natural gas general rate increase application to the NDPSC.  The filing proposes an overall increase in annual revenues of $1.3 million, exclusive of natural gas supply costs, or 1.8


percent.  On Dec. 1, 2004, the NDPSC issued an order approving a $0.7 million interim rate increase, or 1.1 percent, effective Jan. 1, 2005.  The NDPSC staff is scheduled to file its testimony in March 2005, and the NDPSC will conduct evidentiary hearings in April 2005.  The NDPSC is required to issue its order by June 2, 2005.  On Feb. 17, 2005, NSP-Minnesota and the NDPSC staff filed a settlement agreement with the NDPSC.  Under the terms of the settlement, the NDPSC can elect one of two alternatives.  The alternatives are a $745,000 rate increase and a $15.70 monthly residential service charge or an $887,000 rate increase with an $8.75 monthly residential service charge.  The NDPSC is expected to c
onsider the settlement agreement at a hearing in March 2005.

Capability
and Demand

Natural gas supply
requirements are categorized as firm or interruptible (customers with an
alternate energy supply). The maximum daily send-out (firm and interruptible)
for NSP-Minnesota was 647,547 MMBtu for 2004, which occurred on Jan. 29, 2004.

NSP-Minnesota purchases
natural gas from independent suppliers. The natural gas is delivered under
natural gas transportation agreements with interstate pipelines. These
agreements provide for firm deliverable pipeline capacity of approximately
506,391 MMBtu/day. In addition, NSP-Minnesota has contracted with providers of
underground natural gas storage services. These storage agreements provide
storage for approximately 16 percent of winter natural gas requirements and 19
percent of peak day, firm requirements of NSP-Minnesota.

NSP-Minnesota also owns and
operates one LNG plant with a storage capacity of 2.13 Bcf equivalent and three
propane-air plants with a storage capacity of 1.4 Bcf equivalent to help meet
its peak requirements. These peak-shaving facilities have production capacity
equivalent to 250,300 MMBtu of natural gas per day, or approximately 34 percent
of peak day firm requirements. LNG and propane-air plants provide a
cost-effective alternative to annual fixed pipeline transportation charges to
meet the peaks caused by firm space heating demand on extremely cold winter
days.

NSP-Minnesota is required to
file for a change in natural gas supply contract levels to meet peak demand, to
redistribute demand costs among classes or to exchange one form of demand for
another. NSP-Minnesota’s 2003-2004 entitlement levels were approved on Sep. 2,
2004, which allow NSP-Minnesota to recover the demand entitlement costs
associated with the increase in transportation, supply, and storage levels in
its monthly PGA. The 2004-2005 entitlement levels are pending MPUC action.

Natural Gas
Supply and Costs

NSP-Minnesota actively seeks
natural gas supply, transportation and storage alternatives to yield a
diversified portfolio that provides increased flexibility, decreased
interruption and financial risk, and economical rates. This diversification
involves numerous domestic and Canadian supply sources with varied contract
lengths.

The following table
summarizes the average cost per MMBtu of natural gas purchased for resale by
NSP-Minnesota’s regulated retail natural gas distribution business:


$

6.88


$

5.47


$

3.98

The cost of natural gas
supply, transportation service and storage service is recovered through various
cost recovery adjustment mechanisms.

NSP-Minnesota has firm
natural gas transportation contracts with several pipelines, which expire in
various years from 2005 through 2017.

NSP-Minnesota has certain
natural gas supply and transportation agreements that include obligations for
the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of natural gas or to make
payments in lieu of delivery. At Dec. 31, 2004, NSP-Minnesota was committed to
approximately $1.09 billion in such obligations under these contracts.

NSP-Minnesota purchases firm
natural gas supply utilizing long-term and short-term agreements from
approximately 35 domestic and Canadian suppliers. This diversity of suppliers
and contract lengths allows NSP-Minnesota to maintain competition from
suppliers and minimize supply costs.


NSP-Wisconsin

Ratemaking
Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction

—

NSP-Wisconsin is subject to retail rate and
other regulation by the PSCW and the MPSC. 
In addition, each of the state commissions certifies the need for new
retail gas transmission lines of designated capacities to be located within the
respective states before the facilities may be sited and built.

The PSCW has a biennial
base-rate filing requirement. By June of each odd-numbered year, NSP-Wisconsin
must submit a rate filing for the test year period beginning the following
January. The filing procedure and review generally allow the PSCW sufficient
time to issue an order and implement new base rates effective with the start of
the test year.

Natural Gas Cost Recovery Mechanisms

—

NSP-Wisconsin has a retail gas cost recovery
mechanism for Wisconsin operations to recover changes in the actual cost of
natural gas and transportation and storage services. The PSCW has the authority
to disallow certain costs if it finds the utility was not prudent in its
procurement activities.

NSP-Wisconsin’s gas rate
schedules for Michigan customers include a gas cost recovery factor which is
based on 12-month projections. After each 12-month period, a reconciliation is
submitted whereby over-collections are refunded and any under-collections are
collected from the customers over the subsequent 12-month period.

Capability
and Demand

Natural gas supply
requirements are categorized as firm or interruptible (customers with an
alternate energy supply). The maximum daily send-out (firm and interruptible)
for NSP-Wisconsin was 153,423 MMBtu for 2004, which occurred on Jan. 29, 2004.

NSP-Wisconsin purchases
natural gas from independent suppliers. The natural gas is delivered under
natural gas transportation agreements with interstate pipelines. These
agreements provide for firm deliverable pipeline capacity of approximately
124,492 MMBtu/day. In addition, NSP-Wisconsin has contracted with providers of
underground natural gas storage services. These storage agreements provide
storage for approximately 23 percent of winter natural gas requirements and 29
percent of peak day, firm requirements of NSP-Wisconsin.

NSP-Wisconsin also owns and
operates one LNG plant with a storage capacity of 270,000 Mcf equivalent and
one propane-air plant with a storage capacity of 2,700 Mcf equivalent to help
meet its peak requirements. These peak-shaving facilities have production
capacity equivalent to 18,408 MMBtu of natural gas per day, or approximately 14
percent of peak day firm requirements. LNG and propane-air plants provide a
cost-effective alternative to annual fixed pipeline transportation charges to
meet the peaks caused by firm space heating demand on extremely cold winter
days.

NSP-Wisconsin is required to
file a natural gas supply plan with the PSCW annually to change natural gas
supply contract levels to meet peak demand. NSP-Wisconsin’s winter 2004-2005
supply plan was approved by the PSCW in October 2004.

PSCo

Ratemaking
Principles

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction

—

PSCo is subject to
the jurisdiction of the CPUC with respect to its facilities, rates, accounts,
services and issuance of securities. 
PSCo holds a FERC certificate that allows it to transport natural gas in
interstate commerce without PSCo becoming subject to full FERC jurisdiction
under the federal Natural Gas Act.

Purchased Gas and Conservation Cost Recovery Mechanisms

—

PSCo
has a GCA mechanism, which allows PSCo to recover its actual costs of purchased
gas. Effective Nov. 1, 2004, the GCA is revised monthly to allow for changes in
gas rates.  Previously, the GCA rate was
revised at least annually to coincide with changes in purchased gas costs.

Performance-based Regulation and Quality of Service Requirements

— The CPUC established a combined electric
and natural gas quality of service plan. 
See further discussion under Item 1, Electric Utility Operations.

Capability
and Demand

PSCo projects peak day
natural gas supply requirements for firm sales and backup transportation, which
include transportation customers contracting for firm supply backup, to be
1,781,088 MMBtu. In addition, firm transportation customers hold 477,419 MMBtu
for PSCo of capacity without supply backup. 
Total firm delivery obligation for PSCo is 2,258,507 MMBtu per day. The
maximum daily deliveries for PSCo in 2004 for firm and interruptible services
were 1,860,958 MMBtu on Jan. 5, 2004.

PSCo purchases natural gas
from independent suppliers. The natural gas supplies are delivered to the
respective delivery systems through a combination of transportation agreements
with interstate pipelines and deliveries by suppliers directly to each company.
These agreements provide for firm deliverable pipeline capacity of
approximately 1,792,543 MMBtu/day, which includes 826,866 MMBtu of supplies
held under third-party underground storage agreements. In addition, PSCo
operates three company-owned underground storage facilities, which provide
about 40,000 MMBtu of natural gas supplies on a peak day. The balance of the
quantities required to meet firm peak day sales obligations are primarily
purchased at the companies’ city gate meter stations and a small amount is
received directly from wellhead sources.

PSCo has received approval
and is in the process of closing the Leyden Storage Field. The field’s 110,000
MMBtu peak day capacity was replaced with additional third-party storage and
transportation capacity. See further discussion at Note 16 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

PSCo is required by CPUC
regulations to file a natural gas purchase plan by June of each year projecting
and describing the quantities of natural gas supplies, upstream services and
the costs of those supplies and services for the period beginning July 1
through June 30 of the following year. PSCo is also required to file a natural
gas purchase report by October of each year reporting actual quantities and
costs incurred for natural gas supplies and upstream services for the 12-month
period ending the previous June 30.

Natural Gas
Supply and Costs

PSCo actively seeks natural
gas supply, transportation and storage alternatives to yield a diversified

of delivery. At Dec. 31, 2004, PSCo was committed to approximately $1.5 billion
in such obligations under these contracts, which expire in various years from
2005 through 2025.

PSCo purchases natural gas
by optimizing a balance of long-term and short-term natural gas purchases, firm
transportation and natural gas storage contracts. PSCo also utilizes a mixture
of fixed-price purchases and index-related purchases to provide a less
volatile, yet market-sensitive, price to its customers. During 2004, PSCo
purchased natural gas from approximately 37 suppliers.

NONREGULATED
SUBSIDIARIES

Through non-utility
subsidiaries, Xcel Energy invested in and operated several nonregulated
businesses in a variety of industries. 
At Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy has divested its ownership interest in all
significant non-utility subsidiaries. 
The following is an overview of nonregulated businesses, which are
reported as components of continuing operations.

Utility Engineering Corp. (UE)

UE was incorporated in 1985
under the laws of Texas. UE is engaged in engineering, design, construction
management and other miscellaneous services. UE currently has five wholly owned
subsidiaries, including Universal Utility Services LLC, Precision Resource Co.,
Quixx Corp., Proto-Power Corp. and Applied Power Associates Inc.

On March 2, 2005, Xcel Energy
agreed to sell its non-regulated subsidiary UE to Zachry Group, Inc.  Zachry agreed to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of UE, including three UE subsidiaries: Precision Resource
Co., a professional staffing company; Proto-Power Corp., an engineering and
project management company dedicated to the nuclear power industry; and
Universal Utility Services, LLC, a full-service industrial maintenance
group.  Quixx Corp., a subsidiary of UE
that partners in cogeneration projects is not included in the transaction.  Xcel Energy expects to record a small loss as
a result of the transaction; however, the transaction is not expected to have a
material effect on the financial condition of Xcel Energy.  The transaction is subject to customary terms
and conditions as to closing and is expected to be completed in April 2005.

Eloigne Company (Eloigne)

Eloigne was established in
1993 and its principal business is the acquisition of rental housing projects
that qualify for low-income housing tax credits under current federal tax law
and Colorado state tax law.  As of Dec.
31, 2004, Eloigne consolidated $147 million of affordable housing property,
including $126 million of limited partnership-owned property, pursuant to FASB
Interpretation No. 46.  Eloigne also had
approximately $7 million in equity interests in jointly owned projects.
Completed Eloigne projects as of Dec. 31, 2004, are expected to generate tax
credits of $38 million over the time period of 2005 through 2012.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Certain of Xcel Energy’s
subsidiary facilities are regulated by federal and state environmental
agencies. These agencies have jurisdiction over air emissions, water quality,
wastewater discharges, solid wastes and hazardous substances. Various company
activities require registrations, permits, licenses, inspections and approvals
from these agencies. Xcel Energy has received all necessary authorizations for
the construction and continued operation of its generation, transmission and
distribution systems. Company facilities have been designed and constructed to
operate in compliance with applicable environmental standards.

Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries strive to comply with all environmental regulations applicable to
its operations. However, it is not possible at this time to determine when or
to what extent additional facilities or modifications of existing or planned
facilities will be required as a result of changes to environmental
regulations, interpretations or enforcement policies or, generally, what effect
future laws or regulations may have upon Xcel Energy’s operations. For more
information on environmental contingencies, see Notes 16 and 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, environmental matters in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis under Item 7 and the matter discussed below.

NSP-Minnesota Notice of Violation

—

On Dec. 10, 2001, the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency (MPCA) issued a notice of violation to NSP-Minnesota alleging
air quality violations related to the replacement of a coal conveyor and
violations of an opacity limitation at the A.S. King generating plant.  On April 22, 2004, the MPCA executed an
agreement with NSP-Minnesota to resolve the alleged air quality violations at
the A.S. King generating plant and address alleged air quality reporting
violations at the Red Wing and Wilmarth generating plants.  Conditions of the agreement were for
NSP-Minnesota to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and to complete corrective
actions at the A.S. King, Red Wing and Wilmarth generating plants.  In 2004, NSP-Minnesota paid the civil penalty
and completed all required corrective actions. 
On Dec. 15, 2004, the MPCA issued a letter acknowledging receipt of the
civil penalty payment and completion of all requirements in the agreement.

Legal
Contingencies

Nuclear Waste Disposal Litigation

— The federal government has the
responsibility to dispose of, or permanently store, domestic spent nuclear fuel
and other high-level radioactive substances. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act
requires the DOE to implement a program for nuclear substance management. This
includes the siting, licensing, construction and operation of a repository for
domestically produced spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors
and other high-level radioactive substances at a permanent storage or disposal
facility. The federal government has designated the site as Yucca Mountain in
Nevada. This designation has resulted in extensive litigation.

On June 8, 1998,
NSP-Minnesota filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims against the DOE
requesting damages in excess of $1 billion for the DOE’s partial breach of
contract.  NSP-Minnesota has demanded
damages consisting of the costs of storage of spent nuclear fuel at the Prairie
Island and Monticello nuclear generating plants, costs related to the Private
Fuel Storage, LLC and costs relating to the 1994 and 2003 state legislation
relating to the storage of spent nuclear fuel at Prairie Island.  On July 31, 2001, the Court of Federal Claims
granted NSP-Minnesota’s motion for partial summary judgment on liability.  The Court of Federal Claims has directed the
parties to be prepared for trial on this matter by Nov. 1, 2005.

On
July 9, 2004, the federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued
a decision to consolidate cases challenging regulations and decisions on the
federal nuclear waste program. The Court of Appeals rejected challenges by the
state of Nevada and other intervenors with respect to the majority of the
licensing regulations of the NRC, the congressional resolution selecting Yucca
Mountain as the site of the permanent repository, and the DOE and presidential
actions leading to the selection of Yucca Mountain. The Court of Appeals
vacated the 10,000 year compliance period adopted by EPA regulations governing
spent nuclear fuel disposal and incorporated in the NRC regulations governing
Yucca Mountain licensing. Xcel Energy has not ascertained the impact of the
decision on its nuclear operations and storage of spent nuclear fuel; however,
the decision may result in additional delay and uncertainty around disposal of
spent nuclear fuel.

Lamb County Electric Cooperative (SPS)

— On July 24, 1995, LCEC
petitioned the PUCT for a cease and desist order against SPS alleging that SPS
was unlawfully providing service to oil field customers in LCEC’s certificated
area.  On May 23, 2003, the PUCT issued an
order denying LCEC’s petition based on its determination that SPS was granted a
certificate in 1976 to serve the disputed customers.  LCEC appealed the decision to the District
Court in Travis County, Texas and on Aug. 12, 2004, the District Court affirmed
the decision of the PUCT.  On Sept. 9,
2004, LCEC appealed the District Court’s decision to the Court of Appeals for
the Third Supreme Judicial District of the state of Texas, which appeal is
currently pending.  Briefs have been
filed with the Court of Appeals and oral arguments are scheduled for March 23,
2005.

On Oct. 18,
1996, LCEC filed a suit for damages against SPS in the District Court in Lamb
County, Texas, based on the same facts alleged in the petition for a cease and
desist order at the PUCT. This suit has been dormant since it was filed,
awaiting a final determination at the PUCT of the legality of SPS providing
electric service to the disputed customers. 
The PUCT order of May 23, 2003, found that SPS was legally serving the
disputed customers, thus collaterally determining the issue of liability
contrary to LCEC’s position in the suit. 
An adverse ruling on the appeal of May 23, 2003 PUCT order could result
in a re-determination of the legality of SPS’ service to the disputed
customers.

Manufactured Gas Plant Insurance Coverage Litigation (NSP-Wisconsin)

—

In
October 2003, NSP-Wisconsin initiated discussions with its insurers regarding
the availability of insurance coverage for costs associated with the
remediation of four former MGP sites located in Ashland, Chippewa Falls, Eau
Claire, and LaCrosse, Wis. In lieu of participating in discussions, on Oct. 28,
2003, two of NSP-Wisconsin’s insurers, St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co.
and St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co., commenced litigation against


NSP-Wisconsin
in Minnesota state district court. On Nov. 12, 2003, NSP-Wisconsin commenced
suit in Wisconsin state circuit court against St. Paul Fire & Marine
Insurance Co. and its other insurers. Subsequently, the Wisconsin court denied
the insurers’ motion to stay the Wisconsin case pending resolution of the
Minnesota action.  On Jan. 6, 2005, the
Minnesota court issued an injunction prohibiting NSP-Wisconsin from prosecuting
the Wisconsin action.  No trial date has
been set in either proceeding. The PSCW has established a deferral process
whereby clean-up costs associated with the remediation of former MGP sites are
deferred and, if approved by the PSCW, recovered from ratepayers. Carrying
charges associated with these clean-up costs are not subject to the deferral
process and are not recoverable from ratepayers. Any insurance proceeds
received by NSP-Wisconsin will operate as a credit to ratepayers, therefore,
these lawsuits should not have an impact on shareholders, and no accruals have
been made.

Item 6

— Selected Financial Data

(a)

Operating revenues and expenses for 2000 through 2002 include
reclassifications to conform to the 2003 and 2004 presentation. These
reclassifications related to reporting electric and natural gas trading
revenues and costs on a net basis, and to presenting the results of
discontinued operations separately. These reclassifications had no effect on
net income.

(b)

Dividends in 2000 reflect dividends paid by predecessor companies before,
and Xcel Energy after, the Xcel Energy merger in August 2000.

(c)

Excludes undistributed equity income and includes allowance for funds
used during construction.

(d)

Total assets for 2004, 2003 and 2002 reflect the classification of
accrued future plant removal costs as a component of regulatory
liabilities.  For periods prior to 2001,
they are reflected as a component of accumulated depreciation. Accrued future
removal costs were $891 million, $852 million and $800 million in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

(e)

Long term debt includes only debt of continuing operations.

(f)

The 2002 average number of common and potentially dilutive shares has
been restated to include the effect of dilutive securities, which were excluded
in 2002 due to Xcel Energy’s loss from continuing operations. Including these
securities would have been antidilutive, or would have reduced the reported
loss per share. In 2002, the loss from continuing operations that was caused by
NRG made some securities “antidilutive” or would have reduced the reported loss
per share. In 2003, NRG’s results were reclassified to discontinued operations.


Item 7

— Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

BUSINESS
SEGMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW

Xcel Energy Inc. (Xcel
Energy), a Minnesota corporation, is a registered holding company under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). In 2004, Xcel Energy
continuing operations included the activity of four utility subsidiaries that
serve electric and natural gas customers in 10 states. These utility
subsidiaries are Northern States Power Co., a Minnesota corporation
(NSP-Minnesota); Northern States Power Co., a Wisconsin corporation (NSP-Wisconsin);
Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) and Southwestern Public Service Co.
(SPS). These utilities serve customers in portions of Colorado, Kansas,
Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas
and Wisconsin.  Along with WestGas
InterState Inc. (WGI), an interstate natural gas pipeline, these companies
comprise our continuing regulated utility operations.  Discontinued utility operations include the
activity of Viking Gas Transmission Co. (Viking), an interstate natural gas
pipeline company that was sold in January 2003; Black Mountain Gas Co. (BMG), a
regulated natural gas and propane distribution company that was sold in October
2003; and Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Co. (Cheyenne), a regulated electric
and natural gas utility that was sold in January 2005.

Xcel Energy’s nonregulated
subsidiaries in continuing operations include Utility Engineering Corp.
(engineering, construction and design) and Eloigne Co. (investments in rental
housing projects that qualify for low-income housing tax credits).   During 2003, Planergy International, Inc.
(energy management solutions) closed and began selling a majority of its
business operations with final dissolution occurring in 2004.

On March
2, 2005, Xcel Energy agreed to sell its non-regulated subsidiary UE to Zachry
Group, Inc.  Zachry agreed to acquire all
of the outstanding shares of UE, including three UE subsidiaries: Precision
Resource Co., a professional staffing company; Proto-Power Corp., an
engineering and project management company dedicated to the nuclear power
industry; and Universal Utility Services, LLC, a full-service industrial
maintenance group.  Quixx Corp., a
subsidiary of UE that partners in cogeneration projects is not included in the
transaction.  Xcel Energy expects to
record a small loss as a result of the transaction; however, the transaction is
not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition of Xcel
Energy.  The transaction is subject to customary
terms and conditions as to closing and is expected to be completed in April
2005.

During 2004, Xcel Energy’s
board of directors approved management’s plan to pursue the sale of Seren
Innovations, Inc. (Seren), a broadband communications services company.  During 2003, Xcel Energy also divested its
ownership interest in NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG), an independent power producer. On
May 14, 2003, NRG filed for bankruptcy to restructure its debt.  As a result of the reorganization, Xcel
Energy relinquished its ownership interest in NRG.  During 2003, the board of directors of Xcel
Energy also approved management’s plan to exit businesses conducted by the
nonregulated subsidiaries Xcel Energy International Inc. (Xcel Energy International),
an international independent power producer, operating primarily in Argentina
and e prime inc. (e prime), a natural gas marketing and trading company.  NRG, Xcel Energy International, e prime and
Seren are presented as a component of discontinued operations.

See Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued
operations.

MANAGEMENT’S
STRATEGIC PLAN

The structure of the utility industry is continually changing, which is
driven, in part, by the many different types of government regulation over the
industry.  Generally, the states in which
a utility operates determine the rates that the utility charges its retail
customers.  The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) establishes the rates that utilities charge for power sold at
the


wholesale level.  The FERC also
develops and administers various rules that govern how utilities operate.  Utilities also face a wide range of
environmental regulations from various government agencies, at both the state
and federal level.

The mix of state and federal regulations result in numerous rules and
regulations, which are not always consistent and are subject to continual
change.  Clearly, compliance with all of
the regulatory requirements increases the complexity and uncertainty of our
business.

In the last decade or so, the FERC and many states developed rules to
encourage competition and deregulation of the utility sector.  As a result of these regulatory changes, many
utilities have taken steps to prepare for competition and the changing
rules.  These actions included:

•

completion of
mergers and acquisitions to increase economies of scale;

•

efficiency
improvements and cost cutting to avoid rate cases and improve competitive
position;

•

sales of power
plants;

•

use of purchase
power contracts to meet growth in electric requirements; and

•

development of
nonregulated ventures.

On the federal level, the FERC is still very active in promoting
wholesale competition.  Wholesale
operations account for approximately 16 percent of our revenue.  FERC has authority to withhold market-based
rates on wholesale sales in certain areas where a utility is determined to have
“market power control.”  However, Xcel
Energy believes that it will continue to have the ability to make sales under
its market-based tariff.

As part of its agenda to
encourage competition, the FERC has also been very active in promoting regional
transmission organizations (RTOs).  In
the past, each individual utility controlled its transmission lines.  Based on certain FERC initiatives, RTOs will
control the operations of transmission lines for an entire region to ensure
that all parties that want to sell power have access to the lines.  We currently participate in the Midwest
Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO) and the Southwest Power
Pool (SPP).  We are supportive of RTO
participation, provided that they offer benefits to our customers and we have
clear cost-recovery mechanisms.  In 2005,
the MISO will begin its Day 2 operations. 
This will result in uncertainty, which may have a positive or negative
impact on our wholesale margins.

However, at the state level, many states have stopped utility
restructuring activity due to the failure of the California power markets, the
collapse of the independent power producers and other factors.

For
Xcel Energy, no significant retail regulatory restructuring has occurred or is
expected to occur in any of the  states
in which we have major utility operations. 
In some parts of Texas, retail customers can choose their energy
provider. However, due to legislation that extends through 2007, the panhandle
of Texas, where we have utility operations, remains under traditional
regulation. We believe that the panhandle will remain under traditional regulation
after 2007.

Our retail operations represent approximately 82 percent of our
revenues.  Retail rates are set by state
commissions and are intended to provide the utility the opportunity to earn an
authorized return on equity.  Whether the
utility actually earns its authorized return on equity is dependent on many
factors including the level of sales growth, changes in a company’s cost
structure, capital investment, interest rates and other items.

Until recently, we have avoided the need to file rate cases by
experiencing relatively robust growth in our service territories as well as
aggressively managing the costs  of our
business.  Through two mergers, we have
realized cost savings and operational efficiencies.  These steps have helped us to avoid filing
rate cases, but at the same time, we have made significant investments.  While we will continue to look for ways to
reduce costs, the opportunities are no longer large enough to further delay
rate cases.

Our regulatory strategy
is to ensure that we have the opportunity to earn our authorized return on
equity in each state. We are currently not earning our authorized return on
equity in the majority of the states where we have our regulated utility
operations. As a result, we have or in the near-term will begin filing
general  rate increases in the majority
of our jurisdictions as follows.

•

In September 2004, we filed for an
approximately $10 million natural gas rate increase in Minnesota.   The request assumes an 11.5 percent return
on equity. Interim rates, subject to refund, went into effect in December 2004
and we expect a decision this summer.

•

Also in 2004, we filed for a $5
million transmission increase at FERC.


•

In Wisconsin, we are required to file
a rate case every other year.  Therefore,
NSP-Wisconsin will file a case during 2005.

•

In Minnesota, we
plan to file an electric rate case in the fourth quarter of this year with
interim rates, subject to refund, effective in early 2006.  We expect a final commission decision in late
summer or early fall of 2006.

•

Finally, we
intend to file an electric rate case in Colorado in 2006, with rates expected
to be in effect during 2007.

While recovery of costs
cannot be assured, we are optimistic we will receive fair treatment. We believe
that we have fair regulation as demonstrated by the successful agreement
reached on projects like the metropolitan emissions reduction project (MERP) in
Minnesota and the new construction of the Comanche 3 electric generating unit
in Colorado.  Our ability to maintain a
constructive regulatory framework is a critical component of our strategy and
ultimate success.

Though we remain open to all
opportunities to increase shareholder value, o

ur strategy is to invest
in our core electric and natural gas businesses to meet the growing energy
needs of our customers, while earning a fair return on our investments.  We refer to our strategy as Building the
Core.  We have no plans or interest in
deviating from our core business.

We see four critical factors to create incremental value for our
shareholders and view these factors as building blocks.  They are largely independent of each other,
but taken together, they have the potential to create significant additional
value.

•

The first is
service territory growth.  With the
strength and diversity of our service territory, growth provides a solid
foundation year after year.

•

The second
driver is incremental investment in our core businesses.  Certain incremental investment has already
started at a modest level and will grow quickly in the coming years.  Key projects include the MERP project and the
Comanche 3 coal plant.

•

The third driver
is to increase the level of equity that we have invested in our operating
companies.  Additional equity will
increase our financial strength, support a higher credit rating and add to
earnings and cash flow.  We will work
with our regulators to gain support for this initiative.

•

Lastly, we will
strive to earn our regulated, authorized returns, which will require filing for
rate increases in our largest jurisdictions over the next few years.

Execution of our strategy
will allow us to meet or exceed our financial objective of delivering an
average total return of 7 percent to 9 percent per year.  Our total return objective is based on our
expectations of long-term earnings growth of 2 percent to 4 percent and a
dividend yield of approximately 5 percent.

We have established a dividend policy that we believe is sustainable
and contributes to a competitive total return for our shareholders.  Our objective is to deliver the financial
results that will enable our board of directors to grant annual dividend
increases at a rate consistent with our long-term earnings growth rate.

As we look to 2005, we are focused on several challenges, in addition
to the normal day-to-day operations of our utility business.

•

We must prepare for operational
uncertainty surrounding the implementation of various FERC initiatives, which
could impact our short-term wholesale margins.

•

We must manage our procurement
efforts to attempt to mitigate the impact of rising fuel costs, which are
passed on to our customers.

•

We must continue
to look for creative ways to offset rising healthcare and benefit costs, while
we continue our efforts to improve reliability and customer service.

•

While we believe we are well
positioned for changing environmental rules and regulations based on the work
we have done in the last few years on projects such as MERP, we plan to
continue our aggressive efforts to improve our environmental performance.

•

We need to
obtain uncontested environmental permits for the new construction of the
Comanche 3 coal plant.

•

We expect to
complete the sale of Seren.

•

Finally, we will
need to seek a Minnesota electric rate increase at the end of 2005.  This case will be important as we move into
2006.

We believe that we have a
solid and straightforward strategy and that, as we execute our plan, it will
serve to increase shareholder value.


FINANCIAL
REVIEW

The following discussion and
analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on
Xcel Energy’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during
the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future.
It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements and Notes. All note references refer to the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

Summary of
Financial Results

The following table
summarizes the earnings contributions of Xcel Energy’s business segments on the
basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Continuing operations
consist of the following:

•

regulated utility subsidiaries, operating in
the electric and natural gas segments; and

•

several nonregulated subsidiaries and the
holding company, where corporate financing activity occurs.

Discontinued operations
consist of the following:

•

Seren, a nonregulated subsidiary, which was
classified as held for sale in the third quarter of 2004 based on a decision to
divest this investment;

•

the regulated natural gas businesses Viking
and BMG, which were sold in 2003;

•

the regulated utility business of Cheyenne,
which was sold in January 2005;

•

NRG, which emerged from bankruptcy in late
2003, at which time Xcel Energy divested its ownership interest in NRG; and

•

the nonregulated subsidiaries Xcel Energy
International and e prime, which were classified as held for sale in late 2003
based on the decision to divest them.

Prior-year financial
statements have been restated to conform to the current-year presentation and
classification of certain operations as discontinued. See Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of discontinued
operations.


(a) Not a reportable
segment. Included in All Other segment results in Note 19 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

(b) Includes tax benefit
related to NRG. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

While earnings from
continuing operations

for 2004 were flat compared with 2003, the current
period results were favorably impacted by electric sales growth, short-term
wholesale markets and lower depreciation, offset by the negative impact of
unfavorable weather, legal settlement costs and the impacts of certain
regulatory accruals, compared with the same period in 2003.

The loss from discontinued
operations in 2004 is largely due to an after-tax impairment charge of $143
million related to the planned sale of Seren. The after-tax impairment charge
was increased in the fourth quarter of 2004 from the impairment estimate
recorded in the third quarter of 2004 based on further developed market
information, as well as preliminary feedback from prospective buyers.  The earnings in 2003 from discontinued
operations are primarily due to an adjustment to previously estimated tax
benefits related to Xcel Energy’s write-off of its investment in NRG. NRG
recorded more than $3 billion of asset impairment and other charges in 2002 as
it commenced its financial restructuring. Results from discontinued operations
are discussed in the Discontinued Operations section later.

Common Stock Dilution —

Dilution, primarily from common stock and convertible securities issued
in 2002, reduced the utility segment earnings from continuing operations by 12
cents per share for 2003, compared with average common stock and equivalent
levels in 2002. Total earnings from continuing operations were reduced by 11
cents per share for 2003, compared with 2002 share levels. In 2004, 2003 and
2002, approximately 423.3 million, 418.9 million and 384.6 million average
common shares and equivalents, respectively, were used in the calculation of
diluted earnings per share.

Statement
of Operations Analysis — Continuing Operations

The following discussion
summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items
reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Electric
Utility, Short-Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margins

Electric fuel and purchased
power expenses tend to vary with changing retail and wholesale sales
requirements and unit cost changes in fuel and purchased power. Due to fuel
cost recovery mechanisms for retail customers in several states, most
fluctuations in energy costs do not materially affect electric utility margin.

Xcel Energy has two distinct
forms of wholesale marketing activities: short-term wholesale and commodity
trading.  Short-term wholesale refers to
energy related purchase and sales activity and the use of certain financial
instruments associated with the fuel required for and energy produced from Xcel
Energy’s generation assets and energy and capacity purchased to serve native
load.  Commodity trading is not
associated with Xcel Energy’s generation assets or the energy and capacity
purchased to serve native load.


Xcel Energy’s commodity
trading operations are conducted by NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS. Margins from
commodity trading activity are partially redistributed to other operating
utilities of Xcel Energy, pursuant to a joint operating agreement (JOA)
approved by the FERC. On a consolidated basis, the impact of the JOA is
eliminated.  Short-term wholesale and
commodity trading margins reflect the impact of regulatory sharing, if
applicable.  Trading revenues, as discussed
in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are reported net of trading
costs (i.e., on a margin basis) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Commodity trading costs include fuel, purchased power, transmission and other
related costs.  The following table
details the revenue and margin for base electric utility, short-term wholesale
and commodity trading activities:

The following summarizes the
components of the changes in base electric utility revenue and base electric
utility margin for the years ended Dec. 31:

Base Electric Utility Revenue


2004 Comparison with 2003

— Base electric utility revenues increased due to weather-normalized
retail sales growth of approximately 1.8 percent, higher fuel and purchased
power costs, which are largely passed through to customers, and higher revenues
from firm wholesale customers.  Partially
offsetting the higher revenues was the impact of significantly cooler summer
temperatures in 2004 compared with the summer of 2003, as well as estimated
customer refunds related to quality-of-service obligations in Colorado.

2003 Comparison with 2002 —

Base electric utility revenues increased due
to weather-normalized retail sales growth of approximately 1.5 percent, higher
fuel and purchased power costs, which are largely passed through to customers,
and higher capacity sales in Texas. In addition, the AQIR was implemented in
Colorado in January 2003 for the recovery of investments and related costs to
improve air quality. Partially offsetting the higher revenues was the impact of
warmer temperatures during the summer of 2002 compared with the summer of 2003,
as well as 2003 rate reductions related to lower property taxes in Minnesota
and estimated customer refunds related to service quality requirements in
Colorado.

Base Electric Utility Margin

2004 Comparison to 2003 —

Base electric utility margin decreased due to the impact of weather,
higher purchased capacity costs associated with new contracts to support growth,
higher fuel and purchased energy costs not recovered through direct
pass-through recovery mechanisms, mainly in Wisconsin, and regulatory accruals
associated with potential customer refunds related to service quality
obligations in Colorado and fuel reconciliation proceedings in Texas.   These decreases were partially offset by
weather-normalized sales growth.

2003 Comparison to 2002 —

Base electric utility margin decreased due mainly to higher purchased
capacity costs associated with new contracts to support growth, the allowed
recovery of fuel and purchased power costs in excess of actual costs in 2002
under the sharing provisions of the incentive cost adjustment mechanism in
Colorado, compared with passing through costs with no sharing provisions under
the interim adjustment clause in 2003, and the impact of weather. Also
decreasing margin were 2003 rate reductions related to lower property taxes in
Minnesota and estimated refunds to customers related to service quality
requirements in Colorado. The decreases were partially offset by
weather-normalized sales growth, the implementation of the AQIR and higher
capacity sales, as previously discussed.

Short-Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margin

2004 Comparison to 2003 —

Short-term wholesale and commodity trading margins increased
approximately $33 million in 2004 compared with 2003.  The increase reflects a number of market
factors, including higher market prices, additional resources available for
sale and a pre-existing contract, which provided approximately $17 million of
short-term wholesale margins in 2004 and expired in the first quarter of 2004.

2003 Comparison to 2002 —

Short-term wholesale and commodity trading margins increased
approximately $43 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase reflects
more favorable market conditions in the northern regions.

Natural Gas
Utility Margins

The following table details
the changes in natural gas utility revenue and margin. The cost of natural gas
tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of wholesale
natural gas purchases. However, due to purchased natural gas cost recovery
mechanisms for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the wholesale cost of
natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin.


The following summarizes the
components of the changes in natural gas revenue and margin for the years ended
Dec. 31:

Natural Gas Revenue

2004 Comparison to 2003 —

Natural gas revenue increased primarily due to higher natural gas costs
in 2004, which are passed through to customers. 
Retail natural gas weather-normalized sales declined in 2004, largely
due to the rising cost of natural gas and its impact on customer usage.

2003 Comparison to 2002 —

Natural gas revenue increased mainly due to higher natural gas costs in
2003, which are passed through to customers.

Natural Gas Margin

2004 Comparison to 2003 —

Natural gas margin decreased due to a full year of the base rate
decrease, which was effective July 1, 2003, agreed to in the settlement of the
PSCo 2002 general rate case and the impact of warmer winter temperatures in
2004 compared with 2003.  The rate case
settlement agreement is discussed further under Factors Affecting Results of
Continuing Operations.

2003 Comparison to 2002 —

Natural gas margin decreased due to the rate decrease discussed above
and the impact of warmer winter temperatures in 2003 compared with 2002.  The rate case settlement agreement is
discussed further under Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations.

Weather —

Xcel
Energy’s earnings can be significantly affected by weather. Unseasonably hot
summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, but also can
increase expenses. Unseasonably mild weather reduces electric and natural gas
sales, but may not reduce expenses, which affects overall results. The impact
of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature
variances and the amount of gas or electricity the average customer
historically has used per degree of temperature.

The following summarizes the
estimated impact on the earnings of the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy due
to temperature variations from historical averages:

•

weather in 2004 decreased earnings by an
estimated 8 cents per share;

•

weather in 2003 had minimal impact on
earnings per share; and

•

weather in 2002 increased earnings by an
estimated 6 cents per share.


Nonregulated
Operating Margins

The following table details
the changes in nonregulated revenue and margin included in continuing
operations:

2004 Comparison to 2003 —

Nonregulated revenue decreased in 2004, due primarily to the
discontinued consolidation of an investment in an independent power producing
entity that was no longer majority owned.

2003 Comparison to 2002 —

Nonregulated revenue increased in 2003, due mainly to increased
revenues at Utility Engineering. Nonregulated margin decreased in 2003, due to
higher cost of goods sold at a subsidiary of Utility Engineering.

Non-Fuel
Operating Expense and Other Items

Other Utility Operating and Maintenance
Expense —

Other operating and maintenance expenses for
2004 increased by approximately $22 million, or 1.4 percent, compared with
2003.  Of the increase, $12 million of
increased costs are offset by increased revenue, including those incurred to
assist with the storm damage repair in Florida. 
The remaining increase of $10 million is primarily due to lower pension
credits and higher employee benefit costs of $31 million, higher electric
service reliability costs of $9 million, higher information technology costs of
$8 million, higher legal settlement costs of $7 million, higher plant-related
costs of $4 million, higher costs related to a customer billing system
conversion of $4 million and $4 million of increased costs primarily related to
compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
The higher costs were partially offset by lower compensation costs of
$43 million, lower costs associated with inventory adjustments of $14 million
and lower private fuel storage costs of $6 million.

Other operating and maintenance expenses increased $90 million, or 6.0
percent, in 2003 compared with 2002.  The
increase is due primarily to higher employee-related costs, including higher
performance-based compensation of $36 million, restricted stock unit grants of
$29 million, lower pension credits of $19 million and higher medical and health
care costs of $9 million.  In 2002, there
were no restricted stock unit grants and only a partial award of
performance-base compensation.  In
addition, other utility operating and maintenance expense for 2003 reflects
inventory write-downs of $8 million, higher uncollectible accounts receivable
of $3 million, higher reliability expenses of $6 million and a software project
write-off of $2 million.  The increase
was partially offset by lower information technology costs resulting from
centralization.

Other Nonregulated Operating and Maintenance Expense —

Other nonregulated operating and maintenance
expenses decreased $14 million, or 19.6 percent, in 2004 compared with
2003.  This decrease resulted from the
dissolution of Planergy and the discontinued consolidation of an investment in
an independent power producing entity that was no longer majority owned after
the divestiture of NRG.  See additional
discussion of the total results for each nonregulated subsidiary later.

Other nonregulated operating
and maintenance expenses decreased $21 million, or 23.2 percent, in 2003
compared with 2002.  The 2002 expenses
included employee severance costs at the holding company.  These expenses are included in the results
for each nonregulated subsidiary, as discussed later.

Depreciation and Amortization

— Depreciation and amortization expense for 2004 decreased by approximately $21
million, or 2.8 percent, compared with 2003, and $18 million, or 2.4 percent,
in 2003 compared with 2002.  The
fluctuations are largely due to several regulatory decisions in 2003.  In 2004, as a result of a Minnesota Public
Utilities Commission (MPUC) order, NSP-Minnesota modified its decommissioning
expense recognition, which served to reduce decommissioning accruals by approximately
$18 million compared with 2003.

In addition, effective July 1, 2003, the Colorado Public Utilities
Commission (CPUC) lengthened the depreciable lives of certain electric utility
plant at PSCo as a part of the general Colorado rate case, reducing annual
depreciation expense by $20 million. 
PSCo experienced the full impact of the annual reduction in 2004,
resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of $10 million for 2004
compared with 2003.


During 2003, the Minnesota Legislature authorized additional spent
nuclear fuel storage at the Prairie Island nuclear plant.  In December 2003, the MPUC extended the
authorized depreciable lives of the two generating units at the Prairie Island
nuclear plant, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2003, reducing depreciation by $22
million.

Special Charges —

Special charges in 2004 were $17.6 million relating to the settlement
of shareholder litigation.  Special
charges reported in 2003 relate to the TRANSLink Transmission Co., LLC
(TRANSLink) project and NRG restructuring costs. Special charges for 2002
include NRG restructuring costs, as discussed later, but are largely related to
regulated utility costs.   Regulated
utility earnings from continuing operations were reduced by approximately 2
cents per share in 2002 due to a $5 million regulatory recovery adjustment for
SPS and $9 million in employee separation costs associated with a restaffing
initiative for utility and service company operations.  See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion of these items.

Interest and Other Income, Net of Nonoperating Expenses —

Interest
and other income, net of nonoperating expenses increased $5 million in 2004
compared with 2003.  The increase is due to interest income
related to the finalization of prior-period Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
audits of $10.5 million.  Partially
offsetting the increase was the impact of a Utility Engineering gain on the
sale of water rights in 2003, net of write-offs of certain intangible assets.

Interest and other income,
net of nonoperating expenses decreased $27 million in 2003 compared with 2002.
Interest income decreased $13 million primarily due to interest received on tax
refunds in 2002. Other income decreased $10 million primarily due to a gain on
the sale of contracts at Planergy in 2002.

Interest and Financing Costs —

Interest charges
and financing costs decreased approximately $16 million, or 3.6 percent, for
2004, compared with 2003.  The decrease
for the year reflects savings from refinancing higher coupon debt during 2003
and lower credit line fees, partially offset by interest expense related to
prior period IRS audits.

Interest and financing costs
increased approximately $30 million, or 7.1 percent, for 2003 compared with
2002. This increase was due to the full-year impact of the issuance of
long-term debt in the latter part of 2002 intended to reduce dependence on
short-term debt. In addition, during 2002, Xcel Energy incurred approximately
$15 million to redeem temporary holding company debt. During 2003, Xcel Energy
issued approximately $1.7 billion of long-term debt to refinance higher coupon
debt.  During 2002, certain long-term
debt was refinanced at higher interest rates.

Income Tax Expense —

The effective tax rate was 23.2 percent for
the year 2004, compared with 24.6 percent for the same period in 2003.  Significant tax benefits were recorded during
the fourth quarters of 2004 and 2003 due to the resolution of tax audit issues,
largely related to prior periods.

Significant
income tax audit activity occurring in 2003 continued in 2004.  With the exception of the corporate-owned
life insurance (COLI) loan interest deductibility, as discussed in Note 16,
during 2004, Xcel Energy concluded IRS income tax audit and appeal activities
spanning several examination cycles dating back to 1993.  In addition, the IRS nearly completed the
examination cycle ended 2001 and began its review of Xcel Energy’s 2002 and
2003 tax years.

In 2004,
income tax benefits of $39.3 million were recorded, including $28.9 million
related to the successful resolution of various IRS audit issues and other
adjustments to current and deferred taxes related to prior years, $7.7 million
for the 2003 return-to-actual true-up and $2.7 million from revisions to
benefits related to asset and foreign power sales.  Excluding the tax benefits, the effective
rate for 2004 would have been 28.9 percent.

In 2003,
income tax benefits of $36 million were recorded to reflect the resolution of
tax audit issues related to prior years. 
The tax issues resolved during 2003 included the tax deductibility of
certain merger costs associated with the mergers to form Xcel Energy and New
Century Energies, Inc. (NCE) and the deductibility, for state purposes, of
certain tax benefit transfer lease benefits. 
Excluding these tax benefits, the effective rate for 2003 would have
been 29.7 percent.  See Note 10 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Other
Nonregulated Subsidiaries and Holding Company Results

The following tables
summarize the net income and earnings-per-share contributions of the continuing
operations of Xcel Energy’s nonregulated businesses and holding company
results:

Eloigne Company —

Eloigne invests in affordable housing that qualifies for federal and
state tax credits.  Eloigne’s earnings
contribution is expected to decline slightly each year as tax credits on mature
affordable housing projects begin to decline.

Planergy —

Planergy
provided energy management services. Planergy’s losses were lower in 2004 due
to the dissolution of its business. Its losses were lower in 2002 largely due to
pretax gains of approximately $8 million from the sale of a portfolio of energy
management contracts, which reduced losses by approximately 2 cents per share.

Financing Costs and Preferred Dividends —

Nonregulated results include interest expense
and the earnings-per-share impact of preferred dividends, which are incurred at
the Xcel Energy and intermediate holding company levels, and are not directly
assigned to individual subsidiaries.

In November 2002, the Xcel
Energy holding company issued temporary financing, which included detachable
options for the purchase of Xcel Energy notes, which were convertible to Xcel
Energy common stock. This temporary financing was replaced with long-term
holding company financing in late November 2002. Costs incurred to redeem the
temporary financing included a redemption premium of $7.4 million, $5.2 million
of debt discount associated with the detachable option, and other issuance
costs, which increased financing costs and reduced 2002 earnings by 2 cents per
share.

The earnings-per-share
impact of financing costs and preferred dividends for 2004 and 2003 included
above reflects dilutive securities, as discussed further in Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of the dilutive securities, if
converted, is a reduction of interest expense resulting in an increase in net
income of approximately $15 million, or 4 cents per share, in 2004, and $11
million, or 3 cents per share, in 2003.

Holding Company Special Charges —

During 2004, special charges at the holding
company consisted of an accrual of $17.6 million for a settlement agreement
related to shareholder lawsuits.  See
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these
special charges.

During 2002, NRG experienced
credit-rating downgrades, defaults under certain credit agreements, increased
collateral requirements and reduced liquidity. These events ultimately led to
the restructuring of NRG in late 2002 and its bankruptcy filing in May 2003.
See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain costs related to
NRG’s restructuring were incurred at the holding company level and included in
continuing operations and reported as Special Charges. Approximately $12
million of these costs were incurred


in 2003 and $5 million were
incurred in 2002, which reduced after-tax earnings by approximately 2 cents per
share and 1 cent per share, respectively. Costs in 2003 included approximately
$32 million of financial advisor fees, legal costs and consulting costs related
to the NRG bankruptcy transaction. These charges were partially offset by a $20
million pension curtailment gain related to the termination of NRG employees
from Xcel Energy’s pension plan. In 2003, Xcel Energy also recorded a $7
million charge in connection with the suspension of the formation of the
independent transmission company TRANSLink. See Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of these special charges.

Other Nonregulated —

In 2003, Utility Engineering sold water rights, resulting in a pretax
gain (reported as nonoperating income) of $15 million. The gain increased
after-tax income by approximately 2 cents per share.

Statement
of Operations Analysis — Discontinued Operations

A summary of the various
components of discontinued operations is as follows for the years ended Dec.
31:

Regulated
Utility Results — Discontinued Operations

During 2003, Xcel Energy
completed the sale of two subsidiaries in its regulated natural gas utility
segment: Viking, including its interest in Guardian Pipeline, LLC, and BMG.
After-tax disposal gains of $23.3 million, or 6 cents per share, were recorded
for the natural gas utility segment, primarily related to the sale of Viking.

Viking had minimal income in
2003, as it was sold in January of that year. Income from Viking was higher in
2002, compared with 2001, primarily due to increased revenues.

During January 2004, Xcel Energy reached an agreement to sell its
regulated electric and natural gas subsidiary Cheyenne.  As a result of this agreement, Xcel Energy is
reporting Cheyenne results as a component of discontinued operations for all
periods presented.  The


sale was completed in January 2005 and resulted in an after-tax loss of
approximately $13 million, or 3 cents per share, which was accrued at Dec. 31,
2004.

NRG Results
— Discontinued Operations

Due to NRG’s emergence from
bankruptcy in December 2003 and Xcel Energy’s corresponding divestiture of its
ownership interest in NRG, Xcel Energy’s share of NRG results for current and
prior periods is now shown as a component of discontinued operations.

2004 NRG Results Compared with 2003 —

As a result of NRG’s emergence from
bankruptcy in December 2003, Xcel Energy did not retain an ownership interest
in NRG after that date.  Therefore, Xcel
Energy financial statements do not contain any results of NRG operations in
2004.  See Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements and the following discussion for further information.

2003 NRG Results Compared with 2002 —

As a result of NRG’s bankruptcy filing in May
2003, Xcel Energy ceased the consolidation of NRG and began accounting for its
investment in NRG using the equity method in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 18 — “The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock.” After changing to the equity method, Xcel Energy
was limited in the amount of NRG’s losses subsequent to the bankruptcy date
that it was required to record. In accordance with these limitations under the
equity method, Xcel Energy stopped recognizing equity in the losses of NRG
subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2003. These limitations provided for
loss recognition by Xcel Energy until its investment in NRG was written off to
zero, with further loss recognition to continue if its financial commitments to
NRG existed beyond amounts already invested. Xcel Energy initially recorded
more losses than the limitations allow as of June 30, 2003, but upon Xcel
Energy’s divestiture of its interest in NRG, the NRG losses recorded in excess
of Xcel Energy’s investment in and financial commitment to NRG were reversed in
the fourth quarter of 2003. This resulted in a noncash gain of $111 million, or
26 cents per share, for the quarter and an adjustment of the total NRG losses
recorded for the year 2003 to $251 million, or 60 cents per share.

NRG’s results included in
Xcel Energy’s earnings for 2003 were as follows:

*

These represent NRG losses incurred in the
first and second quarters of 2003 that were in excess of the amounts recordable
by Xcel Energy under the equity method of accounting limitations discussed
previously.

Following its credit downgrade
in July 2002, NRG experienced credit and liquidity constraints and commenced a
financial and business restructuring, including a voluntary petition for
bankruptcy protection. This restructuring created significant incremental costs
and resulted in numerous asset impairments as the strategic and economic value
of assets under development and in operation changed.

NRG’s asset impairments and
related charges in 2003 were approximately $540 million related to its NEO
landfill gas projects and equity investments, planned disposals of domestic and
international projects, and regulatory developments and changing circumstances
that adversely affected NRG’s ability to recover the carrying value of certain
investments. As of the bankruptcy filing date (May 14, 2003), Xcel Energy had
recognized $263 million of NRG’s impairments and related charges as these
charges were recorded by NRG prior to May 14, 2003. Consequently, Xcel Energy
recorded its equity in NRG results in excess of its financial commitment to NRG
under the settlement agreement reached in March 2003 among Xcel Energy, NRG and
NRG’s creditors. These excess losses were reversed upon NRG’s emergence from
bankruptcy in December 2003, as discussed previously.

In 2003, NRG’s operating
results (excluding the unusual items discussed above) were affected by higher
market prices due to higher natural gas prices and an increase in capacity
revenues due to additional projects becoming operational in the later part of
2002. In addition, the sale of an NRG investment in 2002 resulted in a
favorable impact in 2003 as the investment generated substantial equity losses
in the prior years. The increase was offset by losses incurred on contracts in
Connecticut due to increased market prices, increased operating expenses,
contract terminations and liquidated damages triggered by NRG’s financial
condition and additional restructuring charges.


During 2002, the tax
filing status of NRG for 2002 and future years changed from being included as
part of Xcel Energy’s consolidated federal income tax group to filing on a
stand-alone basis.

Other
Nonregulated Results — Discontinued Operations

On Sept. 27, 2004, Xcel Energy’s board of directors approved management’s
plan to pursue the sale of Seren, a wholly owned broadband communications
services subsidiary.  Seren delivers
cable television, high-speed Internet and telephone service over an advanced
network to approximately 45,000 customers in St. Cloud, Minn., and Concord and
Walnut Creek, Calif.  As a result of the
decision, Seren is accounted for as discontinued operations.  The sale of such investment is expected to be
completed by mid-2005.

During 2003, Xcel Energy’s board of directors approved management’s
plan to exit businesses conducted by e prime and Xcel Energy
International.  e prime ceased conducting
business in 2004.  Also during 2004, Xcel
Energy completed the sales of the Argentina subsidiaries of Xcel Energy
International.

2004 Nonregulated Results Compared with 2003
—

Results of
discontinued nonregulated operations in 2004 include the impact of the
sales of the Argentina subsidiaries of Xcel Energy International.  The sales were completed in three
transactions with a total sales price of approximately $31 million, including
certain adjustments that reached finalization in the fourth quarter of
2004.  Approximately $15 million was placed in escrow,
which is expected to remain in place until at least the end of the first
quarter of 2005, to support customary indemnity obligations under the sales
agreement.  In addition to the sales
price, Xcel Energy also received approximately $21 million at the closing of
one transaction as redemption of its capital investment.  The sales resulted in a gain of approximately
$8 million, including the realization of approximately $7 million of income tax
benefits realizable upon sale of the Xcel Energy International assets.

In addition, 2004 results from discontinued operations include the
impact of an after-tax impairment charge for Seren, including disposition
costs, of $143 million, or 34 cents per share. 
The impairment charge was recorded based on operating results, market
conditions and preliminary feedback from prospective buyers.

2003 Nonregulated Results Compared with 2002 —

Results of discontinued nonregulated
operations, other than NRG, include an after-tax loss of $59 million, or 14
cents per share, for the disposal of Xcel Energy International’s assets, based
on the estimated fair value of such assets. 
These losses from discontinued nonregulated operations also include a
charge of $16 million for costs of settling a Commodity Futures Trading
Commission trading investigation of e prime.

Tax Benefits Related to Investment in NRG —

Xcel Energy has recognized tax benefits related
to the divestiture of NRG.  These tax
benefits, since related to Xcel Energy’s investment in discontinued NRG
operations, also are reported as discontinued operations.

During 2002, Xcel Energy
recognized an initial estimate of the expected tax benefits of $706
million.  Based on the results of a 2003
preliminary tax basis study of NRG, Xcel Energy recorded $404 million of
additional tax benefits in 2003.  In
2004, the NRG basis study was updated and previously recognized tax benefits
were reduced by $16 million.

Based on current forecasts
of taxable income and tax liabilities, Xcel Energy expects to realize
approximately $1.1 billion of cash savings from these tax benefits through a
refund of taxes paid in prior years and reduced taxes payable in future years.
Xcel Energy used $405 million and $116 million of these tax benefits in 2004
and 2003, respectively, and expects to use $145 million in 2005. The remainder
of the tax benefit carry forward is expected to be used over subsequent years.

Factors Affecting
Results of Continuing Operations

Xcel Energy’s utility
revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions,
general business conditions and the cost of energy services. Various regulatory
agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their
respective jurisdictions and affect our ability to recover our costs from
customers. In addition, Xcel Energy’s nonregulated businesses have had an
adverse impact on Xcel Energy’s earnings in 2004, 2003 and 2002. The historical
and future trends of Xcel Energy’s operating results have been, and are
expected to be, affected by a number of factors, including the following:


General
Economic Conditions

Economic conditions may
have a material impact on Xcel Energy’s operating results. The United States
economy continues to show evidence of recovery as measured by growth in the
gross domestic product. However, certain operating costs, such as those for
insurance and security, have increased during the past three years due to
economic uncertainty, terrorist activity and war or the threat of war.
Management cannot predict the impact of a future economic slowdown, fluctuating
energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. However, Xcel
Energy could experience a material adverse impact to its results of operations,
future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a slowdown in future
economic growth.

Sales
Growth

In addition to the impact of
weather, customer sales levels in Xcel Energy’s regulated utility businesses
can vary with economic conditions, energy prices, customer usage patterns and
other factors. Weather-normalized sales growth for retail electric utility
customers was estimated to be 1.8 percent in 2004 compared with 2003, and 1.5
percent in 2003 compared with 2002. Weather-normalized sales growth for firm
natural gas utility customers was estimated to be approximately (1.9) percent
in 2004 compared with 2003 and 1.6 percent in 2003 compared with 2002.
Projections indicate that weather-normalized sales growth in 2005 compared with
2004 will be approximately 2.2 percent for retail electric utility customers
and 1.1 percent for firm gas utility customers.

Pension
Plan Costs and Assumptions

Xcel Energy’s pension costs
are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of key
assumptions, most notably the annual return level that pension investment
assets will earn in the future and the interest rate used to discount future
pension benefit payments to a present value obligation for financial reporting.
In addition, the actuarial calculation uses an asset-smoothing methodology to
reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. Note 12 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the rate of return and discount
rate used in the calculation of pension costs and obligations in the
accompanying financial statements.

Pension costs have been
increasing in recent years, and are expected to increase further over the next
several years, due to lower-than-expected investment returns experienced in
prior years and decreases in interest rates used to discount benefit
obligations. While investment returns exceeded the assumed level of 9.25
percent in 2003 and 9.0 percent in 2004, investment returns in 2001 and 2002
were below the assumed level of 9.5 percent and discount rates have declined
from the 7.25-percent to 8-percent levels used in 1999 through 2002 cost
determinations to 6.25 percent used in 2004. Xcel Energy continually reviews
its pension assumptions and, in 2005, expects to change the investment return
assumption to 8.75 percent and the discount rate assumption to 6.0 percent.

The investment gains or
losses resulting from the difference between the expected pension returns
assumed on smoothed or “market-related” asset levels and actual returns earned
is deferred in the year the difference arises and recognized over the
subsequent five-year period. This gain or loss recognition occurs by using a
five-year, moving-average value of pension assets to measure expected asset
returns in the cost–determination process, and by amortizing deferred
investment gains or losses over the subsequent five-year period. Based on the
use of average market-related asset values, and considering the expected
recognition of past investment gains and losses over the next five years,
achieving the assumed rate of asset return of 8.75 percent in each future year
and holding other assumptions constant, Xcel Energy currently projects that the
pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes in continuing
operations will increase from a credit, or negative expense, of $27 million in
2004 to an expense of $8 million in 2005 and $20 million in 2006. Pension costs
are currently a credit due to the recognized investment asset returns exceeding
the other pension cost components, such as benefits earned for current service
and interest costs for the effects of the passage of time on discounted
obligations.

Xcel
Energy bases its discount rate assumption on benchmark interest rates quoted by
an established credit rating agency, Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), and
has consistently benchmarked the interest rate used to derive the discount rate
to the movements in the long-term corporate bond indices for bonds rated Aaa
through Baa by Moody’s, which have a period to maturity comparable to our
projected benefit obligations. At Dec. 31, 2003, the annualized Moody’s Baa
index rate was 6.61 percent and the Aaa index rate was 5.63 percent.  The corresponding pension discount rate was
6.25 percent.  At Dec. 31, 2004, the
annualized Moody’s Baa index rate had declined 51 basis points to 6.10 percent,
and the Aaa index rate had declined 20 basis points to 5.43 percent.  Accordingly, the discount rate as of Dec. 31,
2004, was lowered 25 basis points to 6.00 percent. This rate was used to value
the actuarial benefit obligations at that date, and will be used in 2005
pension cost determinations.

If Xcel Energy were to use
alternative assumptions for pension cost determinations, a 1-percent change
would result in the following impacts on the estimated pension costs recognized
by Xcel Energy for financial reporting purposes:


•

a 100 basis point higher rate of return, 9.75
percent, would decrease 2005 pension costs by $17.9 million;

•

a 100 basis point lower rate of return, 7.75
percent, would increase 2005 pension costs by $17.9 million;

•

a 100 basis point higher discount rate, 7.0
percent, would decrease 2005 pension costs by $8.3 million; and

•

a 100 basis point lower discount rate, 5.0
percent, would increase 2005 pension costs by $6.2 million.

Alternative Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) funding assumptions would also
change the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plans.
Cash funding requirements can be affected by changes to actuarial assumptions,
actual asset levels and other calculations prescribed by the funding
requirements of income tax and other pension-related regulations. These
regulations did not require cash funding in recent years for Xcel Energy’s
pension plans, and do not require funding in 2005. Assuming that future asset
return levels equal the actuarial assumption of 8.75 percent for the years 2005
and 2006, Xcel Energy projects, under current funding regulations, that no cash
funding would be required for 2005 and cash funding of $9 million would be
required for 2006. Actual performance can affect these funding requirements
significantly. Current funding regulations are under legislative review in 2005
and, if not retained in their current form, could change these funding
requirements materially.

Regulation

Xcel Energy, its utility
subsidiaries and certain of its nonutility subsidiaries are subject to
extensive regulation by the SEC under the PUHCA with respect to issuances and
sales of securities, acquisitions and sales of certain utility properties and
intra-system sales of certain non-power goods and services. In addition, the
PUHCA generally limits the ability of registered holding companies to acquire
additional public utility systems and to acquire and retain businesses
unrelated to the utility operations of the holding company. See further
discussion of financing restrictions under Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Xcel Energy’s utility
subsidiaries also are regulated by the FERC and state regulatory commissions.
Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energy’s results of
operations. Xcel Energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on
changing energy market and general economic conditions.

The electric and natural gas
rates charged to customers of Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries are approved
by the FERC and the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate.
The rates are generally designed to recover plant investment, operating costs
and an allowed return on investment. 
Xcel Energy requests changes in rates for utility services through
filings with the governing commissions. Because comprehensive rate changes are
requested infrequently in some states, changes in operating costs can affect
Xcel Energy’s financial results. In addition to changes in operating costs,
other factors affecting rate filings are new investment, sales growth,
conservation and demand-side management efforts, and the cost of capital.  In addition, the return on equity authorized
is set by regulatory commissions in rate proceedings.  The most recently authorized electric utility
returns are 11.47 percent for NSP-Minnesota, 11.9 percent for NSP-Wisconsin,
10.75 percent for PSCo and 11.5 percent for SPS.

Most of the retail rates for
Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries provide for periodic adjustments to billings
and revenues to allow for recovery of changes in the cost of fuel for electric
generation, purchased energy, purchased natural gas for resale and, in Minnesota
and Colorado, conservation, energy-management program costs and certain other
costs.  In Colorado, certain purchased
electric capacity costs are recovered through a rate-adjustment mechanism.  In Minnesota, generally changes in purchased
electric capacity costs are not recovered through these rate-adjustment
mechanisms. For Wisconsin electric operations, where automatic cost-of-energy
adjustment clauses are not allowed, the biennial retail rate review process and
an interim fuel-cost hearing process provide the opportunity for rate recovery
of changes in electric fuel and purchased energy costs in lieu of a
cost-of-energy adjustment clause. In Colorado, PSCo had an interim adjustment
clause that allowed for recovery of all prudently incurred electric fuel and
purchased energy expenses in 2003.  In
2004, PSCo generally recovered all prudently incurred electric fuel and
purchased energy costs through an electric commodity adjustment clause.
Additionally, this fuel mechanism also has in place a sharing among customers
and shareholders of certain fuel and energy costs, with an $11.25 million
maximum on any cost sharing over or under an allowed electric commodity
adjustment formula rate, and a sharing among shareholders and customers of
certain gains and losses on trading margins. 
In 2004, PSCo estimated that energy costs incurred were lower than the
commodity adjustment formula rate and accrued an incentive of $11.25 million at
Dec. 31, 2004.

Xcel Energy’s utility
subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions to build and
upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the reliability of the energy
distribution system. In addition to filing for increases in base rates charged
to customers to recover the costs associated with such investments, in 2002 and
2003 approval was obtained from Colorado and Minnesota regulators to recover,
through a rate surcharge, certain costs to upgrade plants and lower emissions
in the Denver and Minneapolis-St. Paul


metropolitan areas. These
rate recovery mechanisms are expected to provide significant cash flows to
enable recovery of costs incurred on a timely basis.

Regulated public utilities
are allowed to record as regulatory assets certain costs that are expected to
be recovered from customers in future periods and to record as regulatory
liabilities certain income items that are expected to be refunded to customers
in future periods. In contrast, nonregulated enterprises would expense these
costs and recognize the income in the current period. If restructuring or other
changes in the regulatory environment occur, Xcel Energy may no longer be
eligible to apply this accounting treatment, and may be required to eliminate
such regulatory assets and liabilities from its balance sheet. Such changes
could have a material effect on Xcel Energy’s results of operations in the
period the write-off is recorded.

At Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy
reported on its balance sheet regulatory assets of approximately $851 million
and regulatory liabilities of approximately $1.6 billion that would be
recognized in the statement of operations in the absence of regulation. In
addition to a potential write-off of regulatory assets and liabilities,
restructuring and competition may require recognition of certain stranded costs
not recoverable under market pricing. See Notes 1 and 18 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of regulatory deferrals.

Tax Matters

Interest Expense Deductibility

- PSCo’s
wholly owned subsidiary, PSR Investments, Inc. (PSRI), owns and manages
permanent life insurance policies, known as COLI policies, on some of PSCo’s
employees. At various times, borrowings have been made against the cash values
of these COLI policies and deductions taken on the interest expense on these
borrowings. The IRS has challenged the deductibility of such interest expense
deductions and has disallowed the deductions taken in tax years 1993 through
1999.  Should the IRS ultimately prevail on this issue, tax and interest
payable through Dec. 31, 2004, would reduce earnings by an estimated $311
million.  In 2004, Xcel Energy received
formal notification that the IRS will seek penalties.  If penalties (plus associated interest) are
also included, the total exposure through Dec. 31, 2004, is approximately $368
million.  Xcel Energy estimates its
annual earnings for 2005 would be reduced by $40 million, after tax, which
represents 9 cents per share, if COLI interest expense deductions were no
longer available.  See Note 16 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Accounting for
Uncertain Tax Positions

— In late July 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) discussed potential changes or
clarifications in the criteria for recognition of tax benefits, which may
result in raising the threshold for recognizing tax benefits, which have some
degree of uncertainty. The FASB has not issued any proposed guidance, but an
exposure draft may be released in the first quarter of 2005.  Xcel Energy is unable to determine the impact
or timing of any potential accounting changes required by the FASB, but such
changes could have a material financial impact.

Environmental
Matters

Environmental costs include
payments for nuclear plant decommissioning, storage and ultimate disposal of
spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, remediation of
contaminated sites and monitoring of discharges to the environment. A trend of
greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation has
caused, and may continue to cause, higher operating expenses and capital
expenditures for environmental compliance.

In addition to nuclear
decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, costs charged to
operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous
materials and wastes were approximately:

•

$133 million in 2004;

•

$133 million in 2003; and

•

$138 million in 2002.

Xcel Energy expects to
expense an average of approximately $154 million per year from 2005 through
2009 for similar costs. However, the precise timing and amount of environmental
costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous
materials, are currently unknown. Additionally, the extent to which
environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates is not
certain.


Capital expenditures on
environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately:

•

$20.9 million in 2004;

•

$58.5 million in 2003; and

•

$107.8 million in 2002.

The regulated utilities
expect to incur approximately $221 million in capital expenditures for
compliance with environmental regulations and environmental improvements in
2005 and approximately $980 million of related expenditures during the period
from 2006 through 2009. Approximately $171 million and $787 million of these
expenditures, respectively, are related to modifications to reduce the emissions
of NSP-Minnesota’s generating plants located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul
metropolitan area pursuant to the metropolitan emissions reduction project,
which are recoverable from customers through cost-recovery mechanisms. See
Notes 16 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion
of Xcel Energy’s environmental contingencies.

Impact of
Nonregulated Investments

In the past, Xcel Energy’s
investments in nonregulated operations have had a significant impact on its
results of operations. As a result of the divestiture of NRG and other
nonregulated operations, Xcel Energy does not expect that its investments in
nonregulated operations will continue to have such a significant impact on its
results. Xcel Energy does not expect to make any material investments in
nonregulated projects. Xcel Energy’s remaining nonregulated businesses may
carry a higher level of risk than its traditional utility businesses.

Inflation

Inflation at its current
level is not expected to materially affect Xcel Energy’s prices or returns to
shareholders.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

Preparation of the
Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in compliance with
GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and
guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies
necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the
likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges
and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could
materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures based
on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the
financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect, not
only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the
application of accounting measures used in preparing the Consolidated Financial
Statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting
policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting
policies that are most significant to the portrayal of Xcel Energy’s financial
condition and results, and that require management’s most difficult, subjective
or complex judgments. Each of these has a higher potential likelihood of
resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions
or using different assumptions. Each critical accounting policy has been
discussed with the audit committee of the Xcel Energy board of directors.



Xcel Energy continually
makes informed judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting
policy areas, based on an evaluation of the varying assumptions and
uncertainties for each area. For example:

•

Probable outcomes of regulatory proceedings
are assessed in cases of requested cost recovery or other approvals from
regulators.

•

The ability to operate plant facilities and
recover the related costs over their useful operating lives, or such other
period designated by our regulators, is assumed.

•

Probable outcomes of reviews and challenges
raised by tax authorities, including appeals and litigation where necessary,
are assessed.

•

Projections are made regarding earnings on
pension investments, and the salary increases provided to employees over their
periods of service.

•

Future cash inflows of operations are
projected in order to assess whether they will be sufficient to recover future
cash outflows, including the impacts of product price changes and market
penetration to customer groups.

The information and
assumptions underlying many of these judgments and estimates will be affected
by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time.
This may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect the events
and updated information that becomes available. The accompanying financial
statements reflect management’s best estimates and judgments of the impacts of
these factors as of Dec. 31, 2004.

Recently Implemented
Accounting Changes

For a discussion of
significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Pending
Accounting Changes

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004) — “Share Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R)

—

In December 2004,
FASB issued SFAS No. 123R related to equity-based compensation.  This statement replaces the original SFAS No.
123 — “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.”

Under SFAS No. 123R, companies are
no longer allowed to account for their share-based payment awards using the
intrinsic value allowed by previous accounting requirements, which did not
require any expense to be recorded on stock options granted with an equal to or
greater than fair market value exercise price. 
Instead, equity-based compensation arrangements will be measured and
recognized based on the grant-date fair value using an option-pricing model
(such as Black-Scholes or Binomial) that considers at least six factors
identified in SFAS No. 123R.  An expense
related to the difference between the grant-date fair value and the purchase
price would be recognized over the vesting period of the options.  Under previous guidance, companies were
allowed to initially estimate forfeitures or recognize them as they actually
occurred.  SFAS No. 123R requires
companies to estimate forfeitures on the date of grant and to adjust that
estimate when information becomes available that suggests actual forfeitures
will differ from previous estimates. 
Revisions to forfeiture estimates will be recorded as a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the revision
occurs.

Previous accounting guidance allowed for compensation expense related
to performance share plans to be reversed if the target was not met.  However, under SFAS No. 123R, compensation
expense for performance share plans that expire unexercised due to the company’s
failure to reach a certain target stock price cannot be reversed.  Any accruals made for Xcel Energy’s restricted
stock unit plan could not be reversed if the target was not met.  Implementation of SFAS No. 123R is required
for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005.  Xcel Energy is required to adopt the
provisions in the third quarter of 2005. 
Implementation is not expected to have a material impact on net income
or earnings per share.

DERIVATIVES,
RISK MANAGEMENT AND MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are
exposed to a variety of market risks. 
Market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of changes
in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity.  All financial and commodity related
instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk.  These risks, as applicable to Xcel Energy and
its subsidiaries, are discussed in further detail below.

Commodity Price Risk —

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed
to commodity price risk in their generation and retail distribution
operations.  Commodity price risk is managed
by entering into both long- and short-term physical purchase and sales
contracts for electric power, natural gas, coal and fuel oil.  Commodity price risk is also managed through
the use of financial derivative instruments. 
Xcel Energy’s risk management policy allows it to manage commodity price
risk within each rate-regulated operation to the extent such exposure exists.


Short-Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Risk —

Xcel Energy’s subsidiaries conduct various
commodity-marketing activities, including the purchase and sale of capacity,
energy and energy-related instruments. These marketing activities are primarily
focused on specific regions where market knowledge and experience have been
obtained and are generally less than one year in length. Xcel Energy’s risk
management policy allows management to conduct the marketing activities within
approved guidelines and limitations as approved by the company’s risk
management committee, which is made up of management personnel not directly
involved in the activities governed by the policy.

Certain contracts within the
scope of these activities qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No.
133 — “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as
amended, while others are subject to the fair value requirements of this
pronouncement.

The fair value of the
commodity trading contracts for continuing operations as of Dec. 31, 2004, was
as follows:

As of Dec. 31, 2004, the
sources of fair value of the commodity trading and hedging net assets were as
follows:

Commodity
Trading Contracts


Hedge
Contracts

— Prices actively quoted or based on actively quoted prices.

2 — Prices based on models
and other valuation methods. These represent the fair value of positions
calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external
prices or prices derived from external sources are not available. Internal
models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present
value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms. The models reflect
management’s estimates, taking into account observable market prices, estimated
market prices in the absence of quoted market prices, the risk-free market
discount rate, volatility factors, estimated correlations of commodity prices
and contractual volumes. Market price uncertainty and other risks also are
factored into the model.

Normal purchases and sales
transactions, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, have been excluded.

At Dec. 31, 2004, a
10-percent increase in market prices over the next 12 months for trading
contracts would impact pretax income from continuing operations by
approximately $(0.1) million, whereas a 10-percent decrease would impact pretax
income from continuing operations by approximately $0.1 million.  Hedge contracts are accounted for as a
component of Other Comprehensive Income and would not directly impact earnings.

Xcel Energy’s short-term
wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk
exposure to price changes on transactions, contracts and obligations that have
been entered into, but not closed, using an industry standard methodology known
as Value-at-Risk (VaR). VaR expresses the potential change in fair value on the
outstanding transactions, contracts and obligations over a particular period of
time, with a given confidence interval under normal market conditions. Xcel
Energy utilizes the variance/covariance approach in calculating VaR. The VaR
model employs a 95-percent confidence interval level based on historical price
movement, lognormal price distribution assumption, delta half-gamma approach
for non-linear instruments and a three-day holding period for both electricity
and natural gas.  Previously, Xcel Energy
calculated VaR using a holding period of five days for electricity and two days
for natural gas.  However, the
methodology was changed to ensure consistency in risk measurement across both
commodities.  Xcel Energy’s revised
holding periods remain consistent with current industry practice.  VaR using the current methodology for 2004
and previous methodology for 2003 are as follows:

As of Dec. 31, 2004, the calculated
VaRs using the current methodology were:

(a)

Comprises transactions for NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS.


As of Dec. 31, 2003, the
calculated VaRs using the previous methodology were:

(a)
Comprises transactions for both NSP-Minnesota and PSCo.

(b)
Conducted by e prime, which is a discontinued operation.

Interest Rate Risk —

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are subject
to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of
business.  Xcel Energy’s risk management
policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate
debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps,
collars and put or call options.

Xcel
Energy engages in hedges of cash flow and fair value exposure.  The fair value of interest rate swaps
designated as cash flow hedges is initially recorded in Other Comprehensive
Income.  Reclassification of unrealized
gains or losses on cash flow hedges of variable rate debt instruments from
Other Comprehensive Income into earnings occurs as interest payments are
accrued on the debt instrument and generally offsets the change in the interest
accrued on the underlying variable rate debt. 
Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into to hedge the fair value
of a recognized asset, liability or firm commitment.  Changes in the derivative fair values that
are designated as fair value hedges are recognized in earnings as offsets to
the changes in fair values of related hedged assets, liabilities or firm
commitments.  To test the effectiveness
of such swaps, a hypothetical swap is used to mirror all the critical terms of
the underlying debt and regression analysis is utilized to assess the
effectiveness of the actual swap at inception and on an ongoing basis, if
required.  The assessment is done
periodically to ensure the swaps continue to be effective.  The fair value of interest rate swaps is
determined through counterparty valuations, internal valuations and broker
quotes.  There have been no material
changes in the techniques or models used in the valuation of interest rate
swaps during the periods presented.

At
Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, a 100-basis-point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel
Energy’s variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense by
approximately $6.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively.  See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a discussion of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries’ interest rate
swaps.

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries also maintain trust funds, as required
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), to fund certain costs of nuclear
decommissioning, which are subject to interest rate risk and equity price
risk.  As of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003,
these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity
securities and fixed-rate fixed-income securities.  Per NRC mandates, these funds may be used
only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning.  The accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes
that costs are recovered through rates; therefore fluctuations in equity prices,
or interest rates do not have an impact on earnings.

Credit Risk —

In addition to the risks discussed previously, Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries are exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of
loss resulting from the nonperformance by a counterparty of its contractual
obligations. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies intended
to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect
changes and scope of operations.

Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties. Xcel
Energy employs additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate, such
as letters of credit, parental guarantees, standardized master netting
agreements and termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and
negative exposures. The credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the
activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is
provided.

At Dec. 31, 2004, a
10-percent increase in prices would have resulted in a net mark-to-market
increase in credit risk exposure of $23.4 million, while a decrease of 10
percent would have resulted in a decrease of $14.4 million.


Foreign Currency Exchange Risk —

Due
to the discontinuance of NRG and Xcel Energy International’s operations in
2003, as discussed in Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
Xcel Energy no longer has material foreign currency exchange risk.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flows

Cash provided by operating
activities for continuing operations increased $19 million during 2004 compared
with 2003 due to the timing of payments made for trade payables partially
offset by increased inventory costs related to higher natural gas costs, which
will be collected from customers in future periods.  Cash provided by operating activities for
discontinued operations decreased $580 million during 2004 compared with
2003.  During 2004, Xcel Energy paid $752
million pursuant to the NRG settlement agreement, which was partially offset by
tax benefits received.

Cash provided by operating
activities for continuing operations decreased during 2003 compared with 2002
primarily due to decreases in recovery of deferred fuel costs. Cash provided by
operating activities for discontinued operations decreased during 2003 compared
with 2002 due to the de-consolidation of NRG for 2003 reporting and the exclusion
of any of its cash flows in that year. The decrease was partially offset by tax
benefits received in connection with the divestiture of NRG in 2003.

Cash used in investing
activities for continuing operations increased $236 million during 2004
compared with 2003 primarily due to increased utility capital
expenditures.  Cash provided by investing
activities for discontinued operations decreased $73 million during 2004
compared with 2003 primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of
Viking in 2003.

Cash used in investing
activities for continuing operations was approximately the same during 2003
compared with 2002 due to comparable utility construction expenditures. Cash
flows for investing activities related to discontinued operations increased during
2003 compared with 2002 due to the de-consolidation of NRG for 2003 reporting
and the exclusion of any of its cash flows in that year. NRG had significant
construction expenditures during 2002 prior to its financial difficulties.

Cash flow from financing
activities related to continuing operations increased $252 million during 2004
compared with 2003 primarily due to increased short-term borrowings partially
offset by a common stock repurchase.

Cash flows for financing
activities related to continuing operations decreased during 2003 compared with
2002 due to refinancing activities in 2003 to better align Xcel Energy’s
capital structure and manage the cost of capital given the improving credit
quality of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries. During 2003, Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries extinguished $1.3 billion of long-term debt and issued


approximately $1.7 billion
of long-term debt, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Capitalization.
Cash flows for financing activities related to discontinued operations
decreased during 2003 compared with 2002 due to the de-consolidation of NRG for
2003 reporting and the exclusion of any of its cash flows in that year. NRG
obtained financing in 2002 for its construction expenditures prior to
experiencing its financial difficulties.

See discussion of trends,
commitments and uncertainties with the potential for future impact on cash flow
and liquidity under Capital Sources.

Capital
Requirements

Utility Capital Expenditures, Nonregulated Investments and Long-Term
Debt

Obligations —

The
estimated cost of the capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries, excluding discontinued operations, and other capital requirements
for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 are shown in the table below.

The capital expenditure
forecast includes the 750-megawatt Comanche 3 coal-fired plant in Colorado and
the  MERP project, which will  reduce the emissions of three NSP-Minnesota’s
generating plants.  The MERP project is
expected to cost approximately $1 billion, with major construction starting in
2005 and finishing in 2009. Xcel Energy expects to recover the costs of the
emission-reduction project through customer rate increases beginning in
2006.  Comanche 3 is expected to cost
approximately $1.35 billion, with major construction starting in 2006 and finishing
in 2010.  The Colorado commission has
approved sharing one-third ownership of this plant with other parties.  Consequently, Xcel Energy’s capital
expenditure forecast includes $1 billion, approximately two-thirds of the total
cost.

Xcel Energy is evaluating
a potential investment in a wind generation project of approximately $165
million, currently not included in the capital expenditure forecast.  A decision to move forward with this type of
investment will be dependent on the extension of federal tax credits related to
wind generation, favorable regulatory recovery and other business
considerations.

The capital expenditure
programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification.
Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to
changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, the desired reserve
margin and the availability of purchased power, as well as alternative plans
for meeting Xcel Energy’s long-term energy needs. In addition, Xcel Energy’s
ongoing evaluation of restructuring requirements, compliance with future
requirements to install emission-control equipment, and merger, acquisition and
divestiture opportunities to support corporate strategies may impact actual
capital requirements. For more information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments —

Xcel Energy has contractual obligations and
other commercial commitments that will need to be funded in the future, in
addition to its capital expenditure programs. The following is a summarized
table of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at Dec. 31,
2004. See additional discussion in the Consolidated Statements of
Capitalization and Notes 5, 6, 15 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.


(a) Under some leases, Xcel
Energy would have to sell or purchase the property that it leases if it chose
to terminate before the scheduled lease expiration date. Most of Xcel Energy’s
railcar, vehicle and equipment and aircraft leases have these terms. At Dec.
31, 2004, the amount that Xcel Energy would have to pay if it chose to
terminate these leases was approximately $130.5 million.

(b) Obligations to purchase fuel
for electric generating plants, and electricity and natural gas for resale.  Certain contractual purchase obligations are
adjusted based on indexes.  However, the
effects of price changes are mitigated through cost-of-energy adjustment
mechanisms.

(c) Xcel Energy also has
outstanding authority under contracts and blanket purchase orders to purchase
up to approximately $500 million of goods and services through the year 2020,
in addition to the amounts disclosed in this table and in the forecasted capital
expenditures.

Common Stock Dividends —

Future dividend levels will be dependent upon the statutory limitations
discussed below, as well as Xcel Energy’s results of operations, financial
position, cash flows and other factors, and will be evaluated by the Xcel
Energy board of directors. Xcel Energy’s objective is to deliver the financial
results that will enable the board of directors to grant annual dividend
increases at a rate consistent with our long-term earnings growth rate.  Xcel Energy’s dividend policy balances:

•

projected cash generation from utility
operations;

•

projected capital investment in the utility
businesses;

•

reasonable rate of return on shareholder
investment; and

•

impact on Xcel Energy’s capital structure and
credit ratings.

Under PUHCA, unless there is
an order from the SEC, a holding company or any subsidiary may only declare and
pay dividends out of retained earnings. Xcel Energy had $397 million of
retained earnings at Dec. 31, 2004, and expects to declare dividends as scheduled.
The cash to pay dividends to Xcel Energy shareholders is primarily derived from
dividends received from the utility subsidiaries. The utility subsidiaries are
generally limited in the amount of dividends allowed by state regulatory
commissions to be paid to the holding company. The limitation is imposed
through equity ratio limitations that range from 30 percent to 60 percent. All
utility subsidiaries are required under PUHCA to pay dividends only from
retained earnings, and some must comply with covenant restrictions under credit
agreements for debt to total capitalization ratios.

The Articles of
Incorporation of Xcel Energy place restrictions on the amount of common stock
dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding. Under the provisions,
dividend payments may be restricted if Xcel Energy’s capitalization ratio (on a
holding company basis only, i.e., not on a consolidated basis) is less than 25
percent. For these purposes, the capitalization ratio is equal to common stock
plus surplus divided by the sum of common stock plus surplus plus long-term
debt. Based on this definition, Xcel Energy’s capitalization ratio at Dec. 31,
2004, was 80 percent. Therefore, the restrictions do not place any effective
limit on Xcel Energy’s ability to pay dividends because the restrictions are
only triggered when the capitalization ratio is less than 25 percent or will be
reduced to less than 25 percent through dividends (other than dividends payable
in common stock), distributions or acquisitions of Xcel Energy common stock.

Capital
Sources

Xcel Energy expects to meet
future financing requirements by periodically issuing short-term debt,
long-term debt, common stock and preferred securities to maintain desired
capitalization ratios.

Registered holding companies
and certain of their subsidiaries, including Xcel Energy and its utility
subsidiaries, are limited under PUHCA in their ability to issue securities.
Such registered holding companies and their subsidiaries may not issue
securities unless authorized by an exemptive rule or order of the SEC. Because
Xcel Energy does not qualify for any of the main exemptive rules, it has
received financing authority from the SEC under PUHCA for various financing
arrangements. Xcel Energy’s current financing authority permits it, subject to
satisfaction of certain conditions, to issue through June 30, 2005, up to $2.5
billion of common stock


and long-term debt and $1.5
billion of short-term debt at the holding-company level. Xcel Energy has issued
$2.2 billion of long-term debt and common stock, including the $600 million
credit facility that closed in November 2004 that replaced the previous $400
million facility.

On Dec. 17, 2004, Xcel
Energy filed an application with the SEC requesting additional financing
authorization beyond June 30, 2005.  If
approved, the new financing authority would extend through June 30, 2008.  The new application requests the authority
for Xcel Energy to issue up to $1.8 billion of new long-term debt, common
equity and equity-linked securities and $1.0 billion of short-term debt
securities during the new authorization period, provided that the aggregate
amount of long-term debt, common equity, equity-linked and short-term debt
securities issued during the new authorization period does not exceed $2.0
billion.  Xcel Energy expects the SEC to
issue an order prior to the expiration of the existing authorization.

Xcel Energy’s ability to
issue securities under the financing authority is subject to a number of
conditions. One of the conditions of the financing authority is that Xcel
Energy’s consolidated ratio of common equity to total capitalization be at
least 30 percent. As of Dec. 31, 2004, the common equity ratio was
approximately 42 percent. Additional conditions require that a security to be
issued that is rated, be rated investment grade by at least one nationally
recognized rating agency. Finally, all outstanding securities that are rated
must be rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating
agency. On Feb. 17, 2005, Xcel Energy’s senior unsecured debt was considered
investment grade by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (Standard & Poor’s)
and Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (Moody’s).

Short-Term Funding Sources —

Historically, Xcel Energy has used a number
of sources to fulfill short-term funding needs, including operating cash flow,
notes payable, commercial paper and bank lines of credit. The amount and timing
of short-term funding needs depend in large part on financing needs for
construction expenditures. Another significant short-term funding need is the
dividend payment.

As of Feb. 17, 2005, Xcel
Energy and its utility subsidiaries had the following credit facilities
available to meet its liquidity needs:

*

Includes short-term borrowings and letters of
credit

**

The credit facilities of NSP-Minnesota, PSCo
and SPS are expected to be renewed as five-year revolving credit facilities
through a pro-rata syndication prior to May 2005.

Operating cash flow as a
source of short-term funding is affected by such operating factors as weather;
regulatory requirements, including rate recovery of costs; environmental
regulation compliance and industry deregulation; changes in the trends for
energy prices; and supply and operational uncertainties, which are difficult to
predict. See further discussion of such factors under Statement of Operations
Analysis.

Short-term borrowing as a
source of funding is affected by regulatory actions and access to reasonably
priced capital markets. For additional information on Xcel Energy’s short-term
borrowing arrangements, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Access to reasonably priced capital markets is dependent in part on credit
agency reviews and ratings. The following ratings reflect the views of Moody’s
and Standard & Poor’s. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy,
sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by
the rating company. As of Feb. 17, 2005, the following represents the credit
ratings assigned to various Xcel Energy companies:


Note: Moody’s highest
credit rating for debt is Aaa1 and lowest investment grade rating is Baa3.
Standard & Poor’s highest credit rating for debt is AAA+ and lowest
investment grade rating is BBB-. Moody’s prime ratings for commercial paper
range from P1 to P3. NP denotes a nonprime rating. Standard & Poor’s
ratings for commercial paper range from A1 to A3, B and C. As of Feb. 17, 2005,
Moody’s had Xcel Energy and its operating utility subsidiaries on “stable
outlook.”  Standard & Poor’s also had
Xcel Energy and its operating utility subsidiaries on “stable outlook.”

In the event of a downgrade
of its credit ratings below investment grade, Xcel Energy may be required to
provide credit enhancements in the form of cash collateral, letters of credit
or other security to satisfy all or a part of its exposures under guarantees
outstanding. See a list of guarantees at Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Xcel Energy has no explicit rating triggers in its debt agreements.

Money Pool

—
In 2003, Xcel Energy established a money pool arrangement with the utility
subsidiaries, subject to receipt of required state regulatory approvals. The money
pool allows for short-term loans between the utility subsidiaries and from the
holding company to the utility subsidiaries at market-based interest rates. The
money pool arrangement does not allow loans from the utility subsidiaries to
the holding company. State regulatory commission approvals have been received
for NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS, and borrowing and lending activity for these
utilities has commenced.  On Jan. 18,
2005, NSP-Wisconsin submitted a letter to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin
(PSCW) withdrawing its request for approval to participate in the money pool
arrangement after it became apparent the conditions likely to be imposed by the
PSCW would have limited flexibility and reduced the economic benefits of
NSP-Wisconsin’s participation.  The
borrowings or loans outstanding at Dec. 31, 2004, and the SEC approved
short-term borrowing limits from the utility money pool are:

Registration Statements —

Xcel Energy’s Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 1
billion shares of common stock. As of Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy had
approximately 400 million shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, Xcel
Energy’s Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 7 million shares
of $100 par value preferred stock. On Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy had
approximately 1 million shares of preferred stock outstanding. Xcel Energy and
its subsidiaries have the following registration statements on file with the
SEC, pursuant to which they may sell, from time to time, securities:

•

In February 2002, Xcel Energy filed a $1
billion shelf registration with the SEC. Xcel Energy may issue debt securities,
common stock and rights to purchase common stock under this shelf registration.
Xcel Energy has approximately $482.5 million remaining under this
registration.  Xcel Energy has
approximately $400 million remaining under the $1 billion shelf registration
filed with the SEC in 2000.


•

In April 2001, NSP-Minnesota filed a $600
million, long-term debt shelf registration with the SEC. NSP-Minnesota has
approximately $40 million remaining under this registration.

•

PSCo has an effective shelf registration
statement with the SEC under which $800 million of secured first collateral
trust bonds or unsecured senior debt securities were registered. PSCo has
approximately $225 million remaining under this registration.

Future
Financing Plans

Xcel Energy generally
expects to fund its operations and capital investments primarily through
internally generated funds.  Xcel Energy
plans to renew its credit facilities at NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS during 2005
and may refinance existing long-term debt or scheduled long-term debt
maturities based on prevailing market conditions.  The renewal of the credit facilities at
NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS is planned to be done with long-term credit
facilities for which borrowings would be reflected as a long-term liability on
the consolidated balance sheet.  To
facilitate its potential debt issuances, 
NSP-Minnesota may file a long-term debt shelf registration statement
with the SEC for up to $1 billion in 2005.

Off-Balance-Sheet
Arrangements

Xcel Energy does not have
any off-balance-sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

MANAGEMENT
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS

The management of Xcel Energy
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting.  Xcel Energy’s
internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the
company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to
be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation.

Xcel Energy management
assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of Dec. 31, 2004.  In making
this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment we believe that, as
of Dec. 31, 2004, the company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on those criteria.

Xcel Energy’s independent
auditors have issued an audit report on our assessment of the company’s
internal control over financial reporting. 
Their report appears on the following page.


REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Xcel Energy Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and consolidated
statements of capitalization of Xcel Energy Inc. (a Minnesota Corporation)
and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, common stockholders’ equity and
other comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders (deficit) equity and cash
flows of NRG Energy, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc.)
included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company, which
statements reflect losses from discontinued operations net of tax of $3.5
billion for the year ended December 31, 2002. Such financial statements were
audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us (which as to
2002 expresses an unqualified opinion and includes an explanatory paragraph
describing conditions that raise substantial doubt about NRG Energy, Inc.’s
ability to continue as a going concern), and our opinion, insofar as it relates
to the amounts included for NRG Energy, Inc. for the period described above, is
based solely on the report of such other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the
report of other auditors, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Xcel Energy Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated

March
3, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audits.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Xcel Energy Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying

Management Report On
Internal Controls

, that Xcel Energy Inc.and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error
or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections
of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2004 of the Company and
subsidiaries and our report dated March 3, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholder

of NRG Energy, Inc.:

In our opinion, the
consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows and stockholder’s (deficit)/equity (not presented
separately herein) present fairly, in all material respects, and the results of
operations and cash flows of NRG Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries for the year
ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance

with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States)

of America.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a
going concern. As discussed in Note 1 and Note 29 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company is experiencing credit and liquidity constraints and
has various credit arrangements that are in default. As a direct consequence,
during 2002 the Company entered into discussions with its creditors to develop
a comprehensive restructuring plan. In connection with its restructuring
efforts, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard
to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Business and System of Accounts —

Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries are
engaged principally in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and
sale of electricity and in the purchase, transportation, distribution and sale
of natural gas. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory
provisions of the PUHCA. The utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by
the FERC and state utility commissions. All of the utility companies’
accounting records conform to the FERC uniform system of accounts or to systems
required by various state regulatory commissions, which are the same in all
material respects.

Principles of Consolidation —

In 2004, Xcel Energy continuing operations
included the activity of four utility subsidiaries that serve electric and
natural gas customers in 10 states. These utility subsidiaries are
NSP-Minnesota; NSP-Wisconsin; PSCo and SPS. These utilities serve customers in
portions of Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. 
Along with WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline, these companies
comprise our continuing regulated utility operations.  Discontinued utility operations include the
activity of Viking, an interstate natural gas pipeline company that was sold in
January 2003; BMG, a regulated natural gas and propane distribution company
that was sold in October 2003; and Cheyenne, a regulated electric and natural
gas utility that was sold in January 2005. See Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information on the discontinued operations of
Viking, BMG and Cheyenne.

Xcel Energy’s nonregulated
subsidiaries in continuing operations include Utility Engineering Corp.
(engineering, construction and design) and Eloigne Co. (investments in rental
housing projects that qualify for low-income housing tax credits).   During 2003, Planergy International, Inc.
(energy management solutions) closed and began selling a majority of its
business operations, with final dissolution occurring in 2004.

During 2004, Xcel Energy’s
board of directors approved management’s plan to pursue the sale of Seren
Innovations, Inc. (broadband communications services).  NRG, Xcel Energy International, e prime and
Seren are presented as components of discontinued operations.  During 2003, Xcel Energy also divested its
ownership interest in NRG, an independent power producer. On May 14, 2003, NRG
filed for bankruptcy to restructure its debt. 
As a result of the reorganization, Xcel Energy relinquished its
ownership interest in NRG.  During 2003,
the board of directors of Xcel Energy also approved management’s plan to exit
businesses conducted by the nonregulated subsidiaries Xcel Energy International
and e prime.  See Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Xcel Energy owns the
following additional direct subsidiaries, some of which are intermediate
holding companies with additional subsidiaries: Xcel Energy Wholesale Energy
Group Inc., Xcel Energy Markets Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy Ventures Inc., Xcel
Energy Retail Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy Communications Group Inc., Xcel Energy
WYCO Inc. and Xcel Energy O&M Services Inc. Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries collectively are referred to as Xcel Energy.

In 2004, Xcel Energy began
consolidating the financial statements of subsidiaries in which it has a
controlling financial interest, pursuant to the requirements of FASB
Interpretation No. 46 as revised, (FIN No. 46). 
Historically, consolidation has been required only for subsidiaries in
which an enterprise has a majority voting interest.  As a result, Xcel Energy is required to
consolidate a portion of its affordable housing investments made through
Eloigne, which for periods prior to 2004 are accounted for under the equity
method.

As of Dec. 31, 2004, the
assets of the affordable housing investments consolidated as a result of FIN
No. 46, as revised, were approximately $144 million and long-term liabilities
were approximately $78 million, including long-term debt of $75 million.  Investments of $51 million, previously
reflected as a component of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, have been
consolidated with the entities’ assets initially recorded at their carrying
amounts as of Jan. 1, 2004.  The
long-term debt is collateralized by the affordable housing projects and is
nonrecourse to Xcel Energy.

Xcel Energy uses the equity
method of accounting for its investments in partnerships, joint ventures and
certain projects for which it does not have a controlling financial interest.
Under this method, a proportionate share of pre-tax income is recorded as
equity earnings from investments in affiliates. In the consolidation process,
all significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. Xcel
Energy has investments in several plants and transmission facilities jointly
owned with other utilities. These projects are accounted for on a proportionate
consolidation basis, consistent with industry practice. See Note 9 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition —

Revenues related to the sale of energy are generally recorded when
service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers. However, the
determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on the
reading of their meter, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the
month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since
the date


of the last meter reading
are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated.

Xcel Energy’s utility
subsidiaries have various rate-adjustment mechanisms in place that currently
provide for the recovery of certain purchased natural gas and electric energy
costs. These cost-adjustment tariffs may increase or decrease the level of
costs recovered through base rates and are revised periodically, as prescribed
by the appropriate regulatory agencies, for any difference between the total
amount collected under the clauses and the recoverable costs incurred. In
addition, Xcel Energy presents its revenue net of any excise or other
fiduciary-type taxes or fees. A summary of significant rate-adjustment
mechanisms follows:

•

In
2004, PSCo generally recovered all prudently incurred electric fuel and
purchased energy costs through an electric commodity adjustment clause.  This fuel mechanism also has in place a
sharing among customers and shareholders of certain fuel and energy costs, with
an $11.25 million maximum on any cost sharing over or under an allowed electric
commodity adjustment formula rate and a sharing among shareholders and
customers of certain gains and losses on trading margins.  In 2003, PSCo’s electric rates permitted
recovery of 100 percent of prudently incurred electric fuel and purchased
energy expense. In 2002, PSCo’s electric rates in Colorado were adjusted under
an incentive cost-adjustment mechanism, which resulted in the sharing of cost
increases and decreases with customers and sharing of trading margins.

•

NSP-Minnesota’s rates include a
cost-of-fuel-and-energy and a cost-of-gas recovery mechanism allowing
dollar-for-dollar recovery of the respective costs, which are trued-up on a
two-month and annual basis, respectively.

•

NSP-Wisconsin’s rates include a cost-of-gas
adjustment clause for purchased natural gas, but not for purchased electric
energy or electric fuel. In Wisconsin, requests can be made for recovery of
those electric costs prospectively through the rate review process, which
normally occurs every two years, and an interim fuel-cost hearing process.

•

In Colorado, PSCo operates under an electric
performance-based regulatory plan, which provides for an annual earnings test.
NSP-Minnesota and PSCo operate under various service standards, which could
require customer refunds if certain criteria are not met. NSP-Minnesota and
PSCo’s rates include monthly adjustments for the recovery of conservation and
energy-management program costs, which are reviewed annually.

•

SPS’ rates in Texas provide electric fuel and
purchased energy cost recovery. In New Mexico, SPS also has a monthly fuel and
purchased power cost-recovery factor.

•

NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS
sell firm power and energy in wholesale markets, which are regulated by the
FERC. Certain of these rates include monthly wholesale fuel cost-recovery
mechanisms.

Commodity Trading Operations —

All applicable gains and losses related to
commodity trading activities, whether or not settled physically, are shown on a
net basis in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Xcel Energy’s commodity
trading operations are conducted by NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS. Pursuant to
the JOA approved by the FERC, some of the commodity trading margins are
apportioned to the other operating utilities of Xcel Energy. Commodity trading
activities are not associated with energy produced from Xcel Energy’s
generation assets or energy and capacity purchased to serve native load.
Commodity trading results are recorded at fair market value in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, as amended.  In addition, commodity
trading results include the impacts of any margin-sharing mechanisms. In 2003,
Xcel Energy’s board of directors designated e prime as held for sale. e prime
had conducted natural gas commodity trading activities. Consequently, e prime
financial results are presented as discontinued operations. For more
information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivative Financial Instruments —

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries utilize a
variety of derivatives, including commodity forwards, futures and options,
index or fixed price swaps and basis swaps, to mitigate market risk and to
enhance our operations. For further discussion of Xcel Energy’s risk management
and derivative activities, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.


Property, Plant, Equipment and Depreciation —

Property, plant and equipment is stated at
original cost. The cost of plant includes direct labor and materials, contracted
work, overhead costs and applicable interest expense. The cost of plant retired
is charged to accumulated depreciation and amortization. Removal costs
associated with non-legal obligations are reclassified from accumulated
depreciation and reflected as regulatory liabilities. Significant additions or
improvements extending asset lives are capitalized, while repairs and
maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Maintenance and replacement of
items determined to be less than units of property are charged to operating
expenses. Property, plant and equipment also includes costs associated with the
engineering design of future generating stations and other property held for
future use.

Xcel Energy determines the
depreciation of its plant by using the straight-line method, which spreads the
original cost equally over the plant’s useful life. Depreciation expense,
expressed as a percentage of average depreciable property, was approximately
3.1 percent, 3.0 percent and 3.4 percent for the years ended Dec. 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFDC)

—

AFDC represents the cost of capital used to
finance utility construction activity. 
AFDC is computed by applying a composite pretax rate to qualified
construction work in progress.  The
amount of AFDC capitalized as a utility construction cost is credited to other
nonoperating income (for equity capital) and interest charges (for debt
capital). AFDC amounts capitalized are included in Xcel Energy’s rate base for
establishing utility service rates. In addition to construction-related
amounts, AFDC also is recorded to reflect returns on capital used to finance
conservation programs in Minnesota.

Decommissioning —

Xcel Energy accounts for the future cost of decommissioning, or
retirement, of its nuclear generating plants through annual depreciation
accruals using an annuity approach designed to provide for full rate recovery
of the future decommissioning costs. The decommissioning calculation covers all
expenses, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material, and
extends over the estimated lives of the plants. The calculation assumes that
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin will recover those costs through rates. The
fair value of external nuclear decommissioning fund investments are estimated
based on quoted market prices for those or similar investments. Unrealized
gains or losses are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities. In 2003,
NSP-Minnesota adopted SFAS No. 143, which changed the accounting methodology
for nuclear decommissioning costs. For more information on nuclear
decommissioning and the impacts of adopting SFAS No. 143, see Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

PSCo also previously
operated a nuclear generating plant, which has been decommissioned and
repowered using natural gas. PSCo’s costs associated with decommissioning were
deferred and are being amortized consistent with regulatory recovery.

Nuclear Fuel Expense —

Nuclear fuel expense, which is recorded as our nuclear generating
plants use fuel, includes the cost of fuel used in the current period, as well
as future disposal costs of spent nuclear fuel. In addition, nuclear fuel
expense includes fees assessed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for
NSP-Minnesota’s portion of the cost of decommissioning the DOE’s
fuel-enrichment facility.

Environmental Costs —

Environmental costs are recorded when it is probable Xcel Energy is
liable for the costs and the liability can reasonably be estimated. Costs may
be deferred as a regulatory asset based on an expectation that the costs will
be recovered from customers in future rates. Otherwise, the costs are expensed.
If an environmental expense is related to facilities currently in use, such as
emission-control equipment, the cost is capitalized and depreciated over the
life of the plant, assuming the costs are recoverable in future rates or future
cash flow.

Estimated remediation costs,
excluding inflationary increases, are recorded. The estimates are based on
experience, an assessment of the current situation and the technology currently
available for use in the remediation. The recorded costs are regularly adjusted
as estimates are revised and as remediation proceeds. If several designated
responsible parties exist, only Xcel Energy’s expected share of the cost is
estimated and recorded. Any future costs of restoring sites where operation may
extend indefinitely are treated as a capitalized cost of plant retirement. The
depreciation expense levels recoverable in rates include a provision for
removal expenses, which has the latitude to compensate for final remediation
costs. Removal costs recovered in rates are classified as a regulatory liability.

Legal Costs

— Litigation settlements are recorded when it is probable Xcel Energy is liable
for the costs and the liability can be reasonably estimated.  Legal accruals are recorded net of insurance
recovery.  Legal costs related to
settlements are not accrued, but expensed as incurred.


Income Taxes —

Xcel Energy and its domestic subsidiaries file consolidated federal
income tax returns. NRG and its domestic subsidiaries were included in Xcel
Energy’s consolidated federal income tax returns prior to NRG’s March 2001
public equity offering. Xcel Energy and its domestic subsidiaries file combined
and separate state income tax returns. NRG and one or more of its domestic
subsidiaries were included in some, but not all, of these combined returns in
2002 and 2003. NRG will not be consolidated or combined in any of Xcel Energy’s
income tax returns after 2003.

Federal income taxes paid by
Xcel Energy, as parent of the Xcel Energy consolidated group, are allocated to
the Xcel Energy subsidiaries based on separate company computations of tax. A similar
allocation is made for state income taxes paid by Xcel Energy in connection
with combined state filings. In accordance with PUHCA requirements, the holding
company also allocates its own net income tax benefits to its direct
subsidiaries based on the positive tax liability of each company.

Xcel Energy defers income
taxes for all temporary differences between pretax financial and taxable
income, and between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Xcel
Energy uses the tax rates that are scheduled to be in effect when the temporary
differences are expected to turn around, or reverse.

Due to the effects of past
regulatory practices, when deferred taxes were not required to be recorded, the
reversal of some temporary differences are accounted for as current income tax
expense. Investment tax credits are deferred and their benefits amortized over
the estimated lives of the related property. Utility rate regulation also has
created certain regulatory assets and liabilities related to income taxes,
which are summarized in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of Estimates —

In recording transactions and balances resulting from business
operations, Xcel Energy uses estimates based on the best information available.
Estimates are used for such items as plant depreciable lives, tax provisions,
uncollectible amounts, environmental costs, unbilled revenues, jurisdictional
fuel and energy cost allocations and actuarially determined benefit costs. The
recorded estimates are revised when better information becomes available or
when actual amounts can be determined. Those revisions can affect operating
results. The depreciable lives of certain plant assets are reviewed or revised
annually, if appropriate.

Cash and Cash Equivalents —

Xcel Energy considers investments in certain
debt instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time
of purchase to be cash equivalents. Those debt instruments are primarily
commercial paper and money market funds.

Restricted cash in 2003 consisted
primarily of funds received from NRG to be used to collateralize in full
existing agreements of Xcel Energy to indemnify NRG, which continued after the
divestiture of NRG.  Restricted cash is
classified as a current asset as all restricted cash is designated for interest
and principal payments due within one year.

Inventory —

All
inventory is recorded at average cost, with the exception of natural gas in
underground storage at PSCo, which until 2004 was recorded using
last-in-first-out pricing (LIFO).  Effective
Jan. 1, 2004, PSCo changed its method of accounting for the cost of stored
natural gas for its local distribution operations from the LIFO pricing method
to the average cost pricing method. This change in accounting was approved by
the CPUC and was accounted for as a cumulative effect in accordance with the
CPUC authorization. The average cost method has historically been used for
pricing stored natural gas by both NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin, as well as
by PSCo for natural gas stored for use in its electric utility operations.

The
cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle resulted in an
increase to natural gas storage inventory and a corresponding decrease to the
deferred natural gas cost accounts of approximately $36 million as of Jan. 1,
2004. Of this amount, $33 million related to current natural gas storage
inventory and $3 million related to long-term natural gas storage inventory. As
natural gas costs are 100 percent recoverable for PSCo’s local natural gas
distribution operations under PSCo’s natural gas cost-adjustment mechanism, the
cumulative effect of this change had no impact on net income or earnings per
share. Prior period financial statements were not restated since the CPUC
authorized this change effective Jan. 1, 2004. Under the natural gas
cost-adjustment mechanism, the decrease in the cost of natural gas reduced
rates to retail natural gas customers in Colorado during 2004.


Regulatory Accounting —

Our regulated utility subsidiaries account for certain income and
expense items in accordance with SFAS No. 71 — “Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation.” Under SFAS No. 71:

•

certain costs, which would otherwise be
charged to expense, are deferred as regulatory assets based on the expected
ability to recover them in future rates; and

•

certain credits, which would otherwise be
reflected as income, are deferred as regulatory liabilities based on the
expectation they will be returned to customers in future rates.

Estimates of recovering
deferred costs and returning deferred credits are based on specific ratemaking
decisions or precedent for each item. Regulatory assets and liabilities are
amortized consistent with the period of expected regulatory treatment. See more
discussion of regulatory assets and liabilities at Note 18 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Stock-Based Employee Compensation —

Xcel Energy has several stock-based
compensation plans. Those plans are accounted for using the intrinsic-value
method. Compensation expense is not recorded for stock options because there is
no difference between the market price and the purchase price at grant date.
Compensation expense is recorded for restricted stock and stock units awarded to
certain employees, which are held until the restriction lapses or the stock is
forfeited. For more information on stock compensation impacts, see Note 11 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Intangible Assets —

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their economic
useful lives and periodically reviewed for impairment. Beginning in 2002,
goodwill is no longer being amortized, but is tested for impairment annually
and on an interim basis if an event occurs or a circumstance changes between
annual tests that may reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying value.

Xcel Energy’s goodwill
consisted primarily of project-related goodwill at Utility Engineering for 2004
and 2003. During 2004 and 2003, impairment testing resulted in write-downs of
this goodwill of $0.8 million and $4.8 million, respectively.

Intangible assets with
finite lives continue to be amortized, and the aggregate amortization expense
recognized in both years ended Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, were approximately $0.2
million and $0.2 million, respectively. The annual aggregate amortization
expense for each of the five succeeding years is expected to approximate $0.1
million. Intangible assets consisted of the following:

Asset Valuation

—

On
Jan. 1, 2002, Xcel Energy adopted SFAS No. 144 — “Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which supercedes previous guidance for
measurement of asset impairments. Xcel Energy did not recognize any asset
impairments as a result of the adoption. The method used in determining fair
value was based on a number of valuation techniques, including present value of
future cash flows.

Deferred Financing Costs

—

Other assets also included deferred financing
costs, net of amortization, of approximately $44 million at Dec. 31, 2004. Xcel
Energy is amortizing these financing costs over the remaining maturity periods
of the related debt.


Reclassifications

—

Certain
items in the statements of operations and the balance sheets have been
reclassified from prior period presentation to conform to the 2004
presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income or earnings
per share. The reclassifications were primarily related to organizational
changes, such as the sale of Cheyenne and the planned divestiture of Seren and
the related reclassification to discontinued operations.

2. Special
Charges

Special charges included in
Operating Expenses for the years ended Dec. 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, include
the following:

2004 Holding Company

—

Legal Settlement

—

In 2004, Xcel Energy
recorded a $17.6 million pretax charge for the accrual of a January 2005
settlement agreement related to shareholder lawsuits.  For further discussion regarding the legal
settlement, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

2003 TRANSLink Transmission Co., LLC

—

In 2003, Xcel Energy recorded a $7 million
pretax charge in connection with the suspension of the activities related to
the formation of TRANSLink. The charge was recorded as a reserve against loans
made to TRANSLink Development Company, LLC, an interim start-up company.
TRANSLink was an independent transmission-only company.  The formation activity was suspended due to
continued market and regulatory uncertainty.

2003 and 2002 Holding Company

—

NRG Restructuring Charges

—

In 2003 and 2002, the Xcel Energy holding
company incurred approximately $12 million and $5 million, respectively, for
charges related to NRG’s financial restructuring. Costs in 2003 included
approximately $32 million of financial advisor fees, legal costs and consulting
costs related to the NRG bankruptcy transaction. These charges were partially
offset by a $20 million pension curtailment gain related to the termination of
NRG employees from Xcel Energy’s pension plan, as discussed in Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

2002 Regulatory Recovery Adjustment — SPS

—

During 2002, SPS entered into a settlement
agreement with intervenors regarding the recovery of industry restructuring
costs in Texas, which was approved by the state regulatory commission in May
2002. Based on the settlement agreement, SPS wrote off pretax restructuring
costs of approximately $5 million.

2002 Utility Restaffing

—

During 2001, Xcel Energy expensed pretax
special charges of $39 million for expected staff consolidation costs for an
estimated 500 employees in several utility-operating and corporate-support
areas of Xcel Energy. In 2002, the identification of affected employees was
completed and additional pretax special charges of $9 million were expensed for
the final costs of staff consolidations. Approximately $6 million of these
restaffing costs were allocated to Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries. All 564
of accrued staff terminations have occurred. See the summary of costs below.


Accrued Special Charges —

The following table summarizes activity related to accrued special
charges related to the 2001 utility restaffing, as described above, for 2004,
2003 and 2002:

*

Reported on the balance sheet in Other Current Liabilities.

3.
Discontinued Operations

Pursuant to the requirements
of SFAS No. 144, Xcel Energy classified and accounted for certain assets as
held for sale at Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003. SFAS No. 144 requires that assets held
for sale are valued on an asset-by-asset basis at the lower of carrying amount
or fair value less costs to sell. In applying those provisions, management
considered cash flow analyses, bids and offers related to those assets and
businesses.  In accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 144, assets held for sale are not depreciated.

Results of operations for
divested businesses and the results of businesses held for sale are reported
for all periods presented on a net basis as discontinued operations. In
addition, the assets and liabilities of the businesses divested and held for
sale in 2004 and 2003 have been reclassified to assets and liabilities held for
sale accounts in the accompanying Balance Sheet.

Regulated
Utility Segment

During 2003, Xcel Energy
completed the sale of two subsidiaries in its regulated natural gas utility
segment: Viking, including its interest in Guardian Pipeline, LLC, and BMG.
After-tax disposal gains of $23.3 million, or 6 cents per share, were recorded
for the natural gas utility segment, primarily related to the sale of Viking.

During January 2004, Xcel Energy reached an agreement to sell its
regulated electric and natural gas subsidiary Cheyenne.  Black Hills Corp. purchased all the common
stock of Cheyenne, including the assumption of outstanding debt of
approximately $25 million, for

approximately $90 million, plus a working capital adjustment to be
finalized in the second quarter of 2005. 
The sale was completed on Jan. 21, 2005, and resulted in an after-tax
loss of approximately $13 million, or 3 cents per share, which was accrued at
Dec. 31, 2004.

NRG Segment

Change in Accounting for NRG in 2003

—

Prior to NRG’s bankruptcy filing in May 2003,
Xcel Energy accounted for NRG as a consolidated subsidiary. However, as a
result of NRG’s bankruptcy filing, Xcel Energy no longer had the ability to
control the operations of NRG. Accordingly, effective as of the bankruptcy
filing date, Xcel Energy ceased the consolidation of NRG and began accounting
for its investment in NRG using the equity method in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 18 — “The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock.” After changing to the equity method, Xcel Energy
was limited in the amount of NRG’s losses subsequent to the bankruptcy date
that it was required to record. In accordance with these limitations under the
equity method, Xcel Energy stopped recognizing equity in the losses of NRG
subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2003. These limitations provide for
loss recognition by Xcel Energy until its investment in NRG is written off to
zero, with further loss recognition to continue if its financial commitments to
NRG exist beyond amounts already invested.

Prior to NRG entering
bankruptcy, Xcel Energy recorded more losses than the limitations provide for
as of June 30, 2003. Upon Xcel Energy’s divestiture of its interest in NRG in
December 2003, the NRG losses recorded in excess of Xcel Energy’s investment in
and financial commitment to NRG were reversed. This resulted in an adjustment
of the total NRG losses recorded for the year 2003 to


$251 million. Xcel Energy’s
share of NRG’s results for all 2003 periods is reported in a single line item,
Equity in Losses of NRG, as a component of discontinued operations. NRG’s 2003
results do reflect some effects of asset impairments and restructuring costs,
as discussed below. Xcel Energy’s share of NRG results for 2002 was a loss of
$3.4 billion, due primarily to asset impairments and other charges recorded in
the third and fourth quarters of 2002 related to NRG’s financial restructuring.

NRG Asset Impairments

—

In
2002, NRG experienced credit-rating downgrades, defaults under numerous credit
agreements, increased collateral requirements and reduced liquidity. These
events resulted in impairment reviews of a number of NRG assets in 2002. NRG
completed an analysis of the recoverability of the asset-carrying values of its
projects each period, factoring in the probability weighting of different
courses of action available to NRG, given its financial position and liquidity
constraints at the time of each analysis. This approach was applied consistently
to asset groups with similar uncertainties and cash flow streams. As a result,
NRG determined that many of its construction projects and its operational
projects became impaired during 2002 and 2003 and should be written down to
fair market value. In applying those provisions, NRG management considered cash
flow analyses, bids and offers related to those projects.

NRG incurred $3.5 billion of
asset impairments and estimated disposal losses related to projects and equity
investments, respectively, with lower expected cash flows or fair values. These
charges recorded by NRG in the third and fourth quarters of 2002 included
write-downs of $2.3 billion and $983 million for projects in development and
operating projects, respectively, and $196 million for impairment charges and
disposal losses related to equity investments.

Approximately $2.5 billion
of these NRG impairment charges in 2002 related to NRG assets considered held
for use under SFAS No. 144 as of Dec. 31, 2002. For fair values determined by
similar asset prices, the fair value represented NRG’s estimate of
recoverability at that time, if the project assets were to be sold. For fair
values determined by estimated market price, the fair value represented a
market bid or appraisal received by NRG that NRG believed was best reflective
of fair value at that time. For fair values determined by projected cash flows,
the fair value represents a discounted cash flow amount over the remaining life
of each project that reflected project-specific assumptions for long-term power
pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant
operation given assumed market conditions at that time.

NRG continued to incur asset
impairments and related charges in 2003. Prior to its bankruptcy filing in May
2003, NRG recorded more than $500 million in impairment and related charges
resulting from planned disposals of an international project and several
projects in the United States, and to regulatory developments and changing
circumstances throughout the second quarter that adversely affected NRG’s
ability to recover the carrying value of certain merchant generation units in
the northeastern United States.

Nonregulated
Subsidiaries — All Other Segment

Seren

— On Sept. 27,
2004, Xcel Energy’s board of directors approved management’s plan to pursue the
sale of Seren Innovations, Inc., a wholly owned broadband communications
services subsidiary. Seren delivers cable television, high-speed Internet and
telephone service over an advanced network to approximately 45,000 customers in
St. Cloud, Minn., and Concord and Walnut Creek, Calif.  An after-tax impairment charge, including
disposition costs, of $143 million, or 34 cents per share, was recorded in
2004. Xcel Energy expects to complete the sale in mid-2005.

Xcel Energy International and e prime

—

In December 2003, the board of directors of
Xcel Energy approved management’s plan to exit the businesses conducted by its
nonregulated subsidiaries Xcel Energy International and e prime.  The exit of all business conducted by e prime
was completed in 2004.

Results
of discontinued nonregulated operations in 2004 include the impact of

the
sale of the Argentina subsidiaries of Xcel Energy International.  The sales took place in a series of three
transactions with a total sales price of approximately $31 million.  Approximately

$15 million of the sales price was placed in escrow, which is
expected to remain in place until at least the end of the first quarter of
2005, to support Xcel Energy’s customary indemnity obligations under the sales
agreement.  In addition to the sales
price, Xcel Energy also received approximately $21 million at the closing of
one transaction as redemption of its capital investment.  The sales resulted in a gain of approximately
$8 million, including the realization of approximately $7 million of income tax
benefits realizable upon sale of the Xcel Energy International assets.

Results of discontinued
nonregulated operations in 2003, other than NRG, include an after-tax loss
expected on the disposal of all


Xcel Energy International
assets of $59 million, based on the estimated fair value of such assets. The
fair value represents a market bid or appraisal received that is believed to
best reflect the assets’ fair value at Dec. 31, 2003. Xcel Energy’s remaining
investment in Xcel Energy International at Dec. 31, 2003, was approximately $39
million. Losses from discontinued nonregulated operations in 2003 also include
a charge of $16 million for costs of settling a Commodity Futures Trading
Commission trading investigation of e prime.

Tax Benefits Related to Investment in NRG —

With NRG’s emergence from bankruptcy in
December 2003, Xcel Energy divested its ownership interest in NRG.  Xcel Energy has recognized tax benefits
related to the divestiture.  These tax
benefits, since related to Xcel Energy’s investment in discontinued NRG
operations, also are reported as discontinued operations.

During 2002, Xcel Energy
recognized tax benefits of $706 million. This benefit was based on the
estimated tax basis of Xcel Energy’s cash and stock investments already made in
NRG, and their deductibility for federal income tax purposes.  Based on the results of a 2003 study, Xcel
Energy recorded $105 million of additional tax benefits in 2003, reflecting an
updated estimate of the tax basis of Xcel Energy’s investments in NRG and state
tax deductibility. Upon NRG’s emergence from bankruptcy in December 2003, an
additional $288 million of tax benefit was recorded to reflect the
deductibility of the settlement payment of $752 million, uncollectible
receivables from NRG, other state tax benefits and further adjustments to the
estimated tax basis in NRG. Another $11 million of state tax benefits were
accrued earlier in 2003 based on projected impacts.  In 2004, the NRG basis study was updated and
previously recognized tax benefits were reduced by $16 million.

Summarized
Financial Results of Discontinued Operations


The major classes of assets
and liabilities held for sale and related to discontinued operations as of Dec.
31 are as follows:

4. NRG
Bankruptcy

In June 2002, in response to
NRG’s severe financial difficulties, Xcel Energy completed an exchange
transaction, whereby Xcel Energy acquired a 100-percent interest in NRG through
a tender offer and merger involving a tax-free exchange of 0.50 shares of Xcel
Energy common stock for each outstanding share of NRG common stock.  Xcel Energy reacquired all of the 26 percent
of NRG shares not then owned by Xcel Energy, which was accounted for as a
purchase. The 25,764,852 shares of Xcel Energy stock issued were valued at
$25.14 per share, based on the average market price of Xcel Energy shares for
three days before and after April 4, 2002, when the revised terms of the
exchange were announced and recommended by the independent members of the NRG board
of directors. Including other costs of acquisition, this resulted in a total
purchase price to acquire NRG’s shares of approximately $656 million. The
process to allocate the purchase price to underlying interests in NRG assets,
and to determine fair values for the interests in assets acquired, resulted in
approximately $62 million of amounts being allocated to fixed assets related to
projects where the fair values were in excess of carrying values, to prepaid
pension assets and to other assets.

The continued financial
difficulties at NRG, resulting primarily from lower prices for power and
declining credit ratings, culminated in NRG and certain of its affiliates
filing, on May 14, 2003, voluntary petitions in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for
the Southern District of New York for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code to restructure their debt. 
In December 2003, NRG


emerged from
bankruptcy.  As part of the
reorganization, Xcel Energy completely relinquished its ownership interest in
NRG.  As part of the overall settlement,
Xcel Energy agreed to pay $752 million to NRG to settle all claims of NRG
against Xcel Energy, and claims of NRG creditors against Xcel Energy.  In return for such payments, Xcel Energy
received, or was granted, voluntary and involuntary releases from NRG and its
creditors.

In 2004, Xcel Energy paid $752 million to
NRG.  Xcel Energy met these cash
requirements with cash on hand, including tax refund proceeds associated with
the NRG bankruptcy and/or borrowings under its revolving credit facility.

5.
Short-Term Borrowings

Credit Facilities

—

As
of Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy had the following credit facilities available:

The lines of credit
provide short-term financing in the form of notes payable to banks, letters of
credit and, depending on credit ratings, support for commercial paper
borrowings.  The borrowing rates under
these lines of credit are based on either the bank’s prime rate or the
applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a borrowing margin.

At Dec. 31, 2004 and
2003, Xcel Energy and its continuing subsidiaries had approximately $312
million and $59 million, respectively, in notes payable to banks, drawn on
these credit lines. The weighted average interest rate at Dec. 31, 2004, was
4.15 percent. Also, $82.2 million of letters of credit were outstanding at Dec.
31, 2004, as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, of
which approximately $62.2 million were outstanding under the above credit
facilities, which further reduced amounts available under the lines.  Subsequent to Dec. 31, 2004, SPS arranged for
the extension of the maturity date of its credit facility to May 2005.

6.
Long-Term Debt

Except for SPS, which does
not currently have a first mortgage indenture, and other minor exclusions, all
property of the utility subsidiaries is subject to the liens of their first
mortgage indentures, which are contracts between the companies and their
bondholders. In addition, certain SPS payments under its pollution-control
obligations are pledged to secure obligations of the Red River Authority of
Texas.

The utility subsidiaries’
first mortgage bond indentures provide for the ability to have sinking-fund
requirements. NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and PSCo have no sinking-fund
requirements for current bonds outstanding.

Xcel Energy has a $600
million, five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in
November 2009.

Xcel Energy has
the right to request a one-time increase in the size of the credit facility by
up to $100 million and to request an extension of the final maturity date by
one year.  The maturity extension is
subject to majority bank group approval. 
A financial covenant for debt to total capitalization is included.

As
of Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy had $140 million drawn on this line of credit,
which was classified as long-term debt. 
In addition, $82.2 million of letters of credit were outstanding at Dec.
31, 2004, as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, of
which $18.5 million were outstanding under the Xcel Energy credit facility,
which further reduced the amount available under the line.

Xcel Energy’s 2007 and 2008
series convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of Xcel Energy
common stock at a conversion price of $12.33 per share. Conversion is at the
option of the holder at any time prior to maturity.  In addition, Xcel Energy must make additional
payments of interest, referred to as protection payments, on the notes in an
amount equal to any portion of regular quarterly per share dividends on common
stock that exceeds $0.1875 that would have been payable to the holders of the
notes if such holders had converted their notes on the record date for such
dividend.  On May 20, 2004, the board of
directors of Xcel Energy voted to raise the quarterly dividend on its common
stock from $0.1875 to $0.2075. 
Consequently, as of Dec. 31, 2004, a total of $1.4 million in additional
interest expense has been recorded.

In February 2005, PSCo
redeemed $110 million of its 7.25-percent first collateral trust bonds,
originally scheduled to mature in 2024.


Maturities of long-term debt
are:

7.
Preferred Stock

At Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel
Energy had six series of preferred stock outstanding, which were callable at
its option at prices ranging from $102.00 to $103.75 per share plus accrued
dividends. Xcel Energy can only pay dividends on its preferred stock from
retained earnings absent approval of the SEC under PUHCA. See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of such restrictions.

The holders of the $3.60
series preferred stock are entitled to three votes for each share held. The
holders of the other preferred stocks are entitled to one vote per share. In
the event dividends payable on the preferred stock of any series outstanding is
in arrears in an amount equal to four quarterly dividends, the holders of
preferred stocks, voting as a class, are entitled to elect the smallest number
of directors necessary to constitute a majority of the board of directors. The
holders of common stock, voting as a class, are entitled to elect the remaining
directors.

The charters of some of Xcel
Energy’s subsidiaries also authorize the issuance of preferred shares. However,
at Dec. 31, 2004, there are no such shares outstanding. This chart shows data
for first- and second-tier subsidiaries:

* The sale of Cheyenne was
completed in January 2005.

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trusts

Southwestern Public Service
Capital I, a wholly owned, special-purpose subsidiary trust of SPS, had $100
million of 7.85-percent trust preferred securities issued and outstanding that
were originally scheduled to mature in 2036. 
The securities were redeemable at the option of SPS after October 2001,
at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued interest. On Oct. 15, 2003,
SPS redeemed the $100 million of trust preferred securities. A certificate of
cancellation was filed to dissolve SPS Capital I on Jan. 5, 2004.

NSP Financing I, a wholly
owned, special-purpose subsidiary trust of NSP-Minnesota, had $200 million of
7.875-percent trust preferred securities issued and outstanding that were
originally scheduled to mature in 2037. 
The preferred securities were redeemable at NSP Financing I’s option at
$25 per share, beginning in 2002. On July 31, 2003, NSP-Minnesota redeemed the
$200 million of trust preferred securities. A certificate of cancellation was
filed to dissolve NSP Financing I on Sept. 15, 2003.

PSCo Capital Trust I, a
wholly owned, special-purpose subsidiary trust of PSCo, had $194 million of
7.60-percent trust preferred securities issued and outstanding that were
originally scheduled to mature in 2038. 
The securities were redeemable at the option of PSCo after May 2003, at
100 percent of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest. On June
30, 2003, PSCo redeemed the $194 million of trust preferred securities. A
certificate of cancellation was filed to dissolve PSCo Capital Trust I on Dec.
29, 2003.

Distributions paid to
preferred security holders were reflected as a financing cost in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations, along with interest charges.


9. Generating
Plant Ownership and Operation

Joint Plant Ownership

— Following are the investments by Xcel Energy’s
subsidiaries in jointly owned plants and the related ownership percentages as
of Dec. 31, 2004:

NSP-Minnesota is part owner
of Sherco 3, an 860-megawatt, coal-fueled electric generating unit.
NSP-Minnesota is the operating agent under the joint ownership agreement.
NSP-Minnesota’s share of operating expenses and construction expenditures are
included in the applicable utility components of operating expenses. PSCo’s
assets include approximately 320 megawatts of jointly owned generating
capacity. PSCo’s share of operating expenses and construction expenditures are
included in the applicable utility components of operating expenses. Each of
the respective owners is responsible for the issuance of its own securities to
finance its portion of the construction costs.

Nuclear Plant Operation

— NSP-Minnesota
and four other utility companies formed the Nuclear Management Co. (NMC), and
each of the five member companies retains a 20 percent ownership interest in
the NMC.  The NMC is an operating company
that manages the operations, maintenance and physical security of eight nuclear
generating units on six sites, including three units/two sites owned by NSP-Minnesota.  NSP-Minnesota continues to own the plants,
controls all energy produced by the plants, and retains responsibility for
nuclear property and liability insurance and decommissioning costs.  In accordance with the Nuclear Power Plant
Operating Services Agreement, NSP-Minnesota also pays its proportionate share
of the operating expenses and capital improvement costs incurred by NMC.  NSP-Minnesota paid NMC $314.7 million in
2004, $227.0 million in 2003 and $182.5 million in 2002.

10. Income
Taxes

Xcel Energy’s share of NRG
results for current and prior periods is shown as a component of discontinued
operations, due to NRG’s emergence from bankruptcy in December 2003 and Xcel
Energy’s corresponding divestiture of its ownership interest in NRG. Accordingly,
Xcel Energy’s tax benefits related to its investment in NRG are reported in
discontinued operations.

Xcel Energy’s federal net
operating loss and tax credit carry forwards are estimated to be $1.4 billion
and $79 million, respectively. $1.2 billion of the net operating loss and $23
million of the tax credit carry forwards are accounted for in discontinued
operations.  The carry forward periods
expire in 2023 and 2024. Xcel Energy also has a net operating loss carry
forward in some states. The state carry forward periods expire between 2018 and
2024.  A valuation allowance was recorded
against $46 million of capital loss carry forwards related to the sales of Xcel
Energy International subsidiaries, which are accounted for in discontinued
operations.  The capital loss carry
forward period expires in 2009.


Total income tax expense
from continuing operations differs from the amount computed by applying the
statutory federal income tax rate to income before income tax expense. The
following is a table reconciling such differences:

Income taxes comprise the
following expense (benefit) items:

The components of Xcel
Energy’s net deferred tax liability from continuing operations (current and
noncurrent portions) at Dec. 31 were:

11. Common
Stock and Incentive Stock Plans

Common Stock and Equivalents

—

Xcel Energy has common stock equivalents
consisting of convertible senior notes, restricted stock units and stock
options, as discussed further.


The dilutive impacts of
common stock equivalents affected earnings per share as follows for the years
ending Dec. 31:

Incentive Stock Plans —

Xcel Energy and some of its subsidiaries have incentive compensation
plans under which stock options and other performance incentives are awarded to
key employees. The weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive
shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy’s earnings per share include
the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock awards based on the
treasury stock method. The options normally have a term of 10 years and
generally become exercisable from three to five years after grant date or upon
specified circumstances. The tables below include awards made by Xcel Energy
and some of its predecessor companies, adjusted for the merger stock exchange
ratio, and are presented on an Xcel Energy share basis.

Activity in stock options
was as follows for the years ended Dec. 31:

Certain employees also may
elect to receive shares of restricted stock under the Xcel Energy Inc.
Executive Annual Incentive Award Plan. 
Restricted stock vests in equal annual installments over a three-year
period from the date of grant.  Xcel
Energy reinvests dividends on the restricted stock it holds while restrictions
are in place.  Restrictions also apply to
the additional shares of restricted


stock acquired through
dividend reinvestment.  Restricted stock
has a value equal to the market-trading price of Xcel Energy’s stock at the
grant date.  Xcel Energy granted 65,090
shares of restricted stock in 2004 when the grant-date market price was
$17.40.  Xcel Energy did not grant any
shares of restricted stock in 2003.  Xcel
Energy granted 50,083 shares of restricted stock in 2002 when the grant-date
market price was $22.83.  Compensation
expense related to these awards was not significant.

On March 28, 2003, the
governance, compensation and nominating committee of Xcel Energy’s board of
directors granted restricted stock units and performance shares under the Xcel
Energy Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan approved by the shareholders in 2000.  Restrictions on the restricted stock units
lapse upon the achievement of a 27-percent total shareholder return (TSR) for
10 consecutive business days and other criteria relating to Xcel Energy’s
common equity ratio. Under no circumstances will the restrictions lapse until
one year after the grant date.  TSR is
measured using the market price per share of Xcel Energy common stock, which at
the grant date was $12.93, plus common dividends declared after grant
date.  The TSR was met in the fourth
quarter of 2003, and approximately $31 million of compensation expense was
recorded at Dec. 31, 2003. The remaining cost of $10 million related to the
2003 restricted stock units was recorded in the first quarter of 2004.  In January 2004, Xcel Energy’s board of
directors approved the repurchase of up to 2.5 million shares of common stock
to fulfill the requirements of the restricted stock unit exercise.   On March 29, 2004, the restricted stock
units lapsed, and Xcel Energy issued approximately 1.6 million shares of common
stock.

On Dec. 9, 2003, the
governance, compensation and nominating committee of Xcel Energy’s board of
directors approved restricted stock units and performance shares under the Xcel
Energy Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan.  On
Jan. 2, 2004, Xcel Energy granted 836,186 restricted stock units and
performance shares.  The grant-date
market price used to calculate the TSR for this grant is $17.03.  No expense has been recorded for the 2004
restricted stock units as it is not currently probable they will be earned.

On Dec. 14, 2004, the governance, compensation and nominating committee
of Xcel Energy’s board of directors approved restricted stock units and
performance shares under the Xcel Energy Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan.  On Jan. 1, 2005, Xcel Energy granted 843,251
restricted stock units and performance shares. 
The grant-date market price used to calculate the TSR for this grant is
$18.10.

Xcel Energy applies
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 — “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” in accounting for stock-based compensation and, accordingly, no
compensation cost is recognized for the issuance of stock options, as the
exercise price of the options equals the fair-market value of Xcel Energy’s
common stock at the date of grant. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.
148 — “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure,”
amending SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation, and requiring disclosure in both annual and interim
Consolidated Financial Statements about the method used and the effect of the
method used on results. The pro forma impact of applying SFAS No. 148 is as
follows at Dec. 31:

Common Stock Dividends Per Share —

Historically, Xcel Energy has paid quarterly
dividends to its shareholders. For the first quarter of 2004, Xcel Energy paid
dividends to its shareholders of $0.1875 per share.  In each of the last three quarters of 2004,
Xcel Energy paid dividends to its shareholders of $0.2075. For each of the four
quarters of 2003, Xcel Energy paid dividends to its shareholders of $0.1875 per
share. For each of the first two quarters of 2002, Xcel Energy paid dividends
to its shareholders of $0.375 per share. In each of the third and fourth
quarters of 2002, Xcel Energy paid dividends to its shareholders of $0.1875 per
share.


Dividends on common stock
are paid as declared by the board of directors.

Dividend and Other Capital-Related Restrictions

—

Under the PUHCA, unless there is an order
from the SEC, a holding company or any subsidiary may declare and pay dividends
only out of retained earnings. In May 2003, Xcel Energy received authorization
from the SEC to pay an aggregate amount of $152 million of common and preferred
dividends out of capital and unearned surplus. Xcel Energy used this
authorization to declare and pay approximately $150 million for its first- and
second-quarter dividends in 2003. At Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy’s retained
earnings were approximately $396.6 million.

The Articles of
Incorporation of Xcel Energy place restrictions on the amount of common stock
dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding. Under the provisions,
dividend payments may be restricted if Xcel Energy’s capitalization ratio (on a
holding company basis only and not on a consolidated basis) is less than 25
percent. For these purposes, the capitalization ratio is equal to (i) common
stock plus surplus divided by (ii) the sum of common stock plus surplus plus
long-term debt. Based on this definition, the capitalization ratio at Dec. 31,
2004, was 81 percent. Therefore, the restrictions do not place any effective
limit on Xcel Energy’s ability to pay dividends because the restrictions are
only triggered when the capitalization ratio is less than 25 percent or will be
reduced to less than 25 percent through dividends (other than dividends payable
in common stock), distributions or acquisitions of Xcel Energy common stock.

In addition, NSP-Minnesota’s
first mortgage indenture places certain restrictions on the amount of cash
dividends it can pay to Xcel Energy, the holder of its common stock. Even with
these restrictions, NSP-Minnesota could have paid more than $833 million in
additional cash dividends on common stock at Dec. 31, 2004.

Registered holding companies
and certain of their subsidiaries, including Xcel Energy and its utility
subsidiaries, are limited, under PUHCA, in their ability to issue securities.
Such registered holding companies and their subsidiaries may not issue
securities unless authorized by an exemptive rule or order of the SEC. Because
Xcel Energy does not qualify for any of the main exemptive rules, it sought and
received financing authority from the SEC under PUHCA for various financing
arrangements. Xcel Energy’s current financing authority permits it, subject to
satisfaction of certain conditions, to issue through June 30, 2005, up to $2.5
billion of common stock and long-term debt and $1.5 billion of short-term debt
at the holding company level. Xcel Energy has $2.2 billion of long-term debt
outstanding and common stock at the holding company level, including the $600 million
multi-year credit facility that was entered into during November 2004.

On Dec. 17, 2004, Xcel
Energy filed an application with the SEC requesting additional financing
authorization beyond June 30, 2005.  If
approved, the new financing authority would extend through June 30, 2008.  The new application requests the authority
for Xcel Energy to issue up to $1.8 billion of new long-term debt, common
equity and equity-linked securities and $1.0 billion of short-term debt securities
during the new authorization period, provided that the aggregate amount of
long-term debt, common equity, equity-linked and short-term debt securities
issued during the new authorization period does not exceed $2.0 billion.  Xcel Energy expects the SEC to issue an order
prior to the expiration of the existing authorization.

Xcel Energy’s ability to
issue securities under the financing authority is subject to a number of
conditions. One of the conditions of the financing authority is that Xcel
Energy’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization, on a consolidated
basis, be at least 30 percent. As of Dec. 31, 2004, such common equity ratio
was approximately 42 percent. Additional conditions require that a security to
be issued that is rated, be rated investment grade by at least one nationally
recognized rating agency. Finally, all outstanding securities that are rated
must be rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating
agency. As of Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy’s senior unsecured debt was considered
investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency.

Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement

—

In June 2001, Xcel Energy adopted a
Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement. Each share of Xcel Energy’s common
stock includes one shareholder protection right. Under the agreement’s
principal provision, if any person or group acquires 15 percent or more of Xcel
Energy’s outstanding common stock, all other shareholders of Xcel Energy would
be entitled to buy, for the exercise price of $95 per right, common stock of
Xcel Energy having a market value equal to twice the exercise price, thereby
substantially diluting the acquiring person’s or group’s investment. The rights
may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 15 percent or
more of Xcel Energy’s common stock. The rights should not interfere with a
transaction that is in the best interests of Xcel Energy and its shareholders
because the rights can be redeemed prior to a triggering event for $0.01 per
right.


12. Benefit
Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

Xcel Energy offers various
benefit plans to its benefit employees. Approximately 51 percent of benefiting
employees are represented by several local labor unions under several
collective-bargaining agreements. At Dec. 31, 2004, NSP-Minnesota had 2,197 and
NSP-Wisconsin had 414 bargaining employees covered under a
collective-bargaining agreement, which expires at the end of 2007. PSCo had
2,177 bargaining employees covered under a collective-bargaining agreement,
which expires in May 2006. SPS had 739 bargaining employees covered under a
collective-bargaining agreement, which expires in October 2005.

Pension
Benefits

Xcel Energy has several
noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all employees.
Benefits are based on a combination of years of service, the employee’s average
pay and Social Security benefits.

Xcel Energy’s policy is to
fully fund into an external trust the actuarially determined pension costs
recognized for ratemaking and financial reporting purposes, subject to the
limitations of applicable employee benefit and tax laws.

Pension Plan Assets

—

Plan
assets principally consist of the common stock of public companies, corporate
bonds and U.S. government securities. In 2004, Xcel Energy completed a review
of its pension plan asset allocation and adopted revised asset allocation
targets.  The target range for our
pension asset allocation is 60 percent in equity investments, 20 percent in
fixed income investments, no cash investments and 20 percent in nontraditional
investments, such as real estate, timber ventures, private equity and a
diversified commodities index.

The actual composition of
pension plan assets at Dec. 31 was:

During 2003, Xcel Energy
entered into a number of hedging arrangements within the pension trust designed
to provide protection from a loss of asset value in the event of a broad
decline in equity prices. These arrangements were closed out in December 2004.

Xcel Energy bases its
investment-return assumption on expected long-term performance for each of the
investment types included in its pension asset portfolio. Xcel Energy considers
the actual historical returns achieved by its asset portfolio over the past
20-year or longer period, as well as the long-term return levels projected and
recommended by investment experts. The historical weighted average annual
return for the past 20 years for the Xcel Energy portfolio of pension
investments is 12.8 percent, which is greater than the current assumption
level. The pension cost determinations assume the continued current mix of
investment types over the long term. The Xcel Energy portfolio is heavily
weighted toward equity securities and includes nontraditional investments that
can provide a higher-than-average return. 
As is the experience in recent years, a higher weighting in equity
investments can increase the volatility in the return levels actually achieved
by pension assets in any year. Investment returns in 2002 were below the
assumed level of 9.5 percent, but in 2003 investment returns exceeded the
assumed level of 9.25 percent and in 2004 investment returns exceeded the
assumed level of 9.0 percent. Xcel Energy continually reviews its pension
assumptions. In 2005, Xcel Energy changed the investment-return assumption to
8.75 percent to reflect its current expectations of investment returns.


Benefit Obligations

—

A
comparison of the actuarially computed pension-benefit obligation and plan
assets, on a combined basis, is presented in the following table:

(a)

$18.5 million of the 2004 prepaid pension asset and $18.7 million of
the 2003 prepaid pension asset relates to Xcel Energy’s remaining obligation
for companies that are now classified as discontinued operations.

During 2002, one of Xcel
Energy’s pension plans became under-funded, and at Dec. 31, 2004, had projected
benefit obligations of $694.4 million, which exceeded plan assets of $590.1
million. All other Xcel Energy plans in the aggregate had plan assets of $2.5
billion and projected benefit obligations of $2.0 billion on Dec. 31, 2004. A
minimum pension liability of $62.7 million was recorded related to the
under-funded plan as of that date. A corresponding reduction in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income, a component of Stockholders’ Equity, also was
recorded, as previously recorded prepaid pension assets were reduced to record
the minimum liability.  Net of the
related deferred income tax effects of the adjustments, total Stockholders’
Equity was reduced by $106.0 million at Dec. 31, 2004, due to the minimum
pension liability for the under-funded plan.

Cash Flows

—

Cash
funding requirements can be impacted by changes to actuarial assumptions,
actual asset levels and other pertinent calculations prescribed by the funding requirements
of income tax and other pension-related regulations. These regulations did not
require cash funding in the years 2002 through 2004 for Xcel Energy’s pension
plans, and is not expected to require cash funding in 2005. PSCo elected to
make voluntary contributions to its pension plan for bargaining employees of
$30 million in 2003 and $9 million in 2004, and Cheyenne voluntarily
contributed $1 million to its pension plan for bargaining employees in 2004.


Benefit Costs —

The components of net periodic pension cost (credit) are:

(a)

Includes pension credits related to discontinued operations of $4.7
million for 2004, $18.3 million for 2003 and $10.1 million for 2002. The 2003
credit is largely due to a $20.0 million curtailment gain related to
termination of NRG employees as a result of the divestiture of NRG in December
2003.

Pension costs include an
expected return impact for the current year that may differ from actual
investment performance in the plan. The return assumption used for 2005 pension
cost calculations will be 8.75 percent. The cost calculation uses a
market-related valuation of pension assets, which reduces year-to-year
volatility by recognizing the differences between assumed and actual investment
returns over a five-year period.

Xcel Energy also maintains
noncontributory, defined benefit supplemental retirement income plans for
certain qualifying executive personnel. Benefits for these unfunded plans are
paid out of Xcel Energy’s operating cash flows.

Defined
Contribution Plans

Xcel Energy maintains 401(k)
and other defined contribution plans that cover substantially all employees.
Total contributions to these plans were approximately $21.9 million in
2004,  $15.9 million in 2003 and $18.3
million in 2002.

Until May 6, 2002, Xcel
Energy had a leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) that covered
substantially all employees of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin. Xcel Energy
made contributions to this noncontributory, defined contribution plan to the
extent it realized tax savings from dividends paid on certain ESOP shares. ESOP
contributions had no material effect on Xcel Energy earnings because the
contributions were essentially offset by the tax savings provided by the
dividends paid on ESOP shares. Xcel Energy allocated leveraged ESOP shares to
participants when it repaid ESOP loans with dividends on stock held by the
ESOP.

In May 2002, the ESOP was
terminated and its assets were combined into the Xcel Energy retirement savings
401(k) plan. The ESOP component of the 401(k) plan is no longer leveraged.

Xcel Energy’s leveraged ESOP
held 10.7 million shares of Xcel Energy common stock at May 6, 2002. Xcel
Energy excluded an average of 0.7 million uncommitted leveraged ESOP shares from
2002 earnings-per-share calculations. On Nov. 19, 2002, Xcel Energy paid off
all of the ESOP loans. All uncommitted ESOP shares were released and were used
by Xcel Energy for the 2002 employer matching contribution to its 401(k) plan.

Postretirement
Health Care Benefits

Xcel Energy has a
contributory health and welfare benefit plan that provides health care and
death benefits to most Xcel Energy retirees. The former NSP discontinued
contributing toward health care benefits for nonbargaining employees retiring
after 1998 and for bargaining employees of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin who
retired after 1999. Xcel Energy discontinued contributing toward health care
benefits for former NCE nonbargaining employees retiring after June 30, 2003.
Employees of the former NCE who retired in 2002 continue to receive
employer-subsidized health care benefits. Nonbargaining employees of the former
NSP who retired after 1998, bargaining employees of the former NSP who retired
after 1999 and nonbargaining employees of the former NCE who retired after June
30, 2003, are eligible to participate in the Xcel Energy health care program
with no employer subsidy.

In conjunction with the 1993
adoption of SFAS No. 106 — “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pension,” Xcel Energy elected to amortize the unrecognized
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) on a straight-line basis
over 20 years.

Regulatory agencies for
nearly all of Xcel Energy’s retail and wholesale utility customers have allowed
rate recovery of accrued


benefit costs under SFAS No.
106. PSCo transitioned to full accrual accounting for SFAS No. 106 costs
between 1993 and 1997, consistent with the accounting requirements for
rate-regulated enterprises. The Colorado jurisdictional SFAS No. 106 costs
deferred during the transition period are being amortized to expense on a
straight-line basis over the 15-year period from 1998 to 2012. NSP-Minnesota
also transitioned to full accrual accounting for SFAS No. 106 costs, with
regulatory differences fully amortized prior to 1997.

Plan Assets

—

Certain state agencies that regulate Xcel
Energy’s utility subsidiaries also have issued guidelines related to the
funding of SFAS No. 106 costs. SPS is required to fund SFAS No. 106 costs for
Texas and New Mexico jurisdictional amounts collected in rates, and PSCo is
required to fund SFAS No. 106 costs in irrevocable external trusts that are
dedicated to the payment of these postretirement benefits. In 2004, the
investment strategy for the union asset fund was changed to increase the
exposure to equity funds.  Also, a
portion of the assets contributed on behalf of nonbargaining retirees has been
funded into a sub-account of the Xcel Energy pension plans.  These assets are invested in a manner
consistent with the investment strategy for the pension plan.

The actual composition of
postretirement benefit plan assets at Dec. 31 was:

Xcel Energy bases its
investment-return assumption for the postretirement health care fund assets on
expected long-term performance for each of the investment types included in its
postretirement health care asset portfolio. Given the fairly short time period
in which funding has been required, Xcel Energy does not consider the actual
historical returns achieved by its postretirement health care fund asset portfolio
to be significant in establishing long-term return assumptions. Instead, Xcel
Energy considers the long-term return levels projected and recommended by
investment experts, weighted for the target mix of asset categories in our
portfolio. Investment-return volatility is not considered to be a material
factor in postretirement health care costs.

Benefit Obligations

—

A
comparison of the actuarially computed benefit obligation and plan assets for
Xcel Energy postretirement health care plans that benefit employees of its
utility subsidiaries is presented in the following table:


(a)

$0.7 million of the 2004 accrued benefit liability and $1.1 million of
the 2003 accrued benefit liability relate to Xcel Energy’s remaining obligation
for companies that are now classified as discontinued operations.

Effective Dec. 31, 2004,
Xcel Energy raised its initial medical trend assumption from 6.5 percent to 9.0
percent and lowered the ultimate trend assumption from 5.5 percent to 5.0
percent.  The period until the ultimate
rate is reached also was increased from two years to six years.  This trend assumption was used to value the
actuarial benefit obligations at year-end 2004, and will be used in 2005
retiree medical cost determinations.  Xcel
Energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long-term cost inflation
expected in the health care market, considering the levels projected and
recommended by industry experts, as well as recent actual medical cost
increases experienced by Xcel Energy’s retiree medical plan.

A 1-percent change in the
assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

The employer subsidy for
retiree medical coverage was eliminated for former New Century Energies, Inc.
nonbargaining employees who retire after July 1, 2003.

Xcel Energy’s subsidiary,
Viking, was sold on Jan. 17, 2003. The sale created a one-time curtailment gain
of $0.8 million. NRG participants withdrew from the retiree life plan,
resulting in a $1.3 million one-time curtailment gain in 2003.

NRG employees’ participation
in the Xcel Energy postretirement health care plan ended when NRG emerged from
bankruptcy on Dec. 5, 2003. A settlement gain of $0.9 million was recognized.

Cash Flows

—

The
postretirement health care plans have no funding requirements under income tax
and other retirement-related regulations other than fulfilling benefit payment
obligations, when claims are presented and approved under the plans. Additional
cash funding requirements are prescribed by certain state and federal rate
regulatory authorities, as discussed previously. Xcel Energy expects to
contribute approximately $73 million during 2005.

Benefit Costs

—

The
components of net periodic postretirement benefit costs are:


(a)

Includes amounts related to discontinued operations of $1.3 million of
cost in 2004, $(1.9) million of cost in 2003 and $3.6 million of cost in 2002.

Impact of 2003 Medicare Legislation

—

On Dec. 8, 2003, President Bush signed into
law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003
(the Act). The Act expanded Medicare to include, for the first time, coverage
for prescription drugs. This new coverage is generally effective Jan. 1, 2006.
Many of Xcel Energy’s retiree medical programs provide prescription drug
coverage for retirees over age 65 with coverage at least equivalent to the
benefit to be provided under Medicare. While retirees remain in Xcel Energy’s
postretirement health care plan without participating in the new Medicare prescription
drug coverage, Medicare will share the cost of Xcel Energy’s plan. This
legislation has therefore reduced Xcel Energy’s share of the obligation for
future retiree medical benefits.

As of Dec. 31, 2003, Xcel
Energy had reduced the postretirement health care benefit obligation by $64.6
million due to the expected sharing of the cost of the program by Medicare
under the new legislation.

Also, beginning in 2004, the annual net
periodic postretirement benefit cost was reduced by approximately $10 million
as a result of the expected sharing of the cost of the program by Medicare,
with similar savings expected in subsequent years.

These estimated reductions do not reflect any
changes that may result in future levels of participation in the plan or the associated
per capita claims cost due to the availability of prescription drug coverage
for Medicare-eligible retirees. Also, in reflecting this legislation, Medicare
cost sharing for a plan has been assumed only if Xcel Energy’s projected
contribution to the plan is expected to be at least equal to the Medicare Part
D basic benefit.

Projected
Benefit Payments

Derivative Instruments

In the normal course of business, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are
exposed to a variety of market risks. 
Market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of changes
in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity.  Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries utilize, in
accordance with approved risk management policies, a variety of derivative
instruments to mitigate market risk and to enhance our operations.  The use of these derivative instruments is
discussed in further detail below.

Utility Commodity
Price Risk —

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their
generation and retail distribution operations. 
Commodity price risk is managed by entering into both long- and
short-term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric power, natural
gas, coal and fuel oil.  Commodity risk
also is managed through the use of financial derivative instruments.  Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries
utilize these derivative instruments to reduce the volatility in the cost of
commodities acquired on behalf of our retail customers even though regulatory
jurisdiction may provide for a dollar-for-dollar recovery of actual costs.  In these instances, the use of derivative
instruments is done consistently with the local jurisdictional cost-recovery
mechanism.  Xcel Energy’s risk management
policy allows it to manage market price risk within each rate-regulated
operation to the extent such exposure exists.

Short-Term Wholesale
and Commodity Trading Risk —

Xcel Energy’s subsidiaries conduct various
marketing and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of
electric capacity and energy and other energy related instruments.  These activities are primarily focused on
specific regions where market knowledge and experience have been obtained and
are generally less than one year in length. 
Xcel Energy’s risk management policy allows management to conduct the
marketing activity within approved guideline and limitations as approved by our
risk management committee, which is made up of management personnel not
directly involved in the activities governed by this policy.

Interest Rate Risk —

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are subject
to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business.  Xcel Energy’s risk management policy allows
interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating
rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or
call options.

Foreign Currency
Exchange Risk —

Due to the discontinuance of NRG and Xcel Energy International’s
operations in 2003, as discussed in Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, Xcel Energy no longer has material foreign currency exchange risk.

Types
of and Accounting for Derivative Instruments

Xcel Energy uses a number of different derivative instruments in
connection with its utility commodity price, interest rate, short-term
wholesale and commodity trading activities, including forward contracts,
futures, swaps and options.  All
derivative instruments not qualifying for the normal purchases and normal sales
exception, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, are recorded at fair value.
The classification of the fair value for these derivative instruments is
dependent on the designation of a qualifying hedging relationship.  The fair value of derivative instruments not
designated in a qualifying hedging relationship is reflected in current
earnings.  This includes certain
instruments used to mitigate market risk for the utility operations and all
instruments related to the commodity trading operations.  The designation of a cash flow hedge permits
the classification of fair value to be recorded within Other Comprehensive
Income, to the extent effective.  The
designation of a fair value hedge permits a derivative instrument’s gains or
losses to offset the related results of the hedged item in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations, to the extent effective.


SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires that the hedging relationship be
highly effective and that a company formally designate a hedging relationship
to apply hedge accounting.  Xcel Energy
and its subsidiaries formally document hedging relationships, including, among
other things, the identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged
transaction, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for
undertaking the hedged transaction.  Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries also formally assess, both at inception and on an
ongoing basis, if required, whether the derivative instruments being used are
highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows
of the hedged items.

Hedge effectiveness is recorded based on the nature of the item being hedged.  Hedging transactions for the sales of
electric energy are recorded as a component of revenue; hedging transactions
for fuel used in energy generation are recorded as a component of fuel costs;
hedging transactions for natural gas purchased for resale are recorded as a
component of natural gas costs; and hedging transactions for interest rate
swaps and lock agreements are recorded as a component of interest expense.  Certain Xcel Energy utility subsidiaries are
allowed to recover in electric or natural gas rates the costs of certain
financial instruments acquired to reduce commodity cost volatility.

Qualifying hedging relationships are designated as either a hedge of a
forecasted transaction or future cash flow (cash flow hedge) or a hedge of a
recognized asset, liability or firm commitment (fair value hedge).  The types of qualifying hedging transactions
that Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are currently engaged in are discussed
below.

Cash
Flow Hedges

The effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative
instrument qualifying as a cash flow hedge is recognized in Other Comprehensive
Income, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during
which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
The ineffective portion of a derivative instrument’s change in fair
value is recognized in current earnings.

Commodity Cash Flow
Hedges

—

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries enter into
derivative instruments to manage variability of future cash flows from changes
in commodity prices.  These derivative
instruments are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.  At Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy had various
commodity-related contracts classified as cash flow hedges extending through
2009.  Amounts deferred from current
earnings are recorded in earnings as the hedged purchase or sales transaction
is settled.  This could include the
purchase or sale of energy and energy-related products, the use of natural gas
to generate electric energy or natural gas purchased for resale.

As of Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy had no amounts accumulated in Other
Comprehensive Income that are expected to be recognized in earnings during the
next 12 months as the hedged transactions settle.

Xcel Energy had no ineffectiveness related to commodity cash flow
hedges during the years ended Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003.

Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges

—

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries enter
into interest rate swap instruments that effectively fix the interest payments
on certain floating rate debt obligations. 
These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges for
accounting purposes.

As of Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel
Energy had net losses related to interest rate swaps of approximately $1.1
million accumulated in Other Comprehensive Income that it expects to recognize
in earnings during the next 12 months.

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries also enter into interest rate lock
agreements, including treasury-rate locks and forward starting swaps, that
effectively fix the yield or price on a specified treasury security for a
specific period.  These derivative
instruments are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.

As of Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy had net gains related to settled
interest rate lock agreements of approximately $1.4 million accumulated in
Other Comprehensive Income that it expects to recognize in earnings during the
next 12 months.

Xcel
Energy had no ineffectiveness related to interest rate cash flow hedges during
the years ended Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003.


Financial Impact of Qualifying Cash Flow
Hedges

—

The
impact of qualifying cash flow hedges on Xcel Energy’s Other Comprehensive
Income, included in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity, are
detailed in the following table:

Fair Value Hedges

The effective portion of
the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument qualifying as a fair
value hedge is offset against the change in the fair value of the underlying
asset, liability or firm commitment being hedged.  That is, fair value hedge accounting allows
the gains or losses of the derivative instrument to offset, in the same period,
the gains and losses of the hedged item. 
The ineffective portion of a derivative instrument’s change in fair
value is recognized in current earnings.

Interest Rate Fair Value Hedges

—

Xcel Energy enters into interest rate swap
instruments that effectively hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt.  The fair market value of Xcel Energy’s
interest rate swaps at Dec. 31, 2004, was a liability of approximately $8.3
million.

Hedges
of Foreign Currency Exposure of a Net Investment in Foreign Operations

Due to the discontinuance
of NRG and Xcel Energy International’s operations in 2003, as discussed in
Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Xcel Energy no longer
has material foreign currency exposure.

Normal
Purchases or Normal Sales Contracts

Xcel Energy’s utility
subsidiaries enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of various
commodities for use in their business operations.  SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires a company
to evaluate these contracts to determine whether the contracts are
derivatives.  Certain contracts that
literally meet the definition of a derivative may be exempted from SFAS No.
133, as amended, as normal purchases or normal sales.  Normal purchases and normal sales are
contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of something other than a
financial instrument or derivative instrument that will be delivered in
quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal
course of business.  In addition, normal
purchases and normal sales contracts must have a price based on an underlying
that is clearly and closely related to the asset being purchased or sold.  An underlying is a specified interest rate,
security price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or
rates, or other variable, including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a
specified event, such as a scheduled payment under a contract.

Contracts that meet the
requirements of normal are documented and exempted from the accounting and
reporting requirements of SFAS No. 133, as amended.  In June 2003, the Derivatives Implementation
Group of the FASB issued Implementation Issue No. C20 (C20) to clarify the
terms clearly and closely related to normal purchases and sales contracts, as
included in SFAS No. 133, as amended. 
Xcel Energy’s implementation of C20 in 2003 had no impact on
earnings.  However, certain contracts did
require a one-time fair value adjustment as of Oct. 1, 2003.  The result of this adjustment was the
creation of a derivative liability with an offsetting regulatory asset to
reflect expected recovery of the amounts from customers.  The derivative liability and related
regulatory asset will be amortized over the respective lives of the
contracts.  See Note 18 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.


Xcel Energy evaluates all
of its contracts when such contracts are entered to determine if they are
derivatives and, if so, if they qualify to meet the normal designation
requirements under SFAS No. 133, as amended. 
None of the contracts entered into within the commodity trading
operations qualify for a normal designation.

Normal purchases and
normal sales contracts are accounted for as executory contracts as required
under GAAP.

The following discussion
briefly describes the use of derivative commodity and financial instruments at
Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, and discloses the respective fair values at
Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003.

Commodity Trading Instruments

— At Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair
value of commodity trading contracts was $0.0 million and $4.2 million,
respectively.

Regulated Commodity Instruments

— The fair value of qualifying cash flow
hedges is presented as a component of Other Comprehensive Income in the
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.  At Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of
these contracts was $(24.6) million and $(11.2) million, respectively.

Nonregulated Commodity Instruments

— Xcel Energy’s nonregulated operations use a
combination of energy futures and forward contracts, along with physical
supply, to hedge market risks in the energy market.  At Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of
these contracts was $0.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively.  The fair value of cash flow hedges related to
nonregulated operations for 2003 is included in discontinued operations.

Financial Instruments

—

Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries had interest rate swaps outstanding with a fair
value that was a liability of approximately $30 million at Dec. 31, 2004.  On Dec. 31, 2003, subsidiaries of Xcel Energy
had interest rate swaps outstanding with a fair value that was a liability of
approximately $18 million.

15.  Financial Instruments

The estimated Dec. 31 fair
values of Xcel Energy’s financial instruments, separately identifying amounts
that are within continuing operations and within discontinued operations, are
as follows:

The fair value of cash and
cash equivalents, notes and accounts receivable and notes and accounts payable
are not materially different from their carrying amounts because of the
short-term nature of these instruments or because the stated rates approximate
market rates.  The fair values of Xcel
Energy’s long-term investments, mainly debt securities in an external nuclear
decommissioning fund, are estimated based on quoted market prices for those or
similar investments. The fair values of Xcel Energy’s long-term debt is
estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues, or
the current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities and credit quality.

The fair value estimates
presented are based on information available to management as of Dec. 31, 2004
and 2003. These fair value estimates have not been comprehensively revalued for
purposes of these Consolidated Financial Statements since that date, and
current estimates of fair values may differ significantly.

Xcel Energy provides
guarantees and bond indemnities supporting certain of its subsidiaries. The
guarantees issued by Xcel Energy guarantee payment or performance by its
subsidiaries under specified agreements or transactions. As a result, Xcel
Energy’s exposure under the guarantees is based upon the net liability of the
relevant subsidiary under the specified agreements or transactions. Most of the
guarantees issued by Xcel Energy limit the exposure of Xcel Energy to a maximum
amount stated in the guarantee. Unless otherwise indicated below, the
guarantees require no liability to be recorded, contain no recourse provisions
and require no collateral.


On Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel
Energy had the following amount of guarantees and exposure under these
guarantees, including those related to e prime Energy Marketing, Inc., e prime
Florida, Inc., Cheyenne and Seren, which are components of discontinued operations:

(a)

Nonperformance and/or nonpayment.

(b)

Losses caused by default in performance of covenants or breach of any
warranty or representation in the purchase agreement.

(c)

Includes one performance bond with a notional amount of $11.1 million
that guarantee the performance of Planergy Housing Inc., a subsidiary of Xcel
Energy that was sold to Ameresco Inc. on Dec. 12, 2003. Ameresco Inc. has
agreed to indemnify Xcel Energy for any liability arising out of any surety
bond.

(d)

Failure of Xcel Energy or one of its subsidiaries to perform under the
agreement that is the subject of the relevant bond. In addition, per the
indemnity agreement between Xcel Energy and the various surety companies, the
surety companies have the discretion to demand that collateral be posted.

(e)

Non-timely payment of the obligations or at the time the debtor becomes
the subject of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings.

(f)

Security interest in underlying receivable
agreements.

(g)

Xcel Energy agreed to indemnify an insurance company in connection with
surety bonds they may issue or have issued for Utility Engineering up to $80
million. The Xcel Energy indemnification will be triggered only in the event
that Utility Engineering has failed to meet its obligations to the surety
company.

(h)

The guarantees associated with Cheyenne were
terminated upon consummation of the sale on Jan. 21, 2005.

Letters of
Credit

Xcel Energy and its
subsidiaries use letters of credit, generally with terms of one year, to
provide financial guarantees for certain operating obligations. At Dec. 31,
2004, there was $82.2 million of letters of credit outstanding. The contract
amounts of these letters of credit approximate their fair value and are subject
to fees determined in the marketplace.

16.     Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

Legislative Resource Commitments —

In 1994 and 2003, NSP-Minnesota received
Minnesota legislative approval for additional on-site temporary spent-fuel
storage facilities at its Prairie Island nuclear power plant, provided
NSP-Minnesota satisfies certain requirements. 
Commitments related to the 17 dry cask storage containers approved in
1994 have been fulfilled.  The use of 29
dry


cask storage containers has
been approved. As of Dec. 31, 2004, NSP-Minnesota had loaded 17 of the
containers.

On May 29, 2003, the
Minnesota Legislature enacted legislation that will enable NSP-Minnesota to
store at least 12 more casks of spent fuel outside the Prairie Island nuclear
generating plant, in addition to those approved in 1994. This will allow
NSP-Minnesota to continue to operate the plant and store spent-fuel in the
facility until its licenses with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) expire
in 2013 and 2014. The legislation transfers the primary authority concerning
future spent fuel storage issues from the state Legislature to the MPUC.  It also allows for additional storage without
the requirement of an affirmative vote from the state Legislature, if the NRC
extends the licenses of the Prairie Island and Monticello plants and the MPUC
grants a certificate of need for such additional storage. The legislation
requires NSP-Minnesota to add at least 300 megawatts of additional wind power
by 2010 with an option to own 100 megawatts of this power.

The legislation also requires
payments during the remaining operating life of the Prairie Island plant. These
payments include: $2.25 million per year to the Prairie Island Tribal Community
beginning in 2004; 5 percent of NSP-Minnesota’s conservation program
expenditures (estimated at $2 million per year) to the University of Minnesota
for renewable energy research; and an increase in funding commitments to the
previously established Renewable Development Fund from $8.5 million in 2002 to
$16 million per year beginning in 2003. The legislation also designated $10
million in one-time grants to the University of Minnesota for additional
renewable energy research, which is to be funded from commitments already made
to the Renewable Development Fund. All of the cost increases to NSP-Minnesota
from these required payments and funding commitments are expected to be
recoverable in Minnesota retail customer rates, mainly through existing
cost-recovery mechanisms. Funding commitments to the Renewable Development Fund
would terminate after the Prairie Island plant discontinues operation unless
the MPUC determines that NSP-Minnesota failed to make a good faith effort to
store or dispose of the spent-fuel out of state, in which case NSP-Minnesota
would have to make payments in the amount of $7.5 million per year.

Capital Commitments —

As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources under Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, the estimated cost, as of Dec. 31, 2004, of the
capital expenditure programs and other capital requirements of Xcel Energy and
its subsidiaries is approximately $1.5 billion in 2005, $2.3 billion in 2006
and $1.8 billion in 2007.

The capital expenditure
programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification.
Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to
changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, the desired reserve
margin and the availability of purchased power, as well as alternative plans
for meeting Xcel Energy’s long-term energy needs. In addition, Xcel Energy’s
ongoing evaluation of restructuring requirements, compliance with future
requirements to install emission-control equipment, and merger, acquisition and
divestiture opportunities to support corporate strategies may impact actual
capital requirements.

Leases —

Xcel
Energy and its subsidiaries lease a variety of equipment and facilities used in
the normal course of business. Some of these leases qualify as capital leases
and are accounted for accordingly. The capital leases contractually expire in
2025 and 2029. The net book value of property under capital leases was
approximately $48.9 million and $47.7 million at Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded as property at
the lower of fair market value or the present value of future lease payments,
and are amortized over their actual contract term in accordance with practices
allowed by regulators. The related obligation is classified as long-term debt.
Executory costs are excluded from the minimum lease payments.

The remainder of the leases,
primarily real estate leases and leases of coal-hauling railcars, trucks, cars
and power-operated equipment are accounted for as operating leases. Rental
expense under operating lease obligations for continuing operations was
approximately $57.5 million, $65.0 million and $67.8 million for 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.


Expected operating lease
expenses and future commitments under capital leases for continuing operations
are:

Technology Agreement —

Xcel Energy has a contract that extends through 2011 with International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) for information technology services. The contract
is cancelable at our option, although there are financial penalties for early
termination. In 2004, Xcel Energy paid IBM $152.5 million under the contract
and $24.5 million for other project business. The contract also has a committed
minimum payment each year from 2005 through 2011.

Fuel Contracts —

Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries have contracts providing for the
purchase and delivery of a significant portion of its current coal, nuclear
fuel and natural gas requirements. These contracts expire in various years
between 2005 and 2025. In total, Xcel Energy is committed to the minimum
purchase of approximately $2.2 billion of coal, $133.1 million of nuclear fuel
and $2.8 billion of natural gas, including $1.0 billion of natural gas storage
and transportation, or to make payments in lieu thereof, under these contracts.
In addition, Xcel Energy is required to pay additional amounts depending on
actual quantities shipped under these agreements. Xcel Energy’s risk of loss,
in the form of increased costs, from market price changes in fuel is mitigated
through the use of natural gas and energy cost adjustment mechanisms of the
ratemaking process, which provide for pass through of most fuel costs to
customers.

Purchased Power Agreements —

The utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy have
entered into agreements with utilities and other energy suppliers for purchased
power to meet system load and energy requirements, replace generation from
company-owned units under maintenance and during outages, and meet operating
reserve obligations. NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS have various
pay-for-performance contracts with expiration dates through the year 2033. In
general, these contracts provide for capacity payments, subject to meeting
certain contract obligations, and energy payments based on actual power taken
under the contracts. Certain contractual payment obligations are adjusted based
on indexes.  However, the effects of
price adjustments are mitigated through cost-of-energy adjustment mechanisms.

At Dec. 31, 2004, the
estimated future payments for capacity that the utility subsidiaries of Xcel
Energy are obligated to purchase, subject to availability, are as follows:

Environmental
Contingencies

Xcel Energy is subject to
regulations covering air and water quality, land use, the storage of natural
gas and the storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic wastes. Compliance is
continually assessed. Regulations, interpretations and enforcement policies can
change, which may impact the cost of building and operating facilities.


Site Remediation —

Xcel Energy must pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate sites
where past activities of our subsidiaries and some other parties have caused
environmental contamination. At Dec. 31, 2004, there were three categories of
sites:

•

the site of a former federal uranium
enrichment facility;

•

sites of former manufactured gas plants
(MGPs) operated by our subsidiaries or predecessors; and

•

third-party
sites, such as landfills, to which Xcel Energy is alleged to be a potentially
responsible party (PRP) that sent hazardous materials and wastes.

Xcel Energy records a liability
when enough information is obtained to develop an estimate of the cost of
environmental remediation and revises the estimate as information is received.
The estimated remediation cost may vary materially.

To estimate the cost to
remediate these sites, assumptions are made when facts are not fully known. For
instance, assumptions may be made about the nature and extent of site
contamination, the extent of required cleanup efforts, costs of alternative
cleanup methods and pollution-control technologies, the period over which
remediation will be performed and paid for, changes in environmental
remediation and pollution-control requirements, the potential effect of
technological improvements, the number and financial strength of other PRPs and
the identification of new environmental cleanup sites.

Estimates are revised as
facts become known.  At Dec. 31, 2004,
the liability for the cost of remediating these sites was estimated to be $44.0
million, of which $19.3 million was considered to be a current liability. Some
of the cost of remediation may be recovered from:

•

insurance coverage;

•

other parties that have contributed to the
contamination; and

•

customers.

Neither the total
remediation cost nor the final method of cost allocation among all PRPs of the
unremediated sites has been determined. 
Estimates have been recorded for Xcel Energy’s future costs for these
sites.

Federal Uranium Enrichment Facility

Approximately $5.4 million
of the long-term liability and $4.6 million of the current liability relate to
a DOE assessment to NSP-Minnesota and PSCo for decommissioning a federal
uranium enrichment facility. These environmental liabilities do not include
accruals recorded and collected from customers in rates for future nuclear fuel
disposal costs or decommissioning costs related to NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear
generating plants. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion of nuclear obligations.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

Levee Station
Manufactured Gas Plant Site

- A portion of
NSP-Minnesota’s High Bridge plant coal yard is located on the site of the
former Levee Station MGP site. The Levee Station was a coke-oven gas
purification, storage and distribution facility.  The Levee Station supplied manufactured gas
to the city of St. Paul from 1918 to the early 1950s.  In the 1950s, the facility was demolished,
and the High Bridge coal yard was extended onto the property.  In the 1990s, the site was investigated and
partially remediated at a cost of approximately $2.9 million.  In 2006, NSP-Minnesota plans to commence
construction of the High Bridge Combined Cycle Generating Plant, as part of the
MERP, on the site of the Levee Station. The construction of the new plant will
require the removal of buried structures and soil and groundwater remediation.
Remediation activities will begin in 2005. The cost of the additional
remediation is estimated to be $5.8 million, which will be accounted for as a
capital expenditure of the MERP project.

Ashland MGP Site

—

NSP-Wisconsin
was named a PRP for creosote and coal tar contamination at a site in Ashland,
Wis. The Ashland site includes property owned by NSP-Wisconsin, which was
previously an MGP facility, and two other properties: an adjacent city
lakeshore park area, on which an unaffiliated third party previously operated a
sawmill, and an area of Lake Superior’s Chequemegon Bay adjoining the park.


As an interim action, Xcel
Energy proposed, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR)
approved, a coal tar removal and groundwater treatment system for one area of
concern at the site for which NSP-Wisconsin has accepted responsibility. The
groundwater treatment system began operating in the fall of 2000. In 2002, NSP-Wisconsin
installed additional monitoring wells in the deep aquifer under the MGP site to
better characterize the extent and degree of contaminants in that aquifer while
the coal tar removal system is operational. 
In 2002, a second interim response action was also implemented.  As approved by the WDNR, this interim
response action involved the removal and capping of a seep area in a city
park.  Surface soils in the area of the
seep were contaminated with tar residues. 
The interim action also included the diversion and ongoing treatment of
groundwater that contributed to the formation of the seep.

On Sept. 5, 2002, the
Ashland site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL).  The NPL is intended primarily to guide the U.
S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in determining which sites require
further investigation.  On Nov. 14, 2003,
the EPA and NSP-Wisconsin signed an administrative order on consent requiring
NSP-Wisconsin to complete the remedial investigation and feasibility study for
the site.  On Dec. 7, 2004, the EPA
approved NSP-Wisconsin’s proposed work plan with minor contingencies to
complete the remedial investigation and feasibility study.  On Feb. 1, 2005, NSP-Wisconsin submitted its
revised work plan to the EPA addressing all of the contingencies raised with
the previous proposal.  The final
approval results in specific delineation of the investigative fieldwork and
scientific assessments that must be performed. 
The estimated cost of carrying out the work plan is $1.3 million in
2005.  Resolution of Ashland remediation
issues is not currently expected until 2007 or 2008.  NSP-Wisconsin continues to work with the WDNR
to access state and federal funds to apply to the ultimate remediation cost of
the entire site.

The WDNR and NSP-Wisconsin
have each developed several estimates of the ultimate cost to remediate the
Ashland site. The estimates vary significantly, between $4 million and $93
million, because different methods of remediation and different results are
assumed in each. The EPA and WDNR have not yet selected the method of
remediation to use at the site. Until the EPA and the WDNR select a remediation
strategy for the entire site and determine NSP-Wisconsin’s level of
responsibility, the ultimate cost of remediating the Ashland site is not
determinable.

On July 2, 2004,
the WDNR sent NSP-Wisconsin an invoice for recovery of past costs incurred at
the Ashland site between 1994 and March 2003 in the amount of $1.4
million.  On Oct. 19, 2004, the WDNR,
represented by the Wisconsin Department of Justice, filed a lawsuit in
Wisconsin state court for reimbursement of the past costs.  This lawsuit has been stayed until further
action by either party.  NSP-Wisconsin is
reviewing the invoice to determine whether all costs charged are appropriate.
All appropriate insurance carriers have been notified of the WDNR’s invoice and
the lawsuit and will be invited to participate in any future efforts to address
the WDNR’s actions.  All costs paid are
expected to be recoverable in rates.

NSP-Wisconsin has recorded a
liability of $17.3 million for its estimate of its share of the cost of
remediating the Ashland site, using information available to date and
reasonably effective remedial methods. NSP-Wisconsin has deferred, as a
regulatory asset, the remediation costs accrued for the Ashland site based on
an expectation that the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) will
continue to allow NSP-Wisconsin to recover payments for environmental
remediation from its customers. The PSCW has consistently authorized recovery
in NSP-Wisconsin rates of all remediation costs incurred at the Ashland site,
and has authorized recovery of similar remediation costs for other Wisconsin
utilities. External MGP remediation costs are subject to deferral in the
Wisconsin retail jurisdiction and are reviewed as part of the Wisconsin
biennial retail rate case process for prudence. Once approved by the PSCW,
deferred MGP remediation costs, less carrying costs, are historically amortized
over four or six years. In addition, the Wisconsin Supreme Court rendered a
ruling that reopens the possibility that NSP-Wisconsin may be able to recover a
portion of the remediation costs from its insurance carriers.

Fort Collins MGP Site

—

Prior
to 1926, Poudre Valley Gas Co., a predecessor of PSCo, operated an MGP in Fort
Collins, Colo., not far from the Cache la Poudre River. In 1926, after
acquiring the Poudre Valley Gas Co., PSCo shut down the MGP site and has sold
most of the property.  Recently, an oily
substance similar to MGP byproducts was discovered in the Cache la Poudre
River.  In early 2004, PSCo completed
implementation of a work plan to further investigate the sources of
contamination of the river at a cost of approximately $1.4 million.  The work resulted in removal of contaminated
sediments and delineation of the extent of the contamination.

On
Nov. 10, 2004, PSCo entered into an agreement with the EPA, the city of Fort
Collins and Schrader Oil Co., under which PSCo will perform remediation and
monitoring work at an estimated cost of $8.8 million.  Work is currently under way, with completion
of construction anticipated in June 2005 followed by ongoing operation and
maintenance.


To date, PSCo has spent
approximately $3.4 million on the project, including settlement costs
negotiated with the City of Fort Collins in 1998 and costs incurred by the
EPA.  The EPA is also expected to seek
recovery of its ongoing oversight costs from PSCo.  PSCo has deferred the costs recorded to date
as a regulatory asset and believes that they will be recovered through future
rates. Any costs that are not recoverable from customers will be expensed.

Third Party and Other Environmental Site Remediation

Asbestos Removal

—

Some
of our facilities contain asbestos. Most asbestos will remain undisturbed until
the facilities that contain it are demolished or renovated. Since the intent is
to operate most of these facilities indefinitely, Xcel Energy cannot estimate
the amount or timing of payments for final removal of the asbestos. It may be
necessary to remove some asbestos to perform maintenance or make improvements
to other equipment. The cost of removing asbestos as part of other work is
immaterial and is recorded as incurred as operating expenses for maintenance
projects, capital expenditures for construction projects or removal costs for
demolition projects.

Federal Clean Water Act

—
The federal Clean Water Act addresses the environmental impacts of cooling
water intakes. In July 2004, the EPA published phase II of the rule that
applies to existing cooling water intakes at steam-electric power plants. The
rule will require Xcel Energy to perform additional environmental studies at 12
power plants in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Colorado to determine the impact the
facilities may be having on aquatic organisms vulnerable to injury.  If the studies determine the plants are not
meeting the new performance standards established by the phase II rule,
physical and/or operational changes may be required at these plants.  It is not possible to provide an accurate
estimate of the overall cost of this rulemaking at this time due to the many
uncertainties involved. Preliminary cost estimates range from less than $1
million at some plants to more than $10 million at others, depending on
site-specific circumstances. Based on the limited information available, total
capital costs to Xcel Energy are estimated at approximately $59 million. Actual
costs may be significantly higher or lower depending on issues such as the resolution
of outstanding third-party legal challenges to the rule.

Leyden Gas Storage Facility

—

In February 2001, the CPUC approved PSCo’s
plan to abandon the Leyden natural gas storage facility (Leyden) after 40 years
of operation.  In July 2001, the CPUC
decided that the recovery of all Leyden costs would be addressed in a future
rate proceeding when all costs were known. 
In 2003, PSCo began flooding the facility with water, as part of an
overall plan to convert Leyden into a municipal water storage facility owned
and operated by the city of Arvada, Colo. 
In August 2003, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC)
approved the closure plan, the last formal regulatory approval necessary before
conversion.  Leyden is expected to close
by Dec. 31, 2005, and the city of Arvada will take over the site. PSCo is
obligated to monitor the site for two years after closure. As of Dec. 31, 2004,
PSCo has incurred approximately $4.8 million of costs associated with
engineering buffer studies, damage claims paid to landowners and other initial
closure costs.  PSCo has accrued an
additional $1.3 million of costs expected to be incurred through 2006 to
complete the decommissioning and closure of the facility.  PSCo has deferred these costs as a regulatory
asset and believes that these costs will be recovered through future rates. Any
costs that are not recoverable from customers will be expensed.

In December 2003, a homeowners association petitioned the EPA to assess
the threat of a natural gas release from the Leyden facility pursuant to
Section 105(d) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended, (CERCLA) 42 U.S.C. section 9605.  The EPA completed its review in October 2004
and concluded that the risk to nearby residents is relatively low.  The EPA referred the matter to its Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act program.  On
Nov. 24, 2004, the EPA sent a letter to the COGCC requesting that the COGCC
contact Xcel Energy and request certain information concerning the
closure.  To date no formal request has
been received by PSCo.

PSCo Notice of Violation

—

On Nov. 3, 1999, the U.S. Department of
Justice filed suit against a number of electric utilities for alleged
violations of the federal Clean Air Act’s New Source Review (NSR) requirements.
The suit is related to alleged modifications of electric generating plants
located in the South and Midwest. Subsequently, the EPA also issued requests
for information pursuant to the Clean Air Act to numerous electric utilities,
including Xcel Energy, seeking to determine whether these utilities engaged in
activities that may have been in violation of the NSR requirements. In 2001,
Xcel Energy responded to the EPA’s initial information requests related to PSCo
plants in Colorado.

On July 1, 2002, PSCo
received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA alleging violations of the
NSR requirements of the Clean Air Act at the Comanche and Pawnee plants in
Colorado. The NOV specifically alleges that various maintenance, repair and
replacement projects undertaken at the plants in the mid-to-late 1990s should
have required a permit under the NSR process. PSCo believes it has acted in
full compliance with the Clean Air Act and NSR process. It believes that the
projects identified in the NOV fit within the routine maintenance, repair and
replacement exemption contained within the NSR regulations, or are otherwise
not subject


to the NSR requirements.
PSCo also believes that the projects would be expressly authorized under the
EPA’s NSR equipment-replacement rulemaking promulgated in October 2003. On Dec.
24, 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stayed
this rule while it considers challenges to it. PSCo disagrees with the
assertions contained in the NOV and intends to vigorously defend its position.
As required by the Clean Air Act, the EPA met with PSCo in September 2002 to
discuss the NOV.

If the EPA is successful in
any subsequent litigation regarding the issues set forth in the NOV or any matter
arising as a result of its information requests, it could require PSCo to
install additional emission-control equipment at the plants and pay civil
penalties. Civil penalties are limited to not more than $25,000 to $27,500 per
day for each violation, commencing from the date the violation began. The
ultimate financial impact to PSCo is not determinable at this time.

NSP-Minnesota NSR Information Request

—

On Nov. 3, 1999, the U. S. Department of
Justice filed suit, related to alleged modifications of electric generating
plants located in the South and Midwest, against a number of electric utilities
for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act’s NSR requirements.  Subsequently, the EPA also issued requests
for information pursuant to the Clean Air Act to numerous other electric
utilities, including Xcel Energy, seeking to determine whether these utilities
engaged in activities that may have been in violation of the NSR requirements.
In 2001, Xcel Energy responded to the EPA’s initial information requests
related to NSP-Minnesota plants in Minnesota. On May 22, 2002, the EPA issued a
follow-up information request to Xcel Energy seeking additional information
regarding NSR compliance at its plants in Minnesota. Xcel Energy completed its
response to the follow-up information request during the fall of 2002.

Polychlorinated
Biphenyl (PCB) Storage and Disposal -

In August
2004, SPS received notice from the EPA contending SPS violated PCB storage and
disposal regulations with respect to storage of a drained transformer and
related solids. The EPA contends the fine for the alleged violation is
approximately $1.2 million. SPS is contesting the fine and is in discussions
with the EPA.

Nuclear Insurance —

NSP-Minnesota’s public liability for claims resulting from any nuclear
incident is limited to $10.8 billion under the 1988 Price-Anderson amendment to
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. NSP-Minnesota has secured $300 million of
coverage for its public liability exposure with a pool of insurance companies.
The remaining $10.5 billion of exposure is funded by the Secondary Financial
Protection Program, available from assessments by the federal government in
case of a nuclear accident. NSP-Minnesota is subject to assessments of up to
$100.6 million for each of its three licensed reactors, to be applied for
public liability arising from a nuclear incident at any licensed nuclear
facility in the United States. The maximum funding requirement is $10 million
per reactor during any one year.

NSP-Minnesota purchases
insurance for property damage and site decontamination cleanup costs from
Nuclear Electric Insurance Ltd. (NEIL). The coverage limits are $2.1 billion
for each of NSP-Minnesota’s two nuclear plant sites. NEIL also provides business
interruption insurance coverage, including the cost of replacement power
obtained during certain prolonged accidental outages of nuclear generating
units. Premiums are expensed over the policy term. All companies insured with
NEIL are subject to retroactive premium adjustments if losses exceed
accumulated reserve funds. Capital has been accumulated in the reserve funds of
NEIL to the extent that NSP-Minnesota would have no exposure for retroactive
premium assessments in case of a single incident under the business
interruption and the property damage insurance coverage. However, in each
calendar year, NSP-Minnesota could be subject to maximum assessments of
approximately $6.9 million for business interruption insurance and $26.1
million for property damage insurance if losses exceed accumulated reserve
funds.

Legal
Contingencies

In the normal course of
business, Xcel Energy is subject to claims and litigation arising from prior
and current operations. Xcel Energy is actively defending these matters and has
recorded an estimate of the probable cost of settlement or other
disposition.  The ultimate outcome of
these matters cannot presently be determined. Accordingly, the ultimate
resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on Xcel Energy’s
financial position and results of operations.

Bender et al. vs. Xcel Energy

—
On July 2, 2004, five former NRG officers filed a lawsuit against Xcel Energy
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. The lawsuit alleges,
among other things, that Xcel Energy violated ERISA by refusing to make certain
deferred compensation payments to the plaintiffs. The complaint also alleges
interference with ERISA benefits, breach of contract related to the nonpayment
of certain stock options and unjust enrichment. The complaint alleges damages
of approximately $6 million. Xcel Energy believes the suit is without
merit.  On Jan. 19, 2005, Xcel Energy
filed a motion for summary judgment.  A
hearing for this motion is scheduled for April 21, 2005.


Carbon Dioxide Emissions Lawsuit

-
On July 21, 2004, the attorneys general of eight states and New York City, as
well as several environmental groups, filed lawsuits in U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York against five utilities, including Xcel
Energy, to force reductions in carbon dioxide (CO


) emissions.  The other utilities include American Electric
Power Co., Southern Co., Cinergy Corp. and Tennessee Valley Authority. CO


is emitted whenever fossil fuel is combusted, such as in automobiles,
industrial operations and coal- or gas-fired power plants.  The lawsuits allege that CO


emitted by each company is a public nuisance as defined under state and federal
common law because it has contributed to global warming.  The lawsuits do not demand monetary
damages.  Instead, the lawsuits ask the
court to order each utility to cap and reduce its CO


emissions.  In October 2004, Xcel Energy
and four other utility companies filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit,
contending, among other reasons, that the lawsuit should be dismissed because
it is an attempt to usurp the policy-setting role of the U.S Congress and the
president. The ultimate financial impact of these lawsuits, if any, is not
determinable at this time.

The issue of global
climate change is receiving increased attention.  Debate continues in the scientific community
concerning the extent to which the earth’s climate is warming, the causes of
climate variations that have been observed, and the ultimate impacts that might
result from a changing climate.  There
also is considerable debate regarding public policy for the approach that the
United States should follow to address the issue.  The United Nations-sponsored Kyoto Protocol,
which establishes greenhouse gas reduction targets for developed nations,
entered into force on Feb. 16, 2005. 
President Bush has declared that the United States will not ratify the
protocol and is opposed to legislative mandates, preferring a program based on
voluntary efforts and research on new technologies.  Xcel Energy is closely monitoring the issue
from both scientific and policy perspectives. 
While it is not possible to know the eventual outcome, Xcel Energy
believes the issue merits close attention and is taking actions it believes are
prudent to be best positioned for a variety of possible future outcomes.  Xcel Energy is participating in a voluntary
carbon management program and has established goals to reduce its volume of
carbon dioxide emissions by 12 million tons by 2009 and to reduce carbon
intensity by 7 percent by 2012.  In
certain jurisdictions, the evaluation process for future generating resources
incorporates the risk of future carbon limits through the use of a carbon cost
adder or externality costs.  Xcel Energy
also is involved in other projects to improve available methods for managing
carbon.

Department of Labor Audit —

In 2001, Xcel Energy received notice from the
Department of Labor (DOL) Employee Benefit Security Administration that it
intended to audit the Xcel Energy pension plan. After multiple on-site meetings
and interviews with Xcel Energy personnel, the DOL indicated on Sept. 18, 2003,
that it is prepared to take the position that Xcel Energy, as plan sponsor and
through its delegate, the Pension Trust Administration Committee, breached its
fiduciary duties under ERISA with respect to certain investments made in
limited partnerships and hedge funds in 1997 and 1998.  The DOL has offered to conclude the
audit at this time if Xcel Energy is willing to contribute to the plan the full
amount of losses from the questioned investments, or approximately $7
million.  On July 19, 2004, Xcel Energy
formally responded with a letter to the DOL that asserted no fiduciary
violations have occurred and extended an offer to meet to discuss the matter
further. If the DOL offer is put into effect, the requested contribution would
affect cash flows only and not the net income of Xcel Energy.

Xcel Energy Inc. Securities Class Action Litigation —

On July 31, 2002, a lawsuit purporting to be
a class action on behalf of purchasers of Xcel Energy’s common stock between
Jan. 31, 2001, and July 26, 2002, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Minnesota. The complaint named Xcel Energy and current and former
Xcel Energy and NRG executives as defendants. Among other things, the complaint
alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule
10(b-5) related to allegedly false and misleading disclosures concerning
various issues including but not limited to “round trip” energy trades, the
nature, extent and seriousness of liquidity and credit difficulties at NRG and
the existence of cross-default provisions (with NRG credit agreements) in
certain of Xcel Energy’s credit agreements. After filing the lawsuit, several
additional lawsuits were filed with similar allegations and all have been
consolidated.  On Jan. 14, 2005, the
District Court issued an order of preliminary approval for a settlement reached
by the parties.  Under the terms of the
settlement, the plaintiffs are to receive $80 million, with Xcel Energy’s
insurance carriers paying $62.5 million, and Xcel Energy paying $17.5
million.  Xcel Energy’s portion of the
settlement payment was accrued at Dec. 31, 2004.  A hearing to consider final approval of the
settlement is scheduled for April 1, 2005.

Xcel Energy Inc. Shareholder Derivative
Action - Edith Gottlieb vs. Xcel Energy

Inc. et al; Essmacher vs. Brunetti;
McLain vs. Brunetti -

In August 2002, a shareholder derivative
action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota
(Gottlieb), purportedly on behalf of Xcel Energy, against the directors and
certain present and former officers, citing allegedly false and misleading
disclosures concerning various issues and asserting breach of fiduciary duty.
This action has been consolidated with other similar securities class actions
and an amended complaint was filed.  A settlement in the federal derivative lawsuit
was reached in December 2004 and given preliminary approval by the District
Court in an order dated Jan. 14, 2005. 
Under the terms of the settlement, Xcel Energy agreed to adopt certain
corporate governance measures and pay plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and expenses
in an amount not to exceed $125,000.  A
hearing to consider final approval of this settlement is scheduled for April 1,
2005.


Xcel Energy Employee ERISA Actions -
Newcome vs. Xcel Energy Inc.; Barday vs. Xcel Energy Inc. —

On Sept. 23, 2002, and Oct. 9, 2002, two
essentially identical actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Colorado, purportedly on behalf of classes of employee participants
in Xcel Energy’s and its predecessors’ 401(k) or ESOP plans, from as early as
Sept. 23, 1999, forward. The complaints in the actions name as defendants Xcel
Energy, its directors, certain former directors and certain present and former
officers.  The complaints allege
violations of the ERISA in the form of breach of fiduciary duty in allowing or
encouraging purchase, contribution and/or retention of Xcel Energy’s common
stock in the plans and making misleading statements and omissions in that
regard.  On Jan. 14, 2005, the
District Court issued an order of preliminary approval related to a settlement
reached by the parties.  Under the terms
of the settlement, plaintiffs are to receive a payment of $8 million, which
will be paid by Xcel Energy’s insurance carrier.  Xcel Energy also agreed, subject to the
provisions of the applicable collective bargaining agreement, to undertake to
amend the Xcel Energy 401(k) savings plan and its predecessor plans and the New
Century Energies employees’ and stock ownership plan for bargaining unit and
former nonbargaining unit employees, by permitting certain diversification of
Xcel Energy stock held in participants’ accounts in portions of these
plans.  A hearing is scheduled for April
1, 2005, to consider final approval of this settlement.

SchlumbergerSema,
Inc. vs. Xcel Energy Inc. (NSP-Minnesota)

-

Under a 1996 data services agreement,
SchlumbergerSema, Inc. (SLB) provides automated meter reading, distribution
automation and other data services to NSP-Minnesota. In September 2002,
NSP-Minnesota issued written notice that SLB committed events of default under
the agreement, including SLB’s nonpayment of approximately $7.4 million for
distribution automation assets. In November 2002, SLB demanded arbitration and
asserted various claims against NSP-Minnesota totaling approximately $24
million for alleged breach of an expansion contract and a meter purchasing
contract. In the arbitration, NSP-Minnesota asserted counterclaims against SLB,
including those related to SLB’s failure to meet performance criteria, improper
billing, failure to pay for use of NSP-Minnesota owned property and failure to
pay $7.4 million for NSP-Minnesota distribution automation assets, for total
claims of approximately $41 million. NSP-Minnesota also sought a declaratory
judgment from the arbitrators that would terminate SLB’s rights under the data
services agreement. In August 2004, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District
of Delaware ruled that claims related to use of certain equipment are barred
unless NSP-Minnesota can establish a basis for the claims in SLB’s conduct subsequent
to the time of the assumption of this contract by SLB.  If NSP-Minnesota cannot establish that basis,
the decision would reduce NSP-Minnesota’s damage claim by approximately $5.5
million.

Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc. vs. Centerpoint Energy et al.

—

On Nov. 19, 2003, a class action complaint
filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California by
Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc., was served on Xcel Energy naming e prime as a
defendant. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a purported class of large wholesale
natural gas purchasers, alleges that e prime falsely reported natural gas
trades to market trade publications in an effort to artificially raise natural
gas prices in California. The case has been conditionally transferred to U.S.
District Judge Pro in Nevada, who is supervising western areas wholesale
natural gas marketing litigation. A motion is currently pending to transfer the
case back to the Eastern District of California. The case is in the early
stages, there has been no discovery and Xcel Energy intends to vigorously
defend against these claims.

Cornerstone Propane
Partners, L.P. et al. vs. e prime inc. et al.

—

On
Feb. 2, 2004, a purported class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York against e prime and three other
defendants by Cornerstone Propane Partners, L.P., Robert Calle Gracey and
Dominick Viola on behalf of a class who purchased or sold one or more New York
Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures and/or options contracts during the
period from Jan. 1, 2000, to Dec. 31, 2002. The complaint alleges that
defendants manipulated the price of natural gas futures and options and/or the
price of natural gas underlying those contracts in violation of the Commodities
Exchange Act. In February 2004, the plaintiff requested that this action be
consolidated with a similar suit involving Reliant Energy Services. In February
2004, defendants, including e prime, filed motions to dismiss. In September
2004, the U.S. District Court denied the motions to dismiss.  The case is in the early stages, there has
been little discovery and Xcel Energy intends to vigorously defend against
these claims.

Fairhaven Power
Company vs. Encana Corporation et al.

—

On Sept.
14, 2004, a class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of California by Fairhaven Power Co. and subsequently served
on Xcel Energy. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a purported class of natural
gas purchasers, alleges that Xcel Energy falsely reported natural gas trades to
market trade publications in an effort to artificially raise natural gas prices
in California and engaged in a conspiracy with other sellers of natural gas to
inflate prices. The case is in the early stages, there has been no discovery and
Xcel Energy intends to vigorously defend against these claims.

Utility Savings and Refund Services LLP vs. Reliant Energy Services
Inc. —

On Nov.
29, 2004, a class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of California by Utility Savings and Refund Services LLP and
subsequently served on Xcel Energy.  The
lawsuit, filed on behalf of a purported class of natural gas purchasers,
alleges that Xcel Energy falsely reported natural gas trades to market trade
publications in an effort to artificially raise natural gas prices in
California and engaged in a


conspiracy with other
sellers of natural gas to inflate prices. 
The case is in the early stages, there has been no discovery and Xcel
Energy intends to vigorously defend against these claims.

Abelman Art Glass vs. Ercana Corporation, et al. —

On Dec. 13, 2004, a class action complaint
was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California by
Abelman Art Glass and subsequently served on Xcel Energy.  The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a purported
class of natural gas purchasers, alleges that Xcel Energy falsely reported
natural gas trades to market trade publications in an effort to artificially
raise natural gas prices in California and engaged in a conspiracy with other
sellers of natural gas to inflate prices. 
The case is in the early stages, there has been no discovery and Xcel
Energy intends to vigorously defend against these claims.

Hill et al. vs. PSCo et al.

- In late October
2003, there were two wildfires in Colorado, one in Boulder County and the other
in Douglas County. There was no loss of life, but there was property damage
associated with these fires. Parties have asserted that trees falling into Xcel
Energy distribution lines may have caused one or both fires.  On Jan. 14, 2004, an action against PSCo
relating to the fire in Boulder County was filed in Boulder County District
Court. There are now 46 plaintiffs, including individuals and insurance
companies, and three co-defendants, including PSCo. The plaintiffs assert that
they are seeking in excess of $35 million in damages. Xcel Energy believes it
has insurance coverage to mitigate the liability in this matter. The ultimate
financial impact to PSCo is not determinable at this time.

Other
Contingencies

Tax Matters —

PSCo’s wholly owned subsidiary,
PSRI, owns and manages permanent life insurance policies, known as COLI
policies, on some of PSCo’s employees. At various times, borrowings have been
made against the cash values of these COLI policies and deductions taken on the
interest expense on these borrowings. The IRS has challenged the deductibility
of such interest expense deductions and has disallowed the deductions taken in
tax years 1993 through 1999.

After
consultation with tax counsel, Xcel Energy contends that the IRS determination
is not supported by tax law. Based upon this assessment, management believes
that the tax deduction of interest expense on the COLI policy loans is in full
compliance with the law. Accordingly, PSRI has not recorded any provision for
income tax or related interest or penalties that may be imposed by the IRS and
has continued to take deductions for interest expense related to policy loans
on its income tax returns for subsequent years.

In April 2004,
Xcel Energy filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of
Minnesota against the IRS to establish its entitlement to deduct policy loan
interest for tax years 1993 and 1994.  In
December 2004, Xcel Energy filed suit in U.S. Tax Court in Washington D.C. for
tax years 1995 through 1997.  Xcel Energy
expects to request that the tax court stay its petition pending the decision in
the District Court litigation.  The
litigation could require several years to reach final resolution. Although the
ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, it could have a material
adverse effect on Xcel Energy’s financial position and results of operations.
Defense of Xcel Energy’s position may require significant cash outlays, which
may or may not be recoverable in a court proceeding.

Should the IRS
ultimately prevail on this issue, tax and interest payable through Dec. 31,
2004, would reduce earnings by an estimated $311 million.  In 2004, Xcel Energy received formal
notification that the IRS will seek penalties. If penalties (plus associated
interest) also are included, the total exposure through Dec. 31, 2004, is
approximately $368 million.  Xcel Energy
estimates its annual earnings for 2004 would be reduced by $36 million, after
tax, which represents 8 cents per share, if COLI interest expense deductions
were no longer available.

Accounting for
Uncertain Tax Positions

— In late July 2004, the
FASB discussed potential changes or clarifications in the criteria for recognition
of tax benefits, which may result in raising the threshold for recognizing tax
benefits, which have some degree of uncertainty. The FASB has not issued any
proposed guidance, but an exposure draft may be released in the first quarter
of 2005.  Xcel Energy is unable to
determine the impact or timing of any potential accounting changes required by
the FASB, but such changes could have a material financial impact.

SPS Retail Fuel Cost Recovery

— Fuel and purchased energy costs are
recovered in Texas through a fixed fuel and purchased energy recovery
factor.  In May 2004, SPS filed with the
PUCT its periodic request for fuel and purchased power cost recovery for
electric generation and fuel management activities for the period from January
2002 through December 2003.  SPS
requested approval of approximately $580 million of Texas-jurisdictional fuel
and purchased power costs for the two-year period.  Intervenor and PUCT staff testimony was filed
in October 2004 and hearings were held in December 2004.  Intervenor testimony contained objections to
SPS’ methodology for assigning average fuel costs to wholesale sales, among
other things.  Recovery of $49 million to
$86 million of the requested amount was contested by multiple intervenors.  SPS has recorded its best estimate of any
potential liability related to the impact of this proceeding.  In January 2005, SPS filed its post-hearing
briefs disputing the intervenor objections. 
Reply briefs were filed on Feb. 15, 2005, the administrative law judge
is expected to issue his recommended proposal for decision by the end of April
2005, and PUCT action is expected by the end of May 2005.  SPS is pursuing a settlement agreement with
the parties involved.


17.      Nuclear and Other Asset Retirement
Obligations

Fuel Disposal —

NSP-Minnesota is responsible for temporarily storing used or
spent-nuclear fuel from its nuclear plants. The DOE is responsible for
permanently storing spent fuel from NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear plants as well as
from other U.S. nuclear plants. NSP-Minnesota has funded its portion of the DOE’s
permanent disposal program since 1981. The fuel disposal fees are based on a
charge of 0.1 cent per kilowatt-hour sold to customers from nuclear generation.
Fuel expense includes DOE fuel disposal assessments of approximately $13
million in 2004, $13 million in 2003 and $13 million in 2002. In total,
NSP-Minnesota had paid approximately $335 million to the DOE through Dec. 31,
2004. However, it is not determinable whether the amount and method of the DOE’s
assessments to all utilities will be sufficient to fully fund the DOE’s
permanent storage or disposal facility.

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act
required the DOE to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel no later than Jan. 31,
1998. In 1996, the DOE notified commercial spent-fuel owners of an anticipated
delay in accepting spent nuclear fuel by the required date and conceded that a
permanent storage or disposal facility will not be available until at least
2010. NSP-Minnesota and other utilities have commenced lawsuits against the DOE
to recover damages caused by the DOE’s failure to meet its statutory and
contractual obligations.

NSP-Minnesota has its own
temporary, on-site storage facilities for spent-fuel at its Monticello and
Prairie Island nuclear plants, which consist of storage pools and a dry cask
facility. With the dry cask storage facility licensed by the NRC approved in
1994 and again in 2003, management believes it has adequate storage capacity to
continue operation of its Prairie Island nuclear plant until at least the end
of its license terms in 2013 and 2014. The Monticello nuclear plant has storage
capacity in the pool to continue operations until 2010. Storage availability to
permit operation beyond these dates is not known at this time. All of the
alternatives for spent fuel storage are being investigated until a DOE facility
is available, including pursuing the establishment of a private facility for
interim storage of spent nuclear fuel as part of a consortium of electric
utilities.

Nuclear fuel expense
includes payments to the DOE for the decommissioning and decontamination of the
DOE’s uranium-enrichment facilities. In 1993, NSP-Minnesota recorded the DOE’s
initial assessment of $46 million, which is payable in annual installments from
1993 to 2008. NSP-Minnesota is amortizing each installment to expense on a
monthly basis. The most recent installment paid in 2004 was $4.6 million;
future installments are subject to inflation adjustments under DOE rules.
NSP-Minnesota is obtaining rate recovery of these DOE assessments through the
cost-of-energy adjustment clause as the assessments are amortized. Accordingly,
the unamortized assessment of $12.6 million at Dec. 31, 2004, is deferred as a
regulatory asset.

Regulatory Plant Decommissioning Recovery —

Decommissioning of NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear
facilities, as last approved by the MPUC, is planned for the years 2010 through
2048, assuming the prompt dismantlement method. NSP-Minnesota is currently accruing
the costs for decommissioning over the MPUC approved cost-recovery period and
including the accruals in Accumulated Depreciation. Upon implementation of SFAS
No. 143, the decommissioning costs in Accumulated Depreciation and ongoing
accruals are reclassified to a regulatory liability account. The total
decommissioning cost obligation is recorded as an asset retirement obligation
in accordance with SFAS No. 143.

Monticello began operation
in 1971 and is licensed to operate until 2010. Prairie Island units 1 and 2
began operation in 1973 and 1974, respectively, and are licensed to operate
until 2013 and 2014, respectively. In 2003, the Minnesota Legislature changed a
law that had limited expansion of on-site storage.

On Aug. 25, 2004, the Xcel Energy board
of directors authorized the pursuit of renewal of the operating licenses for
the Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants.  NSP-Minnesota filed its application for
Monticello with the MPUC in January 2005, seeking a certificate of need for dry
spent-fuel storage, and plans to file an application in early 2005 with the NRC
for an operating license extension of up to 20 years.  A decision regarding Monticello relicensing
is expected in 2007. Plant assessments and other work for the Prairie Island
applications are planned in the next two or three years.

The
Prairie Island license renewal process has not yet begun.

Consistent with cost
recovery in utility customer rates, NSP-Minnesota records annual
decommissioning accruals based on periodic site-specific cost studies and a
presumed level of dedicated funding. Cost studies quantify decommissioning
costs in current dollars. Funding presumes that current costs will escalate in
the future at a rate of 4.19 percent per year. The total estimated decommissioning
costs that will ultimately be paid, net of income earned by external trust
funds, is currently being accrued using an annuity approach over the approved
plant-recovery period. This annuity approach uses an assumed rate of return on
funding, which is currently 5.5 percent, net of tax, for external funding and
approximately 8 percent, net of tax, for internal funding. Unrealized gains on
nuclear decommissioning investments are deferred as Regulatory Liabilities
based on the assumed offsetting against decommissioning costs in current
ratemaking treatment.

The MPUC last approved
NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear decommissioning study request in December 2003, using
2002 cost data. An original filing was submitted to the MPUC in October 2002
and updated in August 2003; final approval was received in December 2003.


The most recent cost
estimate represents an annual increase in external fund accruals, along with
the extension of Prairie Island cost recovery to the end of license life in
2014. The MPUC also approved the Department of Commerce recommendation to
accelerate the internal fund transfer to the external funds effective July 1,
2003, ending on Dec. 31, 2005. This approval increased the fund cash
contribution by approximately $29 million in 2003.  Consistent with previous treatment, the
transfers from the internal fund are effectively moving previously collected
funds to the external fund, thereby reducing the external fund book
expense.  Based on the last MPUC approval
requiring the acceleration of the internal fund transfer, there is a step
change in the level of the overall decommissioning expense at the expiration of
the transfer beginning Jan. 1, 2006. Expecting to operate Prairie Island
through the end of each unit’s licensed life, the approved capital recovery
will allow for the plant to be fully depreciated, including the accrual and
recovery of decommissioning costs, in 2014. Xcel Energy believes future
decommissioning cost accruals will continue to be recovered in customer rates.

The total obligation for
decommissioning currently is expected to be funded 100 percent by external
funds, as approved by the MPUC. Contributions to the external fund started in
1990 and are expected to continue until plant decommissioning begins. The
assets held in trusts as of Dec. 31, 2004, primarily consisted of investments
in fixed income securities, such as tax-exempt municipal bonds and U.S.
government securities that mature in one to 20 years, and common stock of
public companies. NSP-Minnesota plans to reinvest matured securities until
decommissioning begins.

At Dec. 31, 2004,
NSP-Minnesota had recorded and recovered in rates cumulative decommissioning
accruals of $768 million. The following table summarizes the funded status of
NSP-Minnesota’s decommissioning obligation based on approved regulatory
recovery parameters.  These amounts are
not those recorded in the financial statements for the asset retirement
obligation in accordance with SFAS No. 143:

Decommissioning expenses
recognized include the following components:

Decommissioning and interest
accruals are included with Regulatory Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Interest costs and trust earnings associated with externally funded
obligations are reported in Other Nonoperating Income on the Consolidated
Statement of Operations.

Negative accruals for
internally funded portions in 2002, 2003 and 2004 reflect the impacts of the
1999 and 2002 decommissioning studies, which have approved an assumption of
100-percent external funding of future costs. Previous studies assumed a
portion was funded internally; beginning in 2000, accruals are reversing the
previously accrued internal portion and increasing the external portion
prospectively.


Asset Retirement Obligations —

Xcel Energy records future plant
decommissioning obligations as a liability at fair value with a corresponding
increase to the carrying values of the related long-lived assets. This
liability will be increased over time by applying the interest method of
accretion to the liability, and the capitalized costs will be depreciated over
the useful life of the related long-lived assets.  The recording of the obligation has no income
statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the
establishment of a regulatory asset pursuant to SFAS No. 71.

Asset retirement obligations
have been recorded for the decommissioning of two NSP-Minnesota nuclear
generating plants, the Monticello plant and the Prairie Island plant. A liability
also has been recorded for the decommissioning of an NSP-Minnesota steam
production plant, the Pathfinder plant. Monticello began operation in 1971 and
is licensed to operate until 2010. Prairie Island units 1 and 2 began operation
in 1973 and 1974, respectively, and are licensed to operate until 2013 and
2014, respectively. Pathfinder operated as a steam production peaking facility
from 1969 until its retirement.

A reconciliation of the
beginning and ending aggregate carrying amounts of NSP-Minnesota’s asset
retirement obligations is shown in the table below for the 12 months ended Dec.
31, 2004:

The fair value of
NSP-Minnesota assets legally restricted for purposes of settling the nuclear
asset retirement obligations is $986 million as of Dec. 31, 2004, including
external nuclear decommissioning investment funds and internally funded amounts.

Removal Costs

—

Xcel
Energy also accrues an obligation for plant removal costs for other generation,
transmission and distribution facilities of its utility subsidiaries.  Generally, the accrual of future non-legal
removal obligations is not required.  However, long-standing ratemaking practices
approved by applicable state and federal regulatory commissions have allowed
provisions for such costs in historical depreciation rates. These removal costs
have accumulated over a number of years based on varying rates as authorized by
the appropriate regulatory entities. Given the long periods over which the
amounts were accrued and the changing of rates through time, the utility
subsidiaries have estimated the amount of removal costs accumulated through
historic depreciation expense based on current factors used in the existing
depreciation rates.

Accordingly, the recorded
amounts of estimated future removal costs are considered Regulatory Liabilities
under SFAS No. 71. Removal costs by entity are as follows at Dec. 31:

18.     Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

Xcel Energy’s regulated
businesses prepare their Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 71, as discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Under SFAS No. 71, regulatory assets and liabilities can
be created for amounts that regulators may allow to be collected, or may
require to be paid back to customers in future electric and natural gas rates.
Any portion of Xcel Energy’s business that is not regulated cannot use SFAS No.
71 accounting. The components of unamortized regulatory assets and liabilities
of continuing operations shown on the balance sheet at Dec. 31 were:


(a)

Earns a return on investment in the ratemaking process. These amounts
are amortized consistent with recovery in rates.

(b)

These costs do not relate to NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear plants. They
relate to DOE assessments, as discussed previously in Note 17, and unamortized
costs for PSCo’s Fort St. Vrain nuclear plant decommissioning.

(c)

Excludes current portion expected to be returned to customers within 12
months of $12.4 million for 2004, and the 2003 current portion expected to be
recovered from customers of $3.1 million

(d)

Excludes current portion expected to be recovered within the next 12
months of $16.1 and $55.8 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively
