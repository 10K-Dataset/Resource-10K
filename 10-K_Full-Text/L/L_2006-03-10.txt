Carolina
            Group Tracking Stock - (Continued)

The
            Loews
            Group consists of all of our assets and liabilities other than the 45.03%
            economic interest in the Carolina Group represented by the outstanding
            Carolina
            Group stock, and includes as an asset the notional intergroup debt of
            the
            Carolina Group referred to above.

The
            creation of the Carolina Group and the issuance of Carolina Group stock
            does not
            change our ownership of Lorillard, Inc. or Lorillard, Inc.’s status as a
            separate legal entity. The Carolina Group and the Loews Group are notional
            groups that are intended to reflect the performance of the defined sets

            assets and liabilities of each

group.
            The Carolina Group and the Loews Group are not separate legal entities
            and the

attribution
            of our assets and liabilities to the Loews Group or the Carolina Group
            does not
            affect title to the assets or responsibility for the liabilities so attributed.

Each
            outstanding share of Carolina Group Stock has 1/10 of a vote per share.
            Holders
            of our common stock and of Carolina Group stock are shareholders of Loews
            Corporation and are subject to the risks related to an equity investment
            in
            us.

CNA
            FINANCIAL CORPORATION

CNA
            Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “CNA”) was incorporated
            in 1967 and is an insurance holding company. CNA’s property and casualty
            insurance operations are conducted by Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”),
            incorporated in 1897, and its affiliates, and The Continental Insurance
            Company
            (“CIC”), organized in 1853, and its affiliates. CIC became an affiliate of
            CNA
            in 1995 as a result of the acquisition of The Continental Corporation
            (“Continental”). Life and group insurance operations were either sold or are
            primarily being managed as a run-off operation. These operations are
            primarily
            conducted within CCC and Continental Assurance Company (“CAC”). We owned
            approximately 91% of the outstanding common stock and 100% of the Series
            H
            preferred stock of CNA as of December 31, 2005. CNA accounted for 61.59%,
            65.16%
            and 71.25% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December
            31,
            2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

CNA
            serves a wide variety of customers, including small, medium and large
            businesses, associations, professionals, and groups and individuals with
            a broad
            range of insurance and risk management products and services.

Insurance
            products primarily include property and casualty coverages. CNA services
            include
            risk management, information services, warranty and claims administration.
            CNA
            products and services are marketed through independent agents, brokers,
            managing
            general agents and direct sales.

In
            2005,
            CNA conducted its operations through four operating segments: Standard
            Lines,
            Specialty Lines, Life and Group Non-Core and Other Insurance. These segments
            are
            managed separately because of differences in their product lines and
            markets.

Standard
            Lines

Standard
            Lines works with an independent agency distribution system and network
            of
            brokers to market a broad range of property and casualty insurance products
            and
            services to small, middle-market and large businesses. The Standard Lines
            operating model focuses on underwriting performance, relationships with
            selected
            distribution sources and understanding customer needs.

Standard
            Lines includes Property, Casualty and CNA Global.

Property:

Property

            general and product liability and commercial auto coverage through traditional

            are
            small and middle-market businesses, with less than $1.0 million in annual
            insurance premiums. Most insurance programs are provided on a guaranteed
            cost
            basis; however, Casualty has the

capability
            to offer specialized, loss-sensitive insurance programs to those customers

            customer
            and program basis. Customers insured by E&S are generally viewed as higher
            risk and less predictable in exposure than those covered by standard
            insurance
            markets. E&S’s products are distributed throughout the United States through
            specialist producers, program agents and Property and Casualty’s (“P&C”)

            control expertise on the entire portfolio of products. The Centralized
            Processing Operation for small and middle-market customers, located in
            Maitland,
            Florida, handles policy processing and accounting, and also acts as a
            call
            center to optimize customer service. The claims field structure consists
            of 23
            locations organized into two zones, East and West. Also, Standard Lines,

            provides vehicle warranty service contracts that protect individuals
            and
            businesses from the financial burden associated with breakdown,
            under-performance or maintenance of a product.

Life
            and Group Non-Core

The
            Life
            and Group Non-Core segment primarily includes the results of the life
            and group
            lines of business that have either been sold or placed in run-off. CNA
            sold its
            group benefits business on December 31, 2003, its individual life business
            on
            April 30, 2004, its CNA Trust business on August 1, 2004 and its specialty
            medical business on January 6, 2005. The segment includes operating results
            for
            these businesses in periods prior to the sales, the realized gain/loss
            from the
            sales and the effects of the shared corporate overhead expenses which
            continue
            to be allocated to the sold businesses. CNA continues to service its
            existing
            individual long term care commitments, its payout annuity business and
            its
            pension deposit business. CNA also manages a block of group reinsurance
            and life
            settlement contracts. These businesses are being managed as a run-off
            operation.
            CNA’s group long term care and Index 500 products, while considered non-core,
            continue to be actively marketed.

Other
            Insurance

Other
            Insurance includes the results of certain property and casualty lines
            of
            business placed in run-off. CNA Re, formerly a separate property and
            casualty
            operating segment, is currently in run-off and is included in the Other
            Insurance segment. This segment also includes the results related to
            the
            centralized adjusting and settlement of asbestos and environmental pollution
            and
            mass tort (“APMT”) claims, as well as the results of CNA’s participation in
            voluntary insurance pools and various other non-insurance operations.
            Other
            operations also include interest expense on corporate borrowings and
            intercompany eliminations.

Please

            Results of Operations - Results of Operations by Business Segment - CNA
            Financial” for information with respect to each segment.

(a)

Trade
                      ratios reflect the results of CNA’s property and casualty insurance
                      subsidiaries. Trade ratios are industry measures of property
                      and casualty
                      underwriting results. The loss and loss adjustment expense
                      ratio is the
                      percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses
                      and the
                      expenses incurred related to uncollectible reinsurance receivables
                      to net
                      earned premiums. The primary difference in this ratio between
                      accounting
                      principles generally accepted in the United States of America
                      (“GAAP”) and
                      statutory accounting practices (“SAP”) is related to the treatment of
                      active life reserves (“ALR”) related to long term care insurance products
                      written in property and casualty insurance subsidiaries. For
                      GAAP, ALR is
                      classified as claim and claim adjustment expense reserves whereas
                      for SAP,
                      ALR is classified as unearned premium reserves. The expense
                      ratio, using
                      amounts determined in accordance with GAAP, is the percentage
                      of
                      underwriting and acquisition expenses (including the amortization
                      of
                      deferred acquisition expenses) to net earned premiums. The
                      expense ratio,
                      using amounts determined in accordance with SAP, is the percentage
                      of
                      acquisition and underwriting expenses (with no deferral of
                      acquisition
                      expenses) to net written premiums. The dividend ratio, using
                      amounts
                      determined in accordance with GAAP, is the ratio of dividends
                      incurred to
                      net earned premiums. The dividend ratio, using amounts determined
                      in
                      accordance with SAP, is the ratio of dividends paid to net
                      earned
                      premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss
                      adjustment
                      expense, expense and dividend
                      ratios.

(b)

The
                      decline in gross inforce is attributable to the sales of the
                      group
                      benefits and the individual life businesses. Please read Note
                      18 of the
                      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item
                      8 for
                      additional inforce information.

(c)

Other
                      data is determined in accordance with SAP. Life and group statutory
                      capital and surplus as a percent of total liabilities is determined
                      after
                      excluding separate account liabilities and reclassifying the
                      statutorily
                      required Asset Valuation Reserve to
                      surplus.

(d)

Surplus
                      includes the property and casualty companies’ equity ownership of the life
                      and group companies’ capital and
                      surplus.

                      premiums.

Approximately
            6.1%, 5.0% and 3.2% of CNA’s gross written premiums were derived from outside of
            the United States for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.
            Gross
            written premiums from the United Kingdom were approximately 2.8%, 2.3%,
            and 1.8%
            of CNA’s premiums for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Premiums
            from any individual foreign country excluding the United Kingdom were
            not
            significant.

Property
            and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expenses

The
            following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over
            time of
            reserves established for property and casualty claim and claim adjustment
            expenses at the end of the preceding ten calendar years for CNA’s property and
            casualty insurance operations. The table excludes the life subsidiaries,
            and as
            such, the carried reserves will not agree to the Consolidated Financial
            Statements included under Item 8. The first section shows the reserves
            as
            originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section,
            reading
            down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years
            with
            respect to the originally reported reserve liability. The third section,
            reading
            down, shows re-estimates of the originally recorded reserves as of the
            end of
            each successive year, which is the result of CNA’s property and casualty
            insurance subsidiaries’ expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances
            that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest
            re-estimated reserves to the

reserves
            originally established, and indicates whether the original reserves were
            adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled
            claims.

The
            loss
            reserve development table for property and casualty companies is cumulative
            and,
            therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the
            end of
            each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years.
            Additionally, the development amounts in the table below are the amounts
            prior
            to consideration of any related reinsurance bad debt allowance
            impacts.

Other

Competition:

The
            property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as
            to rate
            and service. CNA’s consolidated property and casualty subsidiaries compete not
            only with other stock insurance companies, but also with mutual insurance
            companies, reinsurance companies and other entities for both producers
            and
            customers. CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve
            its
            insurance products and services.

Rates
            among insurers vary according to the types of insurers and methods of
            operation.
            CNA competes for business not only on the basis of rate, but also on
            the basis
            of availability of coverage desired by customers, ratings and quality
            of
            service, including claim adjustment services.

There
            are
            approximately 2,400 individual companies that sell property and casualty
            insurance in the United States. CNA’s consolidated property and casualty
            subsidiaries ranked as the fourteenth largest property and casualty insurance
            organization and CNA is the seventh largest commercial insurance writer
            in the
            United States based upon 2004 statutory net written premiums.

Regulation:

The
            insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation
            and
            supervision throughout the United States. Each state has established
            supervisory
            agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers
            and
            agents, approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, fixing
            minimum interest rates for accumulation of surrender values and maximum
            interest
            rates of policy loans, prescribing the form and content of statutory
            financial
            reports and regulating solvency and the type and amount of investments
            permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations,
            which
            require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.
            In
            addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany
            transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by the
            state
            insurance regulators, depending on the size of such transfers and payments
            in
            relation to the financial position of the insurance affiliates making
            the
            transfer or payment.

Insurers
            are also required by the states to provide coverage to insureds who would
            not
            otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates
            the types
            of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such
            involuntary
            risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a
            function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance
            in
            each state.

Insurance
            companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance-related
            assessments. Guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments are
            levied by
            the state departments of insurance to cover claims of insolvent
            insurers.

Reform
            of
            the U.S. tort liability system is another issue facing the insurance
            industry.
            Over the last decade, many states have passed some type of reform. In
            recent
            years, for example, significant state general tort reforms have been
            enacted in
            Georgia, Ohio, Mississippi and South Carolina. Specific state legislation
            addressing state asbestos reform


Item
            1.
            Business

CNA
            Financial Corporation - (Continued)

has
            been
            passed in Ohio, Georgia, Florida, and Texas. Several more states will
            be
            considering such legislation in the coming year. Although these states’
legislatures have begun to address their litigious environments, some
            reforms
            are being challenged in the courts and it will take some time before
            they are
            finalized. Even though there has been some tort reform success, new causes
            of
            action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court
            actions or
            by legislatures. Continued unpredictability in the law means that insurance
            underwriting and rating is expected to continue to be difficult in commercial
            lines, professional liability and some specialty coverages.

Although
            the Federal Government and its regulatory agencies do not directly regulate
            the
            business of insurance, federal legislative and regulatory initiatives
            can impact
            the insurance industry in a variety of ways. These initiatives and legislation
            include tort reform proposals; proposals to establish a privately financed
            trust
            to process asbestos bodily injury claims; proposals to overhaul the Superfund
            hazardous waste removal and liability statutes; proposals to address
            terrorism
            risk and various tax proposals affecting insurance companies. In 1999,
            Congress
            passed the Financial Services Modernization or “Gramm-Leach-Bliley” Act (“GLB
            Act”), which repealed portions of the Glass-Steagall Act and enabled closer
            relationships between banks and insurers. Although “functional regulation” was
            preserved by the GLB Act for state oversight of insurance, additional
            financial
            services modernization legislation could include provisions for an alternate
            federal system of regulation for insurance companies.

CNA’s
            domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital requirements.
            Risk-based capital is a method developed by the National Association
            of
            Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) to determine the minimum amount of statutory
            capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business
            operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The formula
            for
            determining the risk-based capital requirements specifies various factors,
            weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied to
            certain
            financial balances and financial activity. The adequacy of a company

’

s
            actual capital
            is evaluated by a comparison to the risk-based capital requirements,
            as
            determined by the formula. Companies below minimum risk-based capital
            requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which determines
            a
            specified level of regulatory attention applicable to a company. As of
            December
            31, 2005 and 2004, all of CNA’s domestic insurance subsidiaries exceeded the
            minimum risk-based capital requirements.

Subsidiaries
            with insurance operations outside the United States are also subject
            to
            regulation in the countries in which they operate. CNA has operations
            in the
            United Kingdom, Canada and other countries.

Federal
            Regulation:

The
            Federal Comprehensive Smoking Education Act, which became effective in
            1985,
            requires that cigarette packaging and advertising display one of the
            following
            four warning statements, on a rotating basis:

(1)
            “SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease,
            Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy.”

(2)

            to Your Health.”

(3)

            Injury, Premature Birth, and Low Birth Weight.”

(4)
            “SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide.”

This
            law
            also requires that each person who manufactures, packages or imports
            cigarettes
            shall annually provide to the Secretary of Health and Human Services
            a list of
            the ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes. This
            list of
            ingredients may be submitted in a manner that does not identify the company
            that
            uses the ingredients or the brand of cigarettes that contain the
            ingredients.

In
            addition, bills have been introduced in Congress, including those that
            would:

·

prohibit
                      all tobacco advertising and
                      promotion;

·

require
                      new health warnings on cigarette packages and
                      advertising;

·

authorize
                      the establishment of various anti-smoking education
                      programs;

·

provide
                      that current federal law should not be construed to relieve
                      any person of
                      liability under common or state
                      law;

·

permit
                      state and local governments to restrict the sale and distribution
                      of
                      cigarettes;

·

direct
                      the placement of advertising of tobacco products;

·

provide
                      that cigarette advertising not be deductible as a business
                      expense;

·

prohibit
                      the mailing of unsolicited samples of cigarettes and otherwise
                      to restrict
                      the sale or distribution of cigarettes in retail stores, by
                      mail or over
                      the internet;

·

impose
                      an additional, or increase existing, excise taxes on
                      cigarettes;

·

require
                      that cigarettes be manufactured in a manner that will cause
                      them, under
                      certain circumstances, to be self-extinguishing;
                      and

·

subject
                      cigarettes to regulation in various ways by the U.S. Department
                      of Health
                      and Human Services or other regulatory
                      agencies.

In
            1996,
            the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) published regulations that would
            have extensively regulated the distribution, marketing and advertising
            of
            cigarettes, including the imposition of a wide range of labeling, reporting,
            record keeping, manufacturing and other requirements. Challenges to the
            FDA’s
            assertion of jurisdiction over cigarettes made by Lorillard and other
            manufacturers were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in March of 2000
            when that
            Court ruled that Congress did not give the FDA authority to regulate
            tobacco
            products under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

            Business

Lorillard,
            Inc. - (Continued)

Since the Supreme Court decision, various proposals and recommendations
            were
            made for additional federal and state legislation to regulate cigarette
            manufacturers. Congressional advocates of FDA regulation proposed legislation
            that would give the FDA regulatory authority over the manufacture, sale,
            distribution and labeling of tobacco products to protect public health.
            The
            legislation would allow the FDA to reinstate its prior regulations or
            adopt new
            or additional regulations.

In
            February of 2001, a committee of the Institute of Medicine, a private,
            non-profit organization which advises the federal government on medical
            issues,
            convened and issued a report recommending that Congress enact legislation.
            The
            committee suggested enabling a suitable agency to regulate tobacco-related
            products that purport to reduce exposure to tobacco toxicants or reduce
            risk of
            disease, and implement other policies designed to reduce the harm from
            tobacco
            use. The report recommended regulation of all tobacco products, including
            potentially reduced exposure products, known as PREPs.

In
            2002,
            certain public health groups petitioned the FDA to assert jurisdiction
            over
            several PREP type products that have been introduced into the marketplace.
            These
            groups assert that claims made by manufacturers of these products allow
            the FDA
            to regulate the manufacture, advertising and sale of these products as
            drugs or
            medical devices under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. The agency has
            received
            comments on these petitions but has taken no action.

In
            late
            2002 Philip Morris U.S.A., the largest U.S. manufacturer of cigarettes,
            filed a
            request for rulemaking petition with the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”)
            seeking changes in the existing FTC regulatory scheme for measuring and
            reporting tar and nicotine to the federal government and for inclusion
            in
            cigarette advertising. The agency procedures allow for interested parties
            to
            submit comments on this proposal. The agency has received comments on
            these
            petitions but has taken no action.

In
            1986,
            the Surgeon General of the United States and the National Academy of
            Sciences
            reported that environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) exposes nonsmokers to an
            increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory illness. In addition, in
            1993, the
            United States Environmental Protection Agency released a report (the
“EPA Risk
            Assessment”) concluding that ETS is a human lung carcinogen in adults, and
            causes respiratory effects in children. The EPA Risk Assessment has not
            been
            used as a basis for any regulatory action by the EPA. In May 2000, the
            Department of Health and Human Service’s National Toxicology Program listed ETS
            as “known to be a human carcinogen.” Various public health organizations have
            also issued statements on environmental tobacco smoke and its health
            effects.
            Many scientific papers on ETS have been published since the EPA Risk
            Assessment,
            with varying conclusions.

Lorillard
            cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proposals, reports and
            recommendations. If they are enacted, certain of these proposals could
            have a
            material adverse effect on Lorillard’s business and our financial position or
            results of operations in the future.

A
            federal
            law enacted in October 2004 repealed the federal supply management program
            for
            tobacco growers and compensated tobacco quota holders and growers with
            payments
            to be funded by an assessment on tobacco manufacturers and importers.
            Cigarette
            manufacturers and importers are responsible for paying 96.3% of a $10.14
            billion
            payment to tobacco quota holders and growers over a ten-year period.
            The law
            provides that payments will be based on shipments for domestic
            consumption.

State
            and Local Regulation:

In
            recent
            years, many state, local and municipal governments and agencies, as well
            as
            private businesses, have adopted legislation, regulations or policies
            which
            prohibit or restrict, or are intended to discourage, smoking, including
            legislation, regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking
            in
            various places such as public buildings and facilities, stores, restaurants
            and
            bars and on airline flights and in the workplace. This trend has increased
            significantly since the release of the EPA Risk Assessment.

In
            September of 1997, the California Environmental Protection Agency released
            a
            report (the “Cal/EPA Report”) concluding that ETS causes specified development,
            respiratory, carcinogenic and cardiovascular effects including lung and
            nasal
            sinus cancer, heart disease, sudden infant death syndrome, respiratory
            infections and asthma induction and exacerbation in children. The Cal/EPA
            Report
            was subsequently released as a monograph by the National Cancer Institute
            in
            November of 1999. On January 26, 2006 the California Air Resources Board


Item

            Business

Lorillard,
            Inc. - (Continued)

determined
            that ETS was a toxic air contaminant. Based on this determination, it
            could
            adopt measures to reduce or eliminate emissions, including further restrictions
            regarding venues where smoking is permitted, or controls on cigarette
            emissions.

Two
            states, Massachusetts and Texas, have enacted legislation requiring each
            manufacturer of cigarettes sold in those states to submit an annual report
            identifying for each brand sold certain “added constituents,” and providing
            nicotine yield ratings and other information for certain brands. Neither
            law
            allows for the public release of trade secret information.

A
            New
            York law requires cigarettes sold in that state to meet a mandated standard
            for
            ignition propensity. Such ignition propensity standards were established
            in 2003
            and became effective in June of 2004. Lorillard developed proprietary
            technology
            to comply with the standards and was compliant by the effective date.
            Since the
            passage of the New York law, the states of Vermont and California have
            passed
            similar laws utilizing the same technical standards, to become effective
            on May
            1, 2006 and June 1, 2007, respectively.

Other
            similar laws and regulations have been enacted or considered by other
            state and
            local governments. Lorillard cannot predict the impact which these regulations
            may have on Lorillard’s business, though if enacted, they could have a material
            adverse effect on Lorillard’s business and our financial position or results of
            operations in the future.

Excise
            Taxes:

Cigarettes
            are subject to substantial federal, state and local excise taxes in the
            United
            States and, in general, such taxes have been increasing. The federal
            excise tax
            on cigarettes is $19.50 per thousand cigarettes (or $0.39 per pack of
            cigarettes). State excise taxes, which are levied upon and paid by the
            distributors, are also in effect in the fifty states, the District of
            Columbia
            and many municipalities. Increases in state excise taxes on cigarette
            sales in
            2005 ranged from $0.10 per pack to $1.00 per pack in twelve states. The
            average
            state excise tax, including the District of Columbia, increased to $0.92
            per
            pack (of 20 cigarettes) in 2005 from $0.78 in 2004. Proposals for additional
            increases in federal, state and local excise taxes continue to be considered.
            The combined state and municipal taxes range from $0.07 to $3.00 per
            pack of
            cigarettes.

Advertising
            and Marketing:

Lorillard
            advertises its products to adult smokers in magazines, newspapers, direct
            mail
            and point-of-sale display materials. In addition, Lorillard promotes
            its
            cigarette brands to adult smokers through distribution of store coupons,
            retail
            price promotions, and personal contact with distributors and retailers.
            Although
            Lorillard’s sales are made primarily to wholesale distributors rather than
            retailers, Lorillard’s sales personnel monitor retail and wholesale inventories,
            work with retailers on displays and signs, and enter into promotional
            arrangements with retailers regularly.

Lorillard
            allocates its marketing expenditures among brands on the basis of marketplace
            opportunity and profitable return. In particular, Lorillard focuses its
            marketing efforts on the premium segment of the U.S. cigarette industry,
            with a
            specific focus on Newport.

Advertising
            of tobacco products through television and radio has been prohibited
            since 1971.
            In addition, on November 23, 1998, Lorillard and the three other largest
            major
            cigarette manufacturers entered into a Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”) with
            46 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
            and certain
            other U.S. territories to settle certain health care cost recovery and
            other
            claims. These manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought
            by the
            four remaining states which together with the MSA are generally referred
            to as
            the “State Settlement Agreements.” Under the State Settlement Agreements, the
            participating cigarette manufacturers agreed to severe restrictions on
            their
            advertising and promotion activities. Among other things, the MSA:

·

prohibits
                      the targeting of youth in the advertising, promotion or marketing
                      of
                      tobacco products;

·

bans
                      the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and
                      promotion;

·

limits
                      each tobacco manufacturer to one event sponsorship during any
                      twelve-month
                      period, which may not include major team sports or events in
                      which the
                      intended audience includes a significant percentage of
                      youth;

            Business

Lorillard,
            Inc. - (Continued)

·

bans
                      all outdoor advertising of tobacco products with the exception
                      of small
                      signs at retail establishments that sell tobacco
                      products;

·

bans
                      tobacco manufacturers from offering or selling apparel and
                      other
                      merchandise that bears a tobacco brand name, subject to specified
                      exceptions;

·

prohibits
                      the distribution of free samples of tobacco products except
                      within
                      adult-only facilities;

·

prohibits
                      payments for tobacco product placement in various media; and

·

bans
                      gift offers based on the purchase of tobacco products without
                      sufficient
                      proof that the intended gift recipient is an
                      adult.

Many
            states, cities and counties have enacted legislation or regulations further
            restricting tobacco advertising. There may be additional local, state
            and
            federal legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to the advertising
            and
            promotion of cigarettes in the future. Lorillard cannot predict the impact
            of
            such initiatives on its marketing and sales efforts.

Lorillard
            funds a Youth Smoking Prevention Program, which is designed to discourage
            youth
            from smoking by promoting parental involvement and assisting parents
            in
            discussing the issue of smoking with their children. Lorillard is also
            a
            founding and principal member of the Coalition for Responsible Tobacco
            Retailing
            which through its “We Card” program trains retailers in how to prevent the
            purchase of cigarettes by underage persons. In addition, Lorillard has
            adopted
            guidelines established by the National Association of Attorneys General
            to
            restrict advertising in magazines with large readership among people
            under the
            age of 18.

Distribution
            Methods:

Lorillard
            sells its products primarily to distributors, who in turn service retail
            outlets; chain store organizations; and government agencies, including
            the U.S.
            Armed Forces. Upon completion of the manufacturing process, Lorillard
            ships
            cigarettes to public distributing warehouse facilities for rapid order
            fulfillment to wholesalers and other direct buying customers. Lorillard
            retains
            a portion of its manufactured cigarettes at its Greensboro central distribution
            center and Greensboro cold-storage facility for future finished goods
            replenishment.

As
            of
            December 31, 2005, Lorillard had approximately 675 direct buying customers
            servicing more than 400,000 retail accounts. Lorillard does not sell
            cigarettes
            directly to consumers. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, sales made by Lorillard
            to
            McLane Company, Inc., comprised 21%, 20% and 20%, respectively, of Lorillard’s
            revenues. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of 2005, 2004
            or 2003
            sales. Lorillard does not have any backlog orders.

Most
            of
            Lorillard’s customers buy cigarettes on a next-day-delivery basis. Approximately
            90% of Lorillard’s customers purchase cigarettes using electronic funds
            transfer, which provides immediate payment to Lorillard.

Raw
            Materials and Manufacturing:

In
            its
            production of cigarettes, Lorillard uses domestic and foreign grown burley
            and
            flue-cured leaf tobaccos, as well as aromatic tobaccos grown primarily
            in Turkey
            and other Near Eastern countries. A domestic supplier manufactures all
            of
            Lorillard’s reconstituted tobacco.

Lorillard
            purchases more than 90% of its domestic leaf tobacco from Alliance One
            International, Inc. Lorillard directs Alliance One in the purchase of
            tobacco
            according to Lorillard’s specifications for quality, grade, yield, particle
            size, moisture content, and other characteristics. Alliance One purchases
            and
            processes the whole leaf and then dries and packages it for shipment
            to and
            storage at Lorillard’s Danville, Virginia facility. If Alliance One becomes
            unwilling or unable to supply leaf tobacco to Lorillard, Lorillard believes
            that
            it can readily obtain high-quality leaf tobacco from well-established,
            alternative industry sources.

Due
            to
            the varying size and quality of annual crops and other economic factors,

            prices have historically fluctuated. The passage of “The American Jobs Creation
            Act of 2004” (also known as the FSC-ETI bill ) on October 22, 2004 eliminated
            historical U.S. price supports that accompanied production controls which
            inflated the market

price
            of U.S. tobacco. Lorillard believes the
            elimination of production controls and price supports has favorably impacted
            the
            cost of U.S. tobacco.

Lorillard
            stores its tobacco in 29 storage warehouses on its 130-acre Danville
            facility.
            To protect against loss, amounts of all types and grades of tobacco are
            stored
            in separate warehouses. Because of the aging requirements for tobacco,
            Lorillard
            maintains large quantities of leaf tobacco at all times. Lorillard believes
            its
            current tobacco supplies are adequately balanced for its present production
            requirements. If necessary, Lorillard can purchase aged tobacco in the
            open
            market to supplement existing inventories.

Lorillard
            produces cigarettes at its Greensboro, North Carolina manufacturing plant,
            which
            has a production capacity of approximately 185 million cigarettes per
            day and
            approximately 43 billion cigarettes per year. Through various automated
            systems
            and sensors, Lorillard actively monitors all phases of production to
            promote
            quality and compliance with applicable regulations.

Prices:

Lorillard
            believes that the volume of U.S. cigarette sales is sensitive to price
            changes.
            Changes in pricing by Lorillard or other cigarette manufacturers could
            have an
            adverse impact on Lorillard’s volume of units sold and consequently on
            Lorillard’s profits and earnings. Lorillard makes independent pricing decisions
            based on a number of factors. Lorillard cannot predict the potential
            adverse
            impact of price changes on the following:

·

industry
                      volume or Lorillard volume,

·

the
                      mix between premium and discount
                      sales,

·

                      market share or

·

Lorillard’s
                      profits and earnings.

In
            addition, Lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers occasionally engage
            in
            significant promotional activities. These sales promotion costs are accounted
            for as a reduction in net sales revenue and therefore impact average
            prices.

Properties:

Lorillard’s
            manufacturing facility is located on approximately 80 acres in Greensboro,
            North
            Carolina. This 942,600 square-foot plant contains modern high-speed cigarette
            manufacturing machinery. The Greensboro facility also includes a warehouse
            with
            shipping and receiving areas totaling 54,800 square feet. In addition,
            Lorillard
            owns tobacco receiving and storage facilities totaling approximately
            1,400,000
            square feet in Danville, Virginia. Lorillard’s executive offices are located in
            a 130,000 square-foot, four-story office building in Greensboro. Its
            93,800
            square-foot research facility is also located in Greensboro.

Lorillard’s
            principal properties are owned in fee. With minor exceptions, Lorillard
            owns all
            of the machinery it uses. Lorillard believes that its properties and
            machinery
            are in generally good condition. Lorillard leases sales offices in major
            cities
            throughout the United States, a cold-storage facility in Greensboro and
            warehousing space in 21 public distributing warehouses located throughout
            the
            United States.

Competition:

The
            domestic U.S. market for cigarettes is highly competitive. Competition
            is
            primarily based on a brand’s price, including level of discounting and other
            promotional activities, positioning, consumer loyalty, retail display,
            quality
            and taste. Lorillard’s principal competitors are the two other major U.S.
            cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris (“PM”) and Reynolds American Inc.
            (“RAI”).

Lorillard
            believes its ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained
            by the
            Philip Morris Retail Leaders program and the combination of RJ Reynolds
            Tobacco
            Company (“RJR”) and Brown & Williamson (“B&W”) into RAI discussed below.
            The terms of Philip Morris’ merchandising contracts may effectively limit
            Lorillard from obtaining visible space in the retail store to effectively
            promote its brands. As a result, in a large number of retail locations,
            Lorillard either has a severely limited or no opportunity to competitively
            support its promotion programs which limits its sales potential.

BOARDWALK
            PIPELINE PARTNERS, LP

Boardwalk
            Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”) is engaged in the interstate
            transportation and storage of natural gas. Boardwalk Pipeline conducts
            all of
            its natural gas transportation and storage operations through two subsidiaries:
            Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (“Texas Gas”), acquired in May of 2003, and Gulf
            South Pipeline Company, LP (“Gulf South”), acquired in December of 2004.
            Boardwalk Pipeline accounted for 3.57 %, 1.74% and 0.87% of our consolidated
            total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
            respectively.

In
            November of 2005, Boardwalk Pipeline completed an initial public offering
            of
            15,000,000 common units at a price of $19.50 per unit, representing a
            14.5%
            limited partnership interest. In connection with the closing of this
            offering, a
            wholly owned subsidiary of ours contributed its ownership interest in
            Boardwalk
            Pipelines, LLC, together with certain of its liabilities, to Boardwalk
            Pipeline
            and received from Boardwalk Pipeline 53,256,122 common and 33,093,878
            subordinated units representing an aggregate 83.5% limited partner interest.
            In
            addition, another wholly owned subsidiary of ours, which is the general
            partner
            of Boardwalk Pipeline, received a 2% general partnership interest and
            all of
            Boardwalk Pipeline’s incentive distribution rights, which entitle the general
            partner to an increasing percentage of the cash that is distributed by
            Boardwalk
            Pipeline in excess of $0.4025 per unit per quarter.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline used the net proceeds of approximately $271.4 million to fund
            the
            repayment to us of its intercompany debt ($250.0 million) relating to
            the
            acquisition of Gulf South and to provide additional working
            capital.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline owns and operates two interstate natural gas pipeline systems,
            with
            approximately 13,470 miles of pipeline, directly serving customers in
            11 states
            and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern
            United States through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines.
            In
            2005, its pipeline systems transported approximately 1,350 billion cubic
            feet
            (“Bcf”) of gas. Average daily throughput on its pipeline systems during 2005
            was
            approximately 3.7 Bcf. Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas storage facilities are
            comprised of 11 underground storage fields located in four states with
            aggregate
            certificated working gas capacity of approximately 143.0 Bcf.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline transports and stores natural gas for a broad mix of customers,
            including local distribution companies (“LDC”s), municipalities, interstate and
            intrastate pipelines, direct industrial users, electric power generation
            plants,

Texas
            Gas System

Texas
            Gas’s pipeline system originates in the Louisiana Gulf Coast area and in
            East
            Texas and runs north and east through Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi,
            Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana and into Ohio, with smaller diameter lines
            extending into Illinois. This system is composed of:

·

approximately
                      5,900 miles of pipeline, having a peak-day delivery capacity
                      of
                      approximately 2.8 Bcf per day;

·

                      compressor stations having an aggregate of approximately 531,000
                      horsepower; and

                      natural gas storage fields located in Indiana and Kentucky,
                      having
                      aggregate storage capacity of approximately 178.0 Bcf of gas,
                      of which
                      approximately 63.0 Bcf is certificated as working
                      gas.

Texas
            Gas’s direct market area encompasses eight states in the southern and midwestern
            United States and includes the Memphis, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky;
            Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio; and Evansville and Indianapolis, Indiana
            metropolitan areas. Texas Gas also has indirect market access to the
            Northeast
            through interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines.

Texas
            Gas
            owns a majority of the gas in its storage fields which it uses to meet the
            operational balancing needs on its system, the requirements of its firm
            and
            interruptible storage customers and the requirements of its no-notice
            transportation service, which allows customers to temporarily draw from
            storage
            gas during the winter season to be repaid in-kind during the following
            summer
            season. Texas Gas offers “summer no-notice” transportation service, designed
            primarily to meet the needs of summer-season electrical power generation
            facilities. A large portion of the gas delivered by the Texas Gas’s system is
            used for space heating, resulting in substantially higher daily requirements
            during winter months.

Gulf
            South System

The
            Gulf
            South pipeline system is located in the Gulf Coast states of Texas, Louisiana,
            Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. This system is composed of:

·

approximately
                      7,570 miles of pipeline, having a peak-day delivery capacity
                      of
                      approximately 3.5 Bcf of gas;

·

                      compressor stations having an aggregate of approximately 223,000
                      horsepower; and

·

two
                      natural gas storage fields located in Louisiana and Mississippi,
                      having
                      aggregate storage capacity of approximately 129.0 Bcf of gas,
                      of which
                      approximately 80.0 Bcf is certificated as working
                      gas.

The
            markets directly served by the Gulf South system are generally located
            in
            eastern Texas, Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama and
            the Florida
            panhandle. These markets include the Baton Rouge—New Orleans industrial
            corridor; Lake Charles, Louisiana; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida.
            Gulf
            South also has indirect access to off-system markets through over 100
            interconnections with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage
            facilities. These pipeline interconnections provide access to major cities
            throughout the northeastern and southeastern United States.

In
            February of 2006, Gulf South entered into long-term agreements with customers
            providing firm commitments for capacity on its 1.0 Bcf per day pipeline
            expansion projects in East Texas and Mississippi. It expects the total
            cost for
            the 1.0 Bcf expansion to be approximately $575.0 million, and that the
            new
            capacity will be placed in-service during the second half of 2007. Gulf
            South
            may elect to further expand the pipeline capacity of these projects depending
            on
            the results of ongoing customer discussions. These projects are subject
            to FERC
            approvals. Gulf South will submit separate applications to FERC for authority
            to
            construct the East Texas and Mississippi expansion projects.

Gulf
            South’s Bistineau, Louisiana gas storage facility has approximately 77.0 Bcf
            of
            working gas storage capacity, with a maximum injection rate of 480.0
            million
            cubic feet (“MMcf”)/day and a maximum withdrawal rate of 870.0 MMcf/day. Gulf
            South currently sells firm and interruptible storage services at Bistineau
            under
            FERC approved market-based rates. Gulf South’s Jackson, Mississippi gas storage
            facility, has approximately 2.7 Bcf of working gas storage capacity with a
            maximum injection rate of 100.0 MMcf/day and a maximum withdrawal rate
            of 250.0
            MMcf/day. The Jackson gas storage facility is used for operational purposes
            and
            that capacity is not offered to the market.

Gulf
            South has leased a gas storage facility, which they refer to as the Magnolia
            facility, near Napoleonville, Louisiana, at which it has installed two
            compressor stations with a combined horsepower of 9,470 and other storage
            infrastructure and is currently developing a large, high-deliverability
            storage
            cavern that, when operational, will add up to approximately 5.0 Bcf of
            firm
            working gas storage capacity. Magnolia’s storage capacity is expected to be
            in

service
            and available for sale at market-based rates in late 2008 or early 2009,
            subject to the operational requirements of the lessor.

Gulf South has received FERC approval for an approximately 2.4 Bcf
            expansion of the working gas storage capacity at its Jackson storage
            facility,
            effective through October of 2006. Gulf South will seek permanent FERC
            approval
            of this expansion. Gulf South has also received FERC approval to drill two
            new horizontal storage wells at its Bistineau storage facility and is
            implementing a company-wide multi-year efficiency improvement plan, which
            may
            include well work-overs and rehabilitation, and is expected to increase
            efficiency and late season deliverability.

Seasonality:

Boardwalk
            Pipeline’s revenues are seasonal in nature and are affected by weather and
            natural gas price volatility. Weather impacts natural gas demand for
            power
            generation and heating purposes, which in turn influences the value of
            transportation and storage across its pipeline systems. Colder than normal
            winters or warmer than normal summers typically result in increased pipeline
            revenues. Natural gas prices are also volatile, which in turn influences
            drilling and production which can affect the value of Boardwalk Pipeline’s
            storage and parking and lending (“PAL”) services. Peak demand for natural gas
            occurs during the winter months, caused by the heating load. During 2005,
            approximately 57.7% of Boardwalk’s total operating revenues were realized in the
            first and fourth calendar quarters.

Regulation:

FERC
            regulates the natural gas pipeline operations of Boardwalk Pipeline’s
            subsidiaries under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) and the Natural Gas
            Policy Act of 1978. FERC regulates, among other things, the rates and
            charges
            for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce,
            the
            extension, enlargement or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities, and
            the
            financial accounting of certain regulated pipeline companies. Boardwalk
            Pipeline
            is also regulated by the United States Department of Transportation Office
            of Pipeline Safety under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as
            amended by Title I of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, which regulates
            safety
            requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of
            interstate natural gas pipelines.

Where
            required, Texas Gas and Gulf South hold certificates of public convenience
            and
            necessity issued by the FERC covering their facilities, activities and
            services.
            FERC has power to prescribe accounting treatment for items for regulatory
            purposes. The books and records of Texas Gas and Gulf South may be periodically
            audited by the FERC.

The
            maximum rates that may be charged by Texas Gas and Gulf South for their
            gas
            transportation and storage services are established through FERC ratemaking
            process. Key determinants in the ratemaking process are costs of providing
            service, allowed rate of return and volume throughput assumptions. The
            allowed
            rate of return must be approved by FERC in each rate case. Rate design
            and the
            allocation of costs between the demand and commodity rates also impact
            profitability. Texas Gas filed a new rate case with the FERC in 2005,
            and
            implemented new rates effective November 1, 2005, subject to refund.
            As of
            December 31, 2005, Texas Gas had recorded a refund liability of approximately

Competition:

Boardwalk Pipeline competes with numerous intrastate and interstate pipelines
            throughout its service territory to provide transportation and storage
            services
            for its customers. Competition is particularly strong in the states of
            Louisiana, Texas and Indiana, with the new Heartland Gas Pipeline currently
            being constructed in Indiana posing a competitive threat. The principal
            elements
            of competition among pipelines are rates, terms of service, access to
            supply,
            and flexibility and reliability of service. In addition, FERC’s continuing
            efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased
            the
            natural gas transportation options of Boardwalk Pipeline’s traditional
            customers. As a result, segmentation and capacity release have created
            an active
            secondary market which, increasingly, competes with its pipeline services,
            particularly on its Texas Gas system.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline’s business is, in part, dependent on the volumes of natural gas
            consumed in the United States. Natural gas competes with other forms
            of energy
            available to its customers, including electricity, coal and fuel oils.
            Boardwalk
            Pipeline’s competitors attempt to either attract new supply or attach new load
            to their pipelines, including those that are currently connected to markets
            served by Boardwalk Pipeline. As a result, Boardwalk Pipeline competes
            with
            these entities to maintain current business levels and to serve new demand
            and
            markets.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline and Texas Gas are headquartered in approximately 108,000 square
            feet of

            Gas.
            Gulf South is headquartered in approximately 55,000 square feet of leased
            office
            space located in Houston, Texas. Texas Gas and Gulf South own their respective
            pipeline systems in fee. A substantial portion of these systems is constructed

DIAMOND
            OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC.

Diamond
            Offshore Drilling Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”), is engaged, through its
            subsidiaries, in the business of owning and operating drilling rigs that
            are
            used in the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells on a contract basis
            for
            companies engaged in exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Diamond
            Offshore owns 44 offshore rigs. Diamond Offshore also has two premium
            jack-up
            rigs currently under construction. Diamond Offshore accounted for 8.07%,
            5.49%
            and 4.18% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December
            31,
            2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Diamond
            Offshore owns and operates 30 semisubmersible rigs. Semisubmersible rigs
            consist
            of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected
            to
            lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a “semi-submerged” position, remaining
            afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately
            feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well
            above the
            surface. Semisubmersible rigs are typically anchored in position and
            remain
            stable for drilling in the semi-submerged floating position due in part
            to their
            wave transparency characteristics at the water line. Semisubmersible
            rigs can
            also be held in position through the use of a computer controlled thruster
            (“dynamic-positioning”) system to maintain the rig’s position over a drillsite.
            Three semisubmersible rigs in Diamond Offshore’s fleet have this
            capability.

Diamond
            Offshore owns and operates nine high-specification semisubmersible rigs.
            These
            high specification semisubmersible rigs have high-capacity deck loads
            and are
            generally capable of working in water depths of 4,000 feet or greater
            or in
            harsh environments and have other advanced features, as compared to intermediate
            semisubmersible rigs. As of January 30, 2006, seven of the nine
            high-specification semisubmersible rigs were located in the U.S. Gulf
            of Mexico
            (“GOM”), while the remaining two high-specification semisubmersible rigs were
            located offshore Brazil and Malaysia, respectively.

Diamond
            Offshore owns and operates 21 intermediate semisubmersible rigs which
            generally
            work in maximum water depths up to 4,000 feet and many have diverse capabilities
            that enable them to provide both shallow and deep water service in the
            U.S. and
            in other markets outside the U.S. As of January 30, 2006, Diamond Offshore
            had
            19 intermediate semisubmersible rigs, including the recently reactivated

Ocean New Era

, drilling in various offshore locations around the world.
            Five of these intermediate semisubmersible rigs were located in the GOM;
            four
            were located offshore Mexico or in the Mexican GOM; four were located
            in the
            North Sea and two each were located offshore Australia; Brazil and Malaysia,
            respectively.

Diamond
            Offshore currently has two
            intermediate semisubmersible rigs scheduled for upgrades to ultra deep-water
            capability. When Diamond Offshore anticipates that a rig will be idle
            for an
            extended period of time, it cold

stacks
            the unit by removing the crew and ceasing to actively market the rig.
            This
            reduces expenditures associated with keeping the rig ready to go to work.
            In
            January 2006, Diamond Offshore announced that they would begin a major
            upgrade
            of the

Ocean Monarch

(formerly the

Enserch Garden Banks

) in
            mid-2006. This Victory-class, intermediate semisubmersible rig was acquired
            in
            August 2005 and is currently cold-stacked in the GOM, pending its mobilization
            to a shipyard in Singapore for its upgrade. The

Ocean Endeavor

is
            currently in a shipyard in Singapore for a similar upgrade.

Diamond
            Offshore owns and operates 13 jack-up drilling rigs. Jack-up rigs are
            mobile,
            self-elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that are lowered
            to the
            ocean floor until a foundation is established to support the drilling
            platform.
            The rig hull includes the drilling rig, jacking system, crew quarters,
            loading
            and unloading facilities, storage areas for bulk and liquid materials,
            heliport
            and other related equipment. Diamond Offshore’s jack-up rigs are used for
            drilling in water depths from 20 feet to 350 feet. The water depth limit
            of a
            particular rig is principally determined by the length of the rig’s legs. A
            jack-up rig is towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea,
            as a
            vessel, with its legs retracted. Once over a drillsite, the legs are
            lowered
            until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues until the hull is
            elevated
            above the surface of the water. After completion of drilling operations,
            the
            hull is lowered until it rests in the water and then the legs are retracted
            for
            relocation to another drillsite.

As
            of
            January 30, 2006, 11 of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up rigs were located in the GOM.
            Of these jack-up rigs, eight are independent-leg cantilevered units,
            two are
            mat-supported cantilevered units, and one is a mat-supported slot unit.
            Both of
            Diamond Offshore’s remaining jack-up rigs are internationally based and are
            independent-leg cantilevered rigs; one was located offshore Indonesia,
            and the
            other was located offshore Qatar as of January 30, 2006.

Diamond
            Offshore has one drillship, the

Ocean
            Clipper,

which
            was located offshore Brazil as of January 30, 2006. Drillships, which
            are
            typically self-propelled, are positioned over a drillsite through the
            use of
            either an anchoring system or a dynamic-positioning system similar to
            those used
            on certain semisubmersible rigs. Deep water drillships compete in many
            of the
            same markets as do high-specification semisubmersible rigs.

Markets:

The
            principal markets for Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling services are the
            following:

·

the
                      Gulf of Mexico, including the United States and
                      Mexico;

·

Europe,
                      principally in the U.K and Norway; and Africa and
                      Egypt

·

South
                      America, principally in Brazil

·

Australia,
                      Asia and Middle East, including, Malaysia, Indonesia and
                      Qatar

Diamond
            Offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide. From time to time Diamond
            Offshore’s fleet operates in various other markets throughout the world as the
            market demands.

Diamond
            Offshore believes its presence in multiple markets is valuable in many
            respects.
            For example, Diamond Offshore believes that its experience with safety
            and other
            regulatory matters in the U.K. has been beneficial in Australia and in
            the Gulf
            of Mexico, while production experience gained through Brazilian and North
            Sea
            operations has potential application worldwide. Additionally, Diamond
            Offshore
            believes its performance for a customer in one market segment or area
            enables it
            to better understand that customer’s needs and better serve that customer in
            different market segments or other geographic locations.

Diamond
            Offshore’s contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms
            and provisions. Diamond Offshore often obtains its contracts through
            competitive
            bidding, although it is not unusual for Diamond Offshore to be awarded
            drilling
            contracts without competitive bidding. Drilling contracts generally provide
            for
            a basic drilling rate on a fixed dayrate basis regardless of whether
            or not such
            drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts may also provide
            for
            lower rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling
            operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse
            weather conditions or other conditions beyond the control of Diamond
            Offshore.
            Under dayrate contracts, Diamond Offshore generally pays the operating
            expenses
            of the rig, including wages and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically,
            dayrate contracts have accounted for a


Item
            1.
            Business

Diamond
            Offshore Drilling, Inc. - (Continued)

substantial
            portion of Diamond Offshore’s revenues. In addition, from time to time, Diamond
            Offshore dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an
            incentive
            bonus from its customers based upon performance.

A
            dayrate
            drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either
            the
            drilling of a single well or a group of wells, which Diamond Offshore
            refers to
            as a well-to-well contract, or a stated term, which Diamond Offshore
            refers to
            as a term contract, and may be terminated by the customer in the event
            the
            drilling unit is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended
            for a
            period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases,
            due to
            other events beyond the control of either party to the contract. In addition,
            certain of Diamond Offshore’s contracts permit the customer to terminate the
            contract early by giving notice, and in some circumstances may require
            the
            payment of an early termination fee by the customer. The contract term
            in many
            instances may also be extended by the customer exercising options for
            the
            drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time generally
            at
            competitive market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the time of
            the
            extension.

The
            duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by market
            demand
            and the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractor
            and
            its customers. In periods of rising demand for offshore rigs, contractors
            typically prefer well-to-well contracts that allow contractors to profit
            from
            increasing dayrates. In contrast, during these periods customers with
            reasonably
            definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to
            maintain
            dayrate prices at a consistent level. Conversely, in periods of decreasing
            demand for offshore rigs, contractors generally prefer longer term contracts
            to
            preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers
            prefer well-to-well contracts that allow them to obtain the benefit of
            lower
            dayrates.

Customers:

Diamond
            Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that
            includes
            major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil
            companies.
            Several customers have accounted for 10.0% or more of Diamond Offshore’s annual
            consolidated revenues, although the specific customers may vary from
            year to
            year. During 2005, Diamond Offshore performed services for 53 different
            customers with Petróleo Brasileiro S. A. (“Petrobras”) and Kerr McGee Oil and
            Gas Corporation, accounting for 10.7% and 10.3% of Diamond Offshore’s annual
            total consolidated revenues, respectively. During 2004, Diamond Offshore
            performed services for 53 different customers with Petrobras and
            PEMEX-Exploracion Y Produccion, or PEMEX, accounting for 12.6% and 10.5%
            of
            Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues, respectively. During
            2003, Diamond Offshore performed services for 52 different customers
            with
            Petrobras and BP P.L.C. (“BP”), accounting for 20.3% and 11.9% of Diamond
            Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues, respectively. During periods of
            low demand for offshore drilling rigs, the loss of a single significant
            customer
            could have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s results of
            operations.

Competition

:

The
            offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive and is influenced
            by a
            number of factors, including current and anticipated prices of oil and
            natural
            gas, expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development
            of
            oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs.

Governmental
            Regulation

:
            Diamond
            Offshore’s operations are subject to numerous international, U.S., state and
            local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to Diamond
            Offshore’s operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of
            materials into the environment, requiring removal and clean-up under
            some
            circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.

Operations
            Outside the United States

:
            Diamond
            Offshore’s operations outside the United States accounted for approximately
            45.0%, 56.0% and 52.0% of Diamond Offshore’s total consolidated revenues for the
            years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

                      land leased by the

joint
                      venture from the

            maturing

certain
            hotels are held under leases which are subject to formula derived rental
            increases, with rentals aggregating approximately $6.4 million for the
            year
            ended December 31, 2005.

Competition
            from other hotels and lodging facilities is vigorous in all areas in
            which Loews
            Hotels operates. The demand for hotel rooms in many areas is seasonal
            and
            dependent on general and local economic conditions. Loews Hotels properties
            also
            compete with facilities offering similar services in locations other
            than those
            in which its hotels are located. Competition among luxury hotels is based
            primarily on location and service. Competition among resort and commercial
            hotels is based on price as well as location and service. Because of
            the
            competitive nature of the industry, hotels must continually make expenditures
            for updating, refurnishing and repairs and maintenance, in order to prevent
            competitive obsolescence.

            1.16%
            and 1.01% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December

Item
            1A.  RISK FACTORS.

Our
            business faces many risks. We have described below some of the more significant
            risks which we and our subsidiaries face. There may be additional risks
            that we
            do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant
            that
            may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries.

Each
            of
            the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or
            circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business, results
            of
            operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity and/or the business,
            results of operations, financial condition or equity of one or more of
            our
            subsidiaries. In addition, the risks and uncertainties described below
            relating
            to our Carolina Group stock and our Lorillard subsidiary could lead to
            a
            material loss in the value of the Carolina Group stock.

You
            should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included
            in this
            Report and any subsequent reports we may file with the Securities and
            Exchange
            Commission or make available to the public before investing in any securities
            issued by us. Our subsidiaries, CNA Financial Corporation, Diamond Offshore
            Drilling, Inc. and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, are public companies
            and
            file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You are also
            cautioned
            to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports
            filed
            by those subsidiaries before investing in any of their securities.

We
            are a holding company and derive substantially all of our cash flow from
            our
            subsidiaries.

We
            rely
            upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries
            to
            generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and
            pay any
            dividends to holders of our common stock and Carolina Group stock. Our
            subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no
            obligation,
            contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the
            form of
            loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay
            dividends
            to us is also subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient
            funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case
            of the
            insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of
            dividends
            by regulated insurance companies. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries
            will
            generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our
            claims and our creditors and shareholders.

We
            have restated our financial results for prior years and identified material
            weaknesses in our internal control over financial
            reporting.

In
            February of 2006 we determined that we would restate our annual financial
            statements for the years 2001 through 2004, as well as our interim financial
            statements through September 30, 2005, to correct the accounting for
            discontinued operations acquired by CNA in its merger with The Continental
            Corporation in 1995. In addition, in March of 2006, we determined to
            restate our
            financial results for prior years to correct classification errors within
            our
            Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

As
            a
            result of these restatements, we identified material weaknesses in our
            internal
            control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 and determined
            that our
            prior year financial statements could not be relied upon. We also determined
            that our internal control over financial reporting as of such dates was
            not
            effective. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is
            a process
            designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management, Audit Committee
            and
            Board of Directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting
            and the
            preparation and fair presentation of our published financial statements.
            If we
            fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting,
            we could
            be scrutinized by regulators, securities analysts, and investors and
            suffer a
            loss of public


Item
            1A.
            Risk Factors

confidence
            in our financial reporting capabilities,
            which could have an adverse effect on our business and the market price
            of our
            securities.

Risks
            Related to an Investment In Our Carolina Group Stock

We
            cannot be certain that we will continue to pay dividends on our Carolina
            Group
            stock.

Determinations
            as to the future dividends on Carolina Group stock primarily will depend
            on the
            dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries, our capital requirements and
            other
            factors that our board of directors considers relevant. The amount of
            dividends
            that legally could be paid on Carolina Group stock if the Carolina Group
            were a
            separate Delaware corporation may be greater than the amount actually
            available
            for the payment of dividends under Delaware law and our charter. Furthermore,
            our ability to pay dividends on Carolina Group stock may be reduced by
            dividends
            that we pay on our common stock.

Our
            board
            of directors reserves the right to declare and pay dividends on Carolina
            Group
            stock, and could, in its sole discretion, declare and pay dividends,
            or refrain
            from declaring and paying dividends, on Carolina Group stock. Our board
            of
            directors may take such actions regardless of the amounts available for
            the
            payment of dividends on Carolina Group stock, the amount of prior dividends
            declared on Carolina Group stock, the voting or liquidation rights of
            Carolina
            Group stock, or any other factor.

The
            independence of the board of directors of Lorillard, Inc. and the board
            of
            directors of its wholly owned subsidiary, Lorillard Tobacco Company,
            may affect
            Lorillard’s payment of dividends to us and thereby inhibit our ability or
            willingness to pay dividends and make other distributions on our Carolina
            Group
            stock.

Our
            ability and willingness to pay dividends and make other distributions
            on
            Carolina Group stock, including dividends and distributions following
            a
            disposition of substantially all of the assets attributed to the Carolina
            Group,
            will depend on a number of factors, including whether the independent
            board of
            directors of Lorillard Tobacco Company causes Lorillard Tobacco Company
            to
            declare and pay dividends to its parent, Lorillard, Inc. and whether,
            in turn,
            the independent board of directors of Lorillard, Inc. causes Lorillard,
            Inc. to
            declare and pay dividends to us. In the event that Lorillard Tobacco
            Company or
            Lorillard, Inc. does not distribute its earnings, we are unlikely to
            pay
            dividends on Carolina Group stock. To the extent Lorillard, Inc. does
            not
            distribute net proceeds following the sale of substantially all of the
            assets
            attributed to the Carolina Group, we will not be required to apply the
            net
            proceeds to pay dividends to holders of Carolina Group stock or redeem
            shares of
            Carolina Group stock.

We
            expect
            that the boards of directors of each of Lorillard, Inc. and Lorillard
            Tobacco
            Company will continue to function independently of us and will direct
            the
            operations and management of the assets and businesses of those corporations,
            respectively. None of the individuals currently serving as directors
            of
            Lorillard, Inc. or Lorillard Tobacco Company are officers, directors
            or
            employees of Loews Corporation. Notwithstanding our right, as sole shareholder,
            to elect and remove directors of Lorillard, Inc., we have no present
            intention
            to remove any person currently serving as a director of Lorillard, Inc.
            Moreover, we expect that in the event of any future vacancies on the
            board of
            directors of Lorillard, Inc., we will nominate individuals who are not
            officers,
            directors or employees of Loews Corporation to fill such vacancies.

We
            have allocated to the Carolina Group any liabilities or expenses that
            we incur
            as a result of tobacco-related litigation.

The
            Carolina Group has been allocated any and all liabilities, costs and
            expenses of
            us and Lorillard, Inc. and the subsidiaries and predecessors of Lorillard,
            Inc.,
            arising out of or related to tobacco or otherwise arising out of the
            past,
            present or future business of Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries or
            predecessors, or claims arising out of or related to the sale of any
            businesses
            previously sold by Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries or predecessors,
            in each
            case, whether grounded in tort, contract, statute or otherwise, whether
            pending
            or asserted in the future.

Accordingly,
            we and/or Lorillard may make decisions with respect to litigation and
            settlement
            strategies designed to obtain our dismissal or release from tobacco-related
            litigation or liabilities. Such decisions and strategies could result,
            for
            example, in limitations on payment of dividends by Lorillard to us or
            an
            increase in Lorillard’s exposure in such litigation.


Item
            1A.
            Risk Factors

The
            Engle Agreement may affect Lorillard’s payment of dividends to us and thereby
            inhibit our ability or willingness to pay dividends on our Carolina Group
            stock.

Under
            the

Engle

Agreement if Lorillard, Inc. does not maintain a balance sheet net worth
            of at
            least $921.2 million, the stay pursuant to the agreement would terminate.
            Because dividends from Lorillard, Inc. to us are deducted from the balance
            sheet
            net worth of Lorillard, Inc., the

Engle

Agreement may affect the payment of dividends by Lorillard, Inc. to us.
            For a
            description of the

Engle

Agreement, please read MD&A under Item 7 and Note 20 of the Notes to
            Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

Holders
            of our common stock and Carolina Group stock are shareholders of one
            company
            and, therefore, financial impacts on one group could affect the other
            group.

Holders
            of our common stock and holders of Carolina Group stock are all common
            shareholders of Loews Corporation and are subject to risks associated
            with an
            investment in a single company. Financial effects arising from one group
            that
            affect our consolidated results of operations or financial condition
            could, if
            significant, affect the market price of the class of common shares relating
            to
            the other group. In addition, if we or any of our subsidiaries were to
            incur
            significant indebtedness on behalf of one group, including indebtedness
            incurred
            or assumed in connection with an acquisition or investment, it could
            affect the
            credit rating of us and our subsidiaries taken as a whole. This, in turn,
            could
            increase our borrowing costs. Net losses of either group and dividends
            or
            distributions on shares of any class of common or preferred stock will
            reduce
            the funds legally available for payment of future dividends on Carolina
            Group
            stock.

The
            complex nature of the terms of our Carolina Group stock, or confusion
            in the
            marketplace about what a tracking stock is, could materially adversely
            affect
            the market price of Carolina Group stock.

Tracking
            stocks like Carolina Group stock are more complex than traditional common
            stock
            and are not directly or entirely comparable to common stock of stand-alone
            companies or companies that have been spun off by their parent companies.
            The
            complex nature of the terms of Carolina Group stock, and the potential
            difficulties investors may have in understanding these terms, may materially
            adversely affect the market price of Carolina Group stock. Examples of
            these
            terms include:

·

the
                      discretion of our board of directors to make determinations
                      that may
                      affect Carolina Group stock and our common stock differently;

·

our
                      redemption and/or exchange rights under particular circumstances;
                      and

·

the
                      disparate voting rights of Carolina Group stock and our common
                      stock.

Confusion
            in the marketplace about what a tracking stock is and what it is intended
            to
            represent, and/or investors’ reluctance to invest in tracking stocks, could
            materially adversely affect the market price of Carolina Group stock.

Holders
            of our common stock and Carolina Group stock generally vote together
            as a single
            class.

Holders
            of Carolina Group stock generally do not have the right to vote separately
            as a
            class. Holders of Carolina Group stock have the right to vote as a separate
            class only to the extent required by Delaware law. We have not held,
            and do not
            plan to hold, separate meetings for holders of Carolina Group stock.

Holders
            of our common stock will have significantly greater voting power than
            holders of
            our Carolina Group stock with respect to any matter as to which all of
            our
            common shares vote together as one class.

Each
            share of our common stock has one vote. Each share of Carolina Group
            stock is
            entitled to 1/10 of a vote, which is disproportionately less than the
            economic
            interest represented by each share of Carolina Group stock. When a vote
            is taken
            on any matter as to which all of our common shares are voting together
            as one
            class, holders of our common stock will have significantly greater voting
            power
            than holders of Carolina Group stock. As of February 17, holders of our
            common
            stock controlled approximately 96.0% of our combined voting power and


Item
            1A.
            Risk Factors

holders
            of Carolina Group stock controlled approximately 4.0% of our combined
            voting
            power. The voting power of Carolina Group stock is subject to adjustment
            for
            stock splits, stock dividends and combinations with respect to either
            class of
            stock.

Holders
            of our Carolina Group stock may have interests different from holders
            of our
            common stock.

The
            existence of separate classes of our common stock could give rise to
            occasions
            when the interests of the holders of our common stock and Carolina Group
            stock
            diverge or conflict or appear to diverge or conflict. Subject to its
            fiduciary
            duties, our board of directors could, in its sole discretion, from time
            to time,
            make determinations or implement policies that disproportionately affect
            the
            groups or the different classes of stock. Our board of directors is not
            required
            to select the option that would result in the highest value for the holders
            of
            Carolina Group stock. Examples include determinations by our board of
            directors
            to:

·

pay
                      or omit the payment of dividends on our common stock or Carolina
                      Group
                      stock;

·

redeem
                      shares of Carolina Group stock;

·

approve
                      dispositions of our assets attributed to either
                      group;

·

reallocate
                      funds or assets between groups and determine the amount and
                      type of
                      consideration paid therefore;

·

allocate
                      business opportunities, resources and personnel;

·

allocate
                      the proceeds of issuances of Carolina Group stock either to
                      the Loews
                      Group, with a corresponding reduction in the intergroup interest,
                      if and
                      to the extent there is an intergroup interest, or to the combined
                      attributed net assets of the Carolina
                      Group;

·

formulate
                      public policy positions for us;

·

establish
                      relationships between the groups;

·

make
                      financial decisions with respect to one group that could be
                      considered to
                      be detrimental to the other group;
                      and

·

settle
                      or otherwise seek to resolve actual or potential litigation
                      against us in
                      ways that might adversely affect Lorillard.

Any
            such
            decisions by our board of directors could have or be perceived to have
            a
            negative effect on the Carolina Group and could have a negative effect
            on the
            market price of Carolina Group stock.

If
            our Carolina Group stock is not treated as a class of our common stock,
            several
            adverse federal income tax consequences will result.

It
            is
            possible that the issuance of Carolina Group stock could be characterized
            as
            property other than our stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such
            characterization could require us to recognize taxable gain with respect
            to the
            issuance of Carolina Group stock and the Carolina Group would be responsible
            for
            any tax liability attributable thereto. In addition, we would likely
            no longer
            be able to file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with the
            Carolina
            Group. These tax liabilities, if they arise, would likely have a material
            adverse effect on us and the Carolina Group.

Changes
            in the tax law or in the interpretation of current tax law may result
            in
            redemption of the Carolina Group stock or cessation of the issuance of
            shares of
            Carolina Group stock.

If
            there
            are adverse tax consequences to us or the Carolina Group resulting from
            the
            issuance of Carolina Group stock, it is possible that we would not issue
            shares
            of Carolina Group stock even if we would otherwise choose to do

            Risk Factors

so.
            This
            possibility could affect the value of Carolina Group stock then outstanding.
            Furthermore, we are entitled to redeem Carolina Group stock for either
            (1) cash in an amount equal to 105% of the average market price per share
            of Carolina Group stock or (2) our common stock having a value equal to
            100% of the ratio of the average market price per share of Carolina Group
            stock
            to the average market price per share of our common stock, if, based
            upon the
            opinion of tax counsel, there are adverse federal income tax law developments
            related to Carolina Group stock. In each case, the average market price
            would be
            determined over a specified 20 trading day period.

Our
            board of directors may, at any time until the 90th day after the disposition
            of
            80% of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, redeem shares of
            our
            Carolina Group stock.

Our
            board
            of directors may, at any time until the 90th day after the disposition
            of 80% of
            the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, redeem all outstanding shares
            of
            Carolina Group stock for either (1) cash in an amount equal to 120% of the
            average market price per share of Carolina Group stock or (2) our common
            stock having a value equal to 115% of the ratio of the average market
            price per
            share of Carolina Group stock to the average market price per share of
            our
            common stock. In each case, the average market price would be determined
            over a
            specific 20 trading day period. A decision to redeem the Carolina Group
            stock
            could be made at a time when either or both of our common stock and Carolina
            Group stock may be considered to be overvalued or undervalued. In addition,
            a
            redemption would preclude holders of Carolina Group stock from retaining
            their
            investment in a security intended to reflect separately the economic
            performance
            of the Carolina Group. It would also give holders of shares of converted
            Carolina Group stock an amount of consideration that may be less than
            the amount
            of consideration a third-party buyer pays or would pay for all or substantially
            all of the net assets attributed to the Carolina Group.

If
            we choose to redeem our Carolina Group stock for cash, holders of Carolina
            Group
            stock may have taxable gain or taxable income.

We
            may,
            under certain circumstances, redeem Carolina Group stock for cash. If
            we choose
            to do so, holders of Carolina Group stock would generally be subject
            to tax on
            the excess, if any, of the total consideration they receive for their
            Carolina
            Group stock over their adjusted basis in their Carolina Group stock.

Our
            board of directors does not owe a separate duty to holders of Carolina
            Group
            stock.

Principles
            of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of
            two
            classes of capital stock or two groups of holders of the same class of
            capital
            stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all shareholders
            regardless of class or series, and does not have separate or additional
            duties
            to either group of shareholders. Thus, holders of Carolina Group stock
            who
            believe that a determination by our board of directors has a disparate
            impact on
            their class of stock may not be able to obtain a remedy for such a claim.

Our
            board of directors may change the Carolina Group policy statement without
            shareholder approval.

In
            connection with the initial issuance of Carolina Group stock, our board
            of
            directors adopted the Carolina Group policy statement to govern the relationship
            between the Loews Group and the Carolina Group. Our board of directors
            may
            modify, suspend or rescind the policies set forth in the Carolina Group
            policy
            statement or make additions or exceptions to them, in the sole discretion
            of our
            board of directors, without approval of our shareholders. Our board of
            directors
            may also adopt additional policies, depending upon the circumstances.
            Any
            changes to our policies could have a negative effect on the holders of
            Carolina
            Group stock.

Our
            directors’ and officers’ disproportionate ownership of our common stock compared
            to our Carolina Group stock may give rise to conflicts of interest.

Our
            directors and officers own shares of our common stock and have been awarded
            stock options with respect to shares of our common stock. As of February
            17,
            2006 our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately
            7.7
            million shares of our common stock and no shares of Carolina Group stock,
            which
            represents approximately 4.0% of our combined voting power. Accordingly,
            our
            directors and officers could have an economic incentive to favor the
            Loews Group
            over the Carolina Group.


Item
            1A.
            Risk Factors

Because
            it is possible for an acquiror to obtain control of us by purchasing
            shares of
            our common stock without purchasing any shares of our Carolina Group
            stock,
            holders of Carolina Group stock may not share in any takeover premium.

Because
            holders of our common stock have significantly greater voting power than
            holders
            of Carolina Group stock, a potential acquiror could acquire control of
            us by
            acquiring shares of our common stock without purchasing any shares of
            Carolina
            Group stock. As a result, holders of Carolina Group stock might not share
            in any
            takeover premium and Carolina Group stock may have a lower market price
            than it
            would have if there were a greater likelihood that holders of Carolina
            Group
            stock would share in any takeover premium.

Holders
            of our Carolina Group stock may receive less consideration upon a sale
            of the
            assets attributed to the Carolina Group than if the Carolina Group were
            a
            separate company.

Assuming
            the assets attributed to the Carolina Group represent less than substantially
            all of our assets as a whole, our board of directors could, in its sole
            discretion and without shareholder approval, approve sales and other
            dispositions of any amount of our assets attributed to the Carolina Group
            because the Delaware General Corporation Law requires shareholder approval
            only
            for a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
            of the
            entire company. Similarly, the boards of directors of Lorillard, Inc.
            or its
            subsidiaries could decide to sell or otherwise dispose of the operating
            and
            other assets reflected in the financial statements of the Carolina Group
            without
            the approval of holders of Carolina Group stock.

If
            80% or
            more of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group are sold, we may
            take one of
            the following actions, and if we receive any net proceeds from the sale
            and
            determine not to retain all of such proceeds as tobacco contingency reserves,
            we
            must take one of the following actions:

·

pay
                      a special dividend to holders of Carolina Group stock in an
                      amount equal
                      to their pro rata share of the net proceeds (subject to reduction
                      for
                      repayment of notional debt, amounts not distributed from Lorillard
                      to us
                      and the creation by us of reserves for tobacco-related contingent
                      liabilities and future costs) from the disposition in the form
                      of cash
                      and/or securities (other than our common
                      stock);

·

redeem
                      shares of Carolina Group stock for cash and/or securities (other
                      than our
                      common stock) in an amount equal to the pro rata share of the
                      net proceeds
                      (subject to reduction for repayment of notional debt) from
                      the disposition
                      of all of the assets attributable to the Carolina
                      Group;

·

redeem
                      shares of Carolina Group stock for shares of our common stock
                      at a 15%
                      premium based on the respective market values of Carolina Group
                      stock and
                      our common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days ending
                      on the 5th
                      trading day prior to announcement of the sale; or

·

take
                      some combination of the actions described
                      above.

Our
            board
            of directors has the discretion to choose from the foregoing options.
            The value
            of the consideration paid to holders of Carolina Group stock in the different
            scenarios described above could be significantly different. Our board
            of
            directors would not be required to select the option that would result
            in the
            distribution with the highest value to the holders of Carolina Group
            stock.

If,
            on
            the 91st day following the sale of 80% or more of the assets attributed
            to the
            Carolina Group, we have not redeemed all of the outstanding shares of
            Carolina
            Group stock and Lorillard subsequently distributes to us any previously
            undistributed portion of the net proceeds and/or we subsequently release
            any
            amount of net proceeds previously retained by us as a reserve for
            tobacco-related contingent liabilities or future costs, we will distribute
            the
            pro rata share of such amounts to holders of Carolina Group stock. At
            any time
            after:

·

Lorillard
                      has distributed to us all previously undistributed portions
                      of the net
                      proceeds;

·

no
                      amounts remain in reserve in respect of tobacco-related contingent
                      liabilities and future costs; and

·

the
                      only asset remaining in the Carolina Group is cash and/or cash
                      equivalents,


Item
            1A.
            Risk Factors

then
            we
            may redeem all of the outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock for
            cash in an
            amount equal to the greater of (1) the pro rata share of the remaining
            assets of
            the Carolina Group and (2) $0.001 per share of Carolina Group stock.

If
            the
            Carolina Group were a separate, independent company and its shares were
            acquired
            by another person, some of the costs of that sale, including corporate
            level
            taxes, might not be payable in connection with that acquisition. As a
            result,
            shareholders of a separate, independent company might receive an amount
            greater
            than the net proceeds that would be received by the holders of Carolina
            Group
            stock. In addition, we cannot assure that the net proceeds per share
            of Carolina
            Group stock received by its holder in connection with any redemption
            following a
            sale of Carolina Group assets will be equal to or greater than the market
            value
            per share of Carolina Group stock prior to or after announcement of a
            sale of
            assets reflected in the Carolina Group. Nor can we assure that, where
            consideration is based on the market value of Carolina Group stock, the
            market
            value will be equal to or greater than the net proceeds per share of
            Carolina
            Group stock.

We
            may cause a mandatory exchange of our Carolina Group stock.

We
            may
            exchange all outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock for shares of
            one or
            more of our qualifying subsidiaries. Such an exchange would result in
            the
            qualifying subsidiary or subsidiaries becoming a separate public company
            and the
            holders of Carolina Group stock owning shares directly in that subsidiary
            or
            those subsidiaries. If we choose to exchange shares of Carolina Group
            stock in
            this manner, the market value of the common stock received in that exchange
            could be less than the market value of Carolina Group stock exchanged.

Future
            sales of our Carolina Group stock and our common stock could adversely
            affect
            the market price of Carolina Group stock and our ability to raise capital
            in the
            future.

Future
            sales of substantial amounts of Carolina Group stock or our common stock
            in the
            public market could depress the market price of Carolina Group stock.
            Such sales
            could also impair our ability to raise capital in the future. All of
            the
            approximately 78.2 million shares of Carolina Group stock that we have
            previously issued are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities
            Act of 1933, as amended, by persons other than our “affiliates,” as defined
            under the Securities Act. Any sales of substantial amounts of Carolina
            Group
            stock or our common stock in the public market, or the perception that
            such
            sales might occur, could materially adversely affect the market price
            of
            Carolina Group stock. Our board of directors has not and does not plan
            to
            solicit the approval of holders of Carolina Group stock prior to the
            issuance of
            authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or Carolina Group
            stock
            unless that approval is deemed advisable by our board of directors or
            is
            required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange listing requirements.

If
            we are liquidated, amounts distributed to holders of our Carolina Group
            stock
            may not reflect the value of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group.

In
            the
            event we are liquidated, we would determine the liquidation rights of
            the
            holders of Carolina Group stock in accordance with the market capitalization
            of
            the outstanding shares of the Loews Group and the Carolina Group at a
            specified
            time prior to the time of liquidation. However, the relative market
            capitalization of the outstanding shares of each group may not correctly
            reflect
            the value of the net assets remaining and attributed to the groups after
            satisfaction of outstanding liabilities. Accordingly, the holders of
            Carolina
            Group stock could receive less consideration upon liquidation than they
            would if
            the groups were separate entities.

Risks
            Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA Financial
            Corporation

If
            CNA determines that loss reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated
            ultimate unpaid liability for claims, CNA may need to increase its loss
            reserves.

CNA
            maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability
            for
            claims and claim adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims
            and for
            future policy benefits. Reserves represent CNA management’s best estimate at a
            given point in time. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation
            of
            liability but instead are complex estimates derived by CNA, generally
            utilizing
            a variety of reserve estimation techniques, from numerous


Item

            Risk Factors

assumptions
            and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain,
            such
            as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity,
            expected interest rates, inflation, claims handling and case reserving
            policies
            and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal
            and
            regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an
            insured
            event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties
            are
            not precisely quantifiable and require significant management judgment.
            As
            trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-called “long tail” or
            long duration coverages, CNA is sometimes required to add to our reserves.
            This
            is called unfavorable development and results in a charge to our earnings
            in the
            amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate
            is
            made. These charges can be substantial and can have a material adverse
            effect on
            our results of operations and equity. Please read additional information
            on
            CNA’s reserves included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to
            Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

As
            industry practices and legal, judicial, social, and other environmental
            conditions change, unexpected issues related to claims and coverage may
            emerge.
            These issues have had and may continue to have a negative effect on CNA’s
            business by either extending coverage beyond CNA’s underwriting intent or by
            increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases
            in CNA’s
            reserves which can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
            and equity. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim
            and
            coverage issues are extremely hard to predict. Recent examples of emerging
            claims and coverage issues include:

·

increases
                      in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from
                      medical
                      products, and exposure to lead;

·

the
                      effects of accounting and financial reporting scandals and
                      other major
                      corporate governance failures, which have resulted in an increase
                      in the
                      number and size of claims, including director and officer and
                      errors and
                      omissions insurance claims;

·

increases
                      in the volume of class action litigation challenging a range
                      of industry
                      practices including claims
                      handling;

·

increases
                      in the number of construction defect claims, including claims
                      for a broad
                      range of additional insured endorsements on policies;
                      and

·

increases
                      in the number of claims alleging abuse by members of the clergy,
                      including
                      passage of legislation to reopen or extend various statutes
                      of
                      limitations.

In
            light
            of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates
            and making
            the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA reviews and
            changes
            its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience
            develops
            and further claims are reported and settled. In addition, CNA periodically
            undergoes state regulatory financial examinations, including review and
            analysis
            of its reserves. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason,
            the
            required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against CNA’s
            earnings for the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.
            These charges can be substantial and can materially adversely affect
            our results
            of operations and equity.

Loss
            reserves for asbestos, environmental pollution and mass torts are especially
            difficult to estimate and may result in CNA having to make more frequent
            and
            larger additions to those reserves.

CNA’s
            experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages
            relating
            to APMT claim and claim adjustment expenses is subject to uncertainties
            that are
            greater than those presented by other claims. Estimating the ultimate
            cost of
            both reported and unreported asbestos, environmental pollution and mass
            tort
            claims is subject to a higher degree of variability due to a number of
            additional factors, including among others:

·

coverage
                      issues, including whether certain costs are covered under the
                      policies and
                      whether policy limits apply;

·

inconsistent
                      court decisions and developing legal
                      theories;

changes
                      in the legal and legislative environment in which CNA
                      operates.

As
            a
            result of this higher degree of variability, CNA has necessarily
            supplemented traditional actuarial methods and techniques with additional
            estimating techniques and methodologies, many of which involve significant
            judgment on the part of management. Consequently, CNA may periodically
            need to
            record changes in its claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in
            the future
            in these areas in amounts that may be material. The sections below provide
            more
            details involving the specific factors affecting CNA’s estimation of reserves
            for casualty coverages relating to environmental pollution and asbestos.

            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Environmental
            pollution claims.

The
            estimation of reserves for environmental pollution claims is complicated
            by the
            assertion by many policyholders of claims for defense costs and indemnification.
            CNA and others in the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many
            such
            claims. Key coverage issues in these claims include:

·

whether
                      cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies (and
                      accordingly
                      whether CNA would be liable for these
                      costs);

·

the
                      trigger of coverage, and the allocation of liability among
                      triggered
                      policies;

·

the
                      applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property
                      exclusions;

·

the
                      potential for joint and several liability;
                      and

·

the
                      definition of an occurrence.

To
            date,
            courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues, thus
            adding to
            the uncertainty of the outcome of many of these claims.

Further,
            the scope of federal and state statutes and regulations determining liability
            and insurance coverage for environmental pollution liabilities have been
            the
            subject of extensive litigation. In many cases, courts have expanded
            the scope
            of coverage and liability for cleanup costs beyond the original intent
            of CNA’s
            insurance policies. In addition, the standards for cleanup in environmental
            pollution matters are unclear, the number of sites potentially subject
            to
            cleanup under applicable laws is unknown and the impact of various proposals
            to
            reform existing statutes and regulations is difficult to predict.

Asbestos
            claims.

The
            estimation of reserves for asbestos claims is particularly difficult
            for many of
            the same reasons discussed above for environmental pollution claims,
            as well
            as:

·

inconsistency
                      of court decisions and jury attitudes, as well as future court
                      decisions;

                      targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as
                      defendants;

·

uncertainties
                      in predicting the number of future claims and which other insureds
                      may be
                      targeted in the future;

·

·

                      in the number of non-impaired claimants and the extent to which
                      they can
                      be precluded from making claims;

·

the
                      efforts by insureds to obtain coverage that is not subject
                      to aggregate
                      limits;

·

the
                      long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation,
                      as well as the resulting potential for involvement of multiple
                      policy
                      periods for individual claims;

·

medical
                      inflation trends;

·

the
                      mix of asbestos-related diseases presented;
                      and

·

the
                      ability to recover reinsurance.

In
            addition, a number of CNA’s insureds have asserted that their claims against CNA
            for insurance are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. If these
            insureds
            are successful in this regard, CNA

’

s
            potential
            liability for their claims would be unlimited. Some of these insureds
            contend
            that their asbestos claims fall within the so-called “non-products” liability
            coverage within their policies, rather than the products liability coverage,
            and
            that this “non-products” liability coverage is not subject to any aggregate
            limit. It is difficult to predict the extent to which these claims will
            succeed
            and, as a result, the ultimate size of these claims.

Catastrophe
            losses are unpredictable.

Catastrophe
            losses are an inevitable part of CNA’s business. Various events can cause
            catastrophe losses, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail,
            explosions, severe winter weather and fires, and their frequency and
            severity
            are inherently unpredictable. For example, in 2005, CNA experienced substantial
            losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and in 2004, CNA experienced
            substantial losses from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne.
            These
            catastrophes are unprecedented in modern times. The extent of losses
            from
            catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of insured exposures
            in the
            affected areas and the severity of the events themselves. In addition,
            as in the
            case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the
            ultimate
            cost to CNA to be finally determined. As its claim experience develops
            on a
            particular catastrophe, CNA may be required to adjust reserves, or take
            additional unfavorable development, to reflect its revised estimates
            of the
            total cost of claims. CNA believes that it could incur significant catastrophe
            losses in the future. Please read information on catastrophe losses included
            in
            the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
            Statements included under Item 8.


Item
            1A.
            Risk Factors

CNA’s
            key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs
            for
            its long-term care product offerings could vary
            significantly

CNA’s
            reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its long-term care product
            offerings
            are based on certain key assumptions including morbidity, which is the
            frequency
            of illness, sickness and diseases contracted, policy persistency, which
            is the
            percentage of policies remaining in force, interest rates, future premium
            increases and future health care cost trends. If actual experience differs
            from
            these assumptions, the deferred acquisition costs may not be fully recovered
            and
            the reserves may not be adequate, requiring CNA to add to reserves, or
            take
            unfavorable development.

High
            levels of retained overhead expenses associated with business lines in
            run-off
            negatively impact CNA’s operating results.

During
            the past few years, CNA ceased offering certain insurance products relating
            principally to its life, group and reinsurance segments. Many of these
            business
            lines were sold, others have been placed in run-off and revenue will
            progressively decrease. CNA’s results of operations have been materially,
            adversely affected by the high levels of retained overhead expenses associated
            with these run-off operations, and will continue to be so affected if CNA
            is not successful in eliminating or reducing these costs.

CNA’s
            premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and
            cost of
            reinsurance.

CNA
            purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk. Under CNA’s
            reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion
            of CNA’s
            claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion
            of
            policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost
            of the
            reinsurance protection CNA purchases, which affects the level of CNA’s business
            and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk CNA retains.
            If CNA is
            unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost CNA deems acceptable,
            CNA may
            be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of
            CNA’s
            underwriting commitments. Please read information on Reinsurance included
            in
            MD&A under Item 7 and Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
            Statements included under Item 8.

CNA
            may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by
            reinsurers.

CNA
            has
            significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as
            receivables in the balance sheets and estimated in a manner consistent
            with
            claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits
            reserves.
            The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge CNA’s primary liability for
            claims. As a result, CNA is subject to credit risk relating to its ability
            to
            recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of CNA’s reinsurance carriers have
            experienced deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded
            by rating
            agencies. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which CNA believes
            are
            due to it. If CNA is not able to collect the amounts due to it from reinsurers,
            its claims expenses will be higher. Please read information on Reinsurance
            included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated
            Financial Statements included under Item 8.

CNA
            incurs significant interest expense related to funds withheld from reinsurance
            arrangements.

CNA
            has
            entered into several property and casualty reinsurance agreements where
            CNA
            retains the ceded premium as collateral to secure the reinsurers’ obligations to
            pay for ceded losses. CNA is required to credit interest on these “funds
            withheld” balances at specified rates for all periods in which the funds
            withheld liability exists. In addition, certain of these reinsurance
            contracts
            require CNA to pay interest on additional ceded premiums arising from
            ceded
            losses as if those premiums were payable at the inception of the underlying
            contract. The amount subject to interest crediting on these funds withheld
            contracts varies over time based on a number of factors, including the
            timing of
            loss payments and the ultimate gross losses incurred. CNA expects to
            incur
            significant interest costs on these contracts for several years to come.
            In an
            effort to reduce future interest charges, resolve a dispute or unwind
            an
            arrangement with a reinsurer that is experiencing financial difficulties,
            CNA
            commutes or “buys out” reinsurance arrangements from certain reinsurance
            carriers from time to time. Commutations can result in CNA incurring
            a
            significant charge for the period in which the commutation takes place.

            Risk Factors

included
            in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
            Statements included under Item 8.

Rating
            agencies may downgrade their ratings for CNA in the future, and thereby
            adversely affect CNA’s ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at
            all.

Ratings
            are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive
            position of
            insurance companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries, as well as its public
            debt, are rated by the four major rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best
            Company,
            Inc., Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and
            Fitch, Inc. Ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinions of an insurance
            company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and
            ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debtholders. Agency
            ratings
            are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be
            revised
            or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating
            should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.

In
            the
            past several years, the major rating agencies have lowered CNA’s financial
            strength and debt ratings and, due to the intense competitive environment
            in
            which CNA operates, the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential
            for CNA to take material unfavorable development in the future, and possible
            changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies,
            the
            rating agencies may take action to further lower CNA’s ratings in the future. If
            CNA’s property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings were downgraded
            below current levels, its business and results of operations could be
            materially
            adversely affected. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades
            would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain
            major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our
            insurance products to certain markets, and the required collateralization
            of
            certain future payment obligations or reserves.

In
            addition, CNA believes that a lowering of our debt ratings by certain
            of the
            rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on CNA’s ratings, independent
            of any change in circumstances at CNA. Each of the major rating agencies
            that
            rates us currently maintains a negative outlook. Please read information
            on our
            ratings included in the MD&A under Item 7.

CNA
            is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it does not meet
            these
            requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating
            its business.

Insurance
            companies such as CNA are subject to risk-based capital standards set
            by state
            regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.
            These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium
            and
            reserve components of CNA

’

s
            statutory
            capital and surplus reported in CNA’s statutory basis of accounting financial
            statements. Current rules require companies to maintain statutory capital
            and
            surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the risk-based
            capital
            formula. If CNA does not meet these minimum requirements, state regulators
            may
            restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business. If CNA is required
            to
            record a charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates
            or
            circumstances, such as increasing its reserves in the future as a result
            of
            unexpectedly poor claims experience or recording realized losses due
            to
            impairment of its investments, CNA may violate these minimum capital
            adequacy
            requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional
            capital.

CNA’s
            insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends and advances
            in
            order to fund its working capital needs, are limited by state regulators
            in
            their ability to pay dividends.

CNA
            Financial Corporation is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends,
            advances, loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order
            to meet
            its obligations. Dividend payments, however, must be approved by the
            subsidiaries’ domiciliary state departments of insurance and are generally
            limited to amounts determined by formula, which varies by state. The
            formula for
            the majority of the states is the greater of 10% of the prior year statutory
            surplus or the prior year statutory net income, less the aggregate of
            all
            dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment.
            Some
            states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot
            exceed the
            prior year’s earned surplus. If CNA is restricted, by regulatory rule or
            otherwise, from paying or receiving inter-company dividends, CNA may
            not be able
            to fund its working capital needs and debt service requirements from
            available
            cash. As a result, CNA would need to look to other sources of capital,
            which may
            be more expensive or may not be available at all.


Item
            1A.
            Risk Factors

CNA
            is responding to subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries relating to
            insurance
            brokers and agents, contingent commissions and bidding practices, and
            certain
            finite-risk insurance products.

Along
            with other companies in the industry, CNA has received subpoenas,
            interrogatories and inquiries from: (i) California, Connecticut, Delaware,
            Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
            Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and the Canadian Council
            of
            Insurance Regulators concerning investigations into practices including
            contingent compensation arrangements, fictitious quotes, and tying arrangements;
            (ii) the SEC, the New York State Attorney General, the United States
            Attorney
            for the Southern District of New York, the Connecticut Attorney General,
            the
            Connecticut Department of Insurance, the Delaware Department of Insurance,
            the
            Georgia Office of Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner and the California
            Department of Insurance concerning reinsurance products and finite insurance
            products purchased and sold by CNA; (iii) the Massachusetts Attorney
            General and
            the Connecticut Attorney General concerning investigations into anti-competitive
            practices; and (iv) the New York State Attorney General concerning declinations
            of attorney malpractice insurance. CNA continues to respond to these
            subpoenas,
            interrogatories and inquiries.

Subsequent
            to receipt of the SEC subpoena, CNA has been producing documents
            and providing additional information at the SEC’s request. In addition, the
            SEC and representatives of the United States Attorney

’

s
            Office for the
            Southern District of New York have been conducting interviews with several
            of CNA’s current and former executives relating to the restatement of its
            financial results for 2004, including CNA’s relationship with and accounting for
            transactions with an affiliate that were the basis for the restatement.
            The SEC
            has also recently requested information relating to our current restatement.

It
            is
            possible that CNA’s analyses of, or accounting treatment for, finite reinsurance
            contracts or discontinued operations could be questioned or disputed
            by
            regulatory authorities. As a result, further restatements of CNA’s financial
            results are possible.

CNA’s
            investment portfolio, which is a key component of its overall profitability,
            may
            suffer reduced returns or losses,

especially
            with respect to its equity investments in limited partnerships which
            are often
            subject to greater leverage and volatility

.

Investment
            returns are an important part of CNA’s overall profitability. General economic
            conditions, stock market conditions, fluctuations in interest rates,
            and many
            other factors beyond CNA’s control can adversely affect the returns and the
            overall value of its equity investments and its ability to control the
            timing of
            the realization of investment income. In addition, any defaults in the
            payments
            due to CNA for its investments, especially with respect to liquid corporate
            and
            municipal bonds, could reduce CNA’s investment income and realized investment
            gains or could cause CNA to incur investment losses. Further, CNA invests
            a
            portion of its assets in equity investments, primarily through limited
            partnerships, which are subject to greater volatility than its fixed
            income
            investments. In some cases, these limited partnerships use leverage and
            are
            thereby subject to even greater volatility. Although limited partnership
            investments generally provide higher expected return, they present greater
            risk
            and are more illiquid than CNA’s fixed income investments. As a result of these
            factors, CNA may not realize an adequate return on its investments, may
            incur
            losses on sales of its investments and may be required to write down
            the value
            of its investments.

CNA
            may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and
            casualty
            business.

The
            property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods
            characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive
            underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by
            periods of
            relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards
            and relatively high premium rates.

A
              $16.3 billion judgment has been rendered against Lorillard in the Engle
              litigation.

Engle
              v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al.

(Circuit
              Court, Dade County, Florida, filed May 5, 1994) was certified as a class
              action on behalf of Florida residents, and survivors of Florida residents,
              who
              were injured or died from medical conditions allegedly caused by addiction
              to
              cigarettes. During 2000, a jury awarded approximately $16.3 billion
              in punitive
              damages against Lorillard as part of a $145.0 billion verdict against
              Lorillard
              and the other major

tobacco
              companies, which bears interest at the rate of 10.0% per year. During
              May of
              2003, a Florida appellate court reversed the judgment and decertified
              the class.
              The Florida Supreme Court heard oral arguments on November 3, 2004. As of
              the date of this Report, a decision on the appeal before the Florida
              Supreme
              Court is pending. Even if the Florida Supreme Court were to rule in
              favor of the
              defendants, plaintiffs will not have exhausted all of the appellate
              options
              available to them as they could seek review of the case by the U.S.
              Supreme
              Court.

We
            cannot
            be sure that Lorillard will ultimately prevail on appeal. In the event
            that the
            circuit court’s $16.3 billion punitive damages judgment against Lorillard is
            ultimately upheld, the amount of that judgment would significantly exceed
            the
            assets of Lorillard. Even if the circuit court’s $16.3 billion punitive damages
            judgment were reduced, the reduced amount of the final judgment might
            ultimately
            exceed the assets of Lorillard and result in a liquidation or bankruptcy
            of
            Lorillard. For additional information on the

Engle

case,

            included
            in Item 8 of this report.

Lorillard
            is a defendant in approximately 3,675 tobacco-related lawsuits, which
            are
            extremely costly to defend, and which could result in substantial judgments
            against Lorillard.

Numerous
            legal actions, proceedings and claims arising out of the sale, distribution,
            manufacture, development, advertising, marketing and claimed health effects
            of
            cigarettes are pending against Lorillard, and it is likely that similar
            claims
            will continue to be filed for the foreseeable future. Settlements and
            victories
            by plaintiffs in highly publicized cases against Lorillard and other
            tobacco
            companies, together with acknowledgments by Lorillard and other tobacco
            companies regarding the health effects of smoking, may stimulate further
            claims.
            In addition, adverse outcomes in pending cases could have adverse effects
            on the
            ability of Lorillard to prevail in smoking and health litigation.

Approximately
            3,675 tobacco-related cases are pending against Lorillard in the United
            States.
            Punitive damages, often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars,
            are
            specifically pleaded in a number of cases in addition to compensatory
            and other
            damages. It is possible that the outcome of these cases, individually
            or in the
            aggregate, could result in bankruptcy. It is also possible that Lorillard
            may be
            unable to post a surety bond in an amount sufficient to stay execution
            of a
            judgment in jurisdictions that require such bond pending an appeal on
            the merits
            of the case. Even if Lorillard is successful in defending some or all
            of these
            actions, these types of cases are very expensive to defend. A material
            increase
            in the number of pending claims could significantly increase defense
            costs.

Further,
            adverse decisions in actions against tobacco companies other than Lorillard
            could have an adverse impact on the industry, including Lorillard. During
            February of 2006, the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the verdict in

Williams
            v. Philip Morris USA, Inc

.,
            in
            which plaintiff was awarded approximately $525,000 in compensatory damages
            and
            $79.5 million in punitive damages, a ratio of more than 150:1. The Court
            determined that, in light of the lower court’s findings in this case, the ratio
            of punitive to compensatory damages was not inconsistent with U.S. Supreme
            Court
            precedents in this area. Philip Morris has informed the court that it
            will seek
            review of this case by the U.S. Supreme Court. Lorillard is not a party
            to

A
            substantial judgment has been rendered against Lorillard in the Scott
            litigation.

In
            June
            of 2004, the court entered a final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs
            in

Scott
            v. The American Tobacco Company, et al.

(District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, filed May 24, 1996), a class
            action
            on behalf of certain cigarette smokers resident in the State of Louisiana.
            The
            jury awarded plaintiffs approximately $591.0 million to fund cessation
            programs
            for Louisiana smokers. The court’s final judgment also reflected its award of
            judicial interest. As of February 15, 2006, judicial interest totaled
            an
            additional amount of approximately $395.0 million.

            Risk Factors

The
            judicial interest award will continue to accrue
            until the judgment is paid or is vacated on appeal. Lorillard’s share of the
            judgment and the judicial interest has not been determined. Lorillard
            and the
            other defendants have initiated an appeal from the judgment to the Louisiana
            Court of Appeals. Oral argument in that matter has been scheduled for
            April 12,
            2006. For additional information on the

case,
            please read Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
            included
            in Item 8 of this report.

Lorillard
            is a defendant in an action brought by the U.S. Department of Justice
            that could
            result in substantial damages or disgorgement of profits.

A
            verdict
            could be issued at any time in the U.S. federal government’s reimbursement and
            racketeering suit (

United
            States of America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
            U.S.
            District Court, District of Columbia, filed September 22, 1999). Lorillard,
            other cigarette manufacturers, two parent companies and two trade associations
            are defendants in the case. At the time the trial began during September
            of
            2004, the government sought approximately $280.0 billion in disgorgement
            of
            profits from the defendants, including Lorillard, as well as injunctive
            relief.
            During 2005, an appellate court ruled that the government may not seek
            disgorgement of profits. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review this
            verdict,
            although plaintiff could again seek a review of this issue following
            a verdict.
            The trial has concluded and the parties filed their final post-trial
            submissions
            during the fourth quarter of 2005. The court has not announced when it
            will
            issue its verdict. For additional information on this case, please read
            Note 20
            of the Notes to Consoldiated Financial Statements included in Item 8
            of this
            report.

Lorillard
            has substantial payment obligations under litigation settlement agreements
            which
            will materially adversely affect its cash flows and operating income
            in future
            periods.

Lorillard
            and other manufacturers of tobacco products are parties to the State
            Settlement
            Agreements with the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth
            of
            Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories, which settled the asserted and
            unasserted health care cost recovery and certain other claims of those
            states
            and territories.

Under
            the
            State Settlement Agreements, Lorillard is obligated to pay approximately
            $875.0
            million to $925.0 million in 2006, primarily based on 2005 estimated
            industry
            volume. Annual payments under the State Settlement Agreements are required
            to be
            paid in perpetuity and are based, among other things, on Lorillard’s domestic
            market share and unit volume of domestic shipments in the year preceding
            the
            year in which payment is due. Please read Note 20 to the Notes to Consolidated
            Financial Statements included in Item 8 for additional information regarding
            the
            State Settlement Agreements.

Concerns
            that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks could adversely
            affect
            Lorillard.

Some
            plaintiffs and other sources, including the Centers for Disease Control
            and
            Prevention, have claimed that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater
            health
            risks than non-mentholated cigarettes. If such claims were to be substantiated,
            Lorillard, as the leading manufacturer of mentholated cigarettes in the
            United
            States, could face increased exposure to tobacco-related litigation.
            Even if
            those claims are not substantiated, increased concerns about the health
            impact
            of mentholated cigarettes could adversely affect Lorillard’s sales, including
            sales of Newport.

Lorillard
            is subject to important limitations on advertising and marketing cigarettes
            that
            could harm its competitive position.

Television
            and radio advertisements of tobacco products have been prohibited since
            1971.
            Under the State Settlement Agreements, Lorillard generally cannot use
            billboard
            advertising, cartoon characters, sponsorship of concerts, non-tobacco
            merchandise bearing its brand names and various other advertising and
            marketing
            techniques. In addition, the Master Settlement Agreement prohibits the
            targeting
            of youth in advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products.
            Accordingly, Lorillard has determined not to advertise its cigarettes
            in
            magazines with large readership among people under the age of 18. Additional
            restrictions may be imposed or agreed to in the future. These limitations
            may
            make it difficult to maintain the value of an existing brand if sales
            or market
            share decline for any reason. Moreover, these limitations significantly
            impair
            the ability of cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard, to launch
            new
            premium brands.


Item
            1A.
            Risk Factors

Sales
              of cigarettes are subject to substantial federal, state and local excise
              taxes.

In
              1999,
              federal excise taxes were $0.24 per pack and state excise taxes ranged
              from
              $0.03 to $1.00 per pack. In 2005, the federal excise tax was $0.39 per pack
              and combined state and local excise taxes ranged from $0.07 to $3.00
              per pack.
              During 2005, excise tax increases ranging from $0.10 to $1.00 per pack
              of 20
              cigarettes were implemented in twelve states. Proposals continue to
              be made to
              increase federal, state and local tobacco excise taxes. Lorillard believes
              that
              increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on
              sales of
              cigarettes and that future increases, the extent of which cannot be
              predicted,
              could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry,
              including
              Lorillard, and an increased sales shift toward lower priced discount
              cigarettes
              rather than premium brands.

Lorillard
            is dependent on the U.S. cigarette business, which we expect to continue
            to
            contract.

Lorillard’s
            U.S. cigarette business is currently its only significant business. The
            U.S.
            cigarette market has generally been contracting and we expect it to continue
            to
            contract. Lorillard does not have foreign cigarette sales that could
            offset
            these effects, as it sold the international rights to substantially all
            of its
            brands, including Newport, in 1977. As a result of price increases, restrictions
            on advertising and promotions, increases in regulation and excise taxes,
            health
            concerns, a decline in the social acceptability of smoking, increased
            pressure
            from anti-tobacco groups and other factors, U.S. cigarette shipments
            among the
            three major U.S. cigarette manufacturers have decreased at a compound
            annual
            rate of approximately

2.4

%
            over
            the period 1984 through 2005, as measured by Management Science Associates.
            Domestic U.S. cigarette industry shipments decreased by

3.4

%
            during
            2005, as compared to 2004, and 1.7% for 2004, as compared to 2003, according
            to
            information provided by Management Science Associates.

Lorillard
            derives most of its revenue from the sales of one product in the premium
            market.

Lorillard’s
            largest selling brand, Newport, accounted for approximately

92.8

%
            of
            Lorillard’s sales revenue in 2005. Newport is positioned in the premium segment
            of the U.S. cigarette market. Lorillard’s principal strategic plan revolves
            around the advertising and promotion of its Newport brand. Lorillard
            cannot
            ensure that it will continue to successfully implement its strategic
            plan with
            respect to Newport or that implementation of its strategic plan will
            result in
            the maintenance or growth of the Newport brand.

Increases
            in promotional expenses and sales incentives in response to increased
            competition and declining unit volumes may continue to materially adversely
            impact Lorillard.

The
            cigarette industry is highly competitive and has become significantly
            more
            competitive in recent years. Continuing sizable industry-wide promotional
            expenses and sales incentives are being implemented in response to declining
            unit volume, state excise tax increases and continuing competition among
            the
            three largest cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard, and smaller
            participants who have established a competitive level of market share
            in recent
            years, principally in the deep discount cigarette market. As a result
            of ongoing
            high levels of competition based on retail prices of brands and the competitive
            price advantages of deep discounters, the ability of Lorillard and the
            other
            major manufacturers to raise prices has been adversely affected.

While
            the
            environment remains highly price competitive, during 2005, Lorillard
            reduced
            promotional and sales incentives which had the effect of increasing unit
            prices.
            Lorillard regularly reviews results of its promotional spending activities
            and
            adjusts its promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain its
            competitive position. Accordingly, unit sales volume and sales promotion
            costs
            in any period are not necessarily indicative of sales and costs that
            may be
            realized in subsequent periods.

Several
            of Lorillard’s competitors have developed alternative cigarette products.

Certain
            of the major cigarette makers are marketing alternative cigarette products.
            For
            example, Philip Morris has developed an alternative cigarette called
            Accord in
            which the tobacco is heated rather than burned. Reynolds American has
            developed
            an alternative cigarette called Eclipse in which the tobacco is primarily
            heated, with only a small amount of tobacco burned. Vector Tobacco Inc.
            is
            marketing a cigarette offered in several packings with declining levels
            of
            nicotine, called Quest. Philip Morris and Reynolds American have indicated
            that
            these products may deliver fewer smoke components as compared to conventional
            cigarettes. Lorillard has not marketed similar

            Risk Factors

alternative
            cigarettes. Should such alternative cigarette products gain a significant
            share
            of the U.S. cigarette market, Lorillard may be at a competitive disadvantage.

Lorillard
              may not be able to develop, produce or commercialize competitive new
              products
              and technologies required by regulatory changes or changes in consumer
              preferences.

Consumer
              health concerns and changes in regulations are likely to require Lorillard
              to
              introduce new products or make substantial changes to existing products.
              For
              example, New York State, California and Vermont have enacted legislation
              requiring cigarette manufacturers to reduce the ignition propensity
              of their
              products. Lorillard believes that there may be increasing pressure
              from public
              health authorities to develop a conventional cigarette or an alternative
              cigarette that provides a demonstrable reduced risk of adverse health
              effects.
              Lorillard may not be able to develop a reduced risk product that is
              acceptable
              to consumers. In addition, the costs associated with developing any
              such new
              products and technologies could be substantial.

Increases
            in the availability of counterfeit cigarettes could adversely affect
            Lorillard’s
            sales.

Sales
            of
            counterfeit cigarettes in the United States, including counterfeits of
            Lorillard’s Newport brand, could adversely impact sales by the manufacturers of
            the brands that are counterfeited and potentially damage the value and
            reputation of those brands. Significant future increases in the availability
            of
            counterfeit Newport cigarettes could have a material adverse effect on
            Lorillard’s sales volumes, revenue and profits.

Lorillard
            relies on a single manufacturing facility for the production of its cigarettes.

Lorillard
            produces all of its cigarettes at its Greensboro, North Carolina manufacturing
            facility. If Lorillard’s manufacturing plant is damaged, destroyed or
            incapacitated or Lorillard is otherwise unable to operate its manufacturing
            facility, Lorillard may be unable to produce cigarettes and may be unable
            to
            meet customer demand.

Lorillard
            relies on a small number of suppliers for certain of its tobacco
            leaf.

Lorillard
            purchases more than 90% of its domestic leaf tobacco from one supplier,
            Alliance
            One International, Inc. In addition, Lorillard purchases all of its
            reconstituted tobacco from one supplier, which is an affiliate of Reynolds
            American, Inc., a major competitor of Lorillard. If either of these suppliers
            becomes unwilling or unable to supply Lorillard and Lorillard is unable
            to find
            an alternative supplier on a timely basis, Lorillard’s operations could be
            disrupted resulting in lower production levels and reduced sales.

            Inc.

Diamond
            Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas
            industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas
            prices.

Diamond
            Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and gas
            exploration, development and production in markets worldwide. Oil and
            gas
            prices, market expectations of potential changes in these prices and
            a variety
            of political and economic factors significantly affect this level of
            activity.
            However, higher commodity prices do not necessarily translate into increased
            drilling activity since Diamond Offshore’s customers’ expectations of future
            commodity prices typically drive demand for Diamond Offshore’s rigs. Oil and gas

Diamond
            Offshore’s industry is cyclical.

Diamond
            Offshore’s industry has historically been cyclical. There have been periods of
            high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates, followed by periods
            of lower
            demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates. Periods of excess rig supply
            intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being
            idle
            for long periods of time.

Prolonged
            periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition
            of
            impairment charges on certain of Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs if future cash
            flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the
            time,
            indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be
            recoverable.

Although
            oil and natural gas prices are currently significantly above historical
            averages, which has resulted in higher utilization and dayrates earned
            by
            Diamond Offshore’s drilling units generally beginning in the third quarter of
            2004, Diamond Offshore cannot be sure that the current industry cycle
            of high
            demand, short rig supply and higher dayrates will continue. Diamond Offshore
            may
            be required to idle rigs or to enter into lower rate contracts in response
            to
            market conditions in the future.

The
            terms of some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts may limit its ability to
            benefit from increasing dayrates in a rising market.

The
            duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by market
            demand
            and the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractor
            and
            its customers. In periods of rising demand for offshore rigs, contractors
            typically prefer well-to-well contracts that allow contractors to profit
            from
            increasing dayrates. In contrast, during these periods customers with
            reasonably
            definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to
            maintain
            dayrate prices at a consistent level. Conversely, in periods of decreasing
            demand for offshore rigs, contractors generally prefer longer term contracts
            to
            preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers
            prefer well-to-well contracts that allow them to obtain the benefit of
            lower
            dayrates.

To
            the extent possible, Diamond Offshore seeks to have a foundation of long-term
            contracts with a reasonable balance of single-well, well-to-well and
            short-term
            contracts to minimize the downside impact of a decline in the market
            while still
            participating in the benefit of increasing dayrates in a rising market.
            However,
            Diamond Offshore cannot be sure that it will be able to achieve or maintain
            such
            a balance from time to time. Diamond Offshore’s inability to fully benefit from
            increasing dayrates in a rising market due to the long-term nature of
            its
            contracts, may adversely impact its profitability.


Item
            1A.
            Risk Factors

The
              majority of Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling units are fixed
              dayrate contracts, and increases in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs could
              adversely affect the profitability of those
              contracts.

The
              majority of Diamond Offshore’s contracts with its customers for drilling units
              provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating day. However,
              many
              of Diamond Offshore’s operating costs, such as labor costs, are unpredictable
              and fluctuate based on events beyond Diamond Offshore’s control. The gross
              margin that Diamond Offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts
              will
              fluctuate based on variations in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs over the
              terms of the contracts. Diamond Offshore may be unable to recover increased
              or
              unforeseen costs from its customers.

Diamond
            Offshore’s drilling contracts may be terminated due to events beyond Diamond
            Offshore’s control.

Diamond
            Offshore’s customers may terminate some of their drilling contracts if the
            drilling unit is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended
            for a
            specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment
            or, in
            some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party. In
            addition,
            some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate
            the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually
            specified
            termination amounts. Such termination payments may not fully compensate
            Diamond
            Offshore for the loss of a contract. In addition, the early termination
            of a
            contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time.
            During
            depressed market conditions, Diamond Offshore’s customers may also seek
            renegotiation of firm drilling contracts to reduce their
            obligations.

Rig
            conversions, upgrades or newbuilds may be subject to delays and cost
            overruns.

From
            time
            to time, Diamond Offshore may undertake to add new capacity through conversions
            or upgrades to rigs or through new construction. Diamond Offshore has
            entered
            into agreements to upgrade two of its drilling units to ultra-deepwater
            capability at an estimated aggregate cost of $550 million with expected
            delivery
            dates in mid-2007 and the fourth quarter of 2008. Diamond Offshore also
            has
            entered into agreements to construct two new jack-up drilling units with
            delivery expected in the first quarter of 2008 at an aggregate cost of
            approximately $300 million. These projects and other projects of this
            type are
            subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction
            project resulting from numerous factors. Failure to complete a rig upgrade
            or
            new construction on time, or failure to complete a rig conversion or
            new
            construction in accordance with its design specifications may, in some
            circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of
            a drilling
            contract.

Diamond
            Offshore’s business involves numerous operating hazards and Diamond Offshore is
            not fully insured against all of them.

Diamond
            Offshore’s operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in drilling for
            oil and gas offshore, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production,
            loss of well control, punch-throughs, craterings and natural disasters
            such as
            hurricanes or fires. The occurrence of these events could result in the
            suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment
            involved, injury or death to rig personnel, damage to producing or potentially
            productive oil and gas formations and environmental damage. Operations
            also may
            be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions,
            failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel
            shortages. In addition, offshore drilling operators are subject to perils
            peculiar to marine operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision
            and
            loss or damage from severe weather. Damage to the environment could also
            result
            from Diamond Offshore’s operations, particularly through oil spillage or
            extensive uncontrolled fires. Diamond Offshore may also be subject to
            damage
            claims by oil and gas companies.

Although
            Diamond Offshore maintains insurance in the areas in which it operates,
            pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable and
            Diamond
            Offshore does not typically retain loss-of-hire insurance policies to
            cover its
            rigs. Diamond Offshore’s insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity
            may not adequately cover its losses, or may have exclusions of coverage
            for some
            losses. Diamond Offshore does not have insurance coverage or rights to
            indemnity
            for all risks including, among others, war risk. Diamond Offshore cannot
            be sure
            that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify Diamond
            Offshore
            will necessarily be financially able to do so in all cases.

            Risk Factors

As
              a
              result of underwriting losses suffered by the insurance industry over
              the past
              few years and damages caused by two recent hurricanes in the GOM, Diamond
              Offshore could be faced with the prospect of significantly higher insurance
              premiums and/or significantly increasing deductibles to offset or mitigate
              premium increases. Diamond Offshore cannot be sure that it will be
              able to
              maintain adequate insurance in the future at reasonable rates or that
              it will be
              able to obtain insurance against some risks.

Diamond
              Offshore’s international operations involve additional risks not associated
              with
              domestic operations.

Diamond
              Offshore operates in various regions throughout the world that may

International
            contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations
            in
            countries in which Diamond Offshore operates, including laws and regulations
            relating to:

Diamond
            Offshore’s operations outside the United States accounted for approximately
            45.0%, 56.0% and 52.0% of its revenues for the years ended December 31,
            2005,
            2004 and 2003, respectively. Diamond Offshore cannot predict what future
            governmental regulations might adversely affect its international operations.
            These practices may adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to
            compete.

Diamond

Offshore

’s
            drilling contracts in the Mexican GOM expose it to greater risks than
            they
            normally assume.

During
            2003, Diamond Offshore entered into contracts to operate four of its
            intermediate semisubmersible rigs offshore Mexico for PEMEX, the national
            oil
            company of Mexico. The terms of these contracts expose Diamond Offshore
            to
            greater risks than they normally assume, such as exposure to greater
            environmental liability. While Diamond believes that the financial terms
            of
            these contracts and its operating safeguards in place mitigate these
            risks,
            Diamond Offshore cannot be sure that the increased risk exposure will
            not have a
            negative impact on our future operations or financial results.

Fluctuations
            in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in
            losses.

Due
            to
            Diamond Offshore’s international operations, Diamond Offshore may experience
            currency exchange losses where revenues are received and expenses are
            paid in
            nonconvertible currencies or where it does not hedge an exposure to a
            foreign
            currency. Diamond Offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability

              effective on

November
              1, 2005, are subject to refund in the event lower maximum rates are
              established
              as a result of a settlement or hearing. Boardwalk Pipeline cannot assure
              that it
              will be able to recover all of its costs through existing or future
              rates.

FERC
            has
            issued a statement of general policy providing that pipelines, including
            those
            organized as partnerships, can include in computing their cost of service
            a tax
            allowance to reflect actual or potential tax liability on their public
            utility
            income attributable to all entities or individuals owning public utility
            assets,
            if the pipeline establishes that the entities or individuals have an
            actual or
            potential income tax liability on such income. Whether a pipeline’s owners have
            such actual or potential income tax liability will be reviewed by FERC
            on a
            case-by-case basis. FERC has not indicated what is required to establish
            such
            actual or potential income tax liability for all owners. Application
            of FERC’s
            policy statement may be subject to further FERC action or review in the
            appropriate federal Court of Appeals. Therefore, the ultimate outcome
            could
            result in changes to FERC’s treatment of income tax allowances in cost of
            service. If Texas Gas or Gulf South is required to establish that its
            unitholders, are subject to United States federal income taxation (in
            a future
            rate case for example) and is not able to do so, FERC could disallow
            a
            substantial portion of Texas Gas’s or Gulf South’s income tax allowance. In that
            event, it is likely that the level of maximum lawful rates they could
            charge
            customers would decrease from current levels.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline’s operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen
            interruptions for which Boardwalk Pipeline may not be adequately insured.

There
            are
            a variety of operating risks inherent in Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas
            transportation, gathering and storage operations, such as leaks, explosions
            and
            mechanical problems, all of which could cause substantial financial losses.
            Any
            of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption
            of
            Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or
            loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution,
            impairment of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations and substantial revenue losses.
            The location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential
            areas,
            commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly
            increase
            the level of damages resulting from these risks.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline currently possesses property, business interruption and general
            liability insurance, but proceeds from such insurance coverage may not
            be
            adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Moreover,
            such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable
            costs and on commercially reasonable terms.

Because
            of the natural decline in gas production from existing wells, Boardwalk
            Pipeline’s success depends on its ability to obtain access to new sources of
            natural gas.

Since
            2003, gas production from the Gulf Coast region, which supplies the majority
            of
            Boardwalk Pipeline’s throughput, has declined an average of approximately 3.2%
            per year according to the Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”).
            Production from existing wells and gas supply basins connected to Boardwalk
            Pipeline’s systems will naturally decline over time. The amount of natural gas
            reserves underlying these wells may also be less than Boardwalk Pipeline
            anticipates, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines
            may
            be greater than Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates. Accordingly, to maintain
            or
            increase throughput levels on its pipelines, Boardwalk Pipeline must
            continually
            obtain access to new supplies of natural gas. The primary factors

            Risk Factors

affecting
            Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to obtain new sources of natural gas supply
            include: (1) the level of successful drilling activity near Boardwalk
            Pipeline’s
            pipelines; (2) Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for these supplies; (3)
            the successful completion of new liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) facilities near
            Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities; and (4) Boardwalk Pipeline’s gas quality
            requirements.

The
              level
              of drilling activity is dependent on a number of factors beyond Boardwalk
              Pipeline’s control, including the price of oil and natural gas, producers’
capital budget limitations, the ability of producers to obtain necessary
              drilling and other governmental permits, the availability and cost
              of drilling
              rigs and other drilling equipment, and regulatory changes.

Imported
              LNG is expected to be a significant component of future natural gas
              supply to
              the United States. Much of this increase in LNG supplies is expected
              to be
              imported through new LNG facilities to be developed over the next decade.
              Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates benefiting from some of these new projects
              and
              the additional gas supply they will bring to the Gulf Coast region.
              If a
              significant number of these new projects fail to be developed with
              their
              announced capacity, or there are significant delays in such development,
              or if
              they are built in locations where they are not connected to the facilities
              of
              Boardwalk Pipeline or they do not influence sources of supply on the
              Boardwalk
              Pipeline systems, Boardwalk Pipeline may not realize expected increases
              in
              future natural gas supply available for transportation through its
              systems.

If
            Boardwalk Pipeline is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas
            to replace
            the natural decline in volumes from existing supply basins, or if the
            expected
            increase in natural gas supply through imported LNG is not realized,
            throughput
            on its pipeline systems would decline.

Successful
            development of LNG import terminals in the eastern or northeastern United
            States
            could reduce the demand for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services.

Development
            of new, or expansion of existing, LNG facilities on the East Coast could
            reduce
            the need for customers in the northeastern United States to transport
            natural
            gas from the Gulf Coast and other supply basins connected to the Boardwalk
            Pipeline’s systems. This could reduce the amount of gas transported by Boardwalk
            Pipeline for delivery off-system to other interstate pipelines serving
            the
            northeast. If Boardwalk Pipeline is not able to replace these volumes
            with
            volumes to other markets or other regions, throughput on its pipeline
            systems
            will decline.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation
            and
            storage contracts at favorable rates.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline’s primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time existing
            transportation contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation. As
            of December
            31, 2005, approximately 28% of the firm contract load on the Boardwalk
            Pipeline
            systems was due to expire on or before December 31, 2006. Upon expiration,
            Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to extend contracts with existing
            customers
            or obtain replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term
            basis.

The
            extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of
            factors
            beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control, including:

·

existing
                      and new competition to deliver natural gas to Boardwalk Pipeline’s
                      markets;

·

the
                      growth in demand for natural gas in Boardwalk Pipeline’s markets;

·

whether
                      the market will continue to support long-term contracts;

·

the
                      reduction of basis differentials - market price spreads between
                      two points
                      on the pipeline - across the Boardwalk Pipeline systems;
                      and

·

the
                      effects of state regulation on customer contracting practices.

            Risk Factors

The
              northeastern terminus of the Texas Gas pipeline system is in Lebanon,
              Ohio,
              where it connects with other interstate natural gas pipelines delivering
              natural
              gas to East Coast and Midwest metropolitan areas and other indirect
              markets.
              Pipeline capacity into Lebanon is approximately 48% greater than pipeline
              capacity leaving that point, creating a bottleneck and increased competition
              for
              supply into areas of high demand. Approximately 54% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s
              long-term contracts covering offtake from Lebanon expire by the end
              of 2007.

Boardwalk
              Pipeline depends on certain key customers for a significant portion
              of its
              revenues.

Boardwalk
              Pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant
              portion of
              its revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2005, ProLiance Energy,
              LLC and
              Atmos Energy accounted for approximately 20.2% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s total
              operating revenues. Boardwalk Pipeline may be unable to negotiate extensions
              or
              replacements of these contracts and those with other key customers
              on favorable
              terms as a result of competition, creditworthiness or for other
              reasons.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its
            customers.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline is exposed to credit risk from the nonperformance by its customers
            of
            their contractual obligations, in large part relating to volumes owed
            by
            customers for imbalances or gas loaned to them, generally under parking
            and
            lending services and no-notice services. Average natural gas prices have
            risen
            dramatically in recent years. This rise in gas prices has materially
            increased
            Boardwalk Pipeline’s credit risk related to gas loaned to its
            customers.

            Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline depends on third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected
            to
            its pipelines.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline depends upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that
            provide
            delivery options to and from its pipelines. For example, Gulf South’s pipeline
            system can deliver approximately 500,000 Mcf/d to a major pipeline connection
            with Texas Eastern at Kosciusko, Mississippi. If this or any other pipeline
            connection were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of
            natural
            gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other
            reason, Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to continue shipping natural gas to end
            markets could be restricted. Any temporary or permanent interruption
            at any key
            pipeline interconnect could cause a material reduction in volumes transported
            on
            or stored at facilities of Boardwalk Pipeline.

Significant
            changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand and, reduce
            system
            throughput.

Higher
            natural gas prices could result in a decline in the demand for natural
            gas and,
            therefore, in the throughput on the Boardwalk Pipeline systems. In addition,
            reduced price volatility could reduce the revenues generated by Boardwalk
            Pipeline’s parking and lending and interruptible storage services. In general
            terms, the price of natural gas fluctuates in response to changes in
            supply,
            changes in demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors
            that
            are beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control. These factors include:

·

worldwide
                      economic conditions;

·

weather
                      conditions and seasonal trends;

·

the
                      availability of adequate transportation capacity;

Expansion
              projects and acquisitions involve risks that may adversely affect Boardwalk
              Pipeline’s business.

A
              principal focus of Boardwalk Pipeline’s strategy is to continue to grow its
              business through acquisitions, expansion of existing assets and construction
              of
              new assets. Any acquisition, expansion or new construction involves
              potential
              risks, including:

·

performance
                        of Boardwalk Pipeline’s business following the acquisition, expansion or
                        construction of assets that does not meet expectations;

·

a
                      significant increase in Boardwalk Pipeline’s indebtedness and working
                      capital requirements, which could, among other things, have
                      an adverse
                      impact on its credit ratings;

·

the
                      inability to timely and effectively integrate into Boardwalk
                      Pipeline’s
                      operations the operations of newly acquired, expanded or constructed
                      assets;

·

the
                      incurrence of substantial unforeseen environmental and other
                      liabilities,
                      including liabilities arising from the operation of an acquired

Any
            of
            these factors could result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated
            costs or could adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to realize the

Risks
            Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally

In
            addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries,
            as
            discussed above, we and all of our subsidiaries face risks and uncertainties
            related to, among other things, terrorism, hurricanes and other natural
            disasters, competition, government regulation, dependence on key executives
            and
            employees, litigation, dependence on information technology and compliance
            with
            environmental laws.

Future
            acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.

Future
            terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in this country
            or
            abroad, as well as possible retaliatory military and other action by
            the United
            States and its allies, could have a significant impact on the businesses
            of
            certain of our subsidiaries, including the following:

CNA Financial Corporation.

CNA may
            bear substantial losses from future acts of terrorism. The Terrorism
            Risk
            Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (“TRIEA”) extended, until December 31, 2007, the
            program established by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. Under
            this
            program, insurers are required to offer terrorism insurance and the federal
            government will share the risk of loss by commercial property and casualty
            insurers arising from future terrorist attacks. TRIEA does not provide
            complete
            protection for future losses derived from acts of terrorism. Please read
            information on TRIEA included in the MD&A under Item 7.

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP.

The
            continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military
            and other
            action by the United States and its allies might lead to increased political,
            economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for
            oil and
            natural gas, which could affect the market for Diamond’s offshore oil and gas
            drilling services and Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation, gathering
            and storage services. In addition, it has been reported that terrorists
            might
            target domestic energy facilities. While Diamond and Boardwalk Pipeline
            take
            steps that they believe are appropriate to increase the security of their

            coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.

Loews
              Hotels.

The
              travel and tourism industry went into a steep decline in the periods
              following
              the 2001 World Trade Center event which had a negative impact on the
              occupancy
              levels and average room rates at Loews Hotels. Future terrorist attacks
              could
              similarly lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could
              harm
              Loews Hotels.

Certain
              of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to the impact of
              hurricanes
              and other natural disasters.

In
              addition to CNA’s exposure to catastrophe losses discussed above, the businesses
              operated by several of our other subsidiaries are exposed to significant
              harm
              from the effects of natural disasters, particularly hurricanes and related
              flooding and other damage. While much of the damage caused by natural
              disasters
              is covered by insurance, we cannot be sure that such coverage will
              be available
              or be adequate in all cases. These risks include the
              following:

Diamond
            Offshore Drilling, Inc

.  Diamond
            Offshore operates its offshore rig fleet in waters that can be severely
            impacted
            by hurricanes and other natural disasters, including the U.S. Gulf of
            Mexico. In
            late August 2005, one of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up drilling rigs, the

Ocean
            Warwick

,
            was
            seriously damaged during Hurricane Katrina and other rigs in Diamond’s fleet and
            its warehouse in New Iberia, Louisiana sustained lesser damage in Hurricanes
            Katrina or Rita, or in some cases both storms. In addition to damaging
            or
            destroying rig equipment, some or all of which may be covered by insurance,
            catastrophes of this kind result in additional operating expenses for
            Diamond,
            including the cost of reconnaissance aircraft, rig crew over-time and
            employee
            assistance, hurricane relief supplies, temporary housing and office space
            and
            the rental of mooring equipment and others which may not be covered by
            insurance.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline Partners, LP.

A
            substantial portion of the Gulf South pipeline assets and a smaller portion
            of
            the Texas Gas pipeline assets are located in the Gulf Coast region of
            the United
            States and, as such, are exposed to the impact of hurricanes, such as
            Hurricanes
            Katrina and Rita which struck that region in 2005. Boardwalk Pipeline
            experienced a variety of damage from those storms, including damage to
            its
            physical facilities and rights of way, loss of customers, such as the
            City of
            New Orleans, damaged or destroyed by the storm and loss of natural gas
            supply
            from facilities of suppliers damaged or destroyed by the storm. In addition,
            Boardwalk Pipeline could be required to relocate some of its pipeline
            facilities, possibly at its expense, as the Gulf Coast region is reconstructed.

Loews
            Hotels.

Hotels
            operated by Loews Hotels are exposed to damage, business interruption
            and
            reductions in travel and tourism in markets affected by significant natural
            disasters such as hurricanes. For example, Loews Hotels’ properties located in
            Florida and

New
            Orleans suffered significant damage from hurricanes and related flooding
            during
            the past two years.

Certain
            of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local
            governmental regulations.

The
            businesses operated by certain of our subsidiaries are impacted by current
            and
            potential federal, state and local governmental regulations which imposes
            or
            might impose a variety of restrictions and compliance obligations on
            those
            companies. Governmental regulations can also change materially in ways
            that
            could adversely affect those companies. Risks faced by our subsidiaries
            related
            to governmental regulation include the following:

CNA
            Financial Corporation.

The
            insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation
            and
            supervision throughout the United States. Most insurance regulations
            are
            designed to protect the interests of CNA’s policyholders rather than its
            investors. Each state in which CNA does business has established supervisory
            agencies that regulate the manner in which CNA does business. Their regulations
            relate to, among other things:

·

standards
                      of solvency, including risk-based capital
                      measurements;

·

restrictions
                      on the nature, quality and concentration of
                      investments;

·

restrictions
                      on CNA’s ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of
                      insurance;

            Risk Factors

·

the
                        required use of certain methods of accounting and
                        reporting;

·

the
                        establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and
                        other
                        purposes;

·

potential
                        assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims
                        against impaired,
                        insolvent or failed insurance
                        companies;

·

licensing
                        of insurers and agents;

·

approval
                      of policy forms; and

·

limitations
                      on the ability of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to
                      us.

Regulatory
            powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates
            not be
            excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. CNA also is required
            by the
            states to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered
            eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance
            and the
            level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share
            of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its
            respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each
            state.

Lorillard
            Tobacco Company

.
            A wide
            variety of federal laws limit the advertising, sale and use of cigarettes,
            and
            these laws have proliferated in recent years. If the U.S. Food and Drug
            Administration (“FDA”) is granted authority to regulate tobacco products, as has
            been proposed for many years, Lorillard believes such regulation would
            provide
            Philip Morris, as the largest tobacco company in the country, with a
            competitive
            advantage. Lorillard believes that FDA regulations could:

·

require
                      larger and more severe health warnings on packs and cartons;

·

ban
                      the use of descriptors on tobacco products, such as “low-tar” and “light”;

·

require
                      the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers;

·

require
                      pre-market approval by the FDA for claims made with respect
                      to reduced
                      risk or reduced exposure products;

·

allow
                      the FDA to require the reduction or elimination of nicotine
                      or any other
                      compound in cigarettes;

·

allow
                      the FDA to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in
                      conventional
                      cigarettes;

·

place
                      more severe restrictions on the advertising, marketing and
                      sales of
                      cigarettes;

·

permit
                      state regulation of labeling and advertising and eliminate
                      the existing
                      federal preemption of such regulation; and

·

grant
                      the FDA the authority to impose broad additional restrictions.

In
            addition, some states have enacted or proposed regulations, including
            with
            respect to mandatory disclosure of ingredients, including flavorings,
            some of
            which are trade secrets. State and local laws or rules that prohibit
            or restrict
            smoking in public places and workplaces continue to be enacted and proposed.
            Lorillard cannot predict the ultimate impact of these laws or regulatory
            proposals, but believes they will continue to reduce sales and increase
            costs.
            Extensive and inconsistent regulation by multiple states could prove
            to be
            particularly disruptive to Lorillard’s business.

Diamond
            Offshore Drilling, Inc.

Diamond
            Offshore’s operations are affected from time to time in varying degrees by
            governmental laws and regulations. The drilling industry is dependent
            on demand
            for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and, accordingly,
            is
            affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the energy business
            generally. Diamond may be required to make significant capital expenditures
            to
            comply with governmental laws and

regulations.
              It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future
              add
              significantly to Diamond’s operating costs or may significantly limit drilling
              activity.

Boardwalk
              Pipeline Partners, LP.

Boardwalk
              Pipeline’s natural gas transportation, gathering and storage operations are
              subject to extensive regulation by FERC and the U.S. Department of
              Transportation, among other federal and state authorities. In addition
              to FERC
              rules and regulations related to the rates Boardwalk can charge for
              its
              services, which are discussed above, FERC’s regulatory authority also extends
              to:

·

operating
                      terms and conditions of service;

·

the
                      types of services Boardwalk may offer to Boardwalk’s customers;

·

construction
                      of new facilities;

·

acquisition,
                      extension or abandonment of services or facilities;

·

accounts
                      and records; and

·

relationships
                      with affiliated companies involved in all aspects of the natural
                      gas and
                      electricity businesses.

FERC
            action in any of these areas or modifications of its current regulations
            can
            adversely impact Boardwalk’s ability to compete for business, the costs incurred
            in its operations, the construction of new facilities or Boardwalk’s ability to
            recover the full cost of operating its pipelines.

The
            United States Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety
            requires
            pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively
            evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and take additional measures
            to
            protect pipeline segments located in what the rule refers to as “high
            consequence areas” where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm.
            Compliance with these requirements may require additional reporting by
            Boardwalk
            Pipeline, the replacement of some of its pipeline segments, the addition
            of
            monitoring equipment, and more frequent inspection or testing of its
            pipeline
            facilities.

The
            businesses operated by our subsidiaries face intense
            competition.

Each
            of
            the businesses operated by our subsidiaries faces intense competition
            in its
            industry and will be harmed materially if it is unable to compete effectively.
            Certain of the competitive risks faced by those companies include:

CNA
            Financial Corporation

.
            All
            aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and CNA must
            continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products
            and
            services. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products,
            price,
            services, ratings and financial strength. CNA may lose business to competitors
            offering competitive insurance products at lower prices. CNA competes
            with a
            large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities
            for both
            distributors and customers. In addition, the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act
            of 1999 has
            encouraged growth in the number, size and financial strength of CNA’s potential
            competitors by removing barriers that previously prohibited holding companies
            from simultaneously owning commercial banks, insurers and securities
            firms.

Lorillard
            Tobacco Company

.
            The
            cigarette market is highly concentrated, as Lorillard’s two major competitors,
            Philip Morris USA and Reynolds American, Inc., had a combined market
            share of
            approximately 76.9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. Reynolds
            American owns the third and fourth leading menthol brands, Kool and Salem,
            which
            had a combined share of the menthol segment of approximately 19.0% for
            the
            twelve months ended December 31, 2005. This concentration of U.S. market
            share
            could make it more difficult for Lorillard to compete for shelf space
            in retail
            outlets, access to which is already exacerbated by the restrictive marketing
            programs of these larger competitors, and could impact price competition
            among
            menthol brands.

In
              addition to competing with major cigarette makers, Lorillard competes
              with a
              significant number of smaller competitors, many of which are not subject
              to the
              same payment obligations under the State Settlement Agreements


Item

            Risk Factors

as
            Lorillard and thereby enjoy competitive cost and pricing advantages.
            As a result
            of their cost and pricing advantages, the smaller manufacturers have
            developed
            meaningful market share, principally in the deep discount cigarette segment.
            Market share for the deep discount brands decreased 1.4 share points
            from 14.7%
            in the fourth quarter of 2004 to 13.3% in the fourth quarter of 2005,
            as
            estimated by Management Science Associates. Lorillard’s focus on the premium
            market and its obligations under the State Settlement Agreements make
            it very
            difficult to compete successfully in the deep discount market.

Diamond
            Offshore Drilling, Inc.

The
            offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous
            participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market
            share.
            Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other
            resources than Diamond Offshore does. Drilling contracts are traditionally
            awarded on a competitive bid basis. Intense price competition is often
            the
            primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a
            job,
            although rig availability and the quality and technical capability of
            service
            and equipment may also be considered. Mergers among oil and natural gas
            exploration and production companies have reduced the number of available
            customers. Significant new rig construction could also intensify price
            competition. Diamond believes that there are currently more than 60 drilling
            units, primarily jack-up rigs, on order for delivery between 2006 and
            2009 and
            approximately another 15 jack-up and semisubmersible rigs are currently
            being
            reactivated or scheduled for reactivation, upgrade or conversion for
            drilling
            use. In addition, improvements in dayrates and expectations of sustained
            improvements in rig utilization rates and dayrates may result in the
            construction of additional new rigs or reactivations. These increases
            in rig
            supply could result in depressed rig utilization and greater price
            competition.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline Partners, LP.

Boardwalk Pipeline competes primarily with other interstate and intrastate
            pipelines in the transportation, gathering and storage of natural gas.
            Natural
            gas also competes with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk Pipeline’s
            customers, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The principal elements
            of
            competition among pipelines are rates, terms of service, access to gas
            supplies,
            flexibility and reliability. FERC’s policies promoting competition in gas
            markets are having the effect of increasing the gas transportation options
            for
            Boardwalk Pipeline’s traditional customer base. As a result, Texas Gas has begun
            to experience some “turnback” of firm capacity as existing transportation
            service agreements expire and are not renewed. If Texas Gas is unable
            to
            remarket this capacity or can remarket it only at substantially discounted
            rates
            compared to previous contracts, it may have to bear the costs associated
            with
            the turned back capacity.

Boardwalk
            Pipeline also competes against intrastate pipelines which have a significant
            advantage because of the absence of FERC regulation. In view of the greater
            rate, construction and service flexibility available to intrastate pipelines,
            Boardwalk Pipeline may lose customers and throughput to intrastate competitors.
            Increased competition could reduce the volumes of gas transported by
            Boardwalk
            Pipeline could force it to lower its transportation or storage
            rates.

We
            and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation.

We
            and
            our subsidiaries are subject to litigation in the normal course of business.
            Litigation is costly and time consuming to defend and could result in
            a material
            expense. Please read information on litigation included in the MD&A under
            Item 7 and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

CNA
            faces substantial risks of litigation and arbitration beyond ordinary
            course
            claims and APMT matters, which may contain assertions in excess of amounts
            covered by reserves that CNA has established. These matters may be difficult
            to
            assess or quantify and may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate
            amounts
            that include punitive or treble damages. Accordingly, unfavorable results
            in
            these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our results
            of
            operations.

              other key personnel to operate our businesses successfully.

Our
              success and the success of our operating subsidiaries substantially
              depends upon
              each company’s ability to attract and retain high quality executives and other
              qualified employees. In many instances, there may be only a limited
              number of
              available qualified executives in the business lines in which we and
              our
              subsidiaries compete and the loss of one or more key employees or the
              inability
              to attract and retain other talented personnel could impede the successful
              implementation of our and our subsidiaries’ business strategies. For example,
              Lorillard is currently experiencing difficulty in identifying and hiring
              qualified personnel in some areas of its business, due primarily to
              the health
              and social issues associated with the tobacco industry. In addition,
              shortages
              in the supply of the highly

skilled
              personnel needed to operate and provide technical and support services
              for
              Diamond’s drilling units could arise to the extent demand for drilling services
              and the size of the worldwide industry fleet continue to increase,
              which could
              create upward pressure on wages.

Certain
            of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with
            environmental laws.

Certain
            of our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and/or financial exposure
            related
            to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws or. Laws
            and
            regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in
            recent
            years, and may in some cases impose “strict liability,” rendering a person
            liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault
            on the
            part of that person. These laws and regulations may expose us and our
            subsidiaries to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by
            others or
            for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time
            they were
            performed. For example:

·

as
                      discussed in more detail above, many of CNA’s policyholders have made
                      claims for defense costs and indemnification in connection
                      with
                      environmental pollution matters;

·

as
                      an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in navigable
                      U.S. waters and
                      some offshore areas, Diamond Offshore may be liable for, among
                      other
                      things, damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills
                      related
                      to those operations, including for conduct of or conditions
                      caused by
                      others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable
                      laws at the
                      time they were performed;

·

the
                      risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is
                      inherent in
                      natural gas transportation, gathering and storage, including
                      with respect
                      to, among other things, the handling and discharge of solid
                      and hazardous
                      waste from Boardwalk’s facilities, compliance with clean air standards and
                      the abandonment and reclamation of Boardwalk’s facilities, sites and other
                      properties; and

Bulova
                      no longer manufactures time pieces; however, it has substantial
                      ongoing
                      clean-up obligations and will continue to incur substantial
                      costs, which
                      could exceed Bulova’s current estimates, related to contaminated
                      properties that were previously operated by Bulova as manufacturing
                      sites.

Tobacco
            Related - Approximately 4,000 product liability cases are pending against
            cigarette manufacturers in the United States. Lorillard is a defendant
            in
            approximately 3,675 of these cases. The Company is a defendant in six
            of the
            pending cases. Information with respect to tobacco related legal proceedings
            is
            incorporated by reference to Note 20, Legal Proceedings - Tobacco Related
            of the
            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Additional
            information regarding tobacco related legal proceedings is contained
            below and
            in Exhibit 99.01.

The
            pending product liability cases are composed of the following types of
            cases:

Conventional
            product liability cases are brought by individuals who allege cancer
            or other
            health effects caused by smoking cigarettes, by using smokeless tobacco
            products, by addiction to tobacco, or by exposure to environmental tobacco
            smoke. Approximately 1,300 cases are pending, including approximately
            1,025
            cases against Lorillard. The 1,300 cases include approximately 975 cases
            pending
            in a single West Virginia court that have been consolidated for trial.
            Lorillard
            is a defendant in nearly 885 of the 975 consolidated West Virginia cases.
            The
            Company is a defendant in two of the conventional product liability
            cases.

Class
            action cases are purported to be brought on behalf of large numbers of
            individuals for damages allegedly caused by smoking. Eleven of these
            cases are
            pending against Lorillard. One of these cases,

Schwab v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
            is on
            behalf of a purported nationwide class composed of purchasers of light
            cigarettes. The Company is a defendant in two of the class action cases.
            Lorillard is not a defendant in approximately 35 additional lights class
            action
            cases that are pending against other cigarette manufacturers. Reference
            is made
            to Exhibit 99.01 to this Report for a list of pending Class Action Cases
            in
            which Lorillard is a party.

Reimbursement
            cases are brought by or on behalf of entities who seek reimbursement
            of expenses
            incurred in providing health care to individuals who allegedly were injured
            by
            smoking. Plaintiffs in these cases have included the U.S. federal government,
            U.S. state and local governments, foreign governmental entities, hospitals
            or
            hospital districts, American Indian tribes, labor unions, private companies,
            and
            private citizens. Lorillard is a defendant in six of the seven Reimbursement
            cases pending against cigarette manufacturers in the United States. The
            Company
            is a defendant in two of the pending Reimbursement cases. Lorillard is
            a
            defendant in an additional case pending in Israel. Reference is made
            to Exhibit
            99.01 to this Report for a list of pending Reimbursement Cases in which
            Lorillard is a party.

Included
            in this category is the suit filed by the federal government,

United States of America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
            that
            sought disgorgement and injunctive relief. During February of 2005, an
            appellate
            court ruled that the government may not seek disgorgement of profits.
            The U.S.
            Supreme Court denied the government’s application seeking review of this
            verdict, although plaintiff could again seek appellate review of this
            issue
            following a verdict. A bench trial of this matter began during September
            of
            2004. All evidence has been submitted and the parties made their final
            post-trial submissions during the fourth quarter of 2005. The court could
            issue
            its verdict at any time.

Contribution
            cases are brought by private companies, such as asbestos manufacturers
            or their
            insurers, who are seeking contribution or indemnity for court claims
            they
            incurred on behalf of individuals injured by their products but who also
            allegedly were injured by smoking cigarettes. One such case is pending
            against
            Lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers. Reference is made to Exhibit
            99.01
            to this Report for the identity of the pending Contribution case in which
            Lorillard is a party.

Tobacco
            Related - (Continued)

Flight
            Attendant cases are brought by non-smoking flight attendants alleging
            injury
            from exposure to environmental smoke in the cabins of aircraft. Plaintiffs
            in
            these cases may not seek punitive damages for injuries that arose prior
            to
            January 15, 1997. Lorillard is a defendant in each of the approximately
            2,625
            pending Flight Attendant cases.

Excluding
            the flight attendant and the consolidated West Virginia suits, approximately
            product liability cases are pending against cigarette manufacturers in
            U.S.
            courts. Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 165 of the 385 cases.
            The
            Company, which is not a defendant in any of the flight attendant or the
            consolidated West Virginia matters, is a defendant in six of the
            actions.

MANAGEMENT’S
            REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our
            management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
            control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)
            and
            15d-15(f)) for us. Our internal control system was designed to provide
            reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding
            the
            preparation and fair presentation of published financial
            statements.

There
            are
            inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any control system, however
            well
            designed, including the possibility of human error and the possible
            circumvention or overriding of controls. Further, the design of a control
            system
            must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
            of
            controls must be considered relative to their costs. Management must
            make
            judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of
            any
            specific control measure. The design of a control system also is based
            in part
            upon assumptions and judgments made by management about the likelihood
            of future
            events, and there can be no assurance that a control will be effective
            under all
            potential future conditions. As a result, even an effective system of
            internal
            control over financial reporting can provide no more than reasonable
            assurance with respect to the fair presentation of financial statements
            and the
            processes under which they were prepared.

Our
            management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
            financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment,
            management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
            Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal Control -
            Integrated Framework

. Based on this assessment, our management believes
            that, as of December 31, 2005, our internal control over financial
            reporting was ineffective because of material weaknesses at
            our 91% owned subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation (“CNA”).

A
              material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control
              deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a
              material
              misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not
              be prevented
              or detected. Due to the circumstances described below which resulted in a
              restatement of our financial statements for prior years, our management
              has
              concluded that we had two material weaknesses in our internal control
              over
              financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.

First,
            CNA did not have an effectively designed control process in place to
            ensure
            adequate oversight, analysis, reconciliation, documentation and periodic
            evaluation of the results and balances that comprise its net assets of
            businesses reported as discontinued operations (“discontinued operations”).
            There was also a lack of understanding of subsidiary ledger detail, and
            CNA
            failed to eliminate intercompany activity within its discontinued operations
            and
            between discontinued and continuing operations. As a result, the balances
            related to discontinued operations were incorrectly established in CNA’s current
            general ledger system in 1997 in connection with a general ledger conversion,
            resulting in an overstatement of the reported net assets of discontinued
            operations. In addition, CNA’s evaluation of periodic results of the businesses
            accounted for as discontinued operations was ineffective, therefore the
            income
            or loss from discontinued operations was misstated.

Second,
            CNA did not have an effectively designed control process to ensure correct
            classification of its cash flow activity which is reflected in
            our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. CNA’s classification errors in
            prior financial statements involved the presentation of certain cash flow
            components related to trading securities, equity method investees, investment
            contracts and cumulative translation adjustments.

As
            a
            result, our net cash flows from continuing operations
            for operating, investing and financing activities were increased
            or decreased for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. These
            classification errors had no impact on the total change in cash from
            continuing operations within our Consolidated Statements of Cash
            Flows.


Since
              the
              time the above described control deficiencies were identified, remediation
              efforts have been undertaken. CNA has completed an analysis of the activity
              historically recorded related to its discontinued operations as well
              as a
              complete analysis of the components of its Consolid

ated
              Statements of Cash Flows. The control processes surrounding CNA’s oversight of
              discontinued operations as well as the preparation of its Consolidated
              Statements of Cash Flows have been redesigned and strengthened.

The
              control deficiencies will be fully remediated when, in the

opinion
              of our and CNA’s management, the revised control processes have been operating
              for a sufficient period of time to provide reasonable assurance as
              to their
              effectiveness.

Deloitte
            & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that
            audited our financial statements included in
            this report, has issued a report on our assessment
            of our internal control over financial reporting. The report of
            Deloitte & Touche LLP follows this report.


REPORT
            OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
            the
            Board of Directors and Shareholders of Loews Corporation:

We
            have
            audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
            Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Loews
            Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) did not maintain effective internal
            control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, because of
            the effect
            of the material weaknesses as described below based on criteria established
            in

Internal
            Control—Integrated Framework

issued
            by
            the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
            The
            Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
            over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
            of internal
            control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
            opinion on
            management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
            internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
            conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
            we plan
            and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
            internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
            respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
            over
            financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
            the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
            such
            other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
            believe
            that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
            company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by,
            or
            under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
            financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
            by the
            company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
            reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
            and the
            preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
            with
            generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
            financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
            to
            the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
            fairly
            reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
            (2)
            provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
            to
            permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
            accepted
            accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
            are
            being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
            of
            the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
            or timely
            detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
            assets that could have a material effect on the financial
            statements.

Because
            of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
            including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
            of
            controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented
            or
            detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
            effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
            periods
            are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
            of
            changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
            or
            procedures may deteriorate.

A
            material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant
            deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
            misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be
            prevented
            or detected. The following material weaknesses have been identified and
            included
            in management’s assessment: (1) The Company’s subsidiary CNA Financial
            Corporation (“CNA”) did not have an effectively designed control process to
            adequately monitor and evaluate the accounting for businesses reported
            as
            discontinued operations (

“

discontinued
            operations

”

).
            There was also a lack of understanding of subsidiary ledger detail, and
            CNA
            failed to eliminate intercompany activity within its discontinued operations
            and
            between discontinued and continuing operations. As a result, the balances
            related to discontinued operations were incorrectly established in CNA’s current
            general ledger system in 1997 in connection with a general ledger conversion,
            resulting in an overstatement of the reported net assets of discontinued
            operations. In addition, CNA’s evaluation of periodic results of the businesses
            accounted for as discontinued operations was ineffective, therefore the
            income
            or loss from discontinued operations was misstated. (2) CNA did not have an
            effectively designed control process to ensure correct classification
            of cash
            flow activity which is included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
            Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. The classification
            errors involved the presentation of certain cash flow components related
            to
            trading securities, equity method investees, investment contracts and


cumulative
            translation adjustments. These material weaknesses were considered in
            determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in
            our audit
            of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for
            the year
            ended December 31, 2005, and this report does not affect our report on
            such financial statements and financial statement schedules.

In
            our
            opinion, management’s assessment that the Company did not maintain effective
            internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 is
            fairly
            stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in
            Internal
            Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
            of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, because of the effects
            of the
            material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives
            of the
            control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control
            over
            financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established
            in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
            Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
            do not
            express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management’s
            statements regarding the remediation of the material weaknesses
            included in paragraph 8 of Management’s Report on Internal Control over
            Financial Reporting.

We
            have
            also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting
            Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s consolidated financial statements
            and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December
            31, 2005
            and our report dated March 8, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion
            on those
            consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules and
            included
            an explanatory paragraph relating to the restatements discussed in Note
            25 to
            the financial statements.

REPORT
            OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
            the
            Board of Directors and Shareholders of Loews Corporation:

We
            have
            audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Loews Corporation
            and
            its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
            related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows
            for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 as
            included on
            pages 132 through 231 in this Form 10-K. Our audits also included the
            financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial
            statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of
            the
            Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
            financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our
            audits.

We
            conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”). Those standards require
            that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
            whether
            the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
            includes
            examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
            in
            the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
            principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
            as
            evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
            our
            audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
            our
            opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
            material
            respects, the financial position of Loews Corporation and its subsidiaries
            as of
            December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their
            cash
            flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005,
            in
            conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
            States of
            America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when
            considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
            taken as a
            whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set
            forth
            therein.

We
            have
            also audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the effectiveness
            of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
            2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal
            Control—Integrated Framework

issued
            by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
            and our
            report dated March 8, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
            assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
            reporting and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
            control over financial reporting.

As
            disclosed in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying
            consolidated financial statements for 2004 and 2003 have been restated.

Unless
      the context otherwise requires, references in this report to “Loews
      Corporation,” “we,” “our,” “us” or like terms refer to the business of Loews
      Corporation excluding its subsidiaries.

The
        Company restated its financial statements for the years 2001 through 2004,
        as
        well as its interim financial statements through September 30, 2005. The
        restatement was to correct the accounting for discontinued operations acquired
        in CNA

’

s
        merger with The Continental Corporation in 1995. A recent review of discontinued
        operations identified an overstatement of the net assets of these discontinued
        operations and errors in CNA

s accounting
        for
        the periodic results of these operations. The Company also restated the
        Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended 2004 and 2003 to
        correct classification errors. Please read information on the restatements
        included in Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
        under Item 8.

The
      following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1A, Risk Factors,
      of this Form 10-K.

Consolidated
      Financial Results

Consolidated
      net income (including both the Loews Group and Carolina Group) for the year
      ended December 31, 2005 was $1,211.6 million, compared to $1,215.8 million
      in
      the prior year.

                sales of
                10,000,000 shares of Carolina Group stock in each of November of
                2005 and
                December of 2004. Net income per share of Carolina Group stock was
                not
                impacted by these sales.

Net
      income attributable to Loews common stock for the year ended 2005 amounted
      to
      $960.3 million, or $5.16 per share, compared to $1,031.3 million, or $5.56
      per
      share, in the prior year. The results for the year ended December 31, 2005
      include a benefit of $136.5 million related to a federal income tax settlement
      due primarily to net refund interest and the release of federal income tax
      reserves, and catastrophe losses at CNA of $304.8 million (after tax and
      minority interest) primarily related to Hurricanes Wilma, Katrina, Rita, Dennis
      and Ophelia. Net

income
      also reflects the impact of CNA’s significant commutations of reinsurance finite
      contracts of $236.4 million (after tax and minority interest) and
      non-commutation related adverse net development of $245.5 million (after tax
      and
      minority interest), partially offset by improved results at Diamond Offshore.
      In
      2004, CNA incurred catastrophe losses of $178.9 million (after tax and minority
      interest) also primarily related to hurricanes. Net income for 2004 also
      included $116.5 million (after taxes) from an affiliate’s sale of four
      ultra-large oil tankers.

Net
        income attributable to Loews common
        stock includes net investment losses of $10.3 million (after tax and minority
        interest) compared to net investment losses of $144.9 million (after tax
        and
        minority interest) in the prior year due primarily to a loss of $352.9 million
        (after tax and minority interest) in 2004 from CNA’s sale of its individual life
        insurance business.

Net
      income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the year ended 2005 was $251.3
      million, or $3.62 per Carolina Group share, compared to $184.5 million, or
      $3.15
      per Carolina Group share, in the prior year and

is
      primarily due to improved overall results and our sales of 10 million shares
      of
      Carolina Group stock in each of November of 2005 and December of 2004. Net
      income per share of Carolina Group stock was not impacted by these
      sales.

Consolidated
      revenues for the year ended 2005 amounted to $16.0 billion compared to $15.2
      billion in the prior year. The increase in revenues is primarily due to the
      acquisition of Gulf South in December of 2004, improved results at Diamond
      Offshore and the impact of a loss recorded in 2004 related to CNA’s sale of its
      individual life business.

Classes
      of Common Stock

Our
      issuance of Carolina Group stock has resulted in a two class common stock
      structure for us. Carolina Group stock, commonly called a tracking stock, is
      intended to reflect the economic performance of a defined group of our assets
      and liabilities referred to as the Carolina Group. The principal assets and
      liabilities attributed to the Carolina Group are:

·

our
                100% stock ownership interest in Lorillard,
                Inc.;

·

notional,
                intergroup debt owed by the Carolina Group to the Loews Group ($1.6
                billion outstanding at December 31, 2005), bearing interest at the
                annual
                rate of 8.0% and, subject to optional prepayment, due December 31,
                2021;
                and

·

any
                and all liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of or related
                to
                tobacco or tobacco-related
                businesses.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, the outstanding Carolina Group stock represents a 45.03%
      economic interest in the performance of the Carolina Group. The Loews Group
      consists of all of our assets and liabilities other than the 45.03% economic
      interest represented by the outstanding Carolina Group stock, and includes
      as an
      asset the notional, intergroup debt of the Carolina Group.

The
      existence of separate classes of common stock could give rise to occasions
      where
      the interests of the holders of Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock
      diverge or conflict or appear to diverge or conflict. Subject to its fiduciary
      duties, our board of directors could, in its sole discretion, occasionally
      make
      determinations or implement policies that disproportionately affect the groups
      or the different classes of stock. For example, our board of directors may
      decide to reallocate assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows
      between groups, without the consent of shareholders. The board of directors
      would not be required to select the option that would result in the highest
      value for holders of Carolina Group stock.

As
      a
      result of the flexibility provided to our board of directors, it might be
      difficult for investors to assess the future prospects of the Carolina Group
      based on the Carolina Group’s past performance.

The
      creation of the Carolina Group and the issuance of Carolina Group stock does
      not
      change our ownership of Lorillard, Inc. or Lorillard, Inc.’s status as a
      separate legal entity. The Carolina Group and the Loews Group are notional
      groups that are intended to reflect the performance of the defined sets of
      assets and liabilities of each such

group
      as
      described above. The Carolina Group and the Loews Group are not separate legal
      entities and the attribution of our assets and liabilities to the Loews Group
      or
      the Carolina Group does not affect title to the assets or responsibility for
      the
      liabilities.

Holders
      of our common stock and of Carolina Group stock are shareholders of Loews
      Corporation and are subject to the risks related to an equity investment in
      us.

Parent
      Company Structure

We
      are a
      holding company and derive substantially all of our cash flow from our
      subsidiaries, principally Lorillard and Boardwalk Pipeline. We rely upon our
      invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate
      the
      funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends
      to
      our stockholders. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject
      to, among other things, the availability of sufficient funds in such
      subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance
      subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by
      regulated insurance companies. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will
      generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims
      and those of our creditors and shareholders (see Liquidity and Capital Resources
      - CNA Financial, below).

At
      December 31, 2005, the book value per share of Loews common stock was $70.93,
      compared to $65.56 at December 31, 2004.

CRITICAL
      ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The
      preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
      (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
      reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Actual
      results could differ from those estimates.

The
      consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared
      in
      accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis. We continually evaluate
      the
      accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial
      statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience,
      evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and
      various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts
      and circumstances.

We
      consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an
      understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application
      places the most significant demands on our judgment. Due to the inherent
      uncertainties involved with this type of judgment, actual results could differ
      significantly from estimates and may have a material adverse impact on our
      results of operations or equity.

Insurance
      Reserves

Insurance
      reserves are established for both short and long-duration insurance contracts.
      Short-duration contracts are primarily related to property and casualty
      insurance policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates
      of the amount of loss, including amounts for known and unknown claims.
      Long-duration contracts typically include traditional life insurance and long
      term care products and are estimated using actuarial estimates about mortality
      and morbidity, as well as assumptions about expected investment returns. Workers
      compensation lifetime claim reserves and accident and health claim reserves
      are
      calculated using mortality and morbidity assumptions based on CNA’s own and
      industry experience, and are discounted at interest rates that range from 3.5%
      to 6.5% at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The reserve for unearned premiums on
      property and casualty and accident and health contracts represents the portion
      of premiums written related to the unexpired terms of coverage. The inherent
      risks associated with the reserving process are discussed in the Reserves -
      Estimates and Uncertainties section below.

Reinsurance

Amounts
      recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim
      and
      claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are
      reported as receivables in the Consolidated Balance

Sheets.
      The ceding of insurance does not discharge CNA of its primary liability under
      insurance contracts written by CNA. An exposure exists with respect to property
      and casualty and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is
      unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under
      reinsurance agreements. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded
      on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer
      solvency, CNA’s past experience and current economic conditions.

Reinsurance
      accounting allows for contractual cash flows to be reflected as premiums and
      losses, as compared to deposit accounting, which requires cash flows to be
      reflected as assets and liabilities. To qualify for reinsurance accounting,
      reinsurance agreements must include risk transfer. Considerable judgment by
      management may be necessary to determine if risk transfer requirements are
      met.
      CNA believes it has appropriately applied reinsurance accounting principles
      in
      its evaluation of risk transfer. However, CNA’s evaluation of risk transfer and
      the resulting accounting could be challenged in connection with regulatory
      reviews or possible changes in accounting and/or financial reporting rules
      related to reinsurance, which could materially adversely affect our results
      of
      operations and/or equity. Further information on CNA’s reinsurance program is
      included in the Reinsurance section below and Note 18 of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Tobacco
      and Other Litigation

Lorillard
      and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial
      litigation. Plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of
      compensatory damages and punitive damages, although some seek damages ranging
      into the billions of dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble
      damages, statutory damages, disgorgement of profits, equitable and injunctive
      relief, and medical monitoring, among other damages.

Lorillard
      believes that it has valid defenses to the cases pending against it. Lorillard
      also believes it has valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against
      it.
      To the extent we are a defendant in any of the lawsuits, we believe that we
      are
      not a proper defendant in these matters and have moved or plan to move for
      dismissal of all such claims against us. While Lorillard intends to defend
      vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation, it is not possible to
      predict the outcome of any of this litigation. Litigation is subject to many
      uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided
      unfavorably. Lorillard may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle
      particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so.

Except
      for the impact of the State Settlement Agreements as described in Note 20 of
      the
      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report,
      management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of
      loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation and,
      therefore, no provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements
      for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible that our results of operations,
      cash
      flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by an
      unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future litigation.

CNA
      is
      also involved in various legal proceedings that have arisen during the ordinary
      course of business. CNA evaluates the facts and circumstances of each situation,
      and when CNA determines it necessary, a liability is estimated and recorded.
      Please read Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated
      Financial Statements included in Item 8.

Valuation
      of Investments and Impairment of Securities

Invested
      assets are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and credit
      risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain invested assets and
      the
      level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of these assets, it is
      possible that changes in risks in the near term could have an adverse material
      impact on our results of operations or equity.

CNA’s
      investment portfolio is subject to market declines below book value that may
      be
      other-than-temporary. CNA has an Impairment Committee, which reviews the
      investment portfolio on a quarterly basis, with ongoing analysis as new
      information becomes available. Any decline that is determined to be
      other-than-temporary is recorded as an impairment loss in the results of
      operations in the period in which the determination occurred. Further
      information on CNA’s process for evaluating impairments is included in Note 2 of
      the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item
      8.

Critical

-
                (Continued)

Securities
      in the parent company’s investment portfolio that are not part of its cash
      management activities are classified as trading securities in order to reflect
      our investment philosophy. These investments are carried at fair value with
      the
      net unrealized gain or loss included in the Consolidated Statements of
      Operations.

Long
      Term Care Products

Reserves
      and deferred acquisition costs for CNA’s long term care products are based on
      certain assumptions including morbidity, policy persistency and interest rates.
      Actual experience may differ from these assumptions. The recoverability of
      deferred acquisition costs and the adequacy of the reserves are contingent
      on
      actual experience related to these key assumptions and other factors including
      potential future premium increases and future health care cost trends. Our
      results of operations and/or equity may be materially adversely affected if
      actual experience varies significantly from CNA’s assumptions.

Pension
      and Postretirement Benefit Obligations

We
      are
      required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the
      liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit
      obligations to employees under our benefit plans. The assumptions that have
      the
      most impact on pension costs are the discount rate, the expected return on
      plan
      assets and the rate of compensation increases. These assumptions are evaluated
      relative to current market factors such as inflation, interest rates and fiscal
      and monetary policies. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact
      on pension obligations and pension expense.

In
      determining the discount rate assumption, we utilized current market information
      and liability information provided by our plan actuaries, including a discounted
      cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations. In particular,
      the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly
      rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our
      plan
      liabilities. The Moody’s Aa Corporate Bond Index is consistently used as the
      basis for the change in discount rate from the last measurement date with this
      measure confirmed by the yield on other broad bond indices. In
      addition, in 2005, we supplemented our discount rate decision with a yield
      curve analysis. The yield curve was applied to expected future retirement plan
      payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics
      of
      the plans. The yield curve was developed by the plans’ actuaries and is a

RESULTS
      OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT

CNA
      Financial

Insurance
      operations are conducted by subsidiaries of CNA Financial Corporation (“CNA”).
      CNA is a 91% owned subsidiary.

CNA
      manages its property and casualty operations in two operating segments which
      represent CNA’s core operations: Standard Lines and Specialty Lines. The
      non-core operations are managed in the Life and Group Non-Core and Other
      Insurance segments. Standard Lines includes standard property and casualty
      coverages sold to small and middle market commercial businesses primarily
      through an independent agency distribution system, and excess and surplus lines,
      as well as insurance and risk management products sold to large corporations
      in
      the U.S., as well as globally. Specialty Lines includes professional, financial
      and specialty property and casualty products and services. Life and Group
      Non-Core primarily includes the results of the life and group lines of business
      sold or placed in run-off. Other Insurance includes the results of certain
      property and casualty lines of business placed in run-off, including CNA’s
      former assumed reinsurance business (formerly included in the Property and
      Casualty segment). This segment also includes the results related to the
      centralized adjusting and settlement of Asbestos, Environment Pollution and
      Mass
      Tort (“APMT”) claims as well as the results of CNA’s participation in voluntary
      insurance pools, which are primarily in run-off, and various other non-insurance
      operations.

Results
                of Operations - CNA Financial -
                (Continued)

Throughout
      this MD&A the results of operations include discussion and results for all
      of CNA’s businesses, including those sold or exited as described
      above.

Net
      Prior Year Development

The
      results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
      were
      impacted by net prior year development. Changes in estimates of claim and
      allocated claim adjustment expense reserves and premium accruals for prior
      accident years are defined as net prior year development within this MD&A.
      These changes can be favorable or unfavorable. The development discussed below
      excludes the impact of the provision for uncollectible reinsurance, but includes
      the impact of commutations. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements included under Item 8.

CNA
      records favorable or unfavorable premium and claim and allocated claim
      adjustment expense reserve development related to the corporate aggregate
      reinsurance treaties as movements in the claim and allocated claim adjustment
      expense reserves for the accident years covered by the corporate aggregate
      reinsurance treaties indicate such development is required. While the available
      limit of these treaties was fully utilized in 2003, the ceded premiums and
      losses for an individual segment may change in subsequent years because of
      the
      re-estimation of the subject losses or commutations of the underlying contracts.
      In 2005, CNA commuted a corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty. See Note 18
      of
      the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the
      corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties.

The
      following tables summarize net prior year development by segment for the years
      ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. For the Life and Group Non-Core segment
      $5.0 million and $7.0 million of favorable development was recorded in 2005
      and
      2004, and $62.0 million of unfavorable development was recorded in
      2003.

Reserves
      - Estimates and Uncertainties

CNA
      maintains reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim
      and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims
      adjudication process, for claims that have been reported but not yet settled
      (“case reserves”) and claims that have been incurred but not reported (“IBNR”).
      Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reflected as liabilities and
      are
      included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the heading “Insurance
      Reserves.” Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are
      reflected in the results of operations in the period that the need for such
      adjustments is determined. The carried case and IBNR reserves are provided
      in
      the Segment Results section of this MD&A and in Note 9 of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

The
      level
      of reserves CNA maintains represents CNA’s best estimate, as of a particular
      point in time, of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims
      will
      cost based on its assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time.
      Reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex
      estimates that CNA derives, generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve
      estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future
      events, both internal and external, many of which are highly
      uncertain.

Among
      the
      many uncertain future events about which CNA makes assumptions and estimates,
      many of which have become increasingly unpredictable, are claims severity,
      frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, expected interest rates, inflation,
      claims handling and case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and
      pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag
      time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time it is ultimately
      settled, referred to in the insurance industry as the “tail.” These factors must
      be individually considered in relation to CNA’s evaluation of each type of
      business. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable,
      particularly on a prospective basis, and require significant judgment on CNA’s
      part.

Given
      the
      factors described above, it is not possible to quantify precisely the ultimate
      exposure represented by claims and related litigation. As a result, CNA
      regularly reviews the adequacy of its reserves and reassesses its reserve
      estimates as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported
      and settled and additional information becomes available in subsequent
      periods.

In
      addition, CNA is subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential
      claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial,
      social and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and
      may
      continue to have, a negative effect on its business by either extending coverage
      beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size
      of
      claims. Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues
      include:

·

increases
                in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from medical
                products, and exposure to lead;

·

the
                effects of accounting and financial reporting scandals and other
                major
                corporate governance failures, which have resulted in an increase
                in the
                number and size of claims, including director and officer and errors
                and
                omissions insurance claims;

·

class
                action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices;

·

construction
                defect claims, including claims for a broad range of additional insured
                endorsements on policies; and

·

increases
                in the number of claims alleging abuse by members of the clergy,
                including
                passage of legislation to reopen or extend various statutes of
                limitations.

The
      impact of these and other unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage
      issues is difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect the
      adequacy of CNA’s claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to
      future reserve additions. See the Segment Results sections of this MD&A and
      Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item
      for a discussion of changes in reserve estimates and the impact on our results
      of operations.

Results
                of Operations - CNA Financial

                (Continued)

CNA’s
      experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating
      to asbestos, environmental pollution and mass tort (“APMT”) claim and claim
      adjustment expenses is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those
      presented by other claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and
      unreported APMT claims is subject to a higher degree of variability due to
      a
      number of additional factors, including among others:

·

coverage
                issues, including whether certain costs are covered under the policies
                and
                whether policy limits apply;

·

inconsistent
                court decisions and developing legal
                theories;

·

increasingly
                aggressive tactics of plaintiffs’
lawyers;

·

the
                risks and lack of predictability inherent in major
                litigation;

·

changes
                in the volume of asbestos and environmental pollution and mass tort
                claims
                which cannot now be anticipated;

·

continued
                increase in mass tort claims relating to silica and silica-containing
                products;

·

the
                impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase
                in
                claims on any umbrella or excess policies CNA has
                issued;

·

the
                number and outcome of direct actions against CNA;
                and

·

CNA’s
                ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental pollution
                and mass tort claims.

It
      is
      also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment
      and the impact on the future development of APMT claims. This development will
      be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes
      in
      applicable legislation. It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of
      large
      coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant
      legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is
      adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy
      where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties
      and require court approval to be effective. A further uncertainty exists as
      to
      whether a national privately financed trust to replace litigation of asbestos
      claims with payments to claimants from the trust will be established and
      approved through federal legislation, and, if established and approved, whether
      it will contain funding requirements in excess of CNA’s carried loss
      reserves.

Traditional
      actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of
      claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise
      in
      estimating claim and claim adjustment reserves for APMT, particularly in an
      environment of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise
      from
      industry practices and legal, judicial and social conditions. Therefore, these
      traditional actuarial methods and techniques are necessarily supplemented with
      additional estimation techniques and methodologies, many of which involve
      significant judgments that are required of CNA management. Due to the inherent
      uncertainties in estimating reserves for APMT claim and claim adjustment
      expenses and the degree of variability due to, among other things, the factors
      described above, CNA may be required to record material changes in its claim
      and
      claim adjustment expense reserves in the future, should new information become
      available or other developments emerge. See the APMT Reserves section of this
      MD&A and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
      under Item 8 for additional information relating to APMT claims and
      reserves.

CNA’s
      recorded reserves, including APMT reserves, reflect CNA’s best estimate as of a
      particular point in time based upon known facts, current law and CNA’s judgment.
      The reserve analyses performed by CNA’s actuaries result in point estimates. CNA
      uses these point estimates as the primary factor in determining the carried
      reserve. The carried reserve may differ from the actuarial point estimate as
      the
      result of CNA’s consideration of the factors noted above including, but not
      limited to, the potential volatility of the projections associated with the
      specific product being analyzed and the effects of changes in claims handling,
      underwriting and other factors impacting claims costs that may not be
      quantifiable through actuarial analysis. For APMT reserves, the reserve analysis
      performed by CNA’s actuaries results in both a point estimate and a range. CNA
      uses the point estimate as the

primary
      factor in determining the carried reserve but also considers the range given
      the
      volatility of APMT exposures, as noted above.

For
      Standard Lines, the December 31, 2005 carried net claim and claim adjustment
      expense reserve is slightly higher than the actuarial point estimate. For
      Specialty Lines, the December 31, 2005 carried net claim and claim adjustment
      expense reserve is also slightly higher than the actuarial point estimate.
      For
      both Standard Lines and Specialty Lines, the difference is primarily due to
      the
      2005 accident year. The data from the current accident year is very immature
      from a claim and claim adjustment expense point of view so it is prudent to
      wait
      until experience confirms that the loss ratios should be adjusted. For Other
      Insurance, the December 31, 2005 carried net claim and claim adjustment expense
      reserve is slightly higher than the actuarial point estimate. While the
      actuarial estimates for APMT exposures reflect current knowledge, CNA management
      feels it is prudent, based on the history of developments in this area, to
      reflect some volatility in the carried reserve until the ultimate outcome of
      the
      issues associated with these exposures is clearer.

In
      light
      of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making
      the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA reviews its reserve
      estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments in the period that the need
      for such adjustments is determined (see “Net Prior Year Development” above).
      These reviews have resulted in CNA’s identification of information and trends
      that have caused CNA to increase its reserves in prior periods and could lead
      to
      the identification of a need for additional material increases in claim and
      claim adjustment expense reserves, which could materially adversely affect
      CNA’s
      business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings (see the Ratings
      section of this MD&A) and our results of operations and equity.

The
      following table presents estimated volatility in carried claim and claim
      adjustment expense reserves for the Standard Lines, Specialty Lines and Other
      Insurance segments.

In
      addition to the gross carried loss reserves presented below, Claim and Claim
      Adjustment Expense Reserves as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
      include $3,277.0 million at December 31, 2005, related to the Life and Group
      Non-Core segment.

The
      estimated volatility noted above does not represent an actuarial range around
      our gross loss reserves, and it does not represent the range of all possible
      outcomes. The volatility represents an estimate of the inherent volatility
      associated with estimating loss reserves for the specific type of business
      written by each segment, and along with the associated reserve balances, allows
      for the quantification of potential earnings impacts in future reporting
      periods. The primary characteristics influencing the estimated level of
      volatility are the length of the claim settlement period, the potential for
      changes in medical and other claim costs, changes in the level of litigation
      or
      other dispute resolution processes, changes in the legal environment and the
      potential for different types of injuries emerging. Ceded reinsurance
      arrangements may reduce the volatility. Since ceded reinsurance arrangements
      vary by year, volatility in gross reserves may not result in comparable impacts
      to net income or shareholders’ equity.

Reinsurance

CNA
      cedes
      insurance to reinsurers to limit its maximum loss, provide greater
      diversification of risk, minimize exposures on larger risks and to exit certain
      lines of business. The ceding of insurance does not discharge CNA’s primary
      liabilities. Therefore, a credit exposure exists with respect to property and
      casualty and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable
      to meet the obligations or to the extent that the reinsurer disputes the
      liabilities assumed under reinsurance agreements. Property and casualty
      reinsurance coverages are tailored to the specific risk characteristics of
      each
      product line and CNA’s retained amount varies by type of coverage. Reinsurance
      contracts are purchased to protect specific lines of business such as property,
      workers compensation and

professional
      liability. Corporate catastrophe reinsurance is also purchased for property
      and
      workers compensation exposure. Most reinsurance contracts are purchased on
      an
      excess of loss basis. CNA also utilizes facultative reinsurance in certain
      lines. In addition, CNA assumes reinsurance as members of various reinsurance
      pools and associations.

The
      following table summarizes the amounts receivable from reinsurers at December
      31, 2005 and 2004.

CNA
      attempts to mitigate its credit risk related to reinsurance by entering into
      reinsurance arrangements with reinsurers that have credit ratings above certain
      levels and by obtaining substantial amounts of collateral. The primary methods
      of obtaining collateral are through reinsurance trusts, letters of credit and
      funds withheld balances. Such collateral was approximately $4,277.0 million
      and
      $6,231.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. In addition, CNA may enter
      into
      reinsurance agreements with reinsurers that are not rated.

During
      2005, CNA sustained catastrophe losses related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita
      and
      Wilma. CNA ceded $429.0 million of these losses to its corporate catastrophe
      programs. This reinsurance protection cost CNA premiums of approximately $64.0
      million, which included reinstatement premiums of approximately $27.0 million.
      The cost of CNA’s 2006 corporate catastrophe reinsurance programs will be
      approximately $82.0 million before the impacts of any reinstatement
      premiums.

The
      terms
      of CNA’s 2006 programs are different than those of its 2005 programs. The
      Corporate Property Catastrophe treaty provides coverage for the accumulation
      of
      losses between $200.0 million and $700.0 million arising out of a single
      catastrophe occurrence in the United States, its territories and possessions,
      and Canada. CNA’s co-participation is 25.0% of the first $125.0 million layer
      and 10.0% in all remaining layers. CNA’s Marine treaty provides $65.0 million of
      protection above a $20.0 million retention on the accumulation of losses arising
      out of a single catastrophe occurrence.

In
      addition to these reinsurance treaties, CNA’s exposure to aggregation of certain
      catastrophe events is further mitigated by an Aggregate Property Catastrophe
      treaty. The Aggregate Property Catastrophe treaty covers 95% of $150.0 million
      of losses above a retention of $125.0 million from named earthquake or wind
      storm catastrophes in the United States, its territories and possessions, and
      Canada, which exceed $35.0 million. For any single event, the maximum that
      can
      be applied to CNA’s retention or recovered under the treaty is $75.0 million.

CNA’s
      overall ceded reinsurance program includes certain finite property and casualty
      contracts that are entered into and accounted for on a funds withheld basis.
      Under the funds withheld basis, CNA records the cash remitted to the reinsurer
      for the reinsurer’s margin, or cost of the reinsurance contract, as ceded
      premiums. The remainder of the premiums ceded under the reinsurance contract
      not
      remitted in cash is recorded as funds withheld liabilities. CNA is required
      to
      increase the funds withheld balance at stated interest crediting rates applied
      to the funds withheld balance or as otherwise specified under the terms of
      the
      contract. The funds withheld liability is reduced by any cumulative claim
      payments made by CNA in excess of its retention under the reinsurance contract.
      If the funds withheld liability is exhausted, interest crediting will cease
      and
      additional claim payments are recoverable from the reinsurer. The significant
      commuted contracts resulted in an unfavorable impact of $236.4 million after
      tax
      and minority interest in 2005, a favorable impact of $16.4 million after tax
      and
      minority interest in 2004 and an unfavorable impact of $64.0 million after
      tax
      and minority interest in 2003. During 2005, CNA commuted several of these
      contracts and as a result, there will be no further interest crediting on these
      contracts in future periods. The interest

      charges related to these significant commuted contracts was $42.9 million,
      $78.5
      million and $137.1 million after tax and minority interest in 2005, 2004 and
      2003, and was reflected as a component of net investment income in our
      Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In
      certain circumstances, including significant deterioration of a reinsurer’s
      financial strength ratings, CNA may engage in commutation discussions with
      individual reinsurers. The outcome of such discussions may result in a lump
      sum
      settlement that is less than the recorded receivable, net of any applicable
      allowance for doubtful accounts. Losses arising from commutations could have
      an
      adverse material impact on our results of operations or equity.

      information on CNA’s reinsurance program is included in Note 18 of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Terrorism
      Insurance

CNA
      and
      the insurance industry incurred substantial losses related to the 2001 World
      Trade Center event. For the most part, the industry was able to absorb the
      loss
      of capital from this event, but the capacity to withstand the effect of any
      additional terrorism events was significantly diminished.

The
      Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (“TRIA”) established a program within the
      Department of the Treasury under which insurers are required to offer terrorism
      insurance and the federal government will share the risk of loss by commercial
      property and casualty insurers arising from future terrorist attacks. Although
      TRIA expired on December 31, 2005, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act
      of
      2005 (“TRIEA”) extended this program through December 31, 2007. Each
      participating insurance company must pay a deductible, ranging from 17.5% of
      direct earned premiums from covered commercial insurance lines in 2006 to 20.0%
      in 2007, before federal government assistance becomes available. For losses
      in
      excess of a company’s deductible, the federal government will cover 90.0% of the
      excess losses in 2006 and 85.0% of the excess covered losses in 2007, while
      companies will retain the remaining 10.0% in 2006 and the remaining 15.0% in
      2007. Federal reimbursement is available for a certified act of terrorism after
      March 31, 2006 only if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from
      such
      act exceed $50.0 million in 2006 or $100.0 million in 2007. Losses covered
      by
      the program will be capped annually at $100.0 billion; above this amount,
      insurers are not liable for covered losses and Congress is to determine the
      procedures for and the source of any payments. Amounts paid by the federal
      government under the program over certain phased limits are to be recouped
      by
      the Department of the Treasury through policy surcharges which cannot exceed
      3.0% of annual premium.

The
      program does not cover life or health insurance products or certain lines of
      property and casualty insurance such as commercial automobile, surety and
      professional liability (other than directors and officers liability insurance).
      The program also does not generally affect state law limitations applying to
      premiums and policies for terrorism coverage.

While
      TRIEA provides the property and casualty industry with an increased ability
      to
      withstand the effect of a terrorist event through 2007, given the
      unpredictability of the nature, targets, severity or frequency of potential
      terrorist events, our results of operations or equity could nevertheless be
      materially adversely impacted by them. CNA is attempting to mitigate this
      exposure through its underwriting practices, as well as policy terms and
      conditions (where applicable). Under the laws of certain states, CNA is
      generally prohibited from excluding terrorism exposure from its primary workers
      compensation policies. Further, in those states that mandate property insurance
      coverage of damage from fire following a loss, CNA is prohibited from excluding
      terrorism exposure.

Terrorism-related
      reinsurance losses are also not covered by TRIEA. As a result, CNA’s assumed
      reinsurance arrangements either exclude terrorism coverage or significantly
      limit the level of coverage.

Over
      the
      past several years, CNA has been underwriting its business to manage its
      terrorism exposure through strict underwriting standards, risk avoidance
      measures and conditional terrorism exclusions where permitted by law. There
      is
      substantial uncertainty as to CNA’s ability to effectively contain its terrorism
      exposure since, notwithstanding its efforts described above, CNA continues
      to
      issue forms of coverage, in particular, workers compensation, that are exposed
      to risk of loss from a terrorism event.

Restructuring

In
      2001,
      CNA finalized and approved a plan to restructure the property and casualty
      segments and Life and Group Non-Core segment, discontinue the variable life
      and
      annuity business and consolidate certain real estate locations. The remaining
      accrual related to this plan was $13.0 million at December 31, 2005.
      Approximately $2.0 million of the remaining accrual, primarily related to lease
      termination costs, is expected to be paid in 2006.

Further
      information on the restructuring plan is included in Note 15 of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Segment
      Results

The
      following discusses the results of operations for CNA’s operating segments. In
      evaluating the results of the Standard Lines and Specialty Lines, CNA management
      utilizes the combined ratio, the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the dividend
      ratio. These ratios are calculated using GAAP financial results. The loss ratio
      is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net
      earned premiums. The expense ratio is the percentage of underwriting and
      acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs,
      to net earned premiums. The dividend ratio is the ratio of dividends incurred
      to
      net earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and
      dividend ratios.

Net
      written premiums for Standard Lines decreased $200.0 million in 2005 as compared
      with 2004. This decrease was primarily driven by decreased premium writings
      in
      casualty lines of business, increased reinstatement premium in 2005 related
      to
      catastrophe losses and decreased rates as discussed further below. Net earned
      premiums decreased $507.0 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. This decrease
      was primarily driven by the decline in premiums written. The lower premium
      is
      consistent with CNA’s strategy of portfolio optimization. CNA’s priority is a
      diversified portfolio in profitable classes of business.

Standard
      Lines averaged a rate decrease of 1.0% for 2005 and a rate increase of 4.0%
      for
      2004 for the contracts that renewed during those periods. Retention rates of
      77.0% and 70.0% were achieved for those contracts that were up for
      renewal.

                (Continued)

Net
      results decreased $356.6 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. This decrease
      was attributable to declines in both net operating results and net realized
      investment gains. See the Investments section of the MD&A for further
      discussion on net realized investment gains.

Net
      operating results decreased $238.9 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. This
      decrease was due primarily to increased unfavorable net prior year development
      of $257.3 million after tax and minority interest including $168.8 million
      after
      tax and minority interest related to significant commutations in 2005, a $123.2
      million after tax and minority interest increase in catastrophe losses, the
      decreased earned premium as discussed above and decreased current accident
      year
      results. These unfavorable items were partially offset by a $271.1 million
      increase in net investment income and a decrease in the provision for insurance
      bad debt. See the Investments section of the MD&A for further discussion on
      net investment income.

Unfavorable
      net prior year development of $452.0 million was recorded in 2005, including
      $559.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
      reserve development and $107.0 million of favorable premium development.
      Unfavorable net prior year development of $18.0 million, including $115.0
      million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
      development and $97.0 million of favorable premium development, was recorded
      in
      2004. Further information on Standard Lines Net Prior Year Development for
      and 2004 is included in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      included under Item 8.

During
      2005 and 2004, CNA commuted several significant reinsurance contracts that
      resulted in unfavorable development of $285.0 million and $5.0 million, which
      is
      included in the development above, and which was partially offset by the release
      of previously established allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. These
      commutations resulted in an unfavorable impact of $157.9 million after tax
      and
      minority interest and favorable impact of $3.7 million after tax and minority
      interest in 2005 and 2004. These contracts contained interest crediting
      provisions. The interest charges associated with the reinsurance contracts
      commuted was $38.3 million and $100.4 million, after tax and minority interest,
      in 2005 and 2004. There will be no further interest crediting charges related
      to
      these commuted contracts in future periods.

The
      impact of catastrophes was $290.3 million and $167.0 million, after tax and
      minority interest, for 2005 and 2004. These catastrophe impacts are net of
      anticipated reinsurance recoveries, and include the effect of reinstatement
      premiums and estimated insurance assessments.

The
      combined ratio increased 14.7 points in 2005 as compared with 2004. The loss
      ratio increased 16.7 points in 2005 as compared with 2004. These increases
      were
      primarily due to increased net prior year development, increased catastrophe
      losses and decreased current accident year results. Catastrophe losses of $470.0
      million and $260.0 million were recorded in 2005 and 2004.

The
      dividend ratio increased 0.2 points in 2005 as compared with 2004. The 2004
      ratio was impacted by favorable dividend development, partially offset by
      decreased participation in dividend plans and lower dividend amounts related
      to
      the current accident year.

      Compared with 2003

Net
      written premiums for Standard Lines increased $19.0 million in 2004 as compared
      with 2003. This increase was primarily driven by decreased ceded premiums of
      $270.0 million to corporate aggregate and other reinsurance treaties in 2004
      as
      compared with 2003. The 2003 cessions were principally due to the unfavorable
      net prior year development recorded in 2003. This favorable impact was partially
      offset by lower new business due to increased competition, as well as
      intentional underwriting actions in business classified as high hazard.
      Specifically impacting retention was the impact of intentional underwriting
      actions, including reductions in certain silica-related risks and workers
      compensation policies classified as high hazard.

Standard
      Lines averaged rate increases of 4.0% and 16.0% for 2004 and 2003 for the
      contracts that renewed during those periods. Retention rates of 70.0% and 72.0%
      were achieved for those contracts that were up for renewal.

Net
      earned premiums increased $385.0 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. This
      increase was primarily driven by decreased ceded premiums of $270.0 million
      related to corporate aggregate and other reinsurance treaties.

Net
      results increased $969.5 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. This increase
      was attributable to an increase in net operating income, partially offset by
      a
      decrease in net realized investment gains. See the Investments section of the
      MD&A for further discussion on net realized investment gains.

Net
      operating results increased $1,054.4 million in 2004 as compared with 2003.
      This
      improvement, after tax and minority interest, was due primarily to decreased
      unfavorable net prior year development of $828.8 million, a decrease in the
      bad
      debt provision recorded for insurance receivables of $52.0 million, a decrease
      in the bad debt provision for reinsurance receivables of $43.8 million,
      decreased dividend development of $41.1 million, a decrease in certain insurance
      related assessments of $31.9 million and increased net investment income of
      $52.0 million. The increased net investment income was primarily due to reduced
      interest charges of $57.5 million after tax and minority interest related to
      the
      corporate aggregate and other reinsurance treaties. These favorable items were
      partially offset by increased catastrophe impacts. The impact of catastrophes
      was $167.0 million and $64.0 million, after tax and minority interest, for
      and 2003, as discussed below. These catastrophe impacts are net of anticipated
      reinsurance recoveries, and include the effect of reinstatement premiums and
      estimated insurance assessments. See the Investments section of the MD&A for
      further discussion on net investment income.

The
      combined ratio decreased 37.3 points in 2004 as compared with 2003. The loss
      ratio decreased 27.2 points in 2004 as compared with 2003. These improvements
      were primarily due to decreased net unfavorable prior year development of
      $1,398.0 million and a decrease in the bad debt provision recorded for
      reinsurance receivables of $74.0 million. These favorable impacts on the 2004
      loss ratio were partially offset by increased catastrophe losses. Catastrophe
      losses of $260.0 million and $110.0 million were recorded in 2004 and 2003.
      The
      increased 2004 catastrophe losses were primarily due to a $235.0 million loss
      resulting from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne.

Unfavorable
      net prior year development of $18.0 million was recorded in 2004, including
      $115.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
      reserve development and $97.0 million of favorable premium development.
      Unfavorable net prior year development of $1,416.0 million, including $938.0
      million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
      development and $478.0 million of unfavorable premium development, was recorded
      in 2003. Further information on Standard Lines Net Prior Year Development for
      2004 and 2003 is included in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements included under Item 8.

The
      expense ratio decreased 8.1 points in 2004 as compared with 2003. This decrease
      in 2004 was primarily due to an increased net earned premium base, an $88.0
      million decrease in the provision for uncollectible insurance receivables,
      a
      $54.0 million decrease in certain insurance related assessments and reduced
      expenses as a result of

expense
      reduction initiatives as compared with the same period in 2003. Partially
      offsetting these favorable impacts was $14.0 million of estimated underwriting
      assessments related to the 2004 Florida hurricanes.

During
      2004, additional bad debt provisions for insurance receivables of $150.0 million
      were recorded as compared to $242.0 million recorded in 2003. The substantial
      bad debt provisions for insurance receivables in 2004 and 2003 were primarily
      related to Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) accounts. During 2002,
      Standard Lines ceased writing coverages for PEO businesses, with the last
      contracts expiring on June 30, 2003. In the third quarter of 2003, CNA performed
      a review of PEO accounts to estimate ultimate losses and the indicated
      recoveries under retrospective premium or high-deductible provisions of the
      insurance contracts. Based on the 2003 analysis of the credit standing of the
      individual PEO accounts and the amount of collateral held, CNA recorded an
      increase in the bad debt provision. In the third quarter of 2004, the review
      of
      PEO accounts was updated and the population of accounts reviewed was expanded
      to
      include Temporary Help accounts as well. Payroll audits performed since the
      last
      study identified that the exposure base for many accounts was higher than
      expected. In addition, recovery estimates were updated based on current credit
      information on the insured. Based on the updated study, CNA recorded an
      estimated bad debt provision of $95.0 million in the third quarter of 2004
      for
      these accounts.

In
      2004,
      the expense ratio was adversely impacted by an additional $55.0 million bad
      debt
      provision for insurance receivables. The primary drivers of the provision were
      the completion of updated ultimate loss projections on all large account
      business where the insured is currently in bankruptcy and a comprehensive review
      of all billed balances that are past due.

The
      dividend ratio decreased 2.0 points in 2004 as compared with 2003 due to
      favorable net prior year dividend development of $23.0 million in 2004, as
      compared to unfavorable net prior year dividend development of $46.0 million
      in
      2003, primarily related to workers compensation products. The favorable 2004
      dividend development was related to a review that was completed in 2004 which
      indicated dividends were lower than prior expectations based on decreased usage
      of dividend programs.

Net
      written premiums for Specialty Lines increased $72.0 million in 2005 as compared
      with 2004. This increase was primarily due to improved production, primarily
      driven by improved retention across most professional liability insurance lines
      of business. These favorable impacts were partially offset by increased ceded
      premiums for certain professional liability lines of business and decreased
      premiums for the warranty business. Due to a change in the warranty product
      offering, fees related to the new warranty product are included within other
      revenues. Written premiums for the warranty line of business decreased $70.0
      million in 2005 as compared to 2004. Net earned

premiums
      increased $198.0 million in 2005 as compared with 2004, which reflects the
      increased premium written trend over the past several quarters in Specialty
      Lines.

Specialty
      Lines averaged rate increases of 1.0% and 9.0% in 2005 and 2004 for the
      contracts that renewed during those periods. Retention rates of 86.0% and 83.0%
      were achieved for those contracts that were up for renewal.

Net
      income decreased $27.5 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. This decrease
      was
      due primarily to a $38.9 million decrease in net realized investment gains
      partially offset by increased net operating income. See the Investments section
      of this MD&A for further discussion on net investment income and net
      realized investment gains.

Net
      operating income increased $11.4 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. This
      increase was primarily driven by an increase in net investment income and
      increased earned premiums. These increases to operating income were partially
      offset by decreased current accident year results. In addition, 2004 results
      were favorably impacted by the release of a previously established reinsurance
      bad debt allowance as the result of a significant commutation. Catastrophe
      impacts were $14.6 million and $10.0 million, after tax and minority interest,
      for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

The
      combined ratio increased 2.0 points in 2005 as compared with 2004. The loss
      ratio increased 2.0 points. The 2004 loss ratio was favorably impacted by the
      release of reinsurance bad debt reserve as discussed above. In addition, the
      2005 loss ratio was unfavorably impacted by increased current year accident
      losses. This was driven by increased surety losses of $110.0 million related
      to
      a national contractor, as discussed in further detail in Note 21 of the
      Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, partially offset by
      improved current accident year loss ratios in several professional liability
      lines of business.

Unfavorable
      net prior year development was $54.0 million, including $47.0 million of
      unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense and $7.0 million of
      unfavorable premium development, in 2005. Unfavorable net prior year development
      of $30.0 million, including $58.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated
      claim adjustment expense development and $28.0 million of favorable premium
      development, was recorded for the same period in 2004. Further information
      on
      Specialty Lines Net Prior Year Development for 2005 and 2004 is included in

The

      impacted by a change in estimate related to profit commissions in the warranty
      line of business, which was offset by the impact of the increased earned premium
      base.

      Compared with 2003

Net
      written premiums for Specialty Lines increased $353.0 million and net earned
      premiums increased $437.0 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. This increase
      was primarily due to rate increases and improved retention, principally in
      Professional Liability Insurance, and decreased premiums ceded to corporate
      aggregate and other

reinsurance
      treaties of $26.0 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. The 2003 ceded premiums
      were principally driven by the unfavorable net prior year reserve development
      in
      2003.

Specialty
      Lines averaged rate increases of 9.0% and 29.0% in 2004 and 2003 for the
      contracts that renewed during those periods. Retention rates of 83.0% and 81.0%
      were achieved for those contracts that were up for renewal.

Net
      income increased $308.8 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. This increase
      was
      due primarily to increased net operating income, partially offset by a decrease
      in realized investment gains. See the Investments section of this MD&A for
      further discussion on net realized investment gains.

Net
      operating results improved $325.9 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. This
      improvement, after tax and minority interest, was due primarily to decreased
      unfavorable net prior year development of $156.1 million, a decrease in the
      bad
      debt provision for reinsurance receivables of $71.2 million, a decrease in
      certain insurance related assessments of $7.3 million, and increased net
      investment income. These improvements were partially offset by increased
      catastrophe losses in 2004. The impact of catastrophes was $10.0 million and
      $2.7 million, after tax and minority interest, in 2004 and 2003, as discussed
      below. See the Investments section of this MD&A for further discussion on
      net investment income.

The
      combined ratio decreased 27.8 points in 2004 as compared with 2003. The loss
      ratio decreased 26.3 points due principally to decreased unfavorable net prior
      year development of $264.0 million, a $120.0 million decrease in bad debt
      reserves for uncollectible reinsurance and an improvement in the current net
      accident year loss ratio. These favorable impacts to the loss ratio were
      partially offset by increased catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses of $15.0
      million and $4.0 million were recorded in 2004 and 2003. The increased
      catastrophe losses in 2004 were due to $12.0 million of losses resulting from
      Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne.

Unfavorable
      net prior year development was $30.0 million, including $58.0 million of
      unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense and $28.0 million
      of
      favorable premium development, in 2004. Unfavorable net prior year development
      of $294.0 million, including $257.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated
      claim adjustment expense development and $37.0 million of unfavorable premium
      development, was recorded for the same period in 2003. Further information
      on
      Specialty Lines Net Prior Year Development for 2004 and 2003 is included in
      Note
      9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item
      8.

The
      expense ratio decreased 1.5 points primarily due to the increased earned premium
      base and a decrease of $12.0 million in certain insurance related assessments
      recorded in 2003. In addition, the expense ratio was favorably impacted by
      decreased underwriting expenses due to CNA’s expense initiatives.

                (Continued)

Net
      results improved by $310.9 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. The
      improvement in net results related primarily to a $352.9 million after tax
      and
      minority interest realized loss on the sale of the individual life business
      in
      2004. Also contributing to the improvement in net results is the reduction
      in
      2005 of significant 2004 items related to the IGI Program as discussed below.
      In
      addition, 2005 results included an $11.9 million gain, after tax and minority
      interest, related to a service agreement with a purchaser for sold businesses.
      These agreements have expired. These results were partially offset by a decline
      in net investment income of $98.4 million. This included a decrease of
      approximately $64.0 million from the trading portfolio which was largely net
      income neutral due to a corresponding decrease in the policyholders’ funds
      reserves supported by the trading portfolio. In addition, it included the
      absence of favorable results from the sold insurance operations as discussed
      below. Also unfavorably impacting the 2005 results was a $15.3 million, after
      tax and minority interest, provision increase for estimated indemnification
      liabilities related to the sold individual life business and unfavorable results
      related to the long term care business. See the Investments section of this
      MD&A for additional information on net investment income and net realized
      investment results.

      Compared with 2003

Net
      earned premiums for Life and Group Non-Core decreased $1,455.0 million in 2004
      as compared with 2003. The decrease in net earned premiums was due primarily
      to
      the absence of premiums from the group benefits business and reduced premiums
      for the individual life business. Net earned premiums for the sold life and
      group businesses were $115.0 million and $1,459.0 million for 2004 and 2003.
      Net
      earned premiums also decreased in most of the remaining lines of business which
      are in runoff, and this decline is expected to continue in the future. Partially
      offsetting this decrease was an increase in net earned premiums in the specialty
      medical business, which continued to issue new policies prior to its sale in
      January 2005.

Net
      results decreased by $379.6 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. The decrease
      in net results related primarily to net realized investment losses, including
      the realized loss of approximately $352.9 million after tax and minority
      interest from the sale of the individual life business and reduced results
      from
      the group benefits and individual life businesses. Net realized investment
      losses in 2003 include a loss recorded on the sale of the Group Benefits
      business of $116.4 million after tax and minority interest. Net results for
      the
      sold life and group businesses were losses of $389.7 million and $32.5 million,
      including the loss on sales and the effects of shared corporate overhead
      expenses, in 2004 and 2003. In addition, results for life settlement contracts
      declined in 2004. These items were partially offset by reduced increases in
      individual long term care reserves of $19.2 million after tax and minority
      interest in 2004 as compared with 2003. Also included in the net results of
      and 2003 were the adverse impacts of $23.7 million and $29.8 million, after
      tax
      and minority interest, related to certain accident and health exposures (“IGI
      Program”) and CNA’s past participation in accident and health reinsurance
      programs.

interest
      related to a federal income tax settlement. See Note 11 of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further
      information.

As
      previously disclosed, CNA sold its personal insurance business to The Allstate
      Corporation (“Allstate”) in 1999. Under the revised terms of this transaction,
      Allstate purchased an option exercisable during 2005 to purchase 100% of the
      common stock of five of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries at the fair value as of the
      exercise date. Royalty fees earned for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
      2004 for personal insurance policies 100% reinsured with Allstate were
      approximately $22.0 million and $29.0 million. The royalty fee arrangement
      terminated on September 30, 2005. In addition, Allstate exercised its option
      and
      purchased the five subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of 2005. This
      transaction resulted in a realized gain of $8.0 million. See Note 14 of the
      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further
      information regarding this transaction.

Net
      results decreased $112.0 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. The decrease
      in
      net results was due primarily to a $126.9 million after tax and minority
      interest increase in unfavorable net prior year development related primarily
      to
      commutations and reserve strengthening, a $44.6 million decrease in net realized
      investment results and a decrease in the provision recorded for uncollectible
      reinsurance. Net realized investment results for the year ended December 31,
      2005 and 2004 included a $20.1 million after tax and minority interest and
      $32.9
      million after tax and minority interest impairment related to a national
      contractor. See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      included under Item 8 for additional information regarding the national
      contractor. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $105.0 million after
      tax
      and minority interest increase in net income related to a federal income tax
      settlement and release of federal income tax reserves.

Unfavorable
      net prior year development of $306.0 million was recorded during 2005, including
      $291.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
      adjustment expense reserve development and $15.0 million of unfavorable premium
      development. Unfavorable net prior year development of $93.0 million was
      recorded in 2004, including $84.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim
      and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and $9.0 million
      of
      unfavorable premium development. Further information on Other Insurance’s Net
      Prior Year Development for 2005 and 2004 is included in Note 9 of the Notes
      to

      2005 and 2004, CNA commuted several significant reinsurance contracts that
      resulted in unfavorable development of $118.0 million and $39.0 million, which
      is included in the development above, and which was partially offset by the
      release in 2004 of a previously established allowance for uncollectible
      reinsurance. These commutations resulted in unfavorable impacts of $64.8 million
      and $4.6 million, after tax and minority interest, in 2005 and 2004. These
      contracts contained interest crediting provisions and maintenance charges.
      Interest charges associated with the reinsurance contracts commuted were $11.9
      million and $10.0 million, after tax and minority interest, in 2005 and 2004.
      There will be no further interest crediting charges or other charges related
      to
      these commuted contracts in future periods.

The
      following table summarizes the gross and net carried reserves as of December
      31,
      2005 and 2004 for the Other Insurance segment.

      Compared with 2003

Revenues
      decreased $392.7 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. The decrease in revenues
      was due primarily to reduced net earned premiums in CNA Re due to the exit
      of
      the assumed reinsurance market in October of 2003 and decreased realized
      investment gains of $62.0 million pretax. CNA Re had earned premiums of $125.0
      million and $536.0 million in 2004 and 2003. See the Investments section of
      this
      MD&A for additional information on net realized investment gains (losses)
      and net investment income.

Net
      income increased $772.4 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. The increase
      in
      net income, after tax and minority interest, was due primarily to, a $569.2
      million decrease in unfavorable net prior year development, a $153.3 million
      decrease in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance receivables, the absence
      in 2004 of a $39.7 million increase in unallocated loss adjustment expense
      (“ULAE”) reserves recorded in 2003 and a $14.6 million decrease in certain
      insurance related assessments. In addition, the net results were favorably
      impacted by $12.8 million after tax and minority interest of non-recurring
      income related to a release of purchase accounting reserves related to real
      estate leases assumed in connection with the 1995 acquisition of
      Continental.

Unfavorable
      net prior year development of $93.0 million was recorded during 2004, including
      $84.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
      expense reserve development and $9.0 million of unfavorable premium development.
      Unfavorable net prior year development of $1,065.0 million was recorded in
      2003,
      including $1,039.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated
      claim adjustment expense reserve development and $26.0 million of unfavorable
      premium development. Further information on Other Insurance’s Net Prior Year
      Development for 2004 and 2003 is included in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated
      Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Many
      ceding companies have sought provisions for the collateralization of assumed
      reserves in the event of a financial strength ratings downgrade or other
      triggers. Before exiting the reinsurance market, CNA Re had been impacted by
      this trend and had entered into several contracts with rating or other triggers.
      See the Ratings section of this MD&A for more information.

APMT
      Reserves

CNA’s
      property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have actual and potential exposures
      related to APMT claims.

Establishing
      reserves for APMT claim and claim adjustment expenses is subject to
      uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Traditional
      actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of
      claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise
      in
      estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for APMT, particularly
      in
      an environment of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise
      from industry practices and legal, judicial, and social conditions. Therefore,
      these traditional actuarial methods and techniques are necessarily supplemented
      with additional estimating techniques and methodologies, many of which involve
      significant judgments that are required of management. Accordingly, a high
      degree of uncertainty remains for CNA’s ultimate liability for APMT claim and
      claim adjustment expenses.

In
      addition to the difficulties described above, estimating the ultimate cost
      of
      both reported and unreported APMT claims is subject to a higher degree of
      variability due to a number of additional factors, including among others:
      the
      number and outcome of direct actions against CNA; coverage issues, including
      whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy limits
      apply; allocation of liability among numerous parties, some of whom may be
      in
      bankruptcy proceedings, and in particular the application of “joint and several”
liability to specific insurers on a risk; inconsistent court decisions and
      developing legal theories; increasingly aggressive tactics of plaintiffs’
lawyers; the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation;
      increased filings of claims in certain states; enactment of national federal
      legislation to address asbestos claims; a further increase in asbestos and
      environmental pollution claims which cannot now be anticipated; liability
      against CNA’s policyholders in environmental matters; broadened scope of
      clean-up resulting in increased liability to CNA’s policyholders; increase in
      number of mass tort claims relating to silica and silica-containing products,
      and the outcome of ongoing disputes as to coverage in relation to these claims;
      a further increase of claims and claims payment that may exhaust underlying
      umbrella and excess coverage at accelerated rates; and future developments
      pertaining to CNA’s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos, pollution and
      mass tort claims.

Due
      to
      the inherent uncertainties in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense
      reserves for APMT and due to the significant uncertainties described related
      to
      APMT claims, CNA’s ultimate liability for these cases, both individually and in
      aggregate, may exceed the recorded reserves. Any such potential additional
      liability, or any range of potential additional amounts, cannot be reasonably
      estimated currently, but could be material to CNA’s business, insurer financial
      strength and debt ratings and our results of operations and equity. Due to,
      among other things, the factors described above, it may be necessary for CNA
      to
      record material changes in its APMT claim and claim adjustment expense reserves
      in the future, should new information become available or other developments
      emerge.

CNA
      has
      regularly performed ground up reviews of all open APMT claims to evaluate the
      adequacy of its APMT reserves. In performing the comprehensive ground up
      analysis, CNA considers input from its professionals with direct responsibility
      for the claims, inside and outside counsel with responsibility for its
      representation, and its actuarial staff. These professionals review, among
      many
      factors, the policyholder’s present and predicted future exposures, including
      such factors as claims volume, trial conditions, prior settlement history,
      settlement demands and defense costs; the impact of asbestos defendant
      bankruptcies on the policyholder; the policies CNA issued, including such
      factors as aggregate or per occurrence limits, whether the policy is primary,
      umbrella or excess, and the existence of policyholder retentions and/or
      deductibles; the existence of other insurance; and reinsurance
      arrangements.

The
      following table provides data related to CNA’s APMT claim and claim adjustment
      expense reserves.

Asbestos

In
      the
      past several years, CNA has experienced, at certain points in time, significant
      increases in claim counts for asbestos-related claims. The factors that led
      to
      these increases included, among other things, intensive advertising campaigns
      by
      lawyers for asbestos claimants, mass medical screening programs sponsored by
      plaintiff lawyers and the addition of new defendants such as the distributors
      and installers of products containing asbestos. During 2004 and 2005, the rate
      of new filings appears to have decreased from the filing rates seen in the
      past
      several years. Various challenges to mass screening claimants have been mounted.
      Nevertheless, CNA continues to experience an overall increase in total asbestos
      claim counts. The majority of asbestos bodily injury claims are filed by persons
      exhibiting few, if any, disease symptoms. Recent studies have concluded that
      the
      percentage of unimpaired claimants to total claimants ranges between 66.0%
      and
      up to 90.0%. Some courts, including the federal district court responsible
      for
      pre-trial proceedings in all federal asbestos bodily injury actions, have
      ordered that so-called “unimpaired” claimants may not recover unless at some
      point the claimant’s condition worsens to the point of impairment. Some
      plaintiffs classified as “unimpaired” have challenged those orders. Therefore,
      the ultimate impact of the orders on future asbestos claims remains
      uncertain.

Several
      factors are, in CNA management’s view, negatively impacting asbestos claim
      trends. Plaintiff attorneys who previously sued entities who are now bankrupt
      are seeking other viable targets. As a result, companies with few or no previous
      asbestos claims are becoming targets in asbestos litigation and, although they
      may have little or no liability, nevertheless must be defended. In addition,
      plaintiff attorneys and trustees for future claimants are demanding that policy
      limits be paid lump-sum into the bankruptcy asbestos trusts prior to
      presentation of valid claims and medical proof of these claims. Various
      challenges to these practices are currently in litigation and the ultimate
      impact or success of these tactics remains uncertain. Plaintiff attorneys and
      trustees for future claimants are also attempting to devise claims payment
      procedures for bankruptcy trusts that would allow asbestos claims to be

paid
      under lax standards for injury, exposure and causation. This also presents
      the
      potential for exhausting policy limits in an accelerated fashion.

As
      a
      result of bankruptcies and insolvencies, CNA management has observed an increase
      in the total number of policyholders with current asbestos claims as additional
      defendants are added to existing lawsuits and are named in new asbestos bodily
      injury lawsuits. New asbestos bodily injury claims also increased substantially
      in 2003, but the rate of increase has moderated in 2004 and 2005.

CNA
      has
      resolved a number of its large asbestos accounts by negotiating settlement
      agreements. Structured settlement agreements provide for payments over multiple
      years as set forth in each individual agreement. Payment obligations under
      those
      settlement agreements are projected to terminate by 2016.

In
      1985,
      47 asbestos producers and their insurers, including CIC, executed the Wellington
      Agreement. The agreement intended to resolve all issues and litigation related
      to coverage for asbestos exposures. Under this agreement, signatory insurers
      committed scheduled policy limits and made the limits available to pay asbestos
      claims based upon coverage blocks designated by the policyholders in 1985,
      subject to extension by policyholders. CIC was a signatory insurer to the
      Wellington Agreement.

CNA
      has
      also used coverage in place agreements to resolve large asbestos exposures.
      Coverage in place agreements are typically agreements between CNA and its
      policyholders identifying the policies and the terms for payment of asbestos
      related liabilities. Claims payments are contingent on presentation of adequate
      documentation showing exposure during the policy periods and other documentation
      supporting the demand for claims payment. Coverage in place agreements may
      have
      annual payment caps. Coverage in place agreements are evaluated based on claims
      filings trends and severities.

CNA
      categorizes active asbestos accounts as large or small accounts. CNA defines
      a
      large account as an active account with more than $100,000 of cumulative paid
      losses. CNA has made closing large accounts a significant management priority.
      Small accounts are defined as active accounts with $100,000 or less of
      cumulative paid losses. Approximately 81.0% and 82.9% of CNA’s total active
      asbestos accounts are classified as small accounts at December 31, 2005 and
      December 31, 2004. Small accounts are typically representative of policyholders
      with limited connection to asbestos.

CNA
      also
      evaluates its asbestos liabilities arising from its assumed reinsurance business
      and its participation in various pools, including Excess & Casualty
      Reinsurance Association (“ECRA”).

IBNR
      reserves relate to potential development on accounts that have not settled
      and
      potential future claims from unidentified policyholders.

Some
      asbestos-related defendants have asserted that their insurance policies are
      not
      subject to aggregate limits on coverage. CNA has such claims from a number
      of
      insureds. Some of these claims involve insureds facing exhaustion of products
      liability aggregate limits in their policies, who have asserted that their
      asbestos-related claims fall within so-called “non-products” liability coverage
      contained within their policies rather than products liability coverage, and
      that the claimed “non-products” coverage is not subject to any aggregate limit.
      It is difficult to predict the ultimate size of any of the claims for coverage
      purportedly not subject to aggregate limits or predict to what extent, if any,
      the attempts to assert “non-products” claims outside the products liability
      aggregate will succeed. CNA’s policies also contain other limits applicable to
      these claims, and CNA has additional coverage defenses to certain claims. CNA
      has attempted to manage its asbestos exposure by aggressively seeking to settle
      claims on acceptable terms. There can be no assurance that any of these
      settlement efforts will be successful, or that any such claims can be settled
      on
      terms acceptable to CNA. Where CNA cannot settle a claim on acceptable terms,
      CNA aggressively litigates the claim. A recent court ruling by the United States
      Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has supported certain of CNA’s positions
      with respect to coverage for “non-products” claims. However, adverse
      developments with respect to such matters could have a material adverse effect
      on our results of operations and/or equity.

As
      a
      result of the uncertainties and complexities involved, reserves for asbestos
      claims cannot be estimated with traditional actuarial techniques that rely
      on
      historical accident year loss development factors. In establishing asbestos
      reserves, CNA evaluates the exposure presented by each insured. As part of
      this
      evaluation, CNA considers the available insurance coverage; limits and
      deductibles; the potential role of other insurance, particularly underlying
      coverage below any of its excess liability policies; and applicable coverage
      defenses, including asbestos exclusions. Estimation of asbestos-related claim
      and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment on
      the
      part of CNA management and consideration of many complex factors, including:
      inconsistency of court decisions, jury attitudes and future court decisions;
      specific policy provisions; allocation of liability among insurers and insureds;
      missing policies and proof of coverage; the proliferation of bankruptcy
      proceedings and attendant uncertainties; novel theories asserted by
      policyholders and their counsel; the targeting of a broader range of businesses
      and entities as defendants; the uncertainty as to which other insureds may
      be
      targeted in the future and the uncertainties inherent in predicting the number
      of future claims; volatility in claim numbers and settlement demands; increases
      in the number of non-impaired claimants and the extent to which they can be
      precluded from making claims; the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage not
      subject to aggregate limits; long latency period between asbestos exposure
      and
      disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple
      policy periods for individual claims; medical inflation trends; the mix of
      asbestos-related diseases presented and the ability to recover
      reinsurance.

CNA
      is
      also monitoring possible legislative reforms on the state and national level,
      including possible federal legislation to create a national privately financed
      trust financed by contributions from insurers such as CNA, industrial companies
      and others, which if established, could replace litigation of asbestos claims
      with payments to claimants from the trust. It is uncertain at the present time
      whether such legislation will be enacted or, if it is, its impact on
      CNA.

CNA
      is
      involved in significant asbestos-related claim litigation, which is described
      in
      Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item
      8.

Environmental
      Pollution and Mass Tort

Environmental
      pollution cleanup is the subject of both federal and state regulation. By some
      estimates, there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to cleanup.
      The
      insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage
      issues. Judicial interpretations in many cases have expanded the scope of
      coverage and liability beyond the original intent of the policies. The
      Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
      (“Superfund”) and comparable state statutes (“mini-Superfunds”) govern the
      cleanup and restoration of toxic waste sites and formalize the concept of legal
      liability for cleanup and restoration by “Potentially Responsible Parties”
(“PRPs”). Superfund and the mini-Superfunds establish mechanisms to pay for
      cleanup of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so and assign liability to PRPs.
      The
      extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent upon a variety of
      factors. Further, the number of waste sites subject to cleanup is unknown.
      To
      date, approximately 1,500 cleanup sites have been identified by the
      Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and included on its National Priorities
      List (“NPL”). State authorities have designated many cleanup sites as
      well.

A
      number
      of proposals to modify Superfund have been made by various parties. However,
      no
      modifications were enacted by Congress during 2005, and it is unclear what
      positions Congress or the Administration will take and what legislation, if
      any,
      will result in the future. If there is legislation, and in some circumstances
      even if there is no legislation, the federal role in environmental cleanup
      may
      be significantly reduced in favor of state action. Substantial changes in the
      federal statute or the activity of the EPA may cause states to reconsider their
      environmental cleanup statutes and regulations. There can be no meaningful
      prediction of the pattern of regulation that would result or the possible effect
      upon our results of operations or equity.

Many
      policyholders have made claims against CNA for defense costs and indemnification
      in connection with environmental pollution matters. The vast majority of these
      claims relate to accident years 1989 and prior, which coincides with CNA’s
      adoption of the Simplified Commercial General Liability coverage form, which
      includes what is referred to in the industry as absolute pollution exclusion.
      CNA and the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many such claims.
      Key
      coverage issues include whether cleanup costs are considered damages under
      the
      policies, trigger of coverage, allocation of liability among triggered policies,
      applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions, the
      potential for joint and several liability and the definition of an occurrence.

date,
      courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. CNA noted
      adverse development in various pollution accounts in its most recent ground
      up
      review. In the course of its review, CNA did not observe a negative trend
      or deterioration in the underlying pollution claims environment. Rather,
      individual account estimates changed due to changes in liability and/or coverage
      circumstances particular to those accounts. As a result, CNA increased pollution
      reserves by $50.0 million in 2005.

CNA
      has
      made resolution of large environmental pollution exposures a management
      priority. CNA has resolved a number of its large environmental accounts by
      negotiating settlement agreements. In its settlements, CNA sought to resolve
      those exposures and obtain the broadest release language to avoid future claims
      from the same policyholders seeking coverage for sites or claims that had not
      emerged at the time CNA settled with its policyholder. While the terms of each
      settlement agreement vary, CNA sought to obtain broad environmental releases
      that include known and unknown sites, claims and policies. The broad scope
      of
      the release provisions contained in those settlement agreements should, in
      many
      cases, prevent future exposure from settled policyholders. It remains uncertain,
      however, whether a court interpreting the language of the settlement agreements
      will adhere to the intent of the parties and uphold the broad scope of language
      of the agreements.

CNA
      classifies its environmental pollution accounts into several categories, which
      include structured settlements, coverage in place agreements and active
      accounts. Structured settlement agreements provide for payments over multiple
      years as set forth in each individual agreement.

CNA
      has
      also used coverage in place agreements to resolve pollution exposures. Coverage
      in place agreements are typically agreements between CNA and its policyholders
      identifying the policies and the terms for payment of pollution related
      liabilities. Claims payments are contingent on presentation of adequate
      documentation of damages during the policy periods and other documentation
      supporting the demand for claims payment. Coverage in place agreements may
      have
      annual payment caps.

CNA
      categorizes active accounts as large or small accounts in the pollution area.
      CNA defines a large account as an active account with more than $100,000
      cumulative paid losses. CNA has made closing large accounts a significant
      management priority. Small accounts are defined as active accounts with $100,000
      or less cumulative paid losses.

CNA
      also
      evaluates its environmental pollution exposures arising from its assumed
      reinsurance and its participation in various pools, including ECRA. CNA carries
      unassigned IBNR reserves for environmental pollution. These reserves relate
      to
      potential development on accounts that have not settled and potential future
      claims from unidentified policyholders.

The
      table
      below depicts CNA’s overall pending environmental pollution accounts and
      associated reserves at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

In
      2003,
      CNA observed a marked increase in silica claims frequency in Mississippi, where
      plaintiff attorneys appear to have filed claims to avoid the effect of tort
      reform. Since 2003, silica claims frequency in Mississippi has moderated notably
      due to implementation of tort reform measures and favorable court decisions.
      To
      date, the most significant silica exposures identified included a relatively
      small number of accounts with significant numbers of new claims reported in
      and that continued at a far lesser rate in 2004 and 2005. Establishing claim
      and
      claim adjustment expense reserves for silica claims is subject to uncertainties
      because of disputes concerning medical causation with respect to certain
      diseases, including lung cancer, geographical concentration of the lawsuits
      asserting the claims, and the large rise in the total number of claims without
      underlying epidemiological developments suggesting an increase in disease rates.
      Moreover, judicial interpretations regarding application of various tort
      defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several
      liabilities, impede CNA’s ability to estimate the ultimate liability for such
      claims.

      Compared with 2004

Revenues
      increased by $249.5 million, or 7.4% and net income increased by $64.1 million,
      or 10.0% in 2005 as compared to 2004.

The
      increase in revenues in 2005, as compared to the prior year, is primarily due
      to
      higher net sales of $220.0 million and higher investment and other income of
      $29.5 million. Net sales revenue increased by $123.0 million due to increased
      unit sales volume, assuming prices were unchanged from the prior year and $97.0
      million due to higher effective unit prices reflecting lower sales promotion
      expenses (accounted for as a reduction to net sales). Net investment income
      increased due primarily to higher yields on invested cash balances and includes
      $16.8 million from limited partnerships in 2005, as compared to $18.0 million
      in
      2004.

Net
      income increased in 2005, as compared to 2004, due primarily to the higher
      revenues discussed above and a $26.8 million reduction in promotional expenses
      included in cost of sales, partially offset by higher State Settlement Agreement
      costs as described below, and charges of $100.4 million pretax due to a federal
      assessment (including $26.4 million of charges in relation to losses by grower
      related entities from the sale of surplus tobacco) relating to the repeal of
      the
      federal supply management program for tobacco growers. Lorillard recorded pretax
      charges of $876.4 million and $845.9 million ($537.7 million and $522.6 million
      after taxes) for 2005 and 2004, respectively, to record its obligations under
      settlement agreements entered into between the major cigarette manufacturers,
      including Lorillard, and each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the
      Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain U.S. territories (together, the “State
      Settlement Agreements”). Lorillard’s portion of ongoing adjusted settlement
      payments and related legal fees is based on its share of domestic cigarette
      shipments in the year preceding that in which the payment is due. Accordingly,
      Lorillard records its portion of ongoing settlement payments as part of cost
      of
      manufactured products sold as the related sales occur. The $30.5 million pretax
      increase in tobacco settlement costs in 2005 is due to the impact of the
      inflation adjustment ($26.2 million), charges for higher gross unit sales ($16.2
      million) under the State Settlement Agreements and other adjustments ($21.8
      million), partially offset by the elimination of Lorillard’s payment obligations
      under the national Tobacco Growers Settlement Trust ($33.7 million).

Results

                (Continued)

Lorillard
      regularly reviews results of its promotional spending activities and adjusts
      its
      promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain its competitive position.
      Accordingly, unit sales volume and sales promotion costs in any period are
      not
      necessarily indicative of sales and costs that may be realized in subsequent
      periods.

Overall,
      domestic industry unit sales volume decreased 3.4% in 2005 as compared with
      2004. Industry sales for premium brands were 71.2% of the total market in 2005
      as compared to 69.6% in 2004.

Lorillard’s
      total (domestic, Puerto Rico and certain U.S. Territories) gross unit sales
      volume increased 1.9% in 2005 as compared to 2004. Domestic wholesale volume
      increased 2.0% in 2005 as compared to 2004. Total Newport unit sales volume
      increased 2.5% in 2005 and domestic volume increased 2.6% in 2005 as compared
      with 2004. These results while reflecting positive change continue to be
      affected by on-going competitive promotions and the availability of deep
      discount brands.

Deep
      discount brands are produced by manufacturers that are subject to lower payment
      obligations under the State Settlement Agreements. This cost advantage enables
      them to price their brands more than 50% lower than the list prices of premium
      brand offerings from major manufacturers. As a result of this price
      differential, deep discount brands have grown from an estimated market share
      in
      1998 of less than 1.5% to an estimated 13.1% for 2005. Although the 2005 market
      share reflects a decrease of 1.15 share points versus 2004, these brands
      continue to be a significant competitive factor in the domestic U.S.
      market.

Menthol
      cigarettes as a percent of the total industry remained relatively flat. Newport,
      the industry’s largest menthol brand, had a 32.5% share of the menthol segment
      in 2005, compared to 31.3% in 2004.

Newport,
      a premium brand, accounted for approximately 91.6% of Lorillard’s unit sales
      volume in 2005 as compared to 91.0% in 2004.

The
      costs
      of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other
      legal
      expenses, are included in other operating expenses. Lorillard’s outside legal
      fees and other external product liability defense costs were $82.6 million,
      $83.5 million and $93.7 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Numerous
      factors affect product liability defense costs. The principal factors are as
      follows:

·

the
                number and types of cases filed and
                appealed;

·

the
                number of cases tried and appealed;

·

the
                development of the law;

·

the
                application of new or different theories of liability by plaintiffs
                and
                their counsel; and

·

litigation
                strategy and tactics.

See
      Note
      20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
      this
      Report for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation. The factors that
      have influenced past product liability defense costs are expected to continue
      to
      influence future costs. Although Lorillard does not expect that product
      liability defense costs will increase significantly in the future, it is
      possible that adverse developments in the factors discussed above, as well
      as
      other circumstances beyond the control of Lorillard, could have a material
      adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

      Compared with 2003

Revenues
      increased by $100.1 million, or 3.0% and net income increased by $61.0 million,
      or 10.5% in 2004 as compared to 2003.

Net
      income in 2003 included charges of $34.6 million (net of taxes) to settle
      litigation with tobacco growers and resolve indemnification claims and trademark
      matters in connection with the 1977 sale of Lorillard’s international

business.
      Excluding the 2003 charges, net income increased by $26.4 million, or 4.3%
      in
      2004, as compared to 2003.

The
      increase in revenues in 2004, as compared to 2003, is primarily due to higher
      net sales of $92.2 million, partially offset by reduced investment income of
      $3.3 million. Net sales revenue increased $17.5 million due to higher effective
      unit prices reflecting lower sales promotion expenses, an increase of $44.5
      million as a result of a reduction of approximately one percentage point,
      effective February 9, 2004, in Lorillard’s cash discount rate offered to direct
      buying accounts and an increase of $51.7 million due to increased unit sales
      volume, assuming prices were unchanged from the prior year. These improvements
      were partially offset by a decrease in revenues of $21.5 million due to lower
      average wholesale unit prices due to price/sales mix. Unit sales volume
      increased 0.4% as compared to the prior year.

Net
      income increased in 2004, as compared to 2003, due primarily to lower sales
      promotion expenses, a decrease in product liability defense costs as described
      above and the absence of charges recorded in 2003 related to the tobacco growers
      settlement and the resolution of indemnification claims and trademark matters.

The
      increase in net income in 2004, as compared to 2003, was partially offset by
      higher depreciation expense of $8.7 million pretax and State Settlement
      Agreement costs as described above. Lorillard recorded pretax charges of $845.9
      million and $785.2 million ($522.6 million and $489.5 million after taxes)
      for
      2004 and 2003, respectively, to record its obligations under the State
      Settlement Agreements. The $60.7 million pretax increase in tobacco settlement
      costs in 2004, as compared to 2003, was due to the impact of the inflation
      adjustment ($25.1 million), higher charges for higher unit sales ($2.8 million)
      and other adjustments ($32.8 million) under the State Settlement
      Agreements.

Overall,
      domestic industry unit sales volume decreased 1.7% in 2004 as compared with
      2003. Industry sales for premium brands were 69.6% of the total market in 2004
      as compared to 68.8% in 2003.

Lorillard’s
      total (domestic, Puerto Rico and certain U.S. Territories) gross unit sales
      volume increased 0.4% in 2004 as compared to 2003. Domestic wholesale volume
      increased 0.2% in 2004 as compared to 2003. Total Newport unit sales volume
      increased 1.3% in 2004 and domestic volume increased 1.2% in 2004 as compared
      with 2003.

Deep
      discount brands are produced by manufacturers who are subject to lower payment
      obligations under the State Settlement Agreements. Deep discount brands
      increased their market share in 2004 by 0.01 share points to
      14.25%.

Menthol
      cigarettes as a percent of the total industry remained relatively flat. Newport,
      the industry’s largest menthol brand, increased its share of the menthol segment
      to 32.0% in the fourth quarter of 2004. For the full year 2004, Newport had
      an
      approximate 31.3% share of the menthol segment compared to 30.5% in
      2003.

Lorillard’s
      premium products sold, as a percent of its total domestic volume, remained
      relatively flat in 2004 as compared with 2003.

Newport,
      a premium brand, accounted for approximately 91.0% of Lorillard’s unit sales
      volume in 2004 as compared to 90.2% in 2003.

Lorillard’s
      outside legal fees and other external product liability costs were $83.5 million
      and $93.7 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Other
      operating expenses in 2003 included an aggregate charge of $55.5 million to
      settle litigation with tobacco growers and resolve indemnification and trademark
      matters in connection with the 1977 sale of Lorillard’s international
      business.

                shipment reports

Unless
      otherwise specified, market share data in this MD&A is based on data made
      available by Management Science Associates, Inc. (“MSAI”), an independent
      third-party database management organization that collects wholesale shipment
      data from various cigarette manufacturers. MSAI divides the cigarette market
      into two price segments, the premium price segment and the discount or reduced
      price segment. MSAI’s information relating to unit sales volume and market share
      of certain of the smaller, primarily deep discount, cigarette manufacturers
      is
      based on estimates derived by MSAI.

Lorillard
      management continues to believe that volume and market share information for
      deep discount manufacturers are understated and, correspondingly, share
      information for the larger manufacturers, including Lorillard, are overstated
      by
      MSAI.

Business
      Environment

The
      tobacco industry in the United States, including Lorillard, continues to be
      faced with a number of issues that have impacted or may adversely impact the
      business, results of operations and financial condition of Lorillard and us,
      including the following:

·

A
                substantial

volume

of
                litigation seeking compensatory and punitive damages ranging

into the

billions
                of

dollars,
                as well as equitable and

injunctive relief, arising out of

allegations

of
                cancer and other health

effects

resulting
                from the use

of
                cigarettes

,

addiction
                to smoking

or
                exposure to

environmental
                tobacco

smoke

,

including
                claims for reimbursement of health care costs allegedly incurred
                as a
                result of smoking, as well as other alleged damages. Please read
                Item 3 -
                Legal Proceedings and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
                Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for information with
                respect
                to litigation and the State Settlement
                Agreements.

·

Substantial
                annual payments by Lorillard, continuing in perpetuity, and significant
                restrictions on marketing and advertising agreed to under the terms
                of the
                State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements impose
                a
                stream of future payment obligations on Lorillard and the other major
                U.S.
                cigarette manufacturers and place significant restrictions on their
                ability to market and sell
                cigarettes.

The
                cigarette market is highly concentrated with Lorillard’s two major
                competitors, Philip Morris USA and Reynolds American Inc. having
                a
                combined market share of approximately 76.9% in 2005. In addition,
                Reynolds American Inc. owns the third and fourth leading menthol
                brands,
                Kool and Salem, which have a combined share of the menthol segment
                of
                approximately 19.0%. The concentration of U.S. market share could
                make it
                more difficult for Lorillard to compete for shelf space in retail
                outlets,
                which is already exacerbated by restrictive marketing programs of
                Lorillard’s larger competitors, and could impact price competition among
                menthol brands.

·

The
                continuing contraction of the U.S. cigarette market, in which Lorillard
                currently conducts its only significant business. As a result of
                price
                increases, restrictions on advertising and promotions, increases
                in
                regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, a decline in the social
                acceptability of smoking, increased pressure from anti-tobacco groups
                and
                other factors, U.S. cigarette shipments among the three major U.S.
                cigarette manufacturers have decreased at a compound annual rate
                of
                approximately 2.4% over the period 1984 through 2005 according to
                information provided by MSAI.

·

Competition
                from deep discounters who enjoy competitive cost and pricing advantages
                because they are not subject to the same payment obligations under
                the
                State Settlement Agreements as Lorillard. Market share for the deep
                discount brands decreased 1.4 share points from 14.7% in the fourth
                quarter of 2004 to 13.3% in the fourth quarter of 2005, as estimated
                by
                MSAI. Lorillard’s focus on the premium market and its obligations under
                the State Settlement Agreements make it very difficult to compete
                successfully in the deep discount
                market.

·

Continuing
                sizable industry-wide promotional expenses and sales incentives are
                being
                implemented in response to declining unit volume, state excise tax
                increases and continuing competition among the three largest cigarette
                manufacturers, including Lorillard, and smaller participants who
                have
                established a competitive level of market share in recent years,
                principally in the deep discount cigarette segment. As a result of
                on-going high levels of competition based on the retail price of
                brands
                and the competitive price advantages of deep discounters, the ability
                of
                Lorillard and the other major manufacturers to raise prices has been
                adversely affected. While the environment remains highly price
                competitive, during 2005, Lorillard reduced promotional and sales
                incentives which had the effect of increasing unit
                prices.

·

Substantial
                federal, state and local excise taxes which are reflected in the
                retail
                price of cigarettes. In 2005, the federal excise tax was $0.39 per
                pack
                and combined state and local excise taxes ranged from $0.07 to $3.00
                per
                pack. In 2005, excise tax increases ranging from $0.10 to $1.00 per
                pack
                were implemented in twelve states. Proposals continue to be made
                to
                increase federal, state and local excise taxes. Lorillard believes
                that
                increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact
                on sales
                of cigarettes and that future increases, the extent of which cannot
                be
                predicted, could result in further volume declines for the cigarette
                industry, including Lorillard, and an increased sales shift toward
                lower
                priced discount cigarettes rather than premium brands. In addition,
                Lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers are required to pay an
                assessment under a federal law designed to fund payments to tobacco
                quota
                holders and growers.

·

Substantial
                and increasing regulation of the tobacco industry and governmental
                restrictions on smoking. Bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress
                to grant the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) authority to regulate
                tobacco products. Lorillard believes that FDA regulations, if enacted,
                could among other things result in new restrictions on the manner
                in which
                cigarettes can be advertised and marketed, and may alter the way
                cigarette
                products are developed and manufactured. Lorillard also believes
                that any
                such proposals, if enacted, would provide Philip Morris, as the largest
                tobacco company in the country, with a competitive
                advantage.

·

Sales
                of counterfeit cigarettes in the United States continue to adversely
                impact sales by the manufacturer of the counterfeited brands, including
                Lorillard, and potentially damage the value and reputation of those
                brands.

Boardwalk
      Pipeline derives revenues primarily from the interstate transportation and
      storage of natural gas for third parties. Transportation and storage services
      are provided under firm service and interruptible service agreements.
      Transportation rates are subject to maximum tariff rates established by the
      Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), although most services are
      provided at a discount to the maximum tariff rate due to the competitive
      marketplace.

Under
      firm transportation agreements, customers generally pay a fixed “demand” or
“capacity reservation” charge to reserve pipeline capacity at certain receipt
      and delivery points, plus a commodity and fuel charge paid on the volume of
      gas
      actually transported. Firm storage customers reserve a specific amount of
      storage capacity and generally pay a capacity reservation charge based on the
      amount of capacity being reserved plus an injection and/or withdrawal fee.
      Capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service generally remain
      constant over the term of the contract because the charges are based upon the
      capacity reserved and do not vary with actual use.

Interruptible
      transportation and storage service is typically short-term in nature and is
      generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been
      unable to contract for firm service. Customers pay for interruptible services
      when capacity is used.

Operating
      expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of gas
      transported with the exception of gas consumed by Gulf South’s compressor
      stations. Gulf South’s fuel recoveries are included as part of transportation
      revenues.

Revenues
      and net income in 2003 reflect operations from Texas Gas from May 17, 2003,
      the
      date of acquisition. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements.

Revenues
      and net income for 2004 reflect a full year of operations for Texas Gas and
      operations of Gulf South from December 29, 2004, the date of acquisition.

                (Continued)

Years
      Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004

Total
      revenues increased by $306.2 million to $571.3 million for the year ended
      December 31, 2005, compared to $265.1 million for the year ended December 31,
      2004.

Gas
      transportation revenues increased by $273.1 million to $526.6 million for the
      year ended December 31, 2005, substantially all of which was attributable
      to Gulf South, compared to $253.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.
      Revenues at Texas Gas remained essentially flat due to contract renewals and
      related discounting at the Lebanon terminus that were partially offset by new
      FERC rates, subject to refund, implemented on November 1, 2005, the completion
      of the Western Kentucky area storage expansion project on November 1, 2005
      and
      the associated transportation agreements, contributed an increase of
      approximately $2.0 million in revenues, and the leasing of additional capacity
      on a third party pipeline in Carthage, Texas on December 1, 2005 which
      contributed an increase of approximately $1.0 million in revenues.

Gas
      storage revenues increased by $14.4 million to $21.7 million for the year ended
      December 31, 2005, of which $16.3 million was attributable to Gulf South,
      compared to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Storage revenues
      decreased at Texas Gas by $2.0 million due to unusually high interruptible
      storage revenue generated in 2004 from favorable market conditions.

Other
      revenues increased by $17.9 million to $21.5 million for the year ended December
      31, 2005, of which $11.1 million was attributable to Gulf South, compared to
      $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The balance of the increase
      was due primarily to a $12.2 million gain on the sale of storage gas related
      to
      the Western Kentucky storage expansion.

Operating
      expenses increased by $199.2 million to $353.1 million for the year ended
      December 31, 2005, of which $207.4 million was attributable to Gulf South,
      compared to $153.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Interest
      expense increased by $30.0 million to $60.1 million for the full year ended
      December 31, 2005, due to higher interest expense primarily related to $575.0
      million of debt incurred in 2004 to fund the Gulf South acquisition, compared
      to
      $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Years
      Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003

Revenues
      for Texas Gas in 2004 reflect an increase in storage revenues due to new
      contracts and a regulatory settlement. These increases were partially offset
      by
      lower revenue due to the expiration of transportation contracts on third-party
      pipelines, and lower summer no-notice service.

Net
      income for Texas Gas decreased in 2004 due to an increase in operating expenses
      offset by an increase in revenues noted above. The increase in operating
      expenses was primarily due to a benefit accrual adjustment in 2003, an increase
      in labor and benefit costs and an accrual for environmental costs.

Diamond
      Offshore’s revenues vary based upon demand, which affects the number of days the
      fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned. When a rig is idle, generally no
      dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease. Revenues can also be affected
      as a
      result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, required surveys and shipyard
      upgrades. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, Diamond
      Offshore may mobilize its rigs from one market to another. However, during
      periods of unpaid mobilization, revenues may be adversely affected. In response
      to changes in demand, Diamond Offshore may withdraw a rig from the market by
      cold stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease
      or increase revenues, respectively.

The
      two
      most significant variables affecting revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig
      utilization rates, each of which is ultimately a function of rig supply and
      demand in the marketplace. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to
      increase as well, reflecting the lower supply of available rigs, and vice versa.
      The demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures
      set
      by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development as well as
      a
      variety of political and economic factors. The availability of rigs in a
      particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates.
      These factors are not within Diamond Offshore’s control and are difficult to
      predict.

Revenue
      from dayrate drilling contracts is recognized as services are performed. In
      connection with such drilling contracts, Diamond Offshore may receive lump-sum
      fees for the mobilization of equipment. These fees are earned as services are
      performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts.

In
      April
      2003, Diamond Offshore commissioned a study to evaluate the economic lives
      of
      its drilling rigs because several of its rigs had reached or were approaching
      the end of their depreciable lives, yet were still operating and were expected
      to operate for many more years. As a result of this study, effective April
      1,
      2003, Diamond Offshore recorded changes in accounting estimates by increasing
      the estimated service lives to 25 years for jack-ups and 30 years for
      semisubmersibles and its drillship and by increasing salvage values to 5% for
      most of its drilling rigs. Diamond Offshore made the change in estimate to
      better reflect the remaining economic lives and salvage values of its fleet.
      The
      effect of this change in accounting estimate resulted in an increase in net
      income for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $8.5 million, after tax and
      minority interest, and a reduction of Diamond Offshore’s net loss for the year
      ended December 31, 2004 of $10.7 million, after tax and minority interest.

Results
                of Operations - Diamond Offshore

-
                (Continued)

From
      time
      to time, Diamond Offshore may receive fees from its customers for capital
      improvements to their rigs. Diamond Offshore defers such fees received and
      recognizes these fees into income on a straight-line basis over the period
      of
      the related drilling contract. Diamond Offshore capitalizes the costs of such
      capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of
      the
      improvement.

Diamond
      Offshore receives reimbursements for the purchase of supplies, equipment,
      personnel services and other services provided at the request of its customers
      in accordance with a contract or agreement. Diamond Offshore records these
      reimbursements at the gross amount billed to their customers.

Operating
      income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of
      varying levels of operating expenses. Operating expenses generally are not
      affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by
      fluctuations in utilization. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short
      period of time, Diamond Offshore may realize few decreases in operating expenses
      since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or “ready stacked” state
      with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, Diamond Offshore is
      responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat
      costs, which are typically a cost of the operator under contract. However,
      if
      the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, Diamond Offshore may
      reduce the size of a rig’s crew and take steps to “cold stack” the rig, which
      lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating
      income.

Operating
      income is also negatively impacted when Diamond Offshore performs certain
      regulatory inspections that are due every five years (“5-year survey”) for each
      of Diamond Offshore’s rigs. Operating revenue decreases because these surveys
      are performed during scheduled down-time in a shipyard. Operating expenses
      increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs
      to a
      shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs. Repair
      and
      maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been
      previously planned to take place during this mandatory down-time. The number
      of
      rigs undergoing a 5-year survey will vary from year to year.

In
      addition, operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys,
      which are performed at interim periods between 5-year surveys. Intermediate
      surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a 5-year survey
      and require downtime for the drilling rig, but normally do not require
      dry-docking or shipyard time. During 2006, Diamond Offshore expects to spend
      an
      aggregate of $7.4 million for 5-year and intermediate surveys excluding
      mobilization costs and any resulting repair and maintenance costs.

      Compared with 2004

Revenues
      increased by $457.0 million, or 54.7% and net income increased by $136.1 million
      in the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004. Revenues increased
      primarily due to an overall increase in rig utilization rates and dayrates
      for
      all classes of rigs.

In
      the
      third quarter of 2005, one of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up drilling rigs, the

Ocean
      Warwick

,
      was
      damaged beyond repair during Hurricane Katrina and other rigs in Diamond
      Offshore’s fleet sustained lesser damage in Hurricanes Katrina or Rita, or in
      some cases from both storms. Diamond Offshore believes the physical damage
      to
      its rigs, as well as any related removal and recovery costs, are covered by
      insurance, after applicable deductibles.

Diamond
      Offshore recognized a $33.6 million casualty gain during the third quarter
      of
      2005 as a result of the constructive total loss of the

Ocean
      Warwick

.
      During
      2005, this drilling unit generated $11.8 million in revenues compared to $9.3
      million in 2004 primarily due to a higher average operating dayrate earned
      during 2005, as compared to 2004.

Revenues
      from high-specification floaters and other semisubmersible rigs increased $304.8
      million in 2005 due primarily to increased dayrates of $242.0 million as
      compared to 2004. Utilization improved in 2005, which generated an additional
      $58.3 million in revenue as compared to 2004.

Revenues
      from jack-up rigs increased by $93.4 million in the year ended December 31,
      2005, as compared to 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased dayrates
      of
      $89.5 million and improved utilization of $11.3 million, partially offset by
      a

-
                (Continued)

Net
      investment income increased by $13.8 million, primarily due to interest earned
      on higher average cash and investment balances in 2005 as compared to
      2004.

Interest
      expense increased $11.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily
      due to the additional expense related to the issuance of 5.2% and 4.9% senior
      unsecured notes, partially offset by redemption of zero coupon debentures.
      The
      year ended December 31, 2005 included a write-off of $6.9 million of debt
      issuance costs associated with the partial repurchase of Diamond Offshore’s Zero
      Coupon Debentures in June of 2005.

Net
      income increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 due primarily to the higher
      revenues discussed above, partially offset by increased contract drilling
      expenses and interest expense.

      Compared with 2003

Revenues
      increased by $147.9 million, or 21.5%, and net loss decreased by $20.4 million
      in 2004, as compared to 2003. Revenues in 2004 increased due primarily to higher
      contract drilling revenues of $130.3 million and gains on sales of marketable
      securities of $0.3 million as compared to losses of $6.9 million in the prior
      year.

Revenues
      from high-specification floaters and other semisubmersible rigs increased by
      $49.8 million in 2004, as compared to 2003. The increase reflects an increase
      in
      utilization of $18.4 million and revenues generated by the

Ocean

Rover

and

Ocean
      Vanguard

of $36.5
      million, partially offset by decreased dayrates of $13.2 million.

Revenues
      from jack-up rigs increased $80.6 million, or 82.5%, in 2004 due primarily
      to
      increased utilization of $35.4 million and increased dayrates of $34.3 million
      as compared to 2003. In addition, revenues in 2004 included $10.9 million
      related to the amortization of mobilization fees.

Investment
      income increased by $0.2 million, or 1.7%, primarily due to higher yields on
      cash and marketable securities and an increase in invested cash balances in
      2004, as compared to 2003.

Net
      loss
      decreased in 2004 due primarily to the higher utilization rates earned by
      semisubmersible rigs and improved results from sales of marketable securities
      as
      compared to 2003, partially offset by increased contract drilling expenses
      and
      costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Results for
      2003 were also negatively impacted by a reduced tax benefit related to losses
      incurred by Diamond Offshore’s rigs operating in international markets,
      partially offset by lower depreciation expense.

      Compared with 2004

Revenues
      increased by $35.3 million, or 11.2% and net income increased by $9.8 million
      in
      December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004.

Revenues
      increased in 2005, as compared to 2004, due primarily to an increase in revenue
      per available room of $16.20, or 11.9%, to $151.89 from $135.69 in the prior
      year. Revenue per available room increased due to higher average room rates,
      which increased $20.01, or 11.1% and a 0.8% increase in occupancy rates for
      the
      year ended December 31, 2005. In addition, higher equity income from joint
      ventures reflecting increased average room rates at the Universal Orlando
      properties and increased investment income as a result of the early repayment
      of
      a note received in connection with the sale of a hotel property contributed
      $7.1
      million to the increase.

Revenue
      per available room is an industry measure of the combined effect of occupancy
      rates and average room rates on room revenues. Other hotel operating revenues
      primarily include guest charges for food and beverages.

Net
      income for 2005 increased due to the higher revenues discussed above, partially
      offset by increased interest and operating expenses.

      Compared with 2003

Revenues
      increased by $29.2 million, or 10.2%, and income from continuing operations
      increased by $10.2 million in 2004, as compared to 2003.

Revenues
      increased in 2004, as compared to 2003, due primarily to an increase in revenue
      per available room and higher equity income of $6.0 million from joint ventures.
      Revenue per available room for 2004 increased by $10.40, or 8.3%, to $135.69,
      reflecting an increase in occupancy rates of 3.0% and an increase in average
      room rates of $8.70, or 5.1%, as compared to 2003.

Income
      from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased due
      to
      higher revenues discussed above, increased equity income from joint ventures
      and
      decreased interest expenses, partially offset by higher operating costs,
      increased advertising and depreciation expenses.

Net
      income in 2003 included a gain from the sale of the Metropolitan Hotel of
      approximately $56.7 million ($90.2 million pretax) reported as discontinued
      operations.

Corporate
      and Other

Corporate
      operations consist primarily of investment income, including investment gains
      (losses) from non-insurance subsidiaries, the operations of Bulova, equity
      earnings from Majestic Shipping Corporation (“Majestic”), corporate interest
      expenses and other corporate administrative costs. Majestic, a wholly owned
      subsidiary, owns a 49% common stock interest in Hellespont Shipping Corporation
      (“Hellespont”).

Revenues
      decreased by $204.0 million and net income decreased by $110.5 million in the
      year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004.

Revenues
      decreased in 2005, as compared to 2004, due primarily to a reduction in equity
      income of $188.2 million from shipping operations, and decreased net investment
      income of $34.2 million in 2005.

In
      2004,
      Hellespont sold all of its ultra-large crude oil tankers. We received cash
      distributions from Hellespont and recognized income of $179.3 million ($116.5
      million after taxes). Hellespont had been engaged in the business of owning
      and
      operating four ultra-large crude oil tankers that were used primarily to
      transport crude oil from the Persian Gulf to a limited number of ports in the
      Far East, Northern Europe and the United States.

Net
      investment income includes income from the trading portfolio of $42.8 million
      and $105.9 million ($27.8 million and $68.9 million after taxes) for the years
      ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Results
                of Operations - Corporate and Other -
                (Continued)

Net
      income decreased in 2005 due primarily to the reduced revenues discussed above,
      partially offset by lower income tax expense. Net income also included charges
      of $23.1 million related to the early retirement of our $400.0 million principal
      amount of 7.0% senior notes due 2023 and $1,150.0 million principal amount
      of
      3.1% exchangeable subordinated notes due 2007. Net income for 2004 included
      $11.1 million related to charges from the early retirement of our $300.0 million
      principal amount of 7.6% senior notes due 2023.

The
      lower
      income tax expense was primarily due to a review of tax liabilities we performed
      subsequent to the settlement of our 1998 through 2001 tax returns with the
      Internal Revenue Service. As a result, we reduced our deferred tax liabilities
      by $24.4 million in 2005.

      Compared with 2003

Revenues
      increased by $178.0 million and net income increased by $100.3 million in 2004,
      as compared to 2003.

Revenues
      increased in 2004 due primarily to income of $179.3 million from the Hellespont
      transaction noted above, partially offset by decreased net investment income
      and
      investment gains of $25.2 million.

Net
      income increased in 2004 due primarily to the increased revenues discussed
      above, partially offset by pretax charges in 2004 of $17.8 million related
      to
      the early redemption of long-term debt and $4.9 million related to an estimate
      by Bulova for remediation costs of environmental liabilities.

LIQUIDITY
      AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CNA
      Financial

Cash
      Flow

CNA’s
      principal operating cash flow sources are premiums and investment income from
      its insurance subsidiaries. CNA’s primary operating cash flow uses are payments
      for claims, policy benefits and operating expenses.

For
      2005,
      net cash provided by operating activities was $2,169.0 million as compared
      to
      $1,968.0 million in 2004. The increase in cash provided by operations was
      primarily driven by a reduction in claims and expense payments, including the
      impact of $446.0 million related to commutations. Also impacting operating
      cash
      flows were net tax payments of $164.0 million in 2005 as compared with net
      tax
      refunds of $627.0 million in 2004. In addition, CNA received cash of $121.0
      million related to interest on a federal income tax settlement in
      2005.

For
      2004,
      net cash provided by operating activities was $1,968.0 million as compared
      to
      $2,038.0 million in 2003. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities
      was primarily driven by a decrease in premium collections related to the
      dispositions of the life and group businesses and CNA Re. Partially offsetting
      the decrease in premium collections were decreased paid claims and a federal
      tax
      refund received in 2004.

Cash
      flows from investing activities include purchases and sales of financial
      instruments, as well as the purchase and sale of businesses, land, buildings,
      equipment and other assets not generally held for resale. The change in cash
      collateral exchanged as part of the securities lending activity is included
      as a
      cash flow from investing activities.

Net
      cash
      used for investing activities was $1,316.0 million, $2,084.0 million, and
      $2,392.0 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Cash flows used by investing
      activities were related principally to purchases of fixed maturity
      securities.

The
      cash
      flow from investing activities is impacted by various factors such as the
      anticipated payment of claims, financing activity, asset/liability management
      and individual security buy and sell decisions made in the normal course of
      portfolio management. A consideration in management of the portfolio is the
      characteristics of the underlying liabilities and the ability to align the
      duration of the portfolio to those liabilities to meet future liquidity needs
      and minimize interest rate risk. For portfolios where future liability cash
      flows are determinable and are generally long term in nature, management
      segregates assets and related liabilities for asset/liability management
      purposes. The asset/liability management strategy is used to mitigate valuation
      changes due to interest rate risk in

                (Continued)

those
      specific portfolios. Another consideration in the asset/liability matched
      portfolios is to maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying
      insurance liabilities.

For
      those
      securities in the portfolio that are not part of a segregated asset/liability
      management strategy, CNA typically manages the portfolio to a target duration
      range dictated by the underlying insurance liabilities. In managing these
      portfolios, securities are bought and sold based on individual security value
      assessments made, but with the overall goal of meeting the duration
      targets.

For
      2005,
      net cash used for financing activities was $837.0 million as compared with
      net
      cash provided from financing activities of $61.0 million in 2004. For 2003,
      net
      cash provided from financing activities was $322.0 million.

CNA
      believes that its present cash flows from operating activities, investing
      activities and financing activities are sufficient to fund its working capital
      needs. In addition, CNA believes it has adequate liquidity to meet its
      catastrophe loss obligations.

CNA
      has a
      shelf registration statement under which it may issue an aggregate of $1,500.0
      million of debt or equity securities. This registration statement was declared
      effective by the SEC on September 14, 2005.

Commitments,
      Contingencies and Guarantees

CNA
      has
      various commitments, contingencies and guarantees which it becomes involved
      with
      during the ordinary course of business. The impact of these commitments,
      contingencies and guarantees should be considered when evaluating CNA’s
      liquidity and capital resources.

Regulatory
      Matters

CNA
      has
      established a plan to reorganize and streamline its U.S. property and casualty
      insurance legal entity structure. One phase of this multi-year plan has been
      completed. This phase served to consolidate CNA’s U.S. property and casualty
      insurance risks into CCC, as well as realign the capital supporting these risks.
      As part of this phase, CNA implemented a 100% quota share reinsurance agreement,
      effective January 1, 2003, ceding all of the net insurance risks of CIC and
      its
      14 affiliated insurance companies (“CIC Group”) to CCC. In addition, the
      ownership of the CIC Group was transferred to CCC in order to align the
      insurance risks with the supporting capital. In subsequent phases of this plan,
      CNA will continue its efforts to reduce both the number of U.S. property and
      casualty insurance entities it maintains and the number of states in which
      these
      entities are domiciled. In order to facilitate the execution of this plan,
      CNA
      has agreed to participate in a working group consisting of several states of
      the
      NAIC. Pursuant to CNA’s participation in this working group, CNA has agreed to
      certain time frames and informational provisions in relation to the
      reorganization plan.

In
      connection with the approval process for aspects of the reorganization and
      legal
      entity streamlining plan, CNA agreed to undergo zone regulatory financial
      examinations of CCC and CIC as of December 31, 2003, including a review of
      insurance reserves by an independent actuarial firm. A zone examination is
      a
      vehicle developed by the NAIC for conducting financial examinations of
      multi-state licensed insurers. It allows a representative number of state
      insurance departments to devote resources to the examination process while
      providing an independent and diverse perspective on all areas being reviewed.
      The CCC examination specifically included a review of certain finite reinsurance
      contracts entered into by CNA and determined that such contracts possess
      sufficient risk transfer characteristics necessary to qualify for accounting
      treatment as reinsurance on a statutory basis. These zone regulatory
      examinations were concluded in 2005 and final examination reports have been
      issued.

Along
      with other companies in the industry, CNA has received subpoenas,
      interrogatories and inquiries from: (i) California, Connecticut, Delaware,
      Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
      Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and the Canadian Council
      of
      Insurance Regulators concerning investigations into practices including
      contingent compensation arrangements, fictitious quotes, and tying arrangements;
      (ii) the SEC, the New York State Attorney General, the United States Attorney
      for the Southern District of New York, the Connecticut Attorney General, the
      Connecticut Department of Insurance, the Delaware Department of Insurance,

      practices; and (iv) the New York State Attorney General concerning declinations
      of attorney malpractice insurance. CNA continues to respond to these subpoenas,
      interrogatories and inquiries.

Subsequent
      to receipt of the SEC subpoena, CNA has been producing documents and
      providing additional information at the SEC’s request. In addition, the SEC and
      representatives of the United States Attorney

’

s Office
      for the
      Southern District of New York have been conducting interviews with several
      of CNA’s current and former executives relating to the restatement
      of CNA

’

s
      financial results for 2004, including its relationship with and accounting
      for
      transactions with an affiliate that were the basis for the restatement. The
      SEC
      has also recently requested information relating to CNA

’

s current
      restatement relating to its discontinued operations. It is possible that CNA’s
      analyses of, or accounting treatment for, finite reinsurance contracts or
      discontinued operations could be questioned or disputed by regulatory
      authorities. As a result, further restatement of the financial
      results is possible.

Ratings

Ratings
      are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance
      companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries are rated by major rating
      agencies, and these ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of the insurance
      company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and
      ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. Agency ratings are not a
      recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or
      withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should
      be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. One or more of these
      agencies could take action in the future to change the ratings of CNA’s
      insurance subsidiaries.

“On
      Review,” “Credit Watch” and “Rating Watch” are modifiers used by the ratings
      agencies to alert those parties relying on CNA’s ratings of the possibility of a
      rating change within 90 days. Modifiers are utilized when the agencies are
      uncertain as to the impact of a CNA action or initiative, which could prove
      to
      be material to the current rating level. “Outlooks” accompanied with ratings are
      additional modifiers used by the rating agencies of the possibility of a rating
      change in the longer term.

The
      table
      below reflects the various group ratings issued by A.M. Best Company (“A.M.
      Best”), Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”)
      and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) as of February 26, 2006 for the Property and
      Casualty and Life companies. The table also includes the ratings for CNA’s
      senior debt and Continental senior debt.

(a)

Fitch
                and Moody’s outlook for the Property & Casualty companies’ financial
                strength and holding company debt ratings are stable. All others
                are
                negative.

(b)

A.M.
                Best, Fitch and Moody’s have a stable outlook while S&P has a negative
                outlook on the CAC rating.

On
        November 3, 2005 and February 17, 2006, Moody’s and Fitch concluded their annual
        reviews and affirmed CNA’s current debt and financial strength ratings. The
        Moody’s rating outlook was changed to stable from negative and Fitch’s current
        stable outlook was unchanged.

        CNA’s
        property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings were downgraded
        below
        current levels, CNA’s business and our results of operations could be materially
        adversely affected. The severity of the impact on CNA’s business is dependent on
        the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes
        the
        rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades
        would
        be the inability to obtain a material

volume
      of
      business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material
      volume of CNA’s insurance products to certain markets, and the required
      collateralization of certain future payment obligations or
      reserves.

In
      addition, we believe that a lowering of our debt ratings by certain of these
      agencies could result in an adverse impact on CNA’s ratings, independent of any
      change in circumstances at CNA. Each of the major rating agencies which rates
      us
      currently maintains a negative outlook, but none currently has us on negative
      Credit Watch.

CNA
      has
      entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts
      that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed
      reserves if CNA’s ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain
      thresholds. The ratings triggers are generally more than one level below CNA’s
      current ratings.

Dividend
      Paying Ability

CNA’s
      ability to pay dividends and other credit obligations is significantly dependent
      on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries. The payment of dividends to
      CNA
      by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department
      of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. Dividends
      in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective
      state
      insurance departments.

Dividends
      from CCC are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of
      Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends,
      or
      dividends that do not require prior approval of the Illinois Department of
      Financial and Professional Regulation - Division of Insurance (the
“Department”), may be paid only from earned surplus, which is calculated by
      removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2005,
      CCC
      is in a positive earned surplus position, enabling CCC to pay approximately
      $48.0 million of dividend payments during 2006 that would not be subject to
      the
      Department’s prior approval. In February of 2006, the Department approved
      extraordinary dividends in the amount of $344.0 million to be used to fund
      CNA’s
      2006 debt service and principal repayment requirements.

CNA’s
      domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital requirements.
      Risk-based capital is a method developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum
      amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support
      its
      overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile.
      The
      formula for determining the amount of risk-based capital specifies various
      factors, weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied
      to
      certain financial balances and financial activity. The adequacy of a company’s
      actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the risk-based capital results,
      as determined by the formula. Companies below minimum risk-based capital
      requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which requires
      specified corrective action. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, all of CNA’s
      domestic insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum risk-based capital
      requirements.

Lorillard

Lorillard
      and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial
      litigation. Plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of
      compensatory damages and punitive damages, although some seek damages ranging
      into the billions of dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble
      damages, statutory damages, disgorgement of profits, equitable and injunctive
      relief, and medical monitoring, among other damages.

Lorillard
      believes that it has valid defenses to the cases pending against it. Lorillard
      also believes it has valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against
      it.
      To the extent we are a defendant in any of the lawsuits, we believe that we
      are
      not a proper defendant in these matters and have moved or plan to move for
      dismissal of all such claims against us. While Lorillard intends to defend
      vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation, it is not possible to

predict
      the outcome of any of this litigation. Litigation is subject to many
      uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided
      unfavorably. Lorillard may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle
      particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so.

Except
        for the impact of the State Settlement Agreements as described below, we
        are
        unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that
        could
        result from an unfavorable outcome of pending tobacco related litigation
        and,
        therefore, no provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements
        for any unfavorable

outcome.
      It is possible that our results of operations, cash flows and our financial
      position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of
      certain pending litigation.

The
      State
      Settlement Agreements require

Lorillard
      and

the

other

Original
      Participating Manufacturers (“OPMs”) to make

aggregate

annual
      payments of $8.4 billion through 2007 and $9.4 billion thereafter, subject
      to
      adjustment for several factors

described below

.

In
      addition, the

OPMs

are
      required to pay plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, subject to an

aggregate

annual
      cap of $500.0 million, as well as an additional

aggregate

amount
      of
      up to $125.0 million in each year through 2008. These payment obligations are
      the several and not joint obligations of each

of
      the
      OPMs

.
      We
      believe that Lorillard’s obligations under the State Settlement Agreements will
      materially adversely affect our cash flows and operating income in future
      years.

Both
      the
      aggregate payment

obligations

of the
      OPMs, and the payment obligations of Lorillard, individually,

under
      the State Settlement Agreements are subject to adjustment for

several
      factors which include:

·

inflation

;

·

aggregate

volume of domestic cigarette shipments

;

·

market
                share; and

·

industry
                operating income

.

The
      inflation adjustment increases payments on a compounded annual basis by the
      greater of 3.0% or the actual total percentage change in the consumer price
      index for the preceding year. The inflation adjustment is measured starting
      with
      inflation for 1999. The volume adjustment increases or decreases payments based
      on the increase or decrease in the total number of cigarettes shipped in or
      to
      the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico by the OPMs during
      the preceding year, as compared to the 1997 base

year
      shipments

.
      If
      volume has increased, the volume adjustment would increase the annual payment
      by
      the same percentage as the number of cigarettes shipped exceeds the 1997 base
      number. If volume has decreased, the volume adjustment would decrease the annual
      payment by

98.0%
      of
      the percentage reduction in volume.

In
      addition, downward

adjustments to the annual payments for changes in volume may, subject to
      specified conditions and exceptions, be reduced in the event of an increase
      in
      the OPMs aggregate operating income from domestic sales of cigarettes over
      base
      year levels established in the State Settlement Agreements, adjusted for
      inflation. Any adjustments resulting from increases in operating income would
      be
      allocated among those OPMs who have had increases.

Lorillard’s
      cash payment under the State Settlement Agreements in 2005 was approximately
      $850.8 million

.
      Lorillard estimates the amount payable in 2006 will be approximately $875.0
      million to $925.0 million

,
      primarily based on 2005 estimated industry volume. Because

of the
      many factors discussed above, Lorillard is unable to predict the amount of

payments

under
      the
      State Settlement Agreements

in

subsequent

years

.
      Lorillard’s cash payment in 2005 for the federal assessment relating to the
      repeal of the federal supply management program for tobacco growers was $113.3
      million.

See
      Item
      3 - Legal Proceedings and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information
      regarding this settlement and other litigation matters.

Lorillard’s
      cash and investments, net of receivables and payables, totaled $1,750.1 million
      and $1,581.1 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December
      31, 2005, 89.3% of Lorillard’s cash and investments were invested in short-term
      securities, primarily money market accounts.

The principal source of liquidity for Lorillard’s business and
      operating needs is internally generated funds from its operations. Lorillard’s
      operating activities resulted in a net cash inflow of approximately $820.3
      million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $631.9 million for
      the
      prior year. Lorillard believes, based on current conditions, that cash flows
      from operating activities will be sufficient to enable it to meet its
      obligations under the State Settlement Agreements and to fund its capital
      expenditures. Lorillard cannot predict the impact on its cash flows of cash
      requirements related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash
      required to bond any

Boardwalk
      Pipeline

At
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, cash and investments amounted to $65.8 million
      and
      $16.5 million, respectively. Funds from operations for the year ended December
      31, 2005 amounted to $218.7 million, compared to $104.4 million in 2004. In
      and 2004,

Boardwalk
      Pipeline’s capital expenditures were $83.0 million and $41.9 million,
      respectively.

In
      November of 2005, Boardwalk Pipeline entered into a five year $200.0 million
      revolving credit facility that may be used for letters of credit and general
      partnership purposes. Interest on amounts drawn under the credit facility is
      payable at a floating rate equal to an applicable spread per annum over LIBOR.
      The credit facility agreement requires Boardwalk Pipeline to maintain leverage
      and interest coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2005, $42.1 million was
      outstanding under the credit facility.

In
      February of 2006, Gulf South entered into long-term agreements with customers
      providing firm commitments for capacity on its 1.0 Bcf per day pipeline
      expansion projects in East Texas and Mississippi. Boardwalk Pipeline expects
      the
      total cost for the 1.0 Bcf expansion to be approximately $575.0 million, and
      expects the new capacity to be in-service during the second half of 2007. These
      projects are subject to FERC approvals.

In
      2006,
      Boardwalk Pipeline expects to make capital expenditures of approximately $225.0
      million to $250.0 million, of which $45.0 million to $50.0 million is expected
      to be for maintenance capital and $180.0 million to $200.0 million for expansion
      capital, including approximately $150.0 million to fund the East Texas and
      Mississippi pipeline expansion projects discussed above. The amount of expansion
      capital to be expended in 2006 could vary significantly depending on the
      progress made with these projects, the number and types of other capital
      projects Boardwalk Pipeline may decide to pursue, the timing of any of those
      projects and numerous other factors beyond its control.

Boardwalk
      Pipeline expects to fund the capital expenditure requirements from operating
      cash flows and, where necessary, with a combination of borrowings under
      Boardwalk Pipeline’s revolving credit facility and proceeds from sales of debt
      and equity securities, though no determination has been made with regard to
      such
      financing.

Diamond
      Offshore

Cash
      and
      investments, net of receivables and payables, totaled $844.8 million at December
      31, 2005 compared to $927.9 at December 31, 2004. Cash provided by operating
      activities was $388.6 million in 2005, compared to $208.3 million in 2004.

The
      increase in cash flow from operations in 2005 is the result of higher
      utilization and average dayrates earned by Diamond Offshore’s drilling units as
      a result of an increase in overall demand for offshore contract drilling
      services.

In
      the
      second quarter of 2005, Diamond Offshore entered into agreements to construct
      two high-performance, premium jack-up rigs. The two new drilling units, the

Ocean
      Scepter

and the

Ocean
      Shield

,
      are
      under construction in Brownsville, Texas and in Singapore, respectively, at
      an
      aggregate expected cost of approximately $300.0 million. Diamond Offshore paid
      shipyard deposits totaling $85.9 million in 2005 related to the new
      construction. During 2006, Diamond Offshore expects to spend approximately
      $114.0 million for the construction of the two new drilling units with delivery
      of both units expected during the first quarter of 2008.

In
      May of
      2005, Diamond Offshore began a major upgrade of the

Ocean
      Endeavor

for
      ultra-deepwater service. The modernized rig is being designed to operate in
      up
      to 10,000 feet of water at an estimated upgrade cost of

approximately
      $250.0 million, of which approximately $54.5 million had been spent as of
      December 31, 2005. During 2006, Diamond Offshore expects to spend approximately
      $145.0 million for the upgrade of the

Ocean
      Endeavor

and
      expects delivery of the upgraded rig in mid-2007.

As
        of
        December 31, 2005, Diamond Offshore had purchase obligations aggregating
        approximately $411.0 million related to the major upgrade of the

Ocean
        Endeavor

and
        construction of two new jack-up rigs, the

Ocean
        Scepter

      Diamond
      Offshore had no other purchase obligations for major rig upgrades or any other
      significant obligations at December 31, 2005, except for those that arise during
      the normal course of business and are related to its direct rig
      operations.

In
      January 2006, Diamond Offshore announced that they will upgrade the currently
      cold-stacked

Ocean
      Monarch

(formerly known as

Enserch
      Garden Banks

)
      for
      ultra-deep water service at an aggregate estimated cost of approximately $300.0
      million. Diamond Offshore expects to mobilize the rig to a shipyard in Singapore
      for the upgrade in mid-2006 and expects to spend approximately $60.0 million
      on
      this project in 2006. Diamond Offshore purchased the

Ocean
      Monarch

and
      its
      related equipment in August of 2005 for $20.0 million.

Diamond
      Offshore estimates that capital expenditures in 2006 associated with its ongoing
      rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs and other corporate
      requirements will be approximately $215.0 million. As of December 31, 2005,
      Diamond Offshore had spent approximately $133.4 million for capital additions,
      excluding upgrade costs for the

Ocean
      Endeavor

,
      construction of the two new jack-up rigs and the reactivation of the

Ocean
      New Era

.

Diamond
      Offshore’s liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of its
      working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service
      requirements.

Cash
      required to meet Diamond Offshore’s capital commitments is determined by
      evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements
      and
      by evaluating Diamond Offshore’s ongoing rig equipment replacement and
      enhancement programs, including water depth and drilling capability upgrades.
      It
      is the opinion of Diamond Offshore’s management that its operating cash flows
      and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments; however,
      Diamond Offshore will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry
      conditions. In addition, Diamond Offshore may, from time to time, issue debt
      or
      equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures,
      the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes.
      Diamond Offshore’s ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on the
      results of Diamond Offshore’s operations, its current financial condition,
      current market conditions and other factors, which are beyond its
      control.

In
      June
      of 2005, Diamond Offshore issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount
      of
      4.9% Senior Notes at an offering price of 99.785% of the principal amount,
      resulting in net proceeds of $247.7 million.

In
      June
      of 2005, Diamond Offshore repurchased $460.0 million accreted value, or $774.1
      million in aggregate principal amount at maturity, of its Zero Coupon Debentures
      at a purchase price of $594.25 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which
      represented approximately 96.2% of its then outstanding Zero Coupon
      Debentures.

Diamond
      Offshore’s credit rating is Baa2 for Moody’s Investors Services (“Moody’s”) and
      A- for S&P.

In
      2005,
      Diamond Offshore increased its quarterly dividend to $0.125 per share from
      $0.0625 per share of Diamond Offshore common stock. On January 24, 2006, Diamond
      Offshore declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share of Diamond
      Offshore common stock and an annual special cash dividend of $1.50 per share
      of
      Diamond Offshore common stock, both of which are payable March 1, 2006 to
      stockholders of record on February 3, 2006.

      and
      short-term investments decreased from $58.6 million at December 31, 2004 to
      $19.1 million at December 31, 2005. Funds from operations continue to exceed
      operating requirements. Funds for other capital expenditures and working capital
      requirements are expected to be provided from existing cash balances and
      operations.

In
        the
        first quarter of 2005, Loews Hotels refinanced $107.8 million of mortgages
        with
        new loans of $206.3 million. Loews Hotels also received cash distributions
        of
        $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from its joint venture

Hurricane
      Katrina resulted in the temporary closing of the Loews New Orleans Hotel, a
      managed property. The hotel reopened with limited service in mid-October. Loews
      Hotels is a guarantor of up to $10.0 million of the $40.0 million principal
      amount first mortgage debt on the New Orleans Hotel. No advances have been
      made

Corporate
      and Other

On
      January 27, 2005, we sold an additional $100.0 million principal amount of
      our
      5.3% senior notes due 2016 and sold $300.0 million principal amount of a new
      issue of 6.0% senior notes due 2035. We used net proceeds from the sale,
      together with available cash, to redeem our outstanding $400.0 million principal
      amount of 7.0% senior notes due 2023 at a redemption price of 102.148% of the
      principal amount on February 28, 2005.

On
      April
      21, 2005, we redeemed our outstanding $1,150.0 million principal amount of
      3.1%
      exchangeable subordinated notes due 2007 at a redemption price of 100.9375%
      of
      the principal amount, plus accrued interest. We funded the redemption price
      from
      our available cash balances.

Corporate
      cash and investments, net of receivables and payables, at December 31, 2005
      totaled $2.9 billion, as compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2004. The
      increase in net cash and investments is primarily due to the receipt of $937.0
      million in dividends from our subsidiaries, net proceeds of $144.5 from the
      repayment of intercompany debt, net proceeds of $415.1 million from the issuance
      of 10,000,000 shares of Carolina Group stock in November of 2005 and net
      proceeds of $250.0 million from the repayment of intercompany debt, relating
      to
      the acquisition of Gulf South, as a result of Boardwalk Pipeline’s issuance of
      15,000,000 common units in November of 2005. This increase was partially offset
      by the redemption of our 3.1% exchangeable subordinated notes due 2007 for
      $1,164.4 million and $239.9 million of dividends paid to
      shareholders.

We
      have
      an effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 registering the future sale
      of
      our debt and/or equity securities. As of February 17, 2006, $1.6 billion of
      securities were available for issuance under this shelf registration
      statement.

      December 31, 2005, there were 185,846,889 shares of Loews common stock
      outstanding and 78,191,678 shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding. Depending
      on market and other conditions, we may purchase shares of our, and our
      subsidiaries’, outstanding common stock in the open market or
      otherwise.

We
      continue to pursue conservative financial strategies and seek opportunities
      for
      responsible growth. These include the expansion of

INVESTMENTS

Investment
      activities of non-insurance companies include investments in fixed income
      securities, equity securities including short sales, derivative instruments
      and
      short-term investments, and are carried at fair value. Equity securities, which
      are considered part of our trading portfolio, short sales and derivative
      instruments are marked to market and reported as net investment income in the
      Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We
      enter
      into short sales and invest in certain derivative instruments that are used
      for asset and liability management activities, income enhancements to our
      portfolio management strategy and to benefit from anticipated future movements
      in the underlying markets. If such movements do not occur as anticipated, then
      significant losses may occur. Monitoring procedures include senior management
      review of daily detailed reports of existing positions and valuation
      fluctuations to ensure that open positions are consistent with our portfolio
      strategy.

Credit
      exposure associated with non-performance by the counterparties to derivative
      instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized change in fair value
      of
      the derivative instruments recognized in the Consolidated

      We mitigate

the
      risk
      of non-

performance
      by monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties and diversifying
      derivatives to multiple counter-parties. We occasionally require collateral
      from
      our derivative investment counterparties depending on the amount of the exposure
      and the credit rating of the counterparty.

We
      do not
      believe that any of the derivative instruments we use are unusually complex,
      nor
      do the use of these instruments, in our opinion, result in a higher degree
      of
      risk. See “Results of Operations,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
      about Market Risk” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information with respect to
      derivative instruments, including recognized gains and losses on these

The
                change in net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities, included
                in
                net investment income, was $(7.0) and $2.0 million for the years
                ended
                December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Net
      investment income increased in 2005 as compared with 2004. This increase was
      due
      to the reduced interest expense on funds withheld and other deposits and
      improved results across all other available-for-sale asset classes, especially
      short-term investments which reflect the improved period over period yields.
      During 2005, CNA commuted several significant reinsurance contracts which
      contained interest crediting provisions and as a result, there will be no
      further interest expense on funds withheld on the commuted contracts in future
      periods. The pretax interest expense on funds withheld related to these
      significant commuted contracts was $72.0 million, $132.0 million and $235.0
      million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, and was reflected as a component of net
      investment income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. See the
      Reinsurance section of the MD&A for additional information about interest
      costs on funds withheld and other deposits. The improvement in net investment
      income was partly offset by decreases in investment income from the trading
      portfolio.

Net
      investment income was slightly higher in 2004 as compared with 2003. This
      increase was due primarily to the reduced interest expense on funds withheld
      and
      other deposits. The interest costs on funds withheld and other deposits
      increased in 2003 as a result of additional cessions to the corporate aggregate
      reinsurance and other treaties due to adverse net prior year development. This
      improvement in 2004 was partly offset by decreases in investment income across
      all other available-for-sale asset classes which is largely the result of the
      impacts of the group benefits and individual life sale transactions that are
      described in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
      under Item 8. Also, the net investment income of the trading portfolio
      positively impacted results for 2004.

The
      bond
      segment of the investment portfolio yielded 4.9% in 2005, 4.6% in 2004 and
      5.1%
      in 2003.

Net
      realized investment results improved $130.2 million after tax and minority
      interest in 2005 as compared with 2004. This improvement is primarily the result
      of a 2004 loss of $352.9 million after tax and minority interest for the sale
      of
      the individual life insurance business, partly offset by reduced gains for
      equities securities. Gains on equity securities in 2004 included a gain of
      $95.8
      million after tax and minority interest related to CNA’s investment in Canary
      Wharf Group PLC (“Canary Wharf”), a London-based real estate company. Also
      impacting results for 2005 versus 2004 were decreased results in the overall
      fixed maturity asset class partly offset by improved results for the derivatives
      asset class. Impairment losses of $63.9 million after tax and minority interest
      were recorded in 2005 across various sectors, including an after tax and
      minority interest impairment loss of $20.1 million related to loans made under
      a
      credit facility to a national contractor, that are classified as fixed
      maturities. Impairment losses of $54.8 million after tax and minority interest
      were recorded in 2004 across various sectors, including an after tax and
      minority interest impairment loss of $32.9 million related to loans to the
      national contractor. For additional information on loans to the national
      contractor, see Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      included under Item 8.

Net
      realized investment results decreased $402.8 million after tax and minority
      interest in 2004 as compared with 2003. This decrease in net realized investment
      results was primarily due to the loss on the sale of the individual life
      insurance business of $352.9 million after tax and minority interest, losses
      on
      derivatives of $50.2 million after tax and minority interest and reduced fixed
      maturity gains. The derivative securities losses recorded in 2004 were primarily
      due to derivative securities held to mitigate the effect of changes in long
      term
      interest rates on the value of the fixed maturity portfolio. These decreases
      were partly offset by a $95.8 million after tax and minority interest gain
      related to CNA’s investment in Canary Wharf, and a reduction in impairment
      losses for other-than-temporary declines in market values for fixed maturity
      and
      equity securities. In 2003, impairment losses of $188.4 million after tax and
      minority interest were recorded across various sectors including the airline,
      healthcare and energy industries.

A
      primary
      objective in the management of the fixed maturity and equity portfolios is
      to
      maximize total return relative to underlying liabilities and respective
      liquidity needs. CNA’s views on the current interest rate environment, tax
      regulations, asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader
      industry segment conditions, and the domestic and global economic conditions,
      are some of the factors that may enter into a decision to move between asset
      classes. Based on CNA’s consideration of these factors, in the course of normal
      investment activity CNA may, in pursuit of the total return objective, be
      willing to sell securities that, in CNA’s analysis, are overvalued on a risk
      adjusted basis relative to other opportunities that are available at the time
      in
      the market; in turn

                of Operations

Investments
                - (Continued)

CNA
      may
      purchase other securities that, according to CNA’s analysis, are undervalued in
      relation to other securities in the market. In making these value decisions,
      securities may be bought and sold that shift the investment portfolio between
      asset classes. CNA also continually monitors exposure to issuers of securities
      held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time reduce
      such
      exposures based on its views of a specific issuer or industry sector. These
      activities will produce realized gains or losses.

The
      investment portfolio is periodically analyzed for changes in duration and
      related price change risk. In addition, CNA periodically reviews the sensitivity
      of the portfolio to the level of foreign exchange rates and other factors that
      contribute to market price changes. A summary of these risks and specific
      analysis on changes is included in Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative
      Disclosures about Market Risk included herein. Under certain economic
      conditions, including but not limited to a changing interest rate environment,
      CNA may hedge the value of the investment portfolio by utilizing derivative
      strategies, as discussed further in Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
      Financial Statements.

CNA
      invests in certain derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce its
      exposure to market risk (principally interest rate, equity price and foreign
      currency risk) and credit risk (risk of nonperformance of underlying obligor).
      Derivative securities are recorded at fair value at the reporting date. CNA
      also
      uses derivatives to mitigate market risk by purchasing S&P 500 index futures
      in a notional amount equal to the contract liability relating to Life and Group
      Non-Core indexed group annuity contracts. CNA provided collateral to satisfy
      margin deposits on exchange-traded derivatives totaling $64.0 million as of
      December 31, 2005. For over-the-counter derivative transactions CNA utilizes
      International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreements that
      specify certain limits over which collateral is exchanged. As of December 31,
      2005, CNA provided $2.0 million of cash as collateral for over-the-counter
      derivative instruments.

A
      further
      consideration in the management of the investment portfolio is the
      characteristics of the underlying liabilities and the ability to align the
      duration of the portfolio to those liabilities to meet future liquidity needs,
      minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support
      the underlying insurance liabilities. For portfolios where future liability
      cash
      flows are determinable and long term in nature, CNA segregates assets for asset
      liability management purposes.

CNA
      classifies its fixed maturity securities (bonds and redeemable preferred stocks)
      and its equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading, and as such,
      they are carried at fair value. The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities
      is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity,
      which is included in net investment income. Changes in fair value related to
      available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of other comprehensive
      income. Changes in fair value of trading securities are reported within net
      investment income.

      following table provides further detail of gross realized gains and losses

      by
      issuer including: the fair value of the securities at sale date, the amount
      of
      the loss recorded and the period of time that the security had been in an

      The
      period of time that the security had been in an unrealized loss position prior
      to sale can vary due to the timing of individual security purchases. Also
      included is a narrative providing the industry sector along with the facts

CNA’s
      general account investment portfolio consists primarily of publicly traded
      government bonds, asset-backed securities, short-term investments, municipal
      bonds and corporate bonds.

A
      significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination of
      when an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. CNA analyzes securities
      on
      at least a quarterly basis. Part of this analysis is to monitor the length
      of
      time and severity of the decline below book value for those securities in an
      unrealized loss position. Information on CNA’s impairment process and
      impairments recorded in 2005, 2004 and 2003 is set forth in Note 2 of the Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Investments
      in the general account had a total net unrealized gain of $787.0 million at
      December 31, 2005 compared with $1,197.0 million at December 31, 2004. The
      unrealized position at December 31, 2005 was comprised of a net unrealized
      gain
      of $618.0 million for fixed maturities, a net unrealized gain of $170.0 million
      for equity securities, and a net unrealized loss of $1.0 million for short-term
      securities. The unrealized position at December 31, 2004 was comprised of a
      net
      unrealized gain of $1,061.0 million for fixed maturities and a net

unrealized
      gain of $136.0 million for equity securities. See Note 2 of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further detail
      of
      the unrealized position of CNA’s general account investment
      portfolio.

CNA’s
      investment policies for both the general account and separate account emphasize
      high credit quality and diversification by industry, issuer and issue. Assets
      supporting interest rate sensitive liabilities are segmented within the general
      account to facilitate asset/liability duration management.

The
      following table provides the composition of fixed maturity securities with
      an
      unrealized loss at December 31, 2005 in relation to the total of all fixed
      maturity securities with an unrealized loss by contractual
      maturities.

As
      part
      of the ongoing impairment monitoring process, CNA evaluated the facts and
      circumstances based on available information for each of the non-investment
      grade securities and determined that no further impairments were appropriate
      at
      December 31, 2005. This determination was based on a number of factors that
      CNA
      regularly considers including, but not limited to: the issuers’ ability to meet
      current and future interest and principal payments, an evaluation of the
      issuers’ financial condition and near term prospects, CNA’s assessment of the
      sector outlook and estimates of the fair value of any underlying collateral.
      In
      all cases where a decline in value is judged to be temporary, CNA has the intent
      and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to recover
      the book

value
      of
      its investment through a recovery in the fair value of such securities or by
      holding the securities to maturity. In many cases, the securities held are
      matched to liabilities as part of ongoing asset/liability duration management.
      As such, CNA continually assesses its ability to hold securities for a time
      sufficient to recover any temporary loss in value or until maturity. CNA
      believes it has sufficient levels of liquidity so as to not impact the
      asset/liability management process.

CNA’s
      equity securities available-for-sale as of December 31, 2005 that were in an
      unrealized loss position had a fair value of $53.0 million. Under the same
      process as followed for fixed maturity securities, CNA monitors the equity
      securities for other-than-temporary declines in value. In all cases where a
      decline in value is judged to be temporary, CNA expects to recover the book
      value of its investment through a recovery in the fair value of the
      security.

See
      Note
      2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for
      further discussion.

Invested
      assets are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and credit
      risk. Due to the level of risk associated with certain invested assets and
      the
      level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of these assets, it is
      possible that changes in these risks in the near term, including increases
      in
      interest rates, could have an adverse material impact on our results of
      operations or equity.

The
      general account portfolio consists primarily of high quality bonds, 92.1% and
      92.8% of which were rated as investment grade (rated BBB or higher) at December
      31, 2005 and 2004.

      High-yield securities generally involve a greater degree of risk than

      returns are anticipated to compensate for the added risk. This risk is also
      considered in the interest rate assumptions for the underlying insurance
      products.

The
      carrying value of non-traded securities at December 31, 2005 was $141.0 million
      which represents 0.4% of CNA’s total investment portfolio. These securities were
      in a net unrealized gain position of $115.0 million at December 31, 2005. Of
      the
      non-traded securities, 67.0% are priced by unrelated third party
      sources.

Included
      in CNA’s general account fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2005 are
      $12,946.0 million of asset-backed securities, at fair value, consisting of
      approximately 64.0% in collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”), 21.0% in
      corporate asset-backed obligations, 13.0% in corporate mortgage-backed
      pass-through certificates and 2.0% in U.S. Government agency issued pass-through

ACCOUNTING
      STANDARDS

In
      December of 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a
      complete replacement of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No.
      123, “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”), which covers a wide range of
      share-based compensation arrangements, including share options, restricted
      share
      plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee share
      purchase plans. SFAS No. 123R requires companies to use the fair value method
      in
      accounting for employee stock options which results in compensation expense
      recorded in the income statement. Compensation expense is measured at the grant
      date using an option-pricing model and is recognized over the service period,
      which is usually the vesting period. In March of 2005, the SEC issued Staff
      Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107, “Share-Based Payment.” This bulletin
      summarizes the SEC staff’s views regarding the valuation of share-based payment
      arrangements for public companies and the interaction between SFAS No. 123R
      and
      certain SEC rules and regulations. In April of 2005, the SEC issued an amendment
      to Rule 4-01(a) of Regulation S-X regarding the compliance date for SFAS No.
      123R. SFAS No. 123R is effective for the first interim or annual reporting
      period of the first fiscal year beginning on or after June 15, 2005. The
      adoption of SFAS No. 123R and SAB No. 107 are not expected to have a significant
      impact on our results of operations or equity.

Accounting
                Standards - (Continued)

In
      September of 2005, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
      Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position (“SOP”)
      05-01, “Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in
      Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts.” SOP 05-01
      provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred
      acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts
      other than those specifically described in SFAS No. 97, “Accounting and
      Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and
      for
      Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments.” SOP 05-01 defines an
      internal replacement as a modification in product benefits, features, rights,
      or
      coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract, or
      by
      amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature
      or coverage within a contract. SOP 05-01 is effective for internal replacements
      occurring in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently
      evaluating the impact that adopting SOP 05-01 will have on our operations and/or
      equity.

In
      November of 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 115-1 and
      FAS 124-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application
      to Certain Investments,” as applicable to debt and equity securities that are
      within the scope of SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
      and Equity Securities” and equity securities that are accounted for using the
      cost method specified in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, “The Equity
      Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” This FSP nullifies
      certain requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 03-1, “The
      Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain
      Investments,” guidance on determining whether an impairment is
      other-than-temporary. This FSP will replace guidance set forth in EITF No.
      03-1
      with references to existing other-than-temporary impairment guidance and will
      clarify that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than
      when
      the impairment is deemed other than temporary, even if a decision to sell has
      not been made. The FSP carries forward the requirements in EITF No. 03-1
      regarding required disclosures in the financial statements and requires
      additional disclosure related to factors considered in reaching the conclusion
      that the impairment is other-than-temporary. In addition, in periods subsequent
      to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment loss for debt
      securities, the discount or reduced premium would be amortized over the
      remaining life of the security based on future estimated cash flows. This new
      guidance for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary is effective
      for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. Adoption of this
      standard is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations
      and/or equity.

In
      January of 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid
      Financial Instruments.” SFAS No. 155 amends SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
      Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for
      Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.”
SFAS No. 155 also resolves issues addressed in SFAS No. 133 Implementation
      Issue
      No. D1, “Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized
      Financial Assets.” SFAS No. 155 eliminates the exemption from applying SFAS No.
      133 to interests in securitized financial assets so that similar instruments
      are
      accounted for in the same manner regardless of the form of the instruments.
      SFAS
      No. 155 allows a preparer to elect fair value measurement at acquisition, at
      issuance, or when a previously recognized financial instrument is subject to
      a
      remeasurement (new basis) event, on an instrument-by-instrument basis. SFAS
      No.
      155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the
      beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006.
      The fair value election provided for in paragraph 4(c) of SFAS No. 155 may
      also
      be applied upon adoption of SFAS No. 155 for hybrid financial instruments that
      had been bifurcated under paragraph 12 of SFAS No. 133 prior to the adoption
      of
      this Statement. Earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity’s
      fiscal year, provided the entity has not yet issued financial statements,
      including financial statements for any interim period for that fiscal year.
      Provisions of SFAS No. 155 may be applied to instruments that an entity holds
      at
      the date of adoption on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Adoption of this
      standard is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations
      and/or equity.

SUPPLEMENTAL
      FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The
      following supplemental condensed financial information reflects the financial
      position, results of operations and cash flows of Loews Corporation with our
      investments in CNA and Diamond Offshore accounted for on an equity basis rather
      than as consolidated subsidiaries. It does not purport to present

our
      financial position, results of

operations

and cash

flows
      in
      accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because it does not
      comply with SFAS No. 94, “Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries.” We
      believe, however, that this disaggregated financial data enhances an
      understanding of the consolidated financial statements by providing users with
      a
      format that our management uses in assessing our performance. See Notes 1 and
      of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item
      8.

Item
      7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
      Risk.

We
      are a
      large diversified financial services company. As such, we and our subsidiaries
      have significant amounts of financial instruments that involve market risk.
      Our
      measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair
      value of our financial instruments. Changes in the trading portfolio are
      recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Market risk exposure
      is
      presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at December 31,
      assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below.
      We
      believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure
      of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The
      estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future
      earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected
      actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations
      would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject
      to
      change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to
      changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the
      actual results which may occur.

Exposure
      to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management. Senior management
      approves our overall investment strategy and has responsibility to ensure that
      the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable
      level of risk. We may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering
      into offsetting positions.

Interest
      Rate Risk - We have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in
      the
      level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure
      to
      interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps,
      interest rate caps, commitments to purchase securities, options, futures and
      forwards. We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the
      change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations
      in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous
      change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to
      determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market
      value of our investments and the resulting effect on shareholders’ equity. The
      analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial
      instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe
      are
      reasonably possible over a one-year period.

The
      sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest
      sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2005 and 2004
      due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points,
      with all other variables held constant.

The
      interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in
      advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other
      types
      may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be
      indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise
      forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on our earnings
      or
      shareholders’ equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions
      we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates.

Our
      debt

is
      denominated in U.S. Dollars and has been primarily issued at fixed rates,
      therefore, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts.
      The
      impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would
      result in a decrease in market value of $528.5 million and $426.8 million at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease would
      result in an increase in market value of $328.4 million and $494.4 million
      at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Equity
      Price Risk - We have exposure to equity price risk as a result of our investment
      in equity securities and equity derivatives. Equity price risk results from
      changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value
      of
      equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities
      or
      indexes. Equity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous 25% decrease
      in the underlying reference price or index from its level at December 31, 2005
      and 2004, with all other variables held constant.

Foreign
      Exchange Rate Risk - Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility
      that
      changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial
      instruments. We have foreign exchange rate exposure when we buy or sell foreign
      currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency. This
      exposure is mitigated by our asset/liability matching strategy and through
      the
      use of futures for those instruments which are not matched. Our foreign
      transactions are primarily denominated in Canadian dollars, British pounds
      and
      the European


Item
                7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
                Risk

Monetary
      Unit. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20% decrease in the
      foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, with all other variables held constant.

Commodity
      Price Risk - We have exposure to commodity price risk as a result of our
      investments in gold options. Commodity price risk results from changes in the
      level or volatility of commodity prices that impact instruments which derive
      their value from such commodities. Commodity price risk was measured assuming
      an
      instantaneous decrease of 20% from their levels at December 31, 2005 and
      2004.

Credit
        Risk - We are exposed to credit risk which relates to the risk of loss resulting
        from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Boardwalk
        Pipeline has exposure related to receivables for services provided, as well
        as
        volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas lent by Boardwalk Pipeline
        to
        them generally under parking and lending services and no-notice services.
        Boardwalk Pipeline maintains credit policies intended to minimize this risk
        and
        actively monitors these policies. Average natural gas prices have increased
        dramatically in recent years. This rise in gas prices has materially increased
        Boardwalk Pipeline’s credit risk related to gas loaned to its customers. The
        amount of gas loaned out at any one time by Boardwalk Pipeline over the past
        months at any one time to its customers has ranged from a high of approximately
        38.0 Bcf at April 30, 2005 to a low of approximately 4.0 Bcf at December
        31,
        2005. Assuming an average market price during December of 2005 of $12.34
        per
        MMBtu, the fair value of gas loaned out at December 31, 2005 would have been
        approximately $49.4 million. As of February 28, 2006, the amount of gas loaned
        out was approximately 18.0 Bcf and, assuming an average market price during
        February of 2006 of $7.30 per MMBtu, the fair value of gas loaned out would
        be
        approximately $131.4 million. If any significant customer should have credit
        or
        financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to repay the gas it owes
        Boardwalk Pipeline, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial
        condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The
      following tables present our market risk by category (equity markets, interest
      rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) on the basis of
      those entered into for trading purposes and other than trading
      purposes.

Note:

The
                calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed
                adverse
                changes in the underlying reference price or index of (1) a decrease
                in
                equity prices of 25%, (2) a decrease in interest rates of 100 basis
                points
                and (3) a decrease in gold prices of 20%. Adverse changes on options
                which
                differ from those presented above would not necessarily result in
                a
                proportionate change to the estimated market risk
                exposure.

(a)

A
                decrease in equity prices of 25% would result in market risk amounting
                to
                $(255.0) and $(289.0) at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
                This
                market risk would be offset by decreases in liabilities to customers
                under
                variable insurance contracts.

The

                adverse
                changes in the underlying reference price or index of (1) a decrease
                in

                points.

(a)

Certain
                securities are denominated in foreign currencies. An assumed 20%
                decline
                in the underlying exchange rates would result in an aggregate foreign
                currency exchange rate risk of $(245.0), and $(254.0) at December
                31, 2005

Certain
                fixed maturities positions include options embedded in convertible
                debt

                in
                market risk amounting to $(54.0) and $(63.0) at December 31, 2005

Summary
                      of Significant Accounting
                      Policies

Basis
            of
            presentation

-

Loews
            Corporation is a holding company. Its subsidiaries are engaged in the
            following
            lines of business: commercial property and casualty insurance (CNA Financial
            Corporation (“CNA”), a 91% owned subsidiary); the production and sale of
            cigarettes (Lorillard, Inc. (“Lorillard”), a wholly owned subsidiary); the
            operation of interstate natural gas transmission pipeline systems (Boardwalk
            Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”), an 85% owned subsidiary) the
            operation of offshore oil and gas drilling rigs (Diamond Offshore Drilling,
            Inc.
            (“Diamond Offshore”), a 54% owned subsidiary); the operation of hotels (Loews
            Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels”), a wholly owned subsidiary); and the
            distribution and sale of watches and clocks (Bulova Corporation (“Bulova”), a
            wholly owned subsidiary). Unless the context otherwise requires, the
            terms
“Company,” “Loews” and “Registrant” as used herein mean Loews Corporation
            excluding its subsidiaries.

In
            December of 2004, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, Boardwalk
            Pipeline acquired Gulf South Pipeline, LP (“Gulf South”), from Entergy-Koch, LP,
            a venture between Entergy Corporation and Koch Energy, Inc., a subsidiary
            of
            privately-owned Koch Industries, Inc. The transaction value was approximately
            $1.14 billion. The results of Gulf South have been included in the Consolidated
            Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. The Company funded
            the $1.14
            billion purchase price, including transaction costs and closing adjustments,
            with $561.0 million of its available cash and $575.0 million of proceeds
            from an
            interim loan incurred by Boardwalk Pipeline (see Note 14).

In
            April
            of 2004, CNA sold its individual life insurance business to Swiss Re
            Life &
Health America Inc. (see Note 14).

Principles
            of consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include all
            significant
            subsidiaries and all material intercompany accounts and transactions
            have been
            eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in
            associated companies in which the Company generally has an interest of
            20% to
            50%.

Accounting
            estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
            accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
            (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
            amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related
            notes.
            Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Accounting
            changes

-

In
            July
            of 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee (“AcSEC”) of the American
            Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) issued Statement of Position
            (“SOP”) 03-01, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
            Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts.” SOP 03-01
            provides guidance on accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises
            for
            certain nontraditional long-duration contracts and for separate accounts.
            SOP
            03-01 was effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning
            after
            December 15, 2003. SOP 03-01 did not allow retroactive application to
            prior
            years’ financial statements. CNA adopted SOP 03-01 at January 1, 2004. The
            initial adoption of SOP 03-01 did not have a significant impact on the
            results
            of operations or equity of the Company, but did affect the classification
            and
            presentation of certain balance sheet and income statement items.

Under
            SOP
            03-01, the main criterion that needs to be satisfied for separate account
            presentation is that results of the investments made by the separate
            accounts
            must be directly passed through to the individual contract holders. Certain
            of
            CNA’s separate accounts have guaranteed returns not related to investment
            performance whereby the contract holders do not bear the losses or receive
            the
            gains from the investment performance; rather, amounts less than or in
            excess of
            the guaranteed amounts accrue to CNA. Upon adoption of SOP 03-01, these
            separate
            accounts did not meet the requirements of SOP 03-01 for separate account
            presentation. Therefore, the assets supporting these separate accounts
            are
            reflected within general account investments and the related liabilities
            within
            insurance reserves as of December 31, 2004. SOP 03-01 specifically precludes
            reclassifying balances for years prior to adoption.


Notes
                      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
                      1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

-

(Continued)

The
            adoption of SOP 03-01 did not result in a net impact to total assets,
            total
            liabilities or shareholder’s equity. From an income statement perspective, SOP
            03-01 did not impact net income; however, it required a reclassification
            within
            the income statement. Prior to the adoption of SOP 03-01, the net results
            of the
            separate accounts were primarily included in Other revenue. Upon adopting
            SOP
            03-01, premiums, benefits, net investment income and realized gains are
            included
            within their natural line items. Specifically related to the indexed
            group
            annuity contracts, the underlying portfolio consists of limited partnership
            investments and a trading portfolio which are classified as held for
            trading
            purposes and are carried at fair value, with both the net realized and
            unrealized gains (losses) included within net investment income in the
            Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In
            April
            of 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached consensus on the
            guidance provided in EITF Issue No. 03-6, “Participating Securities and the
            Two-Class Method under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No.
            128 Earnings Per Share” (“EITF 03-6”). EITF 03-6 clarifies whether a security
            should be considered a “participating security” for purposes of computing
            earnings per share (“EPS”) and how earnings should be allocated to a
“participating security” when using the two-class method for computing basic
            EPS. The adoption of EITF 03-6 did not have a significant impact on the
            Company.

In
            May of
            2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff
            Position (“FSP”) 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
            Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.” The FSP
            provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription
            Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 for employers that provide
            prescription drug benefits. FSP 106-2 supersedes FSP 106-1 “Accounting and
            Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
            and Modernization Act of 2003.” Adoption of this position has not had a material
            impact on the Company’s results of operations or equity.

In
            December of 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Non-Monetary
            Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” SFAS No. 153 amends the definition
            of “exchange” or “exchange transaction” and expands the list of transactions
            that would not meet the definition of non-monetary transfer. SFAS No.
            153 did
            not have a significant impact on the results of operations or equity
            of the
            Company.

Investments
            - Investments in securities, which are held principally by insurance
            subsidiaries of CNA, are carried as follows:

The
            Company classifies its fixed maturity securities (bonds and redeemable
            preferred
            stocks) and its equity securities held principally by insurance subsidiaries
            as
            either available-for-sale or trading, and as such, they are carried at
            fair
            value.

Changes
            in fair value of trading securities are reported within net investment
            income.
            The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale
            is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to
            maturity,
            which are included in net investment income. Changes in fair value related
            to
            available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of Other comprehensive
            income in Shareholders’ equity. Investments are written down to fair value and
            losses are recognized in statement of operations when a decline in value
            is
            determined to be other-than-temporary. See Note 2 for information related
            to the
            Company’s impairment charges.

For
            asset-backed securities included in fixed maturity securities, the Company
            recognizes income using a constant effective yield based on anticipated
            prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates
            of
            prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual
            payments to date and anticipated future payments. The net investment
            in the
            securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the
            new
            effective yield been applied since the acquisition of the securities.
            Such
            adjustments are reflected in net investment income.

Mortgage
            loans are carried at unpaid principal balances, including unamortized
            premium or
            discount. Real estate is carried at depreciated cost and policy loans
            are
            carried at unpaid balances. These items are included in “Other investments” in
            the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Short-term
            investments consist primarily of U.S. government securities, money market
            funds
            and commercial paper. These investments are generally carried at fair
            value,
            which approximates amortized cost.

(Continued)

All
            securities transactions are recorded on the trade date. The cost of securities
            sold is generally determined by the identified certificate method.

The
            Company’s limited partnership investments are recorded at fair value typically
            reflecting a reporting lag of up to three months, with changes in fair
            value
            reported in net investment income. Fair value of the Company’s limited
            partnership investments represents the Company’s equity in the partnership’s net
            assets as determined by the general partner. The carrying value of the
            Company’s
            limited partnership investments was $1,769.0 million and $1,783.4 million
            as of
            December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The majority of the limited
            partnerships invest in a substantial number of securities that are readily
            marketable. The Company is primarily a passive investor in such partnerships
            and
            does not have influence over the partnerships’ management, who are committed to
            operate them according to established guidelines and strategies. These
            strategies may include the use of leverage and hedging techniques that
            potentially introduce more volatility and risk to the partnerships. In
            accordance with FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 46R, “Consolidation of Variable
            Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,” during 2004, the Company
            consolidated two limited partnerships which were previously accounted
            for using
            the equity method.

Other
              invested assets include certain derivative securities. Investments
              in derivative
              securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported
              as a
              component of investment gains or losses or other comprehensive income,
              depending
              on their hedge designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative
              securities
              which are not designated as hedges, are reported as a component of
              investment
              gains or losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. A derivative
              is
              typically defined as an instrument whose value is “derived” from an underlying
              instrument, index or rate, has a notional amount, requires little or
              no initial
              investment, and can be net settled. Derivatives include, but are not
              limited to,
              the following types of investments: interest rate swaps, interest rate
              caps and
              floors, put and call options, warrants, futures, forwards, commitments
              to
              purchase securities, and combinations of the foregoing. Derivatives
              embedded
              within non-derivative instruments (such as call options embedded in
              convertible
              bonds) must be split from the host instrument when the embedded derivative
              is
              not clearly and closely related to the host instrument.

Collateralized
              debt obligations (“CDOs”) represent a credit enhancement product that is
              typically structured in the form of a swap. CNA has determined that
              this product
              is a derivative under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
              Hedging Activities.” Changes in the estimated fair value of CDOs, like other
              derivative financial instruments with no hedge designation, are recorded
              in
              investment gains or losses as appropriate. CNA has no CDOs in force
              as of
              December 31, 2005 and there was no related gain or loss in 2005. The
              net impact
              from CDOs was a realized gain of $5.0 million for the year ended December
              31,
              2004. The net impact of CDOs was a realized loss of $1.0 million for
              the year
              ended December 31, 2003. CNA no longer issues this product.

The
            Company’s derivatives are reported as other invested assets or other
            liabilities. Embedded derivative instruments subject to bifurcation are
            reported
            together with the host contract, at fair value. If certain criteria are
            met, a
            derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of exposures to
            changes in
            fair value, cash flows or foreign currency exchange rates. The accounting
            for
            changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use
            of the
            derivative, the nature of any hedge designation thereon and whether the
            derivative was transacted in a designated trading portfolio.

The
            Company’s accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments
            is
            as follows:

Nature
                      of Hedge Designation

Derivative’s
                      Change in Fair Value Reflected in

No
                      hedge designation

Investment
                      gains (losses).

Fair
                      value

Investment
                      gains (losses), along with the change in fair value of the
                      hedged asset or
                      liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.

Cash
                      flow

Other
                      comprehensive income (loss), with subsequent reclassification
                      to earnings
                      when the hedged transaction, asset or liability impacts
                      earnings.

Foreign
                      currency

Consistent
                      with fair value or cash flow above, depending on the nature
                      of the hedging
                      relationship.

(Continued)

The
            Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments
            and
            hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for
            undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses
            (both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives
            that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting
            changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those
            derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods.
            When
            it is determined that a derivative for which hedge accounting has been
            designated is not (or ceases to be) highly effective, the Company discontinues
            hedge accounting prospectively.

Separate
            account investments held in designated trading portfolios are carried
            at fair
            value with changes therein reflected in investment income. Hedge accounting
            on
            derivatives in these separate accounts is generally not applicable.

Securities
            lending and repurchase activities - The Company lends securities to unrelated
            parties, primarily major brokerage firms. Borrowers of these securities
            must
            deposit collateral with the Company of at least 102% of the fair value
            of the
            securities loaned, if the collateral is cash or securities. The Company
            maintains effective control over all loaned securities and, therefore,
            continues
            to report such securities as fixed maturity securities in the Consolidated
            Balance Sheets.

Cash
            collateral received on these transactions is invested in short-term investments
            with an offsetting liability recognized for the obligation to return
            the
            collateral. Non-cash collateral, such as securities or letters of credit,
            received by the Company are not reflected as assets of the Company as
            there
            exists no right to sell or re-pledge the collateral. The fair value of
            collateral held and included in short-term investments was $767.4 million
            and
            $918.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The fair value of non-cash
            collateral was $138.0 million and $3,783.0 million at December 31, 2005
            and
            2004.

Revenue
            Recognition

Insurance
            premiums on property and casualty and accident and health insurance contracts
            are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured which principally
            are earned ratably over the duration of the policies after deductions
            for ceded
            insurance premiums. The reserve for unearned premiums on these contracts
            represents the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired
            terms of
            coverage.

An
            estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of
            periodic
            evaluations of balances due currently or in the future from insureds,
            including
            amounts due from insureds related to losses under high deductible policies,
            management’s experience and current economic conditions.

Property
            and casualty contracts that are retrospectively rated contain provisions
            that
            result in an adjustment to the initial policy premium depending on the
            contract
            provisions and loss experience of the insured during the experience period.
            For
            such contracts, CNA estimates the amount of ultimate premiums that CNA
            may earn
            upon completion of the experience period and recognizes either an asset
            or a
            liability for the difference between the initial policy premium and the
            estimated ultimate premium. CNA adjusts such estimated ultimate premium
            amounts
            during the course of the experience period based on actual results to
            date. The
            resulting adjustment is recorded as either a reduction of or an increase
            to the
            earned premiums for the period.

Revenues
            on interest-sensitive life insurance contracts are composed of contract
            charges
            and fees, which are recognized over the coverage period. Premiums for
            other life
            insurance products and annuities are recognized as revenue when due after
            deductions for ceded insurance premiums.

Revenue
            from cigarette sales is recognized upon shipment of goods, when title
            and risk
            of loss passes to customers.

Revenue
            from dayrate drilling contracts is recognized as services are performed.
            In
            connection with such drilling contracts, Diamond Offshore may receive
            lump-sum
            fees for the mobilization of equipment. These fees are earned as services
            are
            performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. Absent
            a
            contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently.

Revenues
            from the transportation of gas are recognized in the period the service
            is
            provided based on contractual terms and the related transported volumes.
            Revenues from storage services are recognized over the term of the contract.
            Texas Gas is subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”)
            regulations and, accordingly, certain revenues collected may be subject
            to
            possible refunds upon final orders in pending cases. Texas Gas estimates
            rate
            refund liabilities considering its own and third-party regulatory proceedings,
            advice of counsel and estimated total exposure, as discounted and risk
            weighted,
            as well as collection and other risks. As of December 31, 2005, an estimated
            refund liability was recorded. Texas Gas anticipates that the general
            rate case
            will be settled and all required refunds will be paid during 2006.

Insurance
            Operations

Claim
            and
            claim adjustment expense reserves - Claim and claim adjustment expense
            reserves,
            except reserves for structured settlements not associated with asbestos
            and
            environmental pollution and mass tort (“APMT”), workers compensation lifetime
            claims, accident and health claims and certain claims associated with
            discontinued operations, are not discounted and are based on (1) case
            basis
            estimates for losses reported on direct business, adjusted in the aggregate
            for
            ultimate loss expectations; (2) estimates of incurred but not reported
            losses;
            (3) estimates of losses on assumed reinsurance; (4) estimates of future
            expenses
            to be incurred in the settlement of claims; (5) estimates of salvage
            and
            subrogation recoveries and (6) estimates of amounts due from insureds
            related to
            losses under high deductible policies. CNA management considers current
            conditions and trends as well as past CNA and industry experience in
            establishing these estimates. The effects of inflation, which can be
            significant, are implicitly considered in the reserving process and are
            part of
            the recorded reserve balance. Ceded claim and claim adjustment expense
            reserves
            are reported as a component of reinsurance receivables in the Consolidated
            Balance Sheets. See Note 25 for further information on claim and claim
            adjustment expense reserves for discontinued operations.

Structured
            settlements have been negotiated for certain property and casualty insurance
            claims. Structured settlements are agreements to provide fixed periodic
            payments
            to claimants. Certain structured settlements are funded by annuities
            purchased
            from Continental Assurance Company (“CAC”) for which the related annuity
            obligations are reported in future policy benefits reserves. Obligations
            for
            structured settlements not funded by annuities are included in claim
            and claim
            adjustment expense reserves and carried at present values determined
            using
            interest rates ranging from 4.6% to 7.5% at December 31, 2005 and 2004.
            At
            December 31, 2005 and 2004, the discounted reserves for unfunded structured
            settlements were $843.0 million and $872.0 million, net of discount of
            $1,309.0
            million and $1,367.0 million.

Workers
            compensation lifetime claim reserves and accident and health claim reserves
            are
            calculated using mortality and morbidity assumptions based on CNA and
            industry
            experience, and are discounted at interest rates that range from 3.5%
            to 6.5% at
            December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, such discounted
            reserves totaled $1,238.0 million and $1,893.0 million, net of discount
            of
            $430.0 million and $460.0 million.

Future
            policy benefits reserves - Reserves for long term care products are computed
            using the net level premium method, which incorporates actuarial assumptions
            as
            to interest rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency, withdrawals and
            expenses.
            Actuarial assumptions generally vary by plan, age at issue and policy
            duration,
            and include a margin for adverse deviation. Interest rates range from
            6.0% to
            8.6% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and mortality, morbidity and withdrawal
            assumptions are based on CNA and industry experience prevailing at the
            time of
            issue. Expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation
            and
            expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period. The net reserves
            for
            traditional life insurance products (whole and term life products) including
            interest-sensitive contracts were ceded on a 100% indemnity reinsurance
            basis to
            Swiss Re in connection with the sale of the individual life insurance
            business.
            See Note 14 for further information.

Policyholders’
            funds reserves - Policyholders’ funds reserves include reserves for universal
            life insurance contracts and investment contracts without life contingencies.
            The liability for policy benefits for universal life-type contracts is
            equal to
            the balance that accrues to the benefit of policyholders, including credited
            interest, amounts that have been assessed to compensate CNA for services
            to be
            performed over future periods, and any amounts previously assessed against
            policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract. For
            investment
            contracts, policyholder liabilities are equal to the accumulated policy
            account
            values, which consist of an accumulation of deposit payments plus credited
            interest, less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the end of the
            period.

Guaranty
            fund and other insurance-related assessments - Liabilities for guaranty
            fund and
            other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is
            probable,
            when it can be reasonably estimated, and when the event obligating the
            entity to
            pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for guaranty
            funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and
            are
            included as part of Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
            As of
            December 31, 2005 and 2004, the liability balance was $67.0 million.
            As of
            December 31, 2005 and 2004, included in Other assets were $10.0 million
            and $9.0
            million of related assets for premium tax offsets. The related asset
            is limited
            to the amount that is able to be assessed on future premium collections
            or
            policy surcharges from business written or committed to be written.

Reinsurance
            - Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent
            with
            claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits
            reserves
            and are reported as receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
            cost of
            reinsurance is primarily accounted for over the life of the underlying
            reinsured
            policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for
            the
            underlying policies. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary
            liability of CNA. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded
            on
            the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer
            solvency, management’s experience and current economic conditions.

Reinsurance
            contracts that do not effectively transfer the underlying economic risk
            of loss
            on policies written by CNA are recorded using the deposit method of accounting,
            which requires that premium paid or received by the ceding company or
            assuming
            company be accounted for as a deposit asset or liability. CNA primarily
            records
            these deposits as either reinsurance receivables or other assets for
            ceded
            recoverables and reinsurance balances payable or other liabilities for
            assumed
            liabilities. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, CNA had approximately $20.0
            million
            and $117.0 million recorded as deposit assets and $57.0 million and $156.0
            million recorded as deposit liabilities.

Income
            on
            reinsurance contracts accounted for under the deposit method is recognized
            using
            an effective yield based on the anticipated timing of payments and the
            remaining
            life of the contract. When the estimate of timing of payments changes,
            the
            effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and
            the
            estimated timing of future payments. The deposit asset or liability is
            adjusted
            to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been
            applied
            since the inception of the contract. This adjustment is reflected in
            other
            revenue or other operating expense as appropriate.

Participating
            insurance - Policyholder dividends are accrued using an estimate of the
            amount
            to be paid based on underlying contractual obligations under policies
            and
            applicable state laws. When limitations exist on the amount of net income
            from
            participating life insurance contracts that may be distributed to policyholders,
            the policyholders’ share of net income on those contracts that cannot be
            distributed is excluded from stockholders’ equity by a charge to operations and
            the establishment of a corresponding liability.

Deferred
            acquisition costs - Costs, including commissions, premium taxes and certain
            underwriting and policy issuance costs which vary with and are related
            primarily
            to the acquisition of property and casualty insurance business, are deferred
            and
            amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Anticipated
            investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability
            of
            deferred acquisition costs.

The
            excess of first-year commissions over renewal commissions and other first-year
            costs of acquiring life insurance business, such as agency and policy
            issuance
            expenses, which vary with and are related primarily to the production
            of new and
            renewal business, have been deferred and are amortized with interest
            over the
            expected life of the related contracts. The excess of first-year ceded
            expense
            allowances over renewal ceded expense allowances reduces applicable unamortized
            deferred acquisition costs.

Deferred
            acquisition costs related to non-participating traditional life insurance
            and
            accident and health insurance are amortized over the premium-paying period
            of
            the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used for
            computing
            future policy benefits reserves for such contracts. Assumptions as to
            anticipated premiums are made at the date of policy issuance or acquisition
            and
            are consistently applied during the lives of the contracts. Deviations
            from
            estimated experience are included in results of operations when they
            occur. For
            these contracts, the amortization period is typically the estimated life
            of the
            policy.

(Continued)

For
            universal life and cash value annuity contracts, the amortization of
            deferred
            acquisition costs is recorded in proportion to the present value of estimated
            gross margins or profits. The gross margins or profits result from actual
            earned
            interest minus actual credited interest, actual costs of insurance (mortality
            charges) minus expected mortality, actual expense charges minus expected
            maintenance expenses and surrender charges. Amortization interest rates
            are
            based on rates in effect at the inception or acquisition of the contracts
            or the
            latest revised rate applied to the remaining benefit period, according
            to
            product line. Actual gross margins or profits can vary from CNA’s estimates
            resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization. When
            appropriate, CNA revises its assumptions of the estimated gross margins
            or
            profits of these contracts, and the cumulative amortization is re-estimated
            and
            adjusted through current results of operations. To the extent that unrealized
            gains or losses on available-for-sale securities would result in an adjustment
            of deferred acquisition costs had they actually been realized, an adjustment
            is
            recorded to deferred acquisition costs and to unrealized investment gains
            or
            losses within shareholders’ equity.

Deferred
            acquisition costs are recorded net of ceding commissions and other ceded
            acquisition costs. CNA evaluates deferred acquisition costs for recoverability.
            Adjustments, if necessary, are recorded in current results of
            operations.

Investments
            in life settlement contracts and related revenue recognition - CNA has
            purchased
            investments in life settlement contracts. Under a life settlement contract,
            CNA
            obtains the rights of being the owner and beneficiary to an underlying
            life
            insurance policy. The carrying value of each contract at purchase and
            at the end
            of each reporting period is equal to the cash surrender value of the
            policy in
            accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin 85-4, “Accounting for Purchases of Life
            Insurance.” Amounts paid to purchase these contracts that are in excess of the
            cash surrender value, at the date of purchase, were expensed immediately.
            Periodic maintenance costs, such as premiums, necessary to keep the underlying
            policy inforce are expensed as incurred and are included in other operating
            expenses. Revenue is recognized and included in other revenue in the
            Consolidated Statements of Operations when the life insurance policy
            underlying
            the life settlement contract matures.

Separate
            Account Business - Separate account assets and liabilities represent
            contract
            holder funds related to investment and annuity products, which are segregated
            into accounts with specific underlying investment objectives. In 2003,
            separate
            account balances included funds with balances accruing directly to the
            contract
            holders and also funds with performance measures guaranteed by CNA. Net
            income
            accruing to CNA related to the separate accounts, consisting of fee revenue
            and
            investment results in excess of guaranteed returns, were primarily included
            within other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

CNA
            continues to have variable annuity contracts issued by CAC that meet
            the
            criteria for separate account presentation. The assets and liabilities
            of these
            contracts are legally segregated and reported as assets and liabilities
            of the
            separate account business. Substantially all assets of the separate account
            business are carried at fair value. Separate account liabilities are
            carried at
            contract values.

Tobacco
            product inventories - These inventories, aggregating $181.6 million and
            $203.2
            million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are stated at the
            lower of
            cost or market, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and primarily
            consist
            of leaf tobacco. If the average cost method of accounting had been used
            for
            tobacco inventories instead of the LIFO method, such inventories would
            have been
            $161.4 million and $174.3 million higher at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
            respectively.

Watch
            and
            clock inventories - These inventories, aggregating $68.3 million and
            $66.4
            million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are stated at the
            lower of
            cost or market, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

Goodwill
            and other intangible assets - Goodwill and other intangible assets with
            indefinite lives are annually tested for impairment. Goodwill represents
            the
            excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets of acquired entities.
            Impairment losses, if any, are included in the Consolidated Statements
            of
            Operations.

Property,
            plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost
            less
            accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed principally by the
            straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes
            of
            properties. Leaseholds and leasehold improvements are depreciated or
            amortized
            over the terms of the related leases (including optional renewal periods
            where
            appropriate) or the estimated lives of improvements, if less than the
            lease
            term.

Impairment
            of long-lived assets - The Company reviews its long-lived assets for
            impairment
            when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
            asset may
            not be recoverable. Long-lived assets and intangibles with finite lives,
            under
            certain circumstances, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or
            fair
            value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any
            future
            service potential to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying
            amount or
            fair value less cost to sell.

Stock
            option plans - The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles
            Board
            Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related
            interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options and awards.
            Under
            APB No. 25, no compensation expense is recognized when the exercise prices
            of
            options equal the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of
            grant.

Statement
            of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
            Compensation,” requires the Company to disclose pro forma information regarding
            option grants made to its employees. SFAS No. 123 specifies certain valuation
            techniques that produce estimated compensation charges for purposes of
            valuing
            stock option grants. These amounts have not been included in the Company’s
            Consolidated Statements of Operations, in accordance with APB No. 25.
            Several of
            the Company’s subsidiaries also maintain their own stock option plans. The pro
            forma effect of applying SFAS No. 123 includes the Company’s share of expense
            related to its subsidiaries’ plans as well. The Company’s pro forma net income

Regulatory
            accounting - The FERC regulates the operations of Texas Gas. SFAS No.
            71,
“Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation,” requires Texas Gas
            to report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect
            of the
            manner in which independent third-party regulators establish rates. Accordingly,
            certain costs and benefits are capitalized as regulatory assets and liabilities
            in order to provide for recovery from or refund to customers in future
            periods.

Supplementary
            cash flow information - Cash payments made for interest on long-term
            debt,
            including capitalized interest and commitment fees, amounted to approximately
            $405.2 million, $295.7 million and $289.9 million for the years ended
            December
            31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash payments (refunds) for federal,
            foreign, state and local income taxes amounted to approximately $504.2
            million,
            $(73.7) million and $(113.3) million for the years ended December 31,
            2005, 2004
            and 2003, respectively.

Accounting
            pronouncements - In December of 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
            Board
            (“FASB”) issued a complete replacement of SFAS No. 123, “Share-Based Payment”
(“SFAS No. 123R”), which covers a wide range of share-based compensation
            arrangements, including share options, restricted share plans, performance-based
            awards, share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans.
            SFAS No.
            123R requires companies to use the fair value method in accounting for
            employee
            stock options which results in compensation expense recorded in the income
            statement. Compensation expense is measured at the grant date using an
            option-pricing model and is recognized over the service period, which
            is usually
            the vesting period. In March of 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission
            (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107, “Share-Based Payment.”
This bulletin summarizes the SEC staff’s views regarding the valuation of
            share-based payment arrangements for public companies and the interaction
            between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations. In April
            of 2005,
            the SEC issued an amendment to Rule 4-01(a) of Regulation S-X regarding
            the
            compliance date for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R is effective for the
            Company in
            the first quarter of 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R and SAB No.
            107 are not
            expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations or
            equity.

In
            March
            of 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
            Obligations,” which clarifies when an entity is required to recognize a
            liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation
            and
            was effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption
            of
            FIN 47 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations
            or equity.

(Continued)

In
            May of
            2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a
            replacement of APB No. 20 and SFAS No. 3.” SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on the
            accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections
            and is
            effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal
            years
            beginning after December 15, 2005. SFAS No. 154 is not expected to have
            a
            significant impact on the Company’s results of operations or
            equity.

On
            June
            29, 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached a consensus on EITF
            Issue No. 04-5, “Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners
            as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the
            Limited
            Partners Have Certain Rights.” EITF No. 04-5 is effective no later than the
            beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after
            December
            15, 2005. EITF No. 04-5 is not expected to have a significant impact
            on the
            results of operations or equity of the Company.

In
            November of 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 115-1 and
            FAS 124-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application
            to Certain Investments,” as applicable to debt and equity securities that are
            within the scope of SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
            and Equity Securities” and equity securities that are accounted for using the
            cost method specified in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18,
“The Equity
            Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” This FSP nullifies
            certain requirements of EITF Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of
            Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments,”
guidance on determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary.
            This FSP
            will replace guidance set forth in EITF No. 03-1 with references to existing
            other-than-temporary impairment guidance and will clarify that an investor
            should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment
            is deemed
            other than temporary, even if a decision to sell has not been made. The
            FSP
            carries forward the requirements in EITF No. 03-1 regarding required
            disclosures
            in the financial statements and requires additional disclosure related
            to
            factors considered in reaching the conclusion that the impairment is
            other-than-temporary. In addition, in periods subsequent to the recognition
            of
            an other-than-temporary impairment loss for debt securities, the discount
            or
            reduced premium would be amortized over the remaining life of the security
            based
            on future estimated cash flows. This new guidance for determining whether
            impairment is other-than-temporary is effective for reporting periods
            beginning
            after December 15, 2005. Adoption of this standard is not expected to
            have a
            material impact on the Company’s results of operations or equity.

In
            January of 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid
            Financial Instruments.” SFAS No. 155 amends SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
            Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and SFAS No. 140, “Accounting
            for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
            Liabilities.” SFAS No. 155 also resolves issues addressed in SFAS No. 133
            Implementation Issue No. D1, “Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial
            Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.” SFAS No. 155 eliminates the
            exemption from applying SFAS No.133 to interests in securitized financial
            assets
            so that similar instruments are accounted for similarly regardless of
            the form
            of the instruments. SFAS No.155 allows a preparer to elect fair value
            measurement at acquisition, at issuance, or when a previously recognized
            financial instrument is subject to a remeasurement (new basis) event,
            on an
            instrument-by-instrument basis, in cases in which a derivative would
            otherwise
            have to be bifurcated. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments
            acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that
            begins after September 15, 2006. The fair value election provided for
            in
            paragraph 4(c) of SFAS No. 155 may also be applied upon adoption of SFAS
            No. 155
            for hybrid financial instruments that had been bifurcated under paragraph
            12 of
            SFAS No. 133 prior to the adoption of this Statement. Earlier adoption
            is
            permitted as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year, provided the entity
            has not yet issued financial statements, including financial statements
            for any
            interim period for that fiscal year. Provisions of SFAS No. 155 may be
            applied
            to instruments that an entity holds at the date of adoption on an
            instrument-by-instrument basis. Adoption of this standard is not expected
            to
            have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and/or
            equity.

Reclassifications
            - Certain amounts applicable to prior periods have been reclassified
            to conform
            to the classifications followed in 2005, including an adjustment to other
            revenues and expenses. These amounts were previously netted within other
            revenue.

                      related
                      to CNA’s sale of its individual life insurance business for the year
                      ended
                      December 31, 2004 and a pretax loss of $172.9 ($116.4 after
                      tax and
                      minority interest) related to the sale of CNA’s Group Benefits business
                      for the year ended December 31, 2003. See Note
                      14.

Investment
            gains of $491.9 million, $987.8 million and $1,478.6 million and losses
            of
            $550.4 million, $553.4 million and $932.8 million were realized on securities
            available-for-sale for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
            respectively. Investment gains (losses) also include $37.2 million and
            $32.2
            million of net unrealized gains in 2005 and 2004 in the Company’s trading
            portfolios.

Investment
            securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market
            and
            credit. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities
            and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of investment
            securities, it is possible that changes in these risk factors in the
            near term
            could have an adverse material impact on the Company’s results of operations or
            equity.

The
            Company’s investment policies emphasize high credit quality and diversification
            by industry, issuer and issue. Assets supporting interest rate sensitive
            liabilities are segmented within the general account to facilitate
            asset/liability duration management.

A
            significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination
            of
            when an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. CNA follows a
            consistent and systematic process for impairing securities that sustain
            other-than-temporary declines in value. CNA has established a committee
            responsible for the impairment process. This committee, referred to as
            the
            Impairment Committee, is made up of three officers appointed by CNA’s Chief
            Financial Officer. The Impairment Committee is responsible for analyzing
            watch
            list securities on at least a quarterly basis. The watch list includes
            individual securities that fall below certain thresholds or that exhibit
            evidence of impairment indicators including, but not limited to, a significant
            adverse change in the financial condition and near

term
            prospects of the investment or a significant adverse change in legal
            factors,
            the business climate or credit ratings.

When
            a
            security is placed on the watch list, it is monitored for further market
            value
            changes and additional news related to the issuer’s financial condition. The
            focus is on objective evidence that may influence the evaluation of impairment
            factors.

The
            decision to impair a security incorporates both quantitative criteria
            and
            qualitative information. The Impairment Committee considers a number
            of factors
            including, but not limited to: (a) the length of time and the extent
            to which
            the fair value has been less than book value, (b) the financial condition
            and
            near term prospects of the issuer, (c) the intent and ability of the
            Company to
            retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
            anticipated recovery in value, (d) whether the debtor is current on interest
            and
            principal payments and (e) general market conditions and industry or
            sector
            specific factors.

The
            Impairment Committee’s decision to impair a security is primarily based on
            whether the security’s fair value is likely to remain below its book value in
            light of all of the factors considered. For securities that are impaired,
            the
            security is adjusted to fair value and the resulting losses are recognized
            in
            realized gains/losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Realized
            investment losses included $120.4 million, $117.5 million and $321.0
            million of
            pretax impairment losses for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
            and 2003.
            The 2005 impairment losses were recorded across various sectors. The
            2005 and
            2004 impairment losses recorded related to a $47.0 million and $80.5
            million
            pretax impairment loss related to loans made under a credit facility
            to a
            national contractor, that are classified as fixed maturity securities.
            See Note
            21 for additional information on loans to the national contractor. The
            impairment was primarily the result of the continued credit deterioration
            on
            specific issuers in the bond and equity markets and the effects on such
            markets
            due to the overall slowing of the economy.

Other
            investment gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
            and 2003
            include gains and losses related to sales of certain operations or affiliates.

At

            million, representing 76.6% of the total investment portfolio. The net
            unrealized position associated with the fixed maturity portfolio included
            $299.3
            million in gross unrealized losses consisting of municipal securities
            of 12.7%,
            corporate bonds of 21.0%, asset-backed securities of 56.8%, and all other
            fixed
            maturity securities which represented 9.5%. Within corporate bonds, the
            largest
            industry sectors were financial, communications and consumer cyclical,
            which as
            a percentage of total gross unrealized losses were approximately 32.0%,
            19.0%
            and 18.0%. Gross unrealized losses in any single issuer were less than
            0.1% of
            the carrying value of the total fixed maturity portfolio.

            following table summarizes for fixed maturity and equity securities in

As
            of
            December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had committed approximately $191.0
            million and $104.0 million to future capital calls from various third-party
            limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest
            in the
            related partnerships.

The
            Company invests in multiple bank loan participations as part of its overall
            investment strategy and has committed to additional future purchases
            and sales.
            The purchase and sale of these investments are recorded on the date that
            the
            legal agreements are finalized and cash settlement is made. As of December
            31,
            2005 and 2004, the Company had commitments to purchase $135.3 million
            and $65.9
            million and commitments to sell $26.3 million and $17.6 million of various
            bank
            loan participations. When loan participation purchases are settled and
            recorded
            they may contain both funded and unfunded amounts. An unfunded loan represents
            an obligation by the Company to provide additional amounts under the
            terms of
            the loan participation. The funded portions are reflected on the Consolidated
            Balance Sheets, while any unfunded amounts are not recorded until a draw
            is made
            under the loan facility. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004,
            the
            Company had obligations on unfunded bank loan participations in the amount
            of
            $21.0 million and $3.0 million.

-

(Continued)

In
            cases
            where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated
            using
            present value or other valuation techniques. These techniques are significantly
            affected by management’s assumptions, including discount rates and estimates of
            future cash flows. The estimates presented herein are not necessarily
            indicative
            of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange.
            The
            amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for fixed maturities
            securities, equity securities, derivative instruments, short-term investments
            and collateral on loaned securities and derivatives are at fair value.
            As such,
            these financial instruments are not shown in the table above. See Note
            4 for the
            fair value of derivative instruments. Since the disclosure excludes certain
            financial instruments and non-financial instruments such as real estate,
            life
            settlement contracts and insurance reserves, the aggregate fair value
            amounts
            cannot be summed to determine the underlying economic value of the
            Company.

The
            following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating
            its
            fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

Fixed
            maturity securities and equity securities were based on quoted market
            prices,
            where available. For securities not actively traded, fair values were
            estimated
            using values obtained from independent pricing services or quoted market
            prices
            of comparable instruments.

Other
            investments consist of mortgage loans and notes receivable, policy loans,
            investments in limited partnerships and various miscellaneous assets.
            Valuation
            techniques to determine fair value of limited partnership investments,
            other
            investments and other separate account assets consisted of discounting
            cash
            flows, obtaining quoted market prices of the investments and comparing
            the
            investments to similar instruments or to the comparable underlying assets
            of the
            investments.

Premium
            deposits and annuity contracts were valued based on cash surrender values
            and
            the outstanding fund balances.

The
            fair
            values of CDOs were determined largely based on management’s estimates using
            default probabilities of the debt securities underlying the contract,
            which were
            obtained from a rating agency, the term of each contract, and actual
            default
            losses recorded on the contracts.

The
            fair
            value of the liability for financial guarantee contracts was estimated
            using
            discounted cash flows utilizing interest rates currently being offered
            for
            similar contracts.

The
            fair
            value of guaranteed investment contracts of the separate accounts business
            was
            estimated using discounted cash flow calculations, based on interest
            rates
            currently being offered for similar contracts with similar maturities.
            The fair
            value of the liabilities for variable separate account business was based
            on the
            quoted market values of the underlying assets of each variable separate
            account.
            The fair value of other separate account business liabilities approximates
            carrying value because of their short-term nature.

Fair
            value of debt was based on quoted market prices when available. When
            quoted
            market prices were not available, the fair value for debt was based on
            quoted
            market prices of comparable instruments adjusted for differences between
            the
            quoted instruments and the instruments being valued or is estimated using
            discounted cash flow analyses, based on current incremental borrowing
            rates for
            similar types of borrowing arrangements.

            including: (i) asset and liability management activities, (ii) income
            enhancements for its portfolio management strategy, and (iii) benefit
            from
            anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. If such movements
            do not
            occur as anticipated, then significant losses may occur.

Monitoring
            procedures include senior management review of daily detailed reports
            of
            existing positions and valuation fluctuations to ensure that open positions
            are
            consistent with the Company’s portfolio strategy.

The
            Company does not believe that any of the derivative instruments utilized
            by it
            are unusually complex, nor do these instruments contain embedded leverage
            features which would expose the Company to a higher degree of
            risk.

(Continued)

CNA
            invests in derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business,
            primarily to reduce its exposure to market risk (principally interest
            rate risk,
            equity stock price risk and foreign currency risk) stemming from various
            assets
            and liabilities and credit risk (the ability of an obligor to make timely
            payment of principal and/or interest). CNA’s principal objective under such
            market risk strategies is to achieve the desired reduction in economic
            risk,
            even if the position will not receive hedge accounting treatment.

CNA’s
            use
            of derivatives is limited by statutes and regulations promulgated by
            the various
            regulatory bodies to which it is subject, and by its own derivative policy.
            The
            derivative policy limits authorization to initiate derivative transactions
            to
            certain personnel. The policy generally prohibits the use of non-hedging
            derivatives with a maturity greater than 18 months. Derivatives entered
            into for
            hedging, regardless of the choice to designate hedge accounting shall
            have a
            maturity that effectively correlates to the underlying hedged asset or
            liability. The policy prohibits the use of derivatives containing greater
            than
            one-to-one leverage with respect to changes in the underlying price,
            rate or
            index. The policy also prohibits the use of borrowed funds, including
            funds
            obtained through securities lending to engage in derivative
            transactions.

Credit
            exposure associated with non-performance by the counterparties to derivative
            instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized fair value of
            the asset
            related to the instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
            The
            Company mitigates the risk of non-performance by monitoring the creditworthiness
            of counterparties and diversifying derivatives to multiple counterparties.
            The
            Company requires that all over-the-counter derivative contracts be governed
            by
            an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement,
            and exchanges collateral under the terms of these arrangements with its
            derivative investment counterparties depending on the amount of the exposure
            and
            the credit rating of the counterparty.

The
            Company has exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising
            from
            changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. The Company attempts
            to
            mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk through active portfolio
            management,
            which includes rebalancing its existing portfolios of assets and liabilities,
            as
            well as changing the characteristics of investments to be purchased or
            sold in
            the future. In addition, various derivative financial instruments are
            used to
            modify the interest rate risk exposures of certain assets and liabilities.
            These
            strategies include the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps
            and
            floors, options, futures, forwards, and commitments to purchase securities.
            These instruments are generally used to lock interest rates or market
            values, to
            shorten or lengthen durations of fixed maturity securities or investment
            contracts, or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated
            with investments, variable rate debt and life insurance liabilities.
            The Company
            has used these types of instruments as hedges against specific assets
            or
            liabilities on an infrequent basis.

The
            Company is exposed to equity price risk as a result of its investment
            in equity
            securities and equity derivatives. Equity price risk results from changes
            in the
            level or volatility of equity prices, which affect the value of equity
            securities, or instruments that derive their value from such securities.
            The
            Company attempts to mitigate its exposure to such risks by limiting its
            investment in any one security or index. The Company may also manage
            this risk
            by utilizing instruments such as options, swaps, futures and collars
            to protect
            appreciation in securities held. CNA uses derivatives in one of its separate
            accounts to mitigate equity price risk associated with its indexed group
            annuity
            contracts by purchasing Standard & Poor’s 500 (“S&P 500”) index futures
            contracts in a notional amount equal to the contract holder liability,
            which is
            calculated using the S&P 500 rate of return.

The
            Company has exposure to credit risk arising from the uncertainty associated
            with
            a financial instrument obligor’s ability to make timely principal and/or
            interest payments. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by limiting
            credit
            concentrations, practicing diversification, and frequently monitoring
            the credit
            quality of issuers and counterparties. In addition, the Company may utilize
            credit derivatives such as credit default swaps to modify the credit
            risk
            inherent in certain investments. Credit default swaps involve a transfer
            of
            credit risk from one party to another in exchange for periodic payments.
            The
            Company infrequently designates these types of instruments as hedges
            against
            specific assets.

Foreign
            exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign
            currency
            exchange rates will impact the fair value of financial instruments denominated
            in a foreign currency. The Company’s foreign transactions are primarily
            denominated in Canadian dollars, British pounds and the European Monetary
            Unit.
            The Company

manages
            this risk via asset/liability matching and through the use of foreign
            currency
            futures and forwards. The Company has infrequently designated these types
            of
            instruments as hedges against specific assets or liabilities.

The
            contractual or notional amounts for derivatives are used to calculate
            the
            exchange of contractual payments under the agreements and are not representative
            of the potential for gain or loss on these instruments. Interest rates,
            equity
            prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices affect the
            fair
            value of derivatives. The fair values generally represent the estimated
            amounts
            that the Company would expect to receive or pay upon termination of the
            contracts at the reporting date. Dealer quotes are available for substantially
            all of the Company’s derivatives. For derivative instruments not actively
            traded, fair values are estimated using values obtained from independent
            pricing
            services, costs to settle or quoted market prices of comparable
            instruments.

The
            Company is required to provide collateral for all exchange-traded futures
            and
            options contracts. These margin requirements are determined by the individual
            exchanges based on the fair value of the open positions and are in the
            custody
            of the exchange. Collateral may also be required for over-the-counter
            contracts
            such as interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and currency forwards
            per the
            ISDA agreements in place. The Company has access to this collateral pledged
            subject to replacement and therefore it remains recorded as an asset
            on the
            Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of collateral provided was
            $83.0
            million and $89.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004 and consisted
            primarily
            of U.S. Treasury Bills.

Fair
            value hedges

-

The
            Company’s hedging activities primarily involve hedging risk exposures to
            interest rate and foreign currency risks. For the year ended December
            31, 2005,
            CNA recognized a net gain of $0.3 million, which represents the ineffective
            portion of all fair value hedges. There was no gain or loss on the ineffective
            portion of the fair value hedges for the years ended December 31, 2004 and
            2003, because CNA did not designate derivatives as fair value hedges in
            those years.

The
            Company also enters into short sales as part of its portfolio management
            strategy. Short sales are commitments to sell a financial instrument
            not owned
            at the time of sale, usually done in anticipation of a price decline.
            These
            sales resulted in proceeds of $153.0 million and $69.3 million with fair
            value
            liabilities of $165.9 million and $77.6 million at December 31, 2005
            and 2004,
            respectively. These positions are marked to market and investment gains
            or
            losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Earnings
                      Per Share

Companies
            with complex capital structures are required to present basic and diluted
            earnings per share. Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is
            computed
            by dividing net income (loss) attributable to each class of common stock
            by the
            weighted average number of common shares of each class of common stock
            outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential
            dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common
            stock
            were exercised or converted into common stock.

Certain
            options were not included in the diluted weighted shares amount due to
            the
            exercise price being greater than the average stock price for the respective
            periods. The number of shares not included in the diluted computations
            is as
            follows:

Loews
                      and Carolina Group Consolidating Condensed Financial
                      Information

In
            November of 2003, December of 2004, and November of 2005, the Company
            sold
            18.055 million, 10.0 million and 10.0 million shares, of Carolina Group
            stock
            for net proceeds of $399.5 million, $281.9 million and $415.1 million,
            respectively. This stock is designed to track the performance of the
            Carolina
            Group, which consists of: the Company’s ownership interest in Lorillard;
            notional, intergroup debt owed by the Carolina Group to the Loews Group
            ($1.6
            billion outstanding at December 31, 2005), bearing interest at the annual
            rate
            of 8.0% and, subject to optional prepayment, due December 31, 2021; any
            and all
            liabilities, costs and expenses of the Company and Lorillard arising
            out of the
            past, present or future business of Lorillard, and all net income or
            net losses
            from the assets and liabilities attributed to the Carolina Group. Each
            outstanding share of Carolina Group stock has 1/10 of a vote per
            share.

The
            issuance of Carolina Group stock has resulted in a two class common stock
            structure for the Company. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding Carolina
            Group stock represents a 45.03% economic interest in the economic performance
            of
            the Carolina Group. The Loews Group consists of all of the Company’s assets and
            liabilities other than the 45.03% economic interest represented by the
            outstanding Carolina Group stock, and includes as an asset the notional,
            intergroup debt of the Carolina Group. Holders of the Company’s common stock and
            of Carolina Group stock are shareholders of Loews Corporation and are
            subject to
            the risks related to an equity investment in Loews Corporation.

The
            Company has separated, for financial reporting purposes, the Carolina
            Group and
            Loews Group. The following schedules present the consolidating condensed
            financial information for these individual groups. Neither group is a
            separate
            company or legal entity. Rather, each group is intended to reflect a
            defined set
            of assets and liabilities.

In
            July
            of 2003, Loews Hotels sold a New York City property, the Metropolitan
            Hotel, for
            approximately $109.0 million. The Company recorded a pretax gain of
            approximately $90.2 million ($56.7 million after taxes).

Claim
                              and Claim Adjustment Expense
                              Reserves

CNA’s
            property and casualty insurance claim and claim adjustment expense reserves
            represent the estimated amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims,
            including claims that are incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) as of the reporting
            date. CNA’s reserve projections are based primarily on detailed analysis of the
            facts in each case, CNA’s experience with similar cases and various historical
            development patterns. Consideration is given to such historical patterns
            as
            field reserving trends and claims settlement practices, loss payments,
            pending
            levels of unpaid claims and product mix, as well as court decisions,
            economic
            conditions and public attitudes. All of these factors can affect the
            estimation
            of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Establishing
            claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, including claim and claim
            adjustment expense reserves for catastrophic events that have occurred,
            is an
            estimation process. Many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement
            of a
            claim and, therefore, the necessary reserve. Changes in the law, results
            of
            litigation, medical costs, the cost of repair materials and labor rates
            can all
            affect ultimate claim costs. In addition, time can be a critical part
            of
            reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence
            of a
            loss and the payment or settlement of the claim, the more variable the
            ultimate
            settlement amount can be. Accordingly, short-tail claims, such as property
            damage claims, tend to be more reasonably estimable than long-tail claims,
            such
            as general liability and professional liability claims. Adjustments to
            prior
            year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in the results of
            operations
            in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined.

Catastrophes
            are an inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance business
            and have
            contributed to material period-to-period fluctuations in the Company’s results
            of operations and/or equity. The level of catastrophe losses

experienced
            in any period cannot be predicted and can be material to the results
            of
            operations and/or equity of the Company. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance,
            were $493.0 million, $278.0 million and $143.0 million for the years
            ended
            December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The catastrophe losses in 2005 related
            primarily to Hurricanes Katrina, Dennis, Ophelia, Rita and Wilma. The
            2005 loss
            estimate was developed after consideration of reported claims, the insured
            values of properties in the affected areas, modeled losses, industry
            loss
            estimates and CNA’s reinsurance coverage. Because of the nature of the five
            hurricanes, the estimate involves significant judgment due in part to
            the legal
            and regulatory uncertainties, the complexity of factors contributing
            to the
            losses and the preliminary nature of the information available. Accordingly,
            there can be no assurance that CNA’s ultimate cost for these catastrophes will
            not exceed this estimate. The catastrophe losses in 2004 related primarily
            to
            Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. The catastrophe losses
            in 2003
            related primarily to Hurricane Claudette, Hurricane Isabel, Texas tornadoes
            and
            Midwest rain storms.

Commercial
            catastrophe losses, gross of reinsurance, were $976.0 million, $308.0
            million
            and $156.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
            2003.

Claim
            and
            claim adjustment expense reserves are presented net of amounts due from
            insureds
            related to losses under high deductible policies. CNA has an allowance
            for
            uncollectible deductible amounts, which is presented as a component of
            the
            allowance for doubtful accounts for insurance receivables.

                      significant commutations. See Note 18 for further discussion

The
            following provides discussion of CNA’s Asbestos, Environmental Pollution and
            Mass Tort (“APMT”) and core reserves.

APMT
            Reserves

CNA’s
            property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have actual and potential
            exposures
            related to APMT claims.

Establishing
            reserves for APMT claim and claim adjustment expenses is subject to
            uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.
            Traditional
            actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost
            of
            claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less
            precise in
            estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for APMT, particularly
            in
            an environment of emerging or potential claims and

coverage
            issues that arise from industry practices and legal, judicial, and social
            conditions. Therefore, these traditional actuarial methods and techniques
            are
            necessarily supplemented with additional estimating techniques and
            methodologies, many of which involve significant judgments that are required
            of
            management. Accordingly, a high degree of uncertainty remains for CNA’s ultimate
            liability for APMT claim and claim adjustment expenses.

In
            addition to the difficulties described above, estimating the ultimate
            cost of
            both reported and unreported APMT claims is subject to a higher degree
            of
            variability due to a number of additional factors, including among others:
            the
            number and outcome of direct actions against CNA; coverage issues, including
            whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy
            limits
            apply; allocation of liability among numerous parties, some of whom may
            be in
            bankruptcy proceedings, and in particular the application of “joint and several”
liability to specific insurers on a risk; inconsistent court decisions
            and
            developing legal theories; increasingly aggressive tactics of plaintiffs’
lawyers; the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation;
            increased filings of claims in certain states; enactment of national
            federal
            legislation to address asbestos claims; a further increase in asbestos
            and
            environmental pollution claims which cannot now be anticipated; liability
            against CNA’s policyholders in environmental matters; broadened scope of
            clean-up resulting in increased liability to its policyholders; increase
            in
            number of mass tort claims relating to silica and silica-containing products,
            and the outcome of ongoing disputes as to coverage in relation to these
            claims;
            a further increase of claims and claims payments that may exhaust underlying
            umbrella and excess coverage at accelerated rates; and future developments
            pertaining to CNA’s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos, pollution and
            mass tort claims.

CNA
            has
            regularly performed ground up reviews of all open APMT claims to evaluate
            the
            adequacy of CNA’s APMT reserves. In performing its comprehensive ground up
            analysis, CNA considers input from its professionals with direct responsibility
            for the claims, inside and outside counsel with responsibility for
            representation of CNA, and its actuarial staff. These professionals review,
            among many factors, the policyholder’s present and predicted future exposures,
            including such factors as claims volume, trial conditions, prior settlement
            history, settlement demands and defense costs; the impact of asbestos
            defendant
            bankruptcies on the policyholder; the policies issued by CNA, including
            such
            factors as aggregate or per occurrence limits, whether the policy is
            primary,
            umbrella or excess, and the existence of policyholder retentions and/or
            deductibles; the existence of other insurance; and reinsurance arrangements.

CNA’s
            property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposure to asbestos-related
            claims. Estimation of asbestos-related claim and claim adjustment expense
            reserves involves limitations such as inconsistency of court decisions,
            specific
            policy provisions, allocation of liability among insurers and insureds,
            and
            additional factors such as missing policies and proof of coverage. Furthermore,
            estimation of asbestos-related claims is difficult due to, among other
            reasons,
            the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties,
            the
            targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants,
            the
            uncertainty as to which other insureds may be targeted in the future
            and the
            uncertainties inherent in predicting the number of future claims.

As
            of
            December 31, 2005 and 2004, CNA carried approximately $1,554.0 million
            and
            $1,686.0 million of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net
            of
            reinsurance recoverables, for reported and unreported asbestos-related
            claims.
            CNA recorded $10.0 million, $54.0 million and $642.0 million of unfavorable
            asbestos-related net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development
            for
            the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The 2004

unfavorable
            net prior year development was primarily related to a loss from the commutation
            of reinsurance treaties with The Trenwick Group (“Trenwick”). CNA paid
            asbestos-related claims, net of reinsurance recoveries, of $142.0 million,
            $135.0 million and $121.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
            and 2003.

CNA
            recorded $1,826.0 million and $642.0 million in unfavorable gross and
            net prior
            year development for the year ended December 31, 2003 for reported and
            unreported asbestos-related claims, principally due to potential losses
            from
            policies issued by CNA with high attachment points, which previous exposure
            analysis indicated would not be reached. CNA examined the claims filing
            trends
            to determine timeframes within which high excess policies issued by CNA
            could be
            reached. Elevated claims volumes and increased claims values, together
            with
            certain adverse court decisions affecting the ability of policyholders
            to access
            excess policies, supported the conclusion that excess policies with high
            attachment points previously thought not to be exposed may now potentially
            be
            exposed. The ceded reinsurance arrangements on these excess policies
            are
            different from the primary policies. In general, more extensive reinsurance
            arrangements apply to the excess policies. As a result, the prior year
            development shows a higher ratio of ceded to gross amounts than the reserves
            established in prior periods, resulting in a higher percentage of reserves
            ceded
            as of December 31, 2003 versus prior periods.

Certain
            asbestos claim litigation in which CNA is currently engaged is described
            below:

The
            ultimate cost of reported claims, and in particular APMT claims, is subject
            to a
            great many uncertainties, including future developments of various kinds
            that
            CNA does not control and that are difficult or impossible to foresee
            accurately.
            With respect to the litigation identified below in particular, numerous
            factual
            and legal issues remain unresolved. Rulings on those issues by the courts
            are
            critical to the evaluation of the ultimate cost to CNA. The outcome of
            the
            litigation cannot be predicted with any reliability. Accordingly, the
            extent of
            losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued are not readily determinable
            at
            this time.

On
            February 13, 2003, CNA announced it had resolved asbestos related coverage
            litigation and claims involving A.P. Green Industries, A.P. Green Services
            and
            Bigelow - Liptak Corporation. Under the agreement, CNA is required to
            pay $74.0
            million, net of reinsurance recoveries, over a ten year period commencing
            after
            the final approval of a bankruptcy plan of reorganization. The settlement
            resolves CNA’s liabilities for all pending and future asbestos and silica claims
            involving A.P. Green Industries, Bigelow - Liptak Corporation and related
            subsidiaries, including alleged “non-products” exposures. The settlement
            received initial bankruptcy court approval on August 18, 2003 and in
            April 2006
            the court is scheduled to consider confirmation of a bankruptcy plan
            containing
            an injunction to protect CNA from any future claims.

CNA
            is
            engaged in insurance coverage litigation in New York State Court, filed
            in 2003,
            with a defendant class of underlying plaintiffs who have asbestos bodily
            injury
            claims against the former Robert A. Keasbey Company (“Keasbey”) (Continental
            Casualty Co. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau et al., No. 601037/03 (N.Y.
            County)).
            Keasbey, a currently dissolved corporation, was a seller and installer
            of
            asbestos-containing insulation products in New York and New Jersey. Thousands
            of
            plaintiffs have filed bodily injury claims against Keasbey; however,
            Keasbey’s
            involvement at a number of work sites is a highly contested issue. Therefore,
            the defense disputes the percentage of valid claims against Keasbey.
            CNA issued
            Keasbey primary policies for 1970-1987 and excess policies for 1972-1978.
            CNA
            has paid an amount substantially equal to the policies’ aggregate limits for
            products and completed operations claims in the confirmed CNA policies.
            Claimants against Keasbey allege, among other things, that CNA owes coverage
            under sections of the policies not subject to the aggregate limits, an
            allegation CNA vigorously contests in the lawsuit. In the litigation,
            CNA and
            the claimants seek declaratory relief as to the interpretation of various
            policy
            provisions. The court dismissed a claim alleging bad faith and seeking
            unspecified damages on March 21, 2004; that ruling was affirmed on March
            31,
            2005 by Appellate Division, First Department. The trial in the Keasbey
            coverage
            action commenced on July 13, 2005; closing arguments concluded on October
            28,
            2005. It is unclear when CNA will have a decision from the trial court.
            With
            respect to this litigation in particular, numerous factual and legal
            issues
            remain to be resolved that are critical to the final result, the outcome
            of
            which cannot be predicted with any reliability. These factors include,
            among
            others: (a) whether CNA has any further responsibility to compensate
            claimants
            against Keasbey under its policies and, if so, under which policies;
            (b) whether
            CNA responsibilities extend to a particular claimant’s entire claim or only to a
            limited percentage of the claim; (c) whether CNA’s responsibilities under its
            policies are limited by the occurrence limits or other provisions of
            the
            policies; (d) whether certain exclusions in some of the policies apply
            to
            exclude certain claims; (e) the extent to which claimants can establish
            exposures to asbestos materials as to which Keasbey has any responsibility;
            (f)
            the

legal
            theories which must be pursued by such claimants to establish the liability
            of
            Keasbey and whether such theories can, in fact, be established; (g) the
            diseases
            and damages alleged by such claimants; and (h) the extent that such liability
            would be shared with other responsible parties. Accordingly, the extent
            of
            losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued are not readily determinable
            at
            this time.

CNA
            has
            insurance coverage disputes related to asbestos bodily injury claims
            against
            Burns & Roe Enterprises, Inc. (“Burns & Roe”). Originally raised in
            litigation, now stayed, these disputes are currently part of In re: Burns
&
Roe Enterprises, Inc., pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District
            of
            New Jersey, No. 00-41610. Burns & Roe provided engineering and related
            services in connection with construction projects. At the time of its
            bankruptcy
            filing, on December 4, 2000, Burns & Roe faced approximately 11,000 claims
            alleging bodily injury resulting from exposure to asbestos as a result
            of
            construction projects in which Burns & Roe was involved. CNA allegedly
            provided primary liability coverage to Burns & Roe from 1956-1969 and
            1971-1974, along with certain project-specific policies from 1964-1970.
            The
            parties in the litigation are seeking a declaration of the scope and
            extent of
            coverage, if any, afforded to Burns & Roe for its asbestos liabilities. The
            litigation has been stayed since May 14, 2003 pending resolution of the
            bankruptcy proceedings. On December 5, 2005, Burns & Roe filed its Third
            Amended Plan of Reorganization (“Plan”). A confirmation hearing in the
            bankruptcy proceeding, previously scheduled for April 2006, has been
            suspended
            pending hearings related to the new Plan. With respect to the Burns & Roe
            litigation and the pending bankruptcy proceeding, numerous unresolved
            factual
            and legal issues will impact the ultimate exposure to CNA. With respect
            to this
            litigation, numerous factual and legal issues remain to be resolved that
            are
            critical to the final result, the outcome of which cannot be predicted
            with any
            reliability. These factors include, among others: (a) whether CNA has
            any
            further responsibility to compensate claimants against Burns & Roe under its
            policies and, if so, under which; (b) whether CNA’s responsibilities under its
            policies extend to a particular claimant’s entire claim or only to a limited
            percentage of the claim; (c) whether CNA’s responsibilities under its policies
            are limited by the occurrence limits or other provisions of the policies;
            (d)
            whether certain exclusions, including professional liability exclusions,
            in some
            of CNA’s policies apply to exclude certain claims; (e) the extent to which
            claimants can establish exposures to asbestos materials as to which Burns
&
Roe has any responsibility; (f) the legal theories which must be pursued
            by such
            claimants to establish the liability of Burns & Roe and whether such
            theories can, in fact, be established; (g) the diseases and damages alleged
            by
            such claimants; (h) the extent that any liability of Burns & Roe would be
            shared with other potentially responsible parties; and (i) the impact
            of
            bankruptcy proceedings on claims and coverage issue resolution. Accordingly,
            the
            extent of losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued are not readily
            determinable at this time.

CIC
            issued certain primary and excess policies to Bendix Corporation (“Bendix”), now
            part of Honeywell International, Inc. (“Honeywell”). Honeywell faces
            approximately 78,024 pending asbestos bodily injury claims resulting
            from
            alleged exposure to Bendix friction products. CIC’s primary policies allegedly
            covered the period from at least 1939 (when Bendix began to use asbestos
            in its
            friction products) to 1983, although the parties disagree about whether
            CIC’s
            policies provided product liability coverage before 1940 and from 1945
            to 1956.
            CIC asserts that it owes no further material obligations to Bendix under
            any
            primary policy. Honeywell alleges that two primary policies issued by
            CIC
            covering 1969-1975 contain occurrence limits but not product liability
            aggregate
            limits for asbestos bodily injury claims. CIC has asserted, among other
            things,
            even if Honeywell’s allegation is correct, which CNA denies, its liability is
            limited to a single occurrence limit per policy or per year, and in the
            alternative, a proper allocation of losses would substantially limit
            its
            exposure under the 1969-1975 policies to asbestos claims. These and other
            issues
            are being litigated in Continental Insurance Co., et al. v. Honeywell
            International Inc., No. MRS-L-1523-00 (Morris County, New Jersey) which
            was
            filed on May 15, 2000. In the litigation, the parties are seeking declaratory
            relief of the scope and extent of coverage, if any, afforded to Bendix
            under the
            policies issued by CNA. With respect to this litigation, numerous factual
            and
            legal issues remain to be resolved that are critical to the final result,
            the
            outcome of which cannot be predicted with any reliability. These factors
            include, among others: (a) whether certain of the primary policies issued
            by CNA
            contain aggregate limits of liability; (b) whether CNA’s responsibilities under
            its policies extend to a particular claimant’s entire claim or only to a limited
            percentage of the claim; (c) whether CNA’s responsibilities under its policies
            are limited by the occurrence limits or other provisions of the policies;
            (d)
            whether some of the claims against Bendix arise out of events which took
            place
            after expiration of CNA’s policies; (e) the extent to which claimants can
            establish exposures to asbestos materials as to which Bendix has any
            responsibility; (f) the legal theories which must be pursued by such
            claimants
            to establish the liability of Bendix and whether such theories can, in
            fact, be
            established; (g) the diseases and damages claimed by such claimants;
            and (h) the
            extent that any liability of Bendix would be shared with other responsible
            parties. Other issues to be resolved in the litigation include whether
            Bendix is
            responsible for reimbursement of funds advanced by

            for
            defense and indemnity in the past. The extent of losses beyond any amounts
            that
            may be accrued are not readily determinable at this time.

Suits
            have also been initiated directly against two CNA companies and other
            insurers
            in four jurisdictions: Ohio, Texas, West Virginia and Montana. In the
            approximately 83 Ohio actions, plaintiffs allege the defendants negligently
            performed duties undertaken to protect workers and the public from the
            effects
            of asbestos, spoliated evidence and conspired and acted in concert to
            harm the
            plaintiffs. (E.g. Varner v. Ford Motor Co., (Ohio Ct. Common Pl., filed
            June 12,
            2003); Peplowski v. ACE American Ins. Co., (N.D. Ohio, filed April 1,
            2004)) and
            Cross v. Garlock, Inc. (Ohio Ct. Common Pl., filed September 1, 2004)).
            The
            Cuyahoga County court granted insurers, including CNA, dismissals against
            an
            initial group of plaintiffs, ruling that insurers had no duty to warn
            plaintiffs
            about the dangers of asbestos and that there was no basis for spoliation,
            conspiracy and concert of action claims. That ruling was affirmed on
            appeal.
            Bugg v. Am. Std., Inc., No. 84829 (Ohio Ct. App. May 26, 2005). The Cuyahoga
            County court has continued to dismiss substantially similar types of
            complaints
            and plaintiffs have either failed to appeal the dismissals or have voluntarily
            dismissed their appeals. Nonetheless, plaintiffs continue to file additional
            similar suits. With respect to this litigation in particular, numerous
            factual
            and legal issues remain to be resolved that are critical to the final
            result,
            the outcome of which cannot be predicted with any reliability. These
            factors
            include: (a) the speculative nature and unclear scope of any alleged
            duties owed
            to individuals exposed to asbestos and the resulting uncertainty as to
            the
            potential pool of potential claimants; (b) the fact that imposing such
            duties on
            all insurer and non-insurer corporate defendants would be unprecedented
            and,
            therefore, the legal boundaries of recovery are difficult to estimate;
            (c) the
            fact that many of the claims brought to date may be barred by various
            Statutes
            of Limitation and it is unclear whether future claims would also be barred;
            (d)
            the unclear nature of the required nexus between the acts of the defendants
            and
            the right of any particular claimant to recovery; and (e) the existence
            of
            hundreds of co-defendants in some of the suits and the applicability
            of the
            legal theories pled by the claimants to thousands of potential defendants.
            Accordingly, the extent of losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued
            are not
            readily determinable at this time.

Similar
            lawsuits were filed in Texas beginning in 2002, against two CNA companies
            and
            numerous other insurers and non-insurer corporate defendants asserting
            liability
            for failing to warn of the dangers of asbestos (E.g. Boson v. Union Carbide
            Corp., (Nueces County, Texas)). During 2003, many of the Texas suits
            were
            dismissed as time-barred by the applicable Statute of Limitations. In
            other
            suits, the carriers argued that they did not owe any duty to the plaintiffs
            or
            the general public to advise the world generally or the plaintiffs particularly
            of the effects of asbestos and that Texas statutes precluded liability
            for such
            claims, and the Texas courts dismissed these suits. Certain of the Texas
            courts’
rulings were appealed, but plaintiffs later dismissed their appeals.
            Recently, a
            different Texas court denied similar motions seeking dismissal at the
            pleading
            stage, allowing limited discovery to proceed. After that court denied
            a related
            challenge to jurisdiction, the insurers transferred those cases to a
            state
            multi-district litigation court in Harris County charged with handling
            asbestos
            cases, and the cases remain in that court. With respect to this litigation
            in
            particular, numerous factual and legal issues remain to be resolved that
            are
            critical to the final result, the outcome of which cannot be predicted
            with any
            reliability. These factors include: (a) the speculative nature and unclear
            scope
            of any alleged duties owed to individuals exposed to asbestos and the
            resulting
            uncertainty as to the potential pool of potential claimants; (b) the
            fact that
            imposing such duties on all insurer and non-insurer corporate defendants
            would
            be unprecedented and, therefore, the legal boundaries of recovery are
            difficult
            to estimate; (c) the fact that many of the claims brought to date are
            barred by
            various Statutes of Limitation and it is unclear whether future claims
            would
            also be barred; (d) the unclear nature of the required nexus between
            the acts of
            the defendants and the right of any particular claimant to recovery;
            and (e) the
            existence of hundreds of co-defendants in some of the suits and the
            applicability of the legal theories pled by the claimants to thousands
            of
            potential defendants. Accordingly, the extent of losses beyond any amounts
            that
            may be accrued are not readily determinable at this time.

CCC
            was
            named in Adams v. Aetna, Inc., et al. (Circuit Court of Kanawha County,
            West
            Virginia, filed June 28, 2002), a purported class action against CCC
            and other
            insurers, alleging that the defendants violated West Virginia’s Unfair Trade
            Practices Act (“UTPA”) in handling and resolving asbestos claims against five
            specifically named asbestos defendants. The Adams litigation had been
            stayed
            pending a planned motion by plaintiffs to file an amended complaint that
            reflected two June 2004 decisions of the West Virginia Supreme Court
            of Appeals.
            In June 2005, the court presiding over Adams and three similar putative
            class
            actions against other insurers, on its own motion, directed plaintiffs
            to file
            any amended complaints by June 13, 2005 and directed the parties to agree
            upon a
            case management order that would result in trial being commenced by July
            2006.

greatly
            expands the scope of the action against the insurers, including CCC.
            Under the
            Amended Complaint, the defendant insurers, including CCC, have now been
            sued for
            alleged violations of the UTPA in connection with handling and resolving
            asbestos personal injury and wrongful death claims in West Virginia courts
            against all their insureds if those claims were resolved before June
            30, 2001.
            CCC, along with other insurer defendants removed the Adams case to Federal
            court, Adams v. Ins. Co. of North America (“INA”) et al. (S.D. W. Va. No.
            2:05-CV-0527). A motion by plaintiffs to remand the case to state courts
            is
            pending. Numerous factual and legal issues remain to be resolved that
            are
            critical to the final result in Adams, the outcome of which cannot be
            predicted
            with any reliability. These issues include: (a) the legal sufficiency
            and
            factual validity of the novel statutory claims pled by the claimants;
            (b) the
            applicability of claimants’ legal theories to insurers who issued excess
            policies and/or neither defended nor controlled the defense of certain
            policyholders; (c) the possibility that certain of the claims are barred
            by
            various Statutes of Limitation; (d) the fact that the imposition of duties
            would
            interfere with the attorney-client privilege and the contractual rights
            and
            responsibilities of the parties to CNA’s insurance policies; (e) whether
            plaintiffs’ claims are barred in whole or in part by injunctions that have been
            issued by bankruptcy courts that are overseeing, or that have overseen,
            the
            bankruptcies of various insureds; (f) whether some or all of the named
            plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff class have released CCC from the
            claims
            alleged in the Amended Complaint when they resolved their underlying
            asbestos
            claims; (g) the appropriateness of the case for class action treatment;
            and (h)
            the potential and relative magnitude of liabilities of co-defendants.
            Accordingly, the extent of losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued
            are not
            readily determinable at this time.

On
            March
            22, 2002, a direct action was filed in Montana (Pennock, et al. v. Maryland
            Casualty, et al. First Judicial District Court of Lewis & Clark County,
            Montana) by eight individual plaintiffs (all employees of W.R. Grace
& Co.
            (“W.R. Grace”)) and their spouses against CNA, Maryland Casualty and the State
            of Montana. This action alleges that the carriers failed to warn of or
            otherwise
            protect W.R. Grace employees from the dangers of asbestos at a W.R. Grace
            vermiculite mining facility in Libby, Montana. The Montana direct action
            is
            currently stayed because of W.R. Grace’s pending bankruptcy. With respect to
            such claims, numerous factual and legal issues remain to be resolved
            that are
            critical to the final result, the outcome of which cannot be predicted
            with any
            reliability. These factors include: (a) the unclear nature and scope
            of any
            alleged duties owed to people exposed to asbestos and the resulting uncertainty
            as to the potential pool of potential claimants; (b) the potential application
            of Statutes of Limitation to many of the claims which may be made depending
            on
            the nature and scope of the alleged duties; (c) the unclear nature of
            the
            required nexus between the acts of the defendants and the right of any
            particular claimant to recovery; (d) the diseases and damages claimed
            by such
            claimants; (e) the extent that such liability would be shared with other
            potentially responsible parties; and (f) the impact of bankruptcy proceedings
            on
            claims resolution. Accordingly, the extent of losses beyond any amounts
            that may
            be accrued are not readily determinable at this time.

CNA
            is
            vigorously defending these and other cases and believes that it has meritorious
            defenses to the claims asserted. However, there are numerous factual
            and legal
            issues to be resolved in connection with these claims, and it is extremely
            difficult to predict the outcome or ultimate financial exposure represented
            by
            these matters. Adverse developments with respect to any of these matters
            could
            have a material adverse effect on CNA’s business and insurer financial strength
            and debt ratings and the Company’s results of operations and/or
            equity.

Environmental
            Pollution and Mass Tort

As
            of
            December 31, 2005 and 2004, CNA carried approximately $423.0 million
            and $497.0
            million of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance
            recoverables, for reported and unreported environmental pollution and
            mass tort
            claims. There was $53.0 million, $1.0 million and $153.0 million of unfavorable
            environmental pollution and mass tort net claim and claim adjustment
            expense
            reserve development recorded for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
            and
            2003. CNA recorded $20.0 million and $15.0 million of current accident
            year
            losses related to mass tort for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
            2004. CNA
            paid environmental pollution-related claims and mass tort-related claims,
            net of
            reinsurance recoveries, of $147.0 million, $96.0 million and $93.0 million
            for
            the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

CNA
            noted
            adverse development in various pollution accounts in its most recent
            ground up
            review. In the course of its review, CNA did not observe a negative trend
            or
            deterioration in the underlying pollution claims environment. Rather,
            individual
            account estimates changed due to changes in liability and/or coverage
            circumstances particular to those accounts. As a result, CNA increased
            pollution
            reserves by $50.0 million in 2005.

Net
            Prior Year Development

Unfavorable
            net prior year development of $807.0 million, including $945.0 million
            of
            unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development
            and
            $138.0 million of favorable premium development, was recorded in 2005.
            The
            development discussed below includes premium development due to its direct
            relationship to claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development.
            The
            development discussed below excludes the impact of the provision for
            uncollectible reinsurance, but includes the impact of commutations. See
            Note 18
            of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion
            of the
            provision for uncollectible reinsurance.

CNA
            records favorable or unfavorable premium and claim and claim adjustment
            expense
            reserve development related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties
            as
            movements in the claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves
            for the
            accident years covered by the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties
            indicate
            such development is required. While the available limit of these treaties
            was
            fully utilized in 2003, the ceded premiums and losses for an individual
            segment
            may change in subsequent years because of the re-estimation of the subject
            losses or commutations of the underlying contracts. In 2005, CNA commuted
            a
            corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated
            Financial Statements for further discussion of the corporate aggregate
            reinsurance treaties.

The
            following tables summarize pretax net prior year development by segment
            for the
            Property and Casualty segments and the Other Insurance segment for the
            years
            ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. For the Life and Group Non-Core
            segment
            $5.0 million and $7.0 million of favorable development was recorded in
            2005 and
            2004, and $62.0 million of unfavorable development was recorded in 2003.

During
            the fourth quarter of 2005, CNA executed commutation agreements with
            certain
            reinsurers, including the commutation of a corporate aggregate reinsurance
            agreement. These agreements resulted in approximately $285.0 million
            of
            unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development.
            This unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
            development was partially offset by a release of a previously established
            allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.

Also,
            in
            the fourth quarter of 2005, reserve reviews of certain products were
            conducted
            and changes in reserve estimates were recorded. Approximately $102.0
            million of
            unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development
            was
            due to higher frequency and severity on claims related to excess workers
            compensation, particularly in accident years 2003 and prior. In addition,
            approximately $4.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment
            expense reserve development was recorded due to increased severity on
            known
            claims on package policies provided to small businesses in accident years
            and 2003. Approximately $10.0 million of favorable claim and allocated
            claim
            adjustment expense reserve development was due to lower severities in
            the excess
            and surplus lines runoff business in accident years 2001 and prior.
            Approximately $23.0 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment
            expense reserve development was related to favorable loss trends on accidents
            years 2002 and subsequent in CNA’s international business, specifically Europe
            and Canada, primarily in property, cargo and marine coverages. Approximately
            $4.0 million of favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
            expense development was due to less than expected losses in involuntary
            business.

Approximately
            $140.0 million of favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment
            expense development was recorded due to improvement in the severity and
            number
            of claims for property coverages and marine business, primarily in accident
            year
            2004.

Approximately
            $126.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment expense development resulted from increased severity trends
            for
            workers compensation, primarily in accident year 2002 and prior. Approximately
            $15.0 million of unfavorable premium development was recorded in relation
            to
            this unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
            expense
            development which resulted from additional ceded reinsurance premium
            on
            agreements where the ceded premium is impacted by the level of ceded
            losses.

Approximately
            $90.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment
            expense development and $83.0 million of favorable net prior year premium
            development resulted from an unfavorable arbitration ruling on two reinsurance
            treaties.

Approximately
            $76.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment
            expense development was attributed to increased severity in liability
            coverages
            for large account policies.

Approximately
            $53.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment
            expense development was related to reviews of liquor liability, trucking
            and
            habitational business that indicated that the number of large claims
            was higher
            than previously expected in recent accident years. The remainder of the
            favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
            development was primarily a result of improved experience on several
            coverages
            on middle market business, mainly in accident year 2004.

Favorable
            net prior year premium development was recorded primarily as a result
            of
            additional premium resulting from audits on recent policies, primarily
            workers
            compensation.

In
            addition, there was $19.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim
            and
            allocated claim adjustment expense development and $6.0 million of favorable
            premium development related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties,
            excluding the impact of a corporate aggregate reinsurance commutation
            as

Approximately
            $60.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense

Approximately
            $45.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim

allocated
            claim adjustment expense development was recorded due to large claims
            under
            excess coverages provided to health care facilities.

Approximately
            $32.0 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
            reserve
            development related to surety business was due to a favorable outcome
            on several
            specific large claims and lower than expected emergence of additional
            large
            claims related to accident years 1999 through 2003.

Approximately $30.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim
            adjustment
            expense reserve development was related to a commutation agreement executed
            in
            the fourth quarter of 2005 of a corporate aggregate reinsurance agreement.
            This
            unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development
            was
            partially offset by a release of a previously established allowance for
            uncollectible reinsurance.

Approximately
            $24.0 million of favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
            expense development was recorded as a result of improvements in the claim
            severity and claim frequency, mainly in recent accident years, from nursing
            home
            businesses.

Approximately
            $14.0 million of favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
            expense development was recorded due to lower severity in the dental
            program.

The
            remainder of the favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
            expense development was primarily attributed to favorable experience
            in the
            warranty line of business, partially offset by unfavorable net prior
            year claim
            and allocated claim adjustment expense development attributed to other
            large
            D&O claims.

In
            addition, there was approximately $25.0 million of favorable net prior
            year
            claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development and $19.0 million
            of
            unfavorable premium development related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance
            treaties in 2005, excluding the impact of a corporate aggregate
            reinsurance commutation as discussed above.

Other
            Insurance

Approximately
            $157.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
            reserve development was attributable to CNA’s assumed reinsurance operations,
            driven by a significant increase in large claim activity during 2005
            across
            multiple accident years. This development was concentrated in the proportional
            liability, excess of loss liability, and professional liability businesses,
            which impact underlying coverages that include general liability, umbrella,
            E&O and D&O. CNA’s assumed reinsurance operations were put in run-off in
            2003.

During
            the fourth quarter of 2005, CNA executed significant commutation agreements
            with
            certain reinsurers, including the commutation of a corporate aggregate
            reinsurance agreement. These agreements resulted in approximately $62.0
            million
            of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development.

Approximately
            $56.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
            development recorded in 2005 was a result of a second quarter commutation
            of a
            finite reinsurance contract put in place in 1992. CNA recaptured $400.0
            million
            of losses and received $344.0 million of cash. The commutation was economically
            attractive because of the reinsurance agreement’s contractual interest rate and
            maintenance charges.

Approximately
            $6.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
            development was related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties,
            excluding the impact of a corporate aggregate reinsurance commutation
            as
            discussed above. The unfavorable premium development was driven by $10.0
            million
            of additional ceded reinsurance premium on agreements where the ceded
            premium
            depends on the ceded loss and $4.0 million of additional premium ceded
            to the
            corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties.

CNA
            noted
            adverse development in various pollution accounts in its most recent
            ground up
            review. In the course of its review, CNA did not observe a negative trend
            or
            deterioration in the underlying pollution claims environment. Rather,
            individual
            account estimates changed due to changes in liability and/or coverage
            circumstances particular to those accounts. As a result, CNA increased
            pollution
            reserves by $50.0 million in 2005.

The
              overall unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
              development was partially decreased by favorable claim and allocated
              claim
              adjustment expense reserve development in various other programs in
              runoff,
              including Financial Guarantee, Guarantee and Credit, and Mortgage Guarantee.
              These programs have recently exhibited favorable trends due to offsetting
              recoveries and commutations, leading to reductions in the estimated
              liabilities.

            Net Prior Year Development

Standard
            Lines

Approximately
            $190.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment expense development recorded during 2004 resulted from increased
            severity trends for workers compensation on large account policies primarily
            in
            accident years 2002 and prior. Favorable premium development on retrospectively
            rated large account policies of $50.0 million was recorded in relation
            to this
            unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claims adjustment expense
            development.

Approximately
            $60.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment
            expense development was recorded in involuntary pools in which CNA’s
            participation is mandatory and primarily based on premium writings.
            Approximately $15.0 million of this unfavorable net prior year claim
            and
            allocated claim adjustment expense development was related to CNA’s share of the
            National Workers Compensation Reinsurance Pool (“NWCRP”). During 2004, the NWCRP
            reached an agreement with a former pool member to settle their pool liabilities
            at an amount less than their established share. The result of this settlement
            is
            a higher allocation to the remaining pool members, including CNA. The
            remainder
            of this unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
            expense
            development was primarily due to increased severity trends for workers
            compensation exposures in older years.

Approximately
            $60.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment
            expense development resulted from the change in estimates due to increased
            severity trends for excess and surplus business driven by excess liability,
            liquor liability and coverages provided to apartment and condominium
            complexes.
            Approximately $105.0 million of favorable net prior year claim and allocated
            claim adjustment expense development resulted from reserve studies of
            commercial
            auto liability policies and the liability portion of package policies.
            The
            change was due to improvement in the severity and number of claims for
            this
            business. Approximately $85.0 million of favorable net prior year claim
            and
            allocated claim adjustment expense development was due to improvement
            in the
            severity and number of claims for property coverages primarily in accident
            year
            2003.

Other
            favorable net prior year premium development of approximately $50.0 million
            resulted primarily from higher audit and endorsement premiums on workers
            compensation policies.

During
            2004, CNA executed commutation agreements with several members of The
            Trenwick
            Group. These commutations resulted in unfavorable claim and claim adjustment
            expense reserve development which was more than offset by a release of

            previously established allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.

            Lines

Approximately
            $495.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment expense reserve development was recorded related to construction
            defect claims in 2003. Based on analyses completed during 2003, it became
            apparent that the assumptions regarding the number of claims, which were
            used to
            estimate the expected losses, were no longer appropriate. The analyses
            indicated
            that the actual number of claims reported during 2003 was higher than
            expected
            primarily in states other than California. States where this activity
            is most
            evident include Texas, Arizona, Nevada, Washington and Colorado. The
            number of
            claims reported in states other than California during the first six
            months of
            2003 was almost 35.0% higher than the last six months of 2002. The number
            of
            claims reported during the last six months of 2002 increased by less
            than 10.0%
            from the first six months of 2002. In California, claims resulting from
            additional insured endorsements increased throughout 2003. Additional
            insured
            endorsements are regularly included on policies provided to subcontractors.
            The
            additional insured endorsement names general contractors and developers
            as
            additional insureds covered by the policy. Current California case law

            the entire action, subject to contribution or recovery later. In addition,
            the
            additional insured is allowed to choose one specific carrier to defend
            the
            entire action. These additional insured claims can remain open for a
            longer
            period of time than other construction defect claims because the additional
            insured defense obligation can continue until the entire case is resolved.
            The
            adverse reserve development recorded related to construction defect claims
            was
            primarily related to accident years 1999 and prior.

Unfavorable
            net prior year development of approximately $595.0 million, including
            $518.0
            million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
            development and $77.0 million of unfavorable premium development, was
            recorded
            for large account business including workers compensation coverages in
            2003.
            Many of the policies issued to these large accounts include provisions
            tailored
            specifically to the individual accounts. Such provisions effectively
            result in
            the insured being responsible for a portion of the loss. An example of
            such a
            provision is a deductible arrangement where the insured reimburses CNA
            for all
            amounts less than a specified dollar amount. These arrangements often
            limit the
            aggregate amount the insured is required to reimburse CNA. Analyses indicated
            that the provisions that result in the insured being responsible for
            a portion
            would have less of an impact due to the larger size of claims as well
            as the
            increased number of claims. The unfavorable net prior year development
            recorded
            was primarily related to accident years 2000 and prior.

Approximately
            $98.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment
            expense reserve development recorded in 2003, resulted from a program
            covering
            facilities that provide services to developmentally disabled individuals.
            This
            net prior year development was due to an increase in the size of known
            claims
            and increases in policyholder defense costs. With regard to average claim
            size,
            updated data showed the average claim increasing at an annual rate of
            approximately 20.0%. Prior data had shown average claim size to be level.
            Similar to the average claim size, updated data showed the average policyholder
            defense cost increasing at an annual rate of approximately 20.0%. Prior
            data had
            shown average policyholder defense cost to be level. The net prior year
            development recorded was primarily for accident years 2001 and
            prior.

Approximately
            $40.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment
            expense reserve development recorded in 2003 was for excess workers compensation
            coverages due to increasing severity. The increase in severity means
            that a
            higher percentage of the total loss dollars will be CNA’s responsibility since
            more claims will exceed the point at which CNA’s coverage begins. The net prior
            year development recorded was primarily for accident year 2000.

Approximately
            $73.0 million of unfavorable development recorded in 2003 was the result
            of a
            commutation of all ceded reinsurance treaties with Gerling Global Group
            of
            companies (“Gerling”), related to accident years 1999 through 2001, including
            $41.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
            development and $32.0 million of unfavorable premium development. Unfavorable

adjustment
            expense reserve development of approximately $40.0 million recorded in
            2003 was
            related to a program covering tow truck and ambulance operators, primarily
            impacting the 2001 accident year. CNA had previously expected that loss
            ratios
            for this business would be similar to its middle market commercial automobile
            liability business. During 2002, CNA ceased writing business under this
            program.

Approximately
            $25.0 million of unfavorable net prior year premium development recorded
            in 2003
            was related to 2003 reevaluation of losses ceded to a reinsurance contract
            covering middle market workers compensation exposures. The reevaluation
            of
            losses led to a new estimate of the number and dollar amount of claims
            that
            would be ceded under the reinsurance contract. As a result of the reevaluation
            of losses, CNA recorded approximately $36.0 million of unfavorable claim
            and
            allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development, which was ceded
            under
            the contract. The net prior year development was recorded for accident
            year
            2000.

Approximately
            $11.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment
            expense reserve development recorded for the year ended December 31,
            2003 was
            related to directors and officers exposures in Global Lines. The unfavorable
            net
            prior year reserve development was primarily due to securities class
            action
            cases related to certain known corporate malfeasance cases and investment
            banking firms. This net prior year development recorded was primarily
            for
            accident years 2000 through 2002.

The
            following premium and claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development
            was recorded in the third quarter of 2003 as a result of the elimination
            of
            deficiencies and redundancies in reserve positions within the segment.
            Unfavorable net prior year development of approximately $210.0 million
            related
            to small and middle market workers compensation exposures and approximately
            $110.0 million related to E&S lines was recorded in 2003. Offsetting these
            increases was $210.0 million of favorable net prior year development
            in the
            property line of business, including $79.0 million related to the September
            11,
            2001 World Trade Center Disaster and related events (“WTC event”).

Also,
            offsetting the unfavorable premium and claim and allocated claim adjustment
            expense development was a $216.0 million underwriting benefit from cessions
            to
            corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties recorded in 2003. The benefit
            is
            comprised of $485.0 million of ceded losses and $269.0 million of ceded
            premiums
            for accident years 2000 and 2001.

Specialty
            Lines

Approximately
            $50.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment
            expense reserve development recorded in 2003 was related to increased
            severity
            in excess coverages provided to facilities providing health care services.
            The
            increase in reserves is based on reviews of individual accounts where
            claims had
            been expected to be less than the point at which CNA’s coverage applies. The
            current claim trends indicated that the layers of coverage provided by
            CNA would
            be impacted. The net prior year development recorded was primarily for
            accident
            years 2001 and prior.

Approximately
            $68.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment
            expense reserve development recorded in 2003 was for surety coverages
            primarily
            related to workers compensation bond exposure from accident years 1990
            and prior
            and large losses for accident years 1999 and 2002. Approximately $21.0
            million
            of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
            reserve development was recorded in the surety line of business in 2003
            as the
            result of recent developments on one large claim.

Approximately
            $75.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
            adjustment
            expense reserve development recorded in 2003 was related to directors
            and
            officers exposures in CNA Pro. The unfavorable net prior year reserve
            development was primarily due to securities class action cases related
            to
            certain known corporate malfeasance cases and investment banking firms.
            This net
            prior year development recorded was primarily for accident years 2000
            through
            2002.

Approximately
            $84.0 million of losses was recorded during 2003 as the result of a commutation
            of ceded reinsurance treaties with Gerling covering CNA Health Pro, relating
            to
            accident years 1999 through 2002.

(Continued)

The
              following development was recorded in 2003 as a result of the elimination
              of
              deficiencies and redundancies in reserve positions within the segment.
              An
              additional $50.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated
              claim
              adjustment expense reserve development was recorded related to medical
              malpractice and long term

care
              facilities. Partially offsetting this unfavorable net prior year claim
              and
              allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development was a $25.0
              million
              underwriting benefit from cessions to corporate aggregate reinsurance
              treaties.
              The benefit was comprised of $56.0 million of ceded losses and $31.0
              million of
              ceded premiums for accident years 2000 and 2001. See Note 18 for further
              discussion of CNA’s aggregate reinsurance treaties.

Other
            Insurance

The
            development recorded in Other Insurance was primarily driven by $795.0
            million
            of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
            reserve development related to APMT.

In
            addition to APMT development, there was unfavorable net prior year development
            recorded in 2003 related to CNA Re of $149.0 million and $75.0 million
            related
            to voluntary pools.

Unfavorable
            net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development
            of approximately $25.0 million was recorded in CNA Re primarily for directors
            and officers exposures. The unfavorable net prior year development was
            a result
            of a claims review that was completed during the second quarter of 2003.
            The
            unfavorable net prior year development was primarily due to securities
            class
            action cases related to certain known corporate malfeasance cases and
            investment
            banking firms. The unfavorable net prior year development recorded was
            for
            accident years 2000 and 2001.

The
            CNA
            Re unfavorable net prior year development for 2003 was also due to a
            general
            change in the pattern of how losses emerged over time as reported by
            the
            companies that purchased reinsurance from CNA Re. Losses have continued
            to show
            large increases for accident years in the late 1990s and into 2000 and
            2001.
            These increases are greater than the increases indicated by patterns
            from older
            accident years and had a similar effect on several lines of business.
            Approximately $67.0 million unfavorable net prior year development recorded
            in
            2003 was related to proportional liability exposures, primarily from
            multi-line
            and umbrella contracts in accident years 1997 through 2001. Approximately
            $32.0
            million of unfavorable net prior year development recorded in 2003 was
            related
            to assumed financial reinsurance for accident years 2001 and prior and
            approximately $24.0 million of unfavorable net prior year development
            was
            related to professional liability exposures in accident years 2001 and
            prior.

Additionally,
            CNA Re recorded $15.0 million of unfavorable net prior year development
            for
            construction defect related exposures. Because of the unique nature of
            this
            exposure, losses have not followed expected development patterns. The
            continued
            reporting of claims in California, the increase in the number of claims
            from
            states other than California and a review of individual ceding companies’
exposure to this type of claim resulted in an increase in the estimated
            reserve.

The
            following premium and claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development,
            was recorded in 2003 as a result of the elimination of deficiencies and
            redundancies in the reserve positions of individual products within CNA
            Re.
            Unfavorable net prior year premium and claim and allocated claim adjustment
            expense development of approximately $42.0 million related to Surety
            exposures,
            $32.0 million related to excess of loss liability exposures and $12.0
            million
            related to facultative liability exposures were recorded in the third
            quarter of
            2003.

Offsetting
            this unfavorable net prior year development was approximately $55.0 million
            of
            favorable net prior year development related to the WTC event as well
            as a $45.0
            million underwriting benefit from cessions to corporate aggregate reinsurance
            treaties recorded in 2003. The benefit from cessions to the corporate
            aggregate
            reinsurance treaties was comprised of $102.0 million of ceded losses
            and $58.0
            million of ceded premiums for accident years 2000 and 2001.

Unfavorable
            net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development
            of approximately $75.0 million was recorded during the third quarter
            of 2003
            related to an adverse arbitration decision involving a single large property
            and
            business interruption loss on a voluntary insurance pool. The decision
            was
            rendered against a voluntary insurance pool in which CNA was a participant.
            The
            loss was caused by a fire which occurred in 1995. CNA no longer participates
            in
            this pool.

Income
                                    Taxes

The
            Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income
            tax
            return. The Company has entered into a separate tax allocation agreement
            with
            CNA, a majority-owned subsidiary in which its ownership exceeds 80%.
            The
            agreement provides that the Company will (i) pay to CNA the amount, if
            any, by
            which the Company’s consolidated federal income tax is reduced by virtue of
            inclusion of CNA in the Company’s return, or (ii) be paid by CNA an amount, if
            any, equal to the federal income tax that would have been payable by
            CNA if it
            had filed a separate consolidated return. The agreement may be canceled
            by
            either of the parties upon thirty days’ written notice.

The
            Company’s consolidated federal income tax returns have been settled with the
            Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) through 2001 as the tax returns for 1998
            through 2001, including related carryback claims and prior claims for
            refund,
            were approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation in the second quarter
            of 2005.
            As a result, the Company recorded net refund interest of $130.6 million
            that is
            included in Other Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Subsequent
            to this settlement, a review of tax liabilities was performed and the
            Company
            reduced its deferred tax liabilities by $58.5 million for the year ended
            December 31, 2005. The tax benefit relates primarily to the release of
            federal
            income tax reserves.

The
            federal income tax returns for 2002 through 2004 are currently under
            examination
            by the IRS. The Company believes the outcome of this examination will
            not have a
            material effect on its financial condition or results of
            operations.

Provision
            has been made for the expected U.S. federal income tax liabilities applicable
            to
            undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, except for certain subsidiaries
            for
            which the Company intends to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely,
            or
            recover such undistributed earnings tax-free. At December 31, 2005, the
            Company
            has not provided deferred taxes of $88.0 million, if sold through a taxable
            sale, on $250.0 million of undistributed earnings related to a domestic
            affiliate. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred
            tax
            liability related to the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries

Although
            realization of deferred tax assets is not assured, management believes
            it is
            more likely than not that net deferred tax assets, with the exception
            of the CNA
            and Diamond Offshore valuation allowances noted below, will be realized
            through
            future earnings, including but not limited to the generation of future
            income
            from continuing operations and reversal of existing temporary differences
            and
            available tax planning strategies. CNA has a valuation allowance of $30.4
            million which remains outstanding at December 31, 2005 due to uncertainty
            in the
            ability of the foreign subsidiaries to generate sufficient future income.
            Diamond Offshore, which is not included in the Company’s consolidated federal
            income tax return, maintained a valuation allowance of $0.8 million and
            $10.3
            million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, on foreign tax credit
            carryforwards that begin expiring in 2011.

At
            December 31, 2005, Diamond Offshore has a net operating loss carryforward
            of
            approximately $10.5 million which will expire by 2010. It is expected
            that the
            net operating loss carryforward will be fully utilized by Diamond Offshore
            in
            future years.

The

                  rate of 8.6075 shares per one thousand dollars principal amount,
                  subject
                  to adjustment. Each debenture will be purchased by Diamond Offshore
                  at the
                  option of the holder on the tenth and fifteenth anniversaries of
                  issuance
                  at the accreted value through the date of repurchase. The debentures
                  were
                  issued on June 6, 2000. Diamond Offshore, at its option, may elect
                  to pay
                  the purchase price in cash or shares of common stock, or in certain
                  combinations thereof. The debentures are redeemable at the option
                  of
                  Diamond Offshore at any time at prices which reflect a yield of
                  3.5% to

The

                  subject
                  to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, Diamond
                  Offshore
                  has the right to deliver cash in lieu of shares of its common stock.
                  Diamond Offshore may redeem all or a portion of the debentures
                  at any time
                  on or after April 15, 2008 at a price equal to 100% of the principal
                  amount. Holders may require Diamond Offshore to purchase all or
                  a portion
                  of the debentures on April 15, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of
                  the
                  principal amount. Diamond Offshore, at its option, may elect to

        2005.

On
        April
        21, 2005, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding $1,150.0 million principal
        amount of 3.1% exchangeable subordinated notes due 2007 at a redemption price
        of
        100.9375% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest.

On
          June
          7, 2005, Diamond Offshore repurchased $460.0 million, or $774.1 million
          in
          aggregate principal amount at maturity, of its Zero Coupon Debentures at
          a
          purchase price of $594.25 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which
          represents 96.2% of its then outstanding Zero Coupon Debentures. The holders
          of
          the remaining outstanding debentures have the right to require Diamond
          Offshore
          to repurchase the debentures on June 6, 2010 and June 6, 2015 at their
          accreted
          value through the date of purchase. As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate
          accreted value of its Zero Coupon Debentures of $18.7 million is classified
          as
          long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline Initial Public Offering

In
        November of 2005, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Boardwalk Pipeline,
        completed an initial public offering of 15,000,000 common limited partnership
        units at a price of $19.50 per common unit, representing a 14.5% limited
        partnership interest. In connection with the closing of this offering, the
        Company contributed, through a wholly owned subsidiary, its ownership interest
        in Boardwalk Pipelines, LLC, together with certain of its liabilities to
        Boardwalk Pipeline and received 53,256,122 common and 33,093,878 subordinated
        units representing an aggregate 83.5% limited partner interest. In addition,
        the
        Company’s subsidiary received a 2% general partnership interest and incentive
        distribution rights, which entitles the Company to an increasing percentage
        of
        the cash that is distributed in excess of $0.4025 per unit per
        quarter.

The
        subordinated units have secondary distribution rights during the subordination
        period and will convert to common units at the earliest date subsequent to
        which
        Boardwalk Pipeline has paid a $0.35 minimum quarterly distribution for twelve
        consecutive quarters, or minimum quarterly distributions in the amount of
        $0.525
        per unit for four consecutive quarters.

(Continued)

The
        issuance price of the common units exceeded the Company’s carrying amount,
        resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $133.1 million. In accordance
        with
        SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51, “Accounting for Sales of

Stock by a
        Subsidiary,” recognition of a gain is only appropriate if the class of
        securities sold by the subsidiary does not contain any preference over the
        subsidiary’s other classes of securities. As a result, the Company will defer
        gain recognition until the subordinated units are converted into common
        units.

Boardwalk
      Pipeline used the net proceeds of approximately $271.4 million to fund the
      repayment of its intercompany debt ($250.0 million) relating to the acquisition
      of Gulf South and to provide additional working capital.

Acquisitions

The
      Company, through its subsidiary Boardwalk Pipelines, LLC acquired Gulf South
      Pipeline, LP (“Gulf South”) from Entergy-Koch, LP, a venture between Entergy
      Corporation and Koch Energy, Inc., a subsidiary of privately-owned Koch
      Industries, Inc., in December of 2004. The Company funded the $1.14 billion
      purchase price, including transaction costs and closing adjustments, with $575.0
      million of proceeds from an interim loan and the remaining approximately $561.0
      million from its available cash. In January of 2005, Boardwalk Pipelines, LLC
      and Gulf South issued long-term debt and used the proceeds to repay the $575.0
      million interim loan. See Note 12.

Gulf
      South owns and operates a 7,570-mile interstate natural gas pipeline and storage
      system located in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and
      Florida. The Gulf South pipeline system is comprised of the interstate
      transmission pipeline and 80.0 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”) of working gas storage
      capacity.

In
      May of
      2003, Boardwalk Pipelines, LLC acquired Texas Gas from The Williams Companies,
      Inc. (“Williams”). The transaction value was approximately $1.05 billion, which
      included $250.0 million of existing Texas Gas debt. The results of Texas Gas
      have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of
      acquisition. The Company funded the approximately $803.3 million balance of
      the
      purchase price, including transaction costs and closing adjustments, with $528.3
      million of its available cash and $275.0 million of proceeds from an interim
      loan incurred by Texas Gas immediately after the acquisition.

Upon
      completion of the acquisition, Boardwalk Pipelines, LLC issued $185.0 million
      of
      5.2% Notes due 2018 and Texas Gas issued $250.0 million of 4.6% Notes due 2015.
      The net offering proceeds of approximately $431.0 million were used to repay
      the
      $275.0 million interim loan and to retire approximately $132.7 million principal
      amount of Texas Gas’s existing $150.0 million of 8.625% Notes due 2004 and to
      pay related tender premiums. In March of 2004, Texas Gas retired the remaining
      $17.3 million principal amount of its 8.625% Notes upon final maturity. Texas
      Gas used its existing cash balances to fund this maturity. Boardwalk Pipelines,
      LLC was converted to a limited partnership in November 2005 and is now known
      as
      Boardwalk Pipelines, LP.

Texas
      Gas
      owns and operates a 5,900-mile natural gas pipeline system that transports
      natural gas originating in the Louisiana Gulf Coast and East Texas and running
      north and east through Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky,
      Indiana and into Ohio, with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois.
      Texas Gas currently has a delivery capacity of 2.8 Bcf per day and a working
      storage capacity of 63.0 Bcf.

Hellespont
      Shipping Corporation (“Hellespont”), in which the Company, through Majestic
      Shipping Corporation (“Majestic”), a wholly owned subsidiary, has a 49% common
      stock interest, sold all of its ultra-large crude oil tankers in July of 2004.
      Majestic received cash distributions from Hellespont and recognized income
      of
      $179.3 million ($116.5 million after taxes) for the year ended December 31,
      2004.

Personal
      Insurance Transaction

As
      part
      of the sale of CNA’s personal insurance business to The Allstate Corporation
      (“Allstate”) on October 1, 1999, Allstate paid CNA $20.0 million for an option
      to purchase 100% of the common stock of five CNA insurance subsidiaries.
      Subsequent to the sale, Allstate and CNA agreed to substitute other CNA
      subsidiaries for the originally named subsidiaries, and to extend the purchase
      option period for the substituted subsidiaries through 2005. CNA compensated
      Allstate for the postponement of its right to exercise the option and the
      reduced number of licenses in the substitute companies.

On
      October 1, 2005, Allstate exercised its option to purchase the five substitute
      companies. The consideration received by CNA, which totaled $60.0 million,
      was
      equal to the fair value of investments and cash, less the balance of surplus
      note liabilities of the substitute companies, which approximated the GAAP
      carrying value of the five substitute companies. CNA recognized a gain of $7.3
      million after tax and minority interest which was the remaining deferred balance
      of the option consideration. Net loss of the business sold was $0.9 million
      for
      the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income was $0.9 million and $1.8 million
      for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

      December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Sale
      of CNA Trust

On
      August
      1, 2004, CNA completed the sale of the retirement plan trust and recordkeeping
      business portfolio of CNA Trust to Union Bank of California, N.A. (“Union Bank”)
      for approximately $12.0 million. As a result of the sale, CNA recorded a
      realized investment gain of approximately $9.0 million pretax ($4.6 million
      after tax and minority interest) for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Union
      Bank assumed assets and liabilities of $172.0 million and $172.0 million at
      August 1, 2004. The revenues of the business sold through the sale date were
      $11.0 million and $27.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

      for
      a nominal fee. As part of the sale, CNA Trust was merged into Nevada Security
      Bank, and is no longer a subsidiary of CNA.

Individual
      Life Sale

On
      April
      30, 2004, CNA completed the sale of its individual life insurance business
      to
      Swiss Re. The business sold included term, universal and permanent life
      insurance policies and individual annuity products. CNA’s individual long term
      care and structured settlement businesses were excluded from the sale. Swiss
      Re
      acquired VFL, a wholly owned subsidiary of CAC, and CNA’s Nashville, Tennessee
      insurance servicing and administration building as part of the sale. In
      connection with the sale, CNA entered into a reinsurance agreement in which
      CAC
      ceded its individual life insurance business to Swiss Re on a 100% indemnity
      reinsurance basis. Subject to certain exceptions, Swiss Re assumed the credit
      risk of the business that was previously reinsured to other carriers. As a
      result of this reinsurance agreement with Swiss Re, approximately $1.0 billion
      of future policy benefit reserves were ceded to Swiss Re. CNA received
      consideration of approximately $700.0 million and recorded a realized investment
      loss of $622.0 million pretax ($352.9 million after tax and minority interest).

Swiss
      Re
      assumed assets and liabilities of $6.6 billion and $5.2 billion at April 30,
      2004. The revenues of the individual life business through the sale date were
      $151.0 million and $625.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and

      31,
      2004 and 2003.

      received consideration of approximately $530.0 million and recorded a realized
      investment loss on the sale of $163.0 million pretax ($109.1 million after
      tax
      and minority interest).

As
      a

Assumed
      Reinsurance Renewal Rights Sale

In
      October of 2003, CNA sold the renewal rights for most of the treaty business
      of
      CNA Re to Folksamerica Reinsurance Company (“Folksamerica”). Under the terms of
      the transaction, Folksamerica compensated CNA based upon the amount of premiums
      renewed by Folksamerica over the next two contract renewals. The renewal rights
      transaction did not have a material effect on results of operations. Concurrent
      with the sale, CNA withdrew from the assumed reinsurance business and is
      managing the run-off of its retained liabilities.

CNA
      Re U.K. and Other Dispositions of Certain Businesses

On
      October 31, 2002, CNA completed the sale of CNA Re Management Company Limited
      (“CNA Re U.K.”) to Tawa UK Limited (“Tawa”), a subsidiary of Artemis Group, a
      diversified French-based holding company.

Under
      the
      terms of the purchase agreement there was a purchase price adjustment that
      entitled CCC to receive $5.0 million from Tawa after Tawa was able to legally
      withdraw funds from the former CNA Re U.K. entities; at December 31, 2004,

      had received all amounts owed to it, totaling approximately $5.0 million. CNA
      has also committed to contribute up to $5.0 million to the former CNA Re U.K.
      entities over a four-year period beginning in 2009 should the Financial Services
      Authority (“FSA”) deem those entities to be undercapitalized. In February 2005,
      CCC repaid Tawa the $5.0 million received as the purchase price adjustment
      in
      settlement of certain claims made by Tawa against CCC. As a result of this
      settlement, CNA’s contingent liability to contribute to the former CNA Re U.K.
      has been reduced to zero.

Restructuring
                and Other Related Charges

In
      2001,
      CNA finalized and approved two separate restructuring plans. The first plan
      related to CNA’s Information Technology operations (the “IT Plan”). The initial
      restructuring and other related charges amounted to $62.0 million in 2001.
      The
      remaining accrual related to this restructuring charge of $3.0 million was
      released in 2004.

The
      second plan related to restructuring the property and casualty segments and
      Life
      and Group Non-Core segment, discontinuation of the variable life and annuity
      business and consolidation of real estate locations. During 2005, 2004 and
      2003,
      approximately $1.0 million, $5.0 million and $17.0 million of costs were paid.
      In addition, a remaining accrual of $1.0 million related to impaired assets
      was
      released in 2005. At December 31, 2005, the remaining accrual was $13.0 million.
      The initial restructuring and other related charges amounted to $189.0 million
      in 2001.

Statutory
                  Accounting Practices
                  (Unaudited)

CNA’s
      domestic and foreign insurance subsidiaries maintain their accounts in
      conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance
      regulatory authorities, which vary in certain respects from GAAP. In converting
      from statutory to GAAP, typical adjustments include deferral of policy
      acquisition costs and the inclusion of net realized holding gains or losses
      in
      shareholders’ equity relating to fixed maturity securities. The National
      Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has codified statutory
      accounting principles to foster more consistency among the states for accounting
      guidelines and reporting.

CNA’s
      insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in various jurisdictions. These
      subsidiaries prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with
      accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the respective jurisdictions’
insurance regulators. Prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth
      in
      a variety of publications of the NAIC as well as state laws, regulations and
      general administrative rules.

CCC
      follows a permitted practice related to the statutory provision for reinsurance,
      or the uncollectible reinsurance reserve. This permitted practice allows CCC
      to
      record an additional uncollectible reinsurance reserve

amount
      through a different financial statement line item than the prescribed statutory
      convention. This permitted practice had no effect on CCC’s statutory surplus in
      2005 or 2004.

During
      2004 and through March 31, 2005, CIC followed a permitted practice related
      to
      its statutory accounting for reinsurance recoverables from voluntary pools.
      Under the prescribed statutory accounting practice, CIC would be required to
      record a reduction to its statutory surplus related to amounts due from
      reinsurers, including voluntary pools, that are not authorized in its state
      of
      domicile, South Carolina. The permitted practice allowed CIC to continue to
      report voluntary pools that were classified as authorized in CIC’s previous
      state of domicile, New Hampshire, as authorized in South Carolina. This
      permitted practice was intended to be transitional as a result of CIC’s
      redomestication from New Hampshire to South Carolina effective January 1, 2004.
      In the second quarter of 2005, it was determined by CIC’s domiciliary state
      insurance department that credit for reinsurance ceded to voluntary pools shall
      be allowed as an asset. Therefore, a permitted practice is no longer
      necessary.

CNA’s
      ability to pay dividends and other credit obligations is significantly dependent
      on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries. The payment of dividends to
      CNA
      by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department
      of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. Dividends
      in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective
      state
      insurance departments.

Dividends
      from CCC are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of
      Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends,
      or
      dividends that do not require prior approval of the Illinois Department of
      Financial and Professional Regulation - Division of Insurance (the
“Department”), may be paid only from earned surplus, which is calculated by
      removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2005,
      CCC
      is in a positive earned surplus position, enabling CCC to pay approximately
      $48.0 million of dividend payments during 2006 that would not be subject to
      the
      Department’s prior approval. In February of 2006, the Department approved
      extraordinary dividends in the amount of $344.0 million to be used to fund
      CNA’s
      2006 debt service and principal repayment requirements.

CNA’s
      domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital requirements.
      Risk-based capital is a method developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum
      amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support
      its
      overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile.
      The
      formula for determining the amount of risk-based capital specifies various
      factors, weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied
      to
      certain financial balances and financial activity. The adequacy of a company’s
      actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the risk-based capital results,
      as determined by the formula. Companies below minimum risk-based capital
      requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which requires
      specified corrective action. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, all of CNA’s
      domestic insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum risk-based capital
      requirements.

Combined
      statutory capital and surplus and net income (loss), determined in accordance
      with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory
      authorities, for the property and casualty and the life and group insurance
      subsidiaries, were as follows:

Benefit
                Plans

Pension
      Plans - The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit plans for
      eligible employees. The benefits for certain plans which cover salaried
      employees and certain union employees are based on formulas which include,
      among
      others, years of service and average pay. The benefits for one plan which covers
      union workers

under
      various union contracts and certain salaried employees are based on years of
      service multiplied by a stated amount. Benefits for another plan are determined
      annually based on a specified percentage of annual earnings (based on the
      participant’s age) and a specified interest rate (which is established annually
      for all participants) applied to accrued balances.

The
      Company’s funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with applicable
      governmental regulatory requirements. The assets of the plans are invested
      primarily in interest-bearing obligations and for one plan with an insurance
      subsidiary of CNA, in its separate account business.

Other
      Postretirement Benefit Plans - The Company has several postretirement benefit
      plans covering eligible employees and retirees. Participants generally become
      eligible after reaching age 55 with required years of service. Actual
      requirements for coverage vary by plan. Benefits for retirees who were covered
      by bargaining units vary by each unit and contract. Benefits for certain
      retirees are in the form of a Company health care account.

Benefits
      for retirees reaching age 65 are generally integrated with Medicare. Other
      retirees, based on plan provisions, must use Medicare as their primary coverage,
      with the Company reimbursing a portion of the unpaid amount; or are reimbursed
      for the Medicare Part B premium or have no Company coverage. The benefits
      provided by the Company are basically health and, for certain retirees, life
      insurance type benefits.

The
      Company funds certain of these benefit plans and accrues postretirement benefits
      during the active service of those employees who would become eligible for
      such
      benefits when they retire.

The
      Company uses December 31 as the measurement date for the majority of its
      plans.

The
      Company employs a total return approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed
      income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets
      for
      a prudent level of risk. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan
      expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance
      is
      established through careful consideration of the plan liabilities, plan funded
      status and corporate financial conditions. The investment portfolio contains
      a
      diversified blend of U.S. and non-U.S. fixed income and equity investments.
      Alternative investments, including hedge funds, are used judiciously to enhance
      risk adjusted long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.
      Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely
      manner. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through
      annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly
      investment portfolio reviews.

The
      Company’s pension plan and other postretirement benefit weighted-average asset
      allocation at December 31, 2005 and 2004, by asset category are as
      follows:

The
      table
      below presents the estimated future minimum benefit payments at December 31,
      2005.

In
        2006,

        plans
        and $34.0 million to postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefit
        plans.

Savings
      Plans - The Company and its subsidiaries have several contributory savings
      plans
      which allow employees to make regular contributions based upon a percentage
      of
      their salaries. Matching contributions are made up to specified percentages
      of
      employees’ contributions. The contributions by the Company and its subsidiaries
      to these plans amounted to $40.1 million, $64.4 million and $72.4 million for
      the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Stock
      Option Plans - In 2005, shareholders approved the amended and restated Loews
      Corporation 2000 Stock Option Plan (the “Loews Plan”). The aggregate number of
      shares of Loews Common stock for which options may be granted under the Loews
      Plan increased from 2,000,000 shares to 4,000,000 shares, and the maximum number
      of shares of Loews Common stock with respect to which options may be granted
      to
      any individual in any calendar year is 400,000 shares. The exercise price per
      share may not be less than the fair value of the Common stock on the date of
      grant. Generally, options vest ratably over a four-year period and expire in
      ten
      years.

Reinsurance

CNA
      cedes
      insurance to reinsurers to limit its maximum loss, provide greater
      diversification of risk, minimize exposures on larger risks and to exit certain
      lines of business. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary
      liability of CNA. Therefore, a credit exposure exists with respect to property
      and casualty and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is
      unable to meet their obligations or to the extent that the reinsurer disputes
      the liabilities assumed under reinsurance agreements. Property and casualty
      reinsurance coverages are tailored to the specific risk characteristics of
      each
      product line and CNA’s retained amount varies by type of coverage. Reinsurance
      contracts are purchased to protect specific lines of business such as property,
      workers compensation and professional liability. Corporate catastrophe
      reinsurance is also purchased for property and workers compensation exposure.
      Most reinsurance contracts are purchased on an excess of loss basis. CNA also
      utilizes facultative reinsurance in certain lines. In addition CNA assumes
      reinsurance as member of various reinsurance pools and
      associations.

The
      following table summarizes the amounts receivable from reinsurers at December
      31, 2005 and 2004.

Ceded
      claim and claim adjustment expense related reinsurance receivables were reduced
      by approximately $2,000.0 million in 2005 due to the impact of three significant
      commutations. See further discussion related to commutations below.

The
      net
      decrease in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was primarily due to
      a
      release of a previously established allowance due to the execution of several
      commutation agreements, as discussed further below. The expenses incurred
      related to uncollectible reinsurance receivables are presented as a component
      of
“Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits” in the Consolidated Statements of
      Operations.

Prior
      to
      the April 2004 sale of its individual life and annuity business to Swiss Re,
      CNA
      had reinsured a portion of this business through coinsurance, yearly renewable
      term and facultative programs to various reinsurers. As a result of the sale
      of
      the individual life and annuity business, 100% of the net reserves were
      reinsured to Swiss Re. Subject to certain exceptions, Swiss Re assumed the
      credit risk of the business that was previously reinsured to other carriers.
      As
      of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, CNA ceded $968.0 million and
      $1,012.0 million of future policy benefits to Swiss Re.

On
      December 31, 2003, CNA completed the sale of the majority of its Group Benefits
      business through the sale of CNAGLA to Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
      (“Hartford”). In connection with the sale of the group benefits business, CNA
      ceded insurance reserves to Hartford. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, these
      ceded reserves were $1,347.0 million and $1,726.0 million.

CNA
      attempts to mitigate its credit risk related to reinsurance by entering into
      reinsurance arrangements with reinsurers that have credit ratings above certain
      levels and by obtaining substantial amounts of collateral. The primary methods
      of obtaining collateral are through reinsurance trusts, letters of credit and
      funds withheld balances. Such collateral was approximately $4,277.0 million
      and
      $6,231.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. In addition, on a more limited
      basis, CNA may enter into reinsurance contracts with reinsurers that are not
      rated.

In
      2005,
      CNA entered into several significant commutation agreements, including the
      Aggregate Cover as discussed further below. These commutations resulted in
      an
      unfavorable impact of $399.0 million and CNA received $446.0 million of cash
      in
      connection with these significant commutations.

In
      2004,
      CNA executed commutation agreements with several members of The Trenwick Group.
      These commutations resulted in an unfavorable claim and claim adjustment expense
      reserve development which was more than offset by a release of previously
      established allowance of uncollectible reinsurance. These commutations resulted
      in a favorable impact of $28.0 million and CNA received $69.0 million of cash
      in
      connection with these significant commutations.

In
      2003,
      CNA commuted all remaining ceded and assumed reinsurance contracts with four
      Gerling entities. The commutations resulted in an unfavorable impact of $109.0
      million, which was net of a previously established allowance for doubtful
      accounts of $47.0 million, and CNA received $324.0 million of cash in connection
      with these significant commutations. CNA has no further exposure to the Gerling
      companies that are in run-off.

CNA’s
      largest recoverables from a single reinsurer at December 31, 2005, including
      prepaid reinsurance premiums, were approximately $2,215.0 million from
      subsidiaries of Swiss Reinsurance Group, $1,364.0 million from subsidiaries
      of
      Hartford Life Group Insurance Company, $971.0 million from subsidiaries of
      Munich American Holding, $871.0 million from Allstate, and $516.0 million from
      syndicates of Lloyd’s of London.

Insurance
      claims and policyholders’ benefits reported in the Consolidated Statements of
      Operations are net of reinsurance recoveries of $1,459.0 million, $5,792.0
      million and $6,265.0 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The
      impact of reinsurance on life insurance inforce at December 31, 2005, 2004
      and
      2003 is shown in the following table:

(a)

The
                decline in gross inforce is attributable to the sales of the group
                benefits and the individual life
                businesses.

Life
      premiums are primarily from long duration contracts; property and casualty
      premiums and accident and health premiums are primarily from short duration
      contracts.

Reinsurance
      accounting allows for contractual cash flows to be reflected as premiums and
      losses, as compared to deposit accounting, which requires cash flows to be
      reflected as assets and liabilities. To qualify for reinsurance accounting,
      reinsurance agreements must include risk transfer. To meet risk transfer
      requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk,
      consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of
      a
      significant loss for the assuming entity. Reinsurance contracts that include
      both significant risk sharing provisions, such as adjustments to premiums or
      loss coverage based on loss experience, and relatively low policy limits as
      evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits,
      may require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer
      requirements are met. For such contracts, often referred to as finite products,
      CNA assesses risk transfer for each contract generally by developing
      quantitative analyses at contract inception which measure the present value
      of
      reinsurer losses as compared to the present value of the related
      premium.

Funds
      Withheld Reinsurance Arrangements

CNA’s
      overall reinsurance program includes certain property and casualty contracts,
      such as the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties discussed in more detail
      below, that are entered into and accounted for on a “funds withheld” basis.
      Under the funds withheld basis, CNA records the cash remitted to the reinsurer
      for the reinsurer’s margin, or cost of the reinsurance contract, as ceded
      premiums. The remainder of the premiums ceded under the reinsurance contract
      not
      remitted in cash is recorded as funds withheld liabilities. CNA is required
      to
      increase the funds withheld balance at stated interest crediting rates applied
      to the funds withheld balance or as otherwise specified under the terms of
      the
      contract. The funds withheld liability is reduced by any cumulative claim
      payments made by CNA in excess of CNA’s retention under the reinsurance
      contract. If the funds withheld liability is exhausted, interest crediting
      will
      cease and additional claim payments are recoverable from the reinsurer. The
      funds withheld liability is recorded in reinsurance balances payable in the
      Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Interest
      cost on funds withheld and other deposits is credited during all periods in
      which a funds withheld liability exists. Pretax interest cost, which is included
      in net investment income, was $166.0 million, $261.0 million and $335.0 million
      in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The amount subject to interest crediting rates on such
      contracts was $1,050.0 million and $2,564.0 million at December 31, 2005 and
      2004. Certain funds withheld reinsurance contracts, including the corporate
      aggregate reinsurance treaties, require interest on additional premiums arising
      from ceded losses as if those premiums were payable at the inception of the
      contract. In addition, on the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties discussed
      below, if CNA exceeds certain aggregate loss ratio thresholds, the rate on
      which
      interest charges are accrued would increase and be retroactively applied to
      the
      inception of the contract or to a specified date. Any such retroactive interest
      is accrued in the period the additional premiums arise or the loss ratio
      thresholds are met. The amount of retroactive interest was $4.0 million, $45.0
      million and $147.0 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The
      amount subject to interest crediting on these funds withheld contracts will
      vary
      over time based on a number of factors, including the timing of loss payments
      and ultimate gross losses incurred. CNA expects that it will continue to incur
      significant interest costs on these contracts for several years.

Included
      in “All Other” above for the year ended December 31, 2005 is approximately $24.0
      million of pretax expense related to Standard Lines which resulted from an
      unfavorable arbitration ruling on two reinsurance treaties impacting ceded
      earned premiums, ceded claim and claim adjustment expenses, ceding commissions
      and interest charges. This unfavorable outcome was partially offset by a release
      of previously established reinsurance bad debt reserves resulting in a net
      impact from the arbitration ruling of $10.0 million pretax expense for the
      year
      ended December 31, 2005.

Corporate
      Aggregate Reinsurance Treaties

CNA
      had
      an aggregate reinsurance treaty related to the 1999 through 2001 accident years
      that covered substantially all of CNA’s property and casualty lines of business
      (the “Aggregate Cover”). The aggregate limits under both sections of the
      Aggregate Cover have been fully utilized and in 2005 the Aggregate Cover was
      commuted, as discussed in more detail previously in this note. The Aggregate
      Cover provided for two sections of coverage. These coverages attached at defined
      loss ratios for each accident year. Coverage under the first section of

-

(Continued)

the
      Aggregate Cover, which was available for all accident years covered by the
      treaty, had a $500.0 million limit per accident year of ceded losses and an
      aggregate limit of $1.0 billion of ceded losses for the three accident years.
      The ceded premiums associated with the first section were a percentage of ceded
      losses and for each $500.0 million of limit the ceded premium was $230.0
      million. The second section of the Aggregate Cover, which only related to
      accident year 2001, provided additional coverage of up to $510.0 million of
      ceded losses for a maximum ceded premium of $310.0 million. Under the Aggregate
      Cover, interest charges on the funds withheld liability accrue at 8.0% per
      annum. The aggregate loss ratio for the three-year period exceeded certain
      thresholds which required additional premiums to be paid and an increase in
      the
      rate at which interest charges were accrued.

In
      2001,
      as a result of reserve additions including those related to accident year 1999,
      the remaining $500.0 million limit related to the 1999 accident year under
      the
      first section was fully utilized and losses of $510.0 million were ceded under
      the second section as a result of losses related to the World Trade Center
      event. During 2003, as a result of the unfavorable net prior year development
      recorded related to accident years 2000 and 2001, the $500.0 million limit
      related to the 2000 and 2001 accident years under the first section was fully
      utilized and losses of $500.0 million were ceded under the first section of
      the
      Aggregate Cover.

In
      2001,
      CNA entered into a one-year aggregate reinsurance treaty related to the 2001
      accident year covering substantially all property and casualty lines of business
      in the Continental Casualty Company pool (the “CCC Cover”). The CCC Cover was
      fully utilized in 2003. The loss protection provided by the CCC Cover has an
      aggregate limit of approximately $761.0 million of ceded losses. The ceded
      premiums are a percentage of ceded losses. The ceded premium related to full
      utilization of the $761.0 million of limit is $456.0 million. The CCC Cover
      provides continuous coverage in excess of the second section of the Aggregate
      Cover discussed above. Under the CCC Cover, interest charges on the funds
      withheld are accrued at 8.0% per annum. The interest rate increases to 10.0%
      per
      annum if the aggregate loss ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The aggregate
      loss
      ratio exceeded that threshold in 2004 which required retroactive interest
      charges on funds withheld.

At
      CNA’s
      discretion, the contract can be commuted annually on the anniversary date of
      the
      contract. The CCC Cover requires mandatory commutation on December 31, 2010,
      if
      the agreement has not been commuted on or before such date. Upon mandatory
      commutation of the CCC Cover, the reinsurer is required to release to CNA the
      existing balance of the funds withheld account if the unpaid ultimate ceded
      losses at the time of commutation are less than or equal to the funds withheld
      account balance. If the unpaid ultimate ceded losses at the time of commutation
      are greater than the funds withheld account balance, the reinsurer will release
      the existing balance of the funds withheld account and pay CNA the present
      value
      of the projected amount the reinsurer would have had to pay from its own funds
      absent a commutation. The present value is calculated using 1-year LIBOR as
      of
      the date of the commutation.

      while CCC was a shareholder of Global Crossing. CCC believes it has meritorious
      defenses to this action and intends to defend the case vigorously.

The
      extent of losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued are not readily
      determinable at this time. However, based on facts and circumstances presently
      known in the opinion of management an unfavorable outcome will not materially
      affect the equity of the Company, although results of operations may be
      adversely affected.

IGI
      Contingency

In
      1997,
      CNA Reinsurance Company Limited (“CNA Re Ltd.”) entered into an arrangement with
      IOA Global, Ltd. (“IOA”), an independent managing general agent based in
      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to develop and manage a book of accident and health
      coverages. Pursuant to this arrangement, IGI Underwriting Agencies, Ltd.
      (“IGI”), a personal accident reinsurance managing general underwriter, was
      appointed to underwrite and market the book under the supervision of IOA.
      Between April 1, 1997 and December 1, 1999, IGI underwrote a number of
      reinsurance arrangements with respect to personal accident insurance worldwide
      (the “IGI Program”). Under various arrangements, CNA Re Ltd. both assumed risks
      as a reinsurer and also ceded a substantial portion of those risks to other
      companies, including other CNA insurance subsidiaries and ultimately to a group
      of reinsurers participating in a reinsurance pool known as the Associated
      Accident and Health Reinsurance Underwriters (“AAHRU”) Facility. CNA’s group
      operations business unit participated as a pool member in the AAHRU Facility
      in
      varying percentages between 1997 and 1999.

A
      portion
      of the premiums assumed under the IGI Program related to United States workers
      compensation “carve-out” business. Some of these premiums were received from
      John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (“John Hancock”) under four excess of
      loss reinsurance treaties (the “Treaties”) issued by CNA Re Ltd. While John
      Hancock has indicated that it is not able to accurately quantify its potential
      exposure to its cedents on business which is retroceded to CNA, John Hancock
      has
      reported in excess of $200.0 million of paid and unpaid losses under these
      Treaties. John Hancock is disputing portions of its assumed obligations
      resulting in these reported losses, and has advised CNA that it is, or has
      been,
      involved in multiple arbitrations with its own cedents, in which proceedings
      John Hancock is seeking to avoid and/or reduce risks that would otherwise
      arguably be ceded to CNA through the Treaties. John Hancock has further informed
      CNA that it has settled several of these disputes, but has not provided CNA
      with
      details of the settlements. To the extent that John Hancock is successful in
      reducing its liabilities in these disputes, that development may have an impact
      on the recoveries it is seeking under the Treaties from CNA.

As
      indicated, CNA arranged substantial reinsurance protection to manage its
      exposures under the IGI Program, including the United States workers
      compensation carve-out business ceded from John Hancock and other reinsurers.
      While certain reinsurers of CNA, including participants in the AAHRU Facility,
      disputed their liabilities under the reinsurance contracts with respect to
      the
      IGI Program, those disputes have been resolved and substantial reinsurance
      coverage exists for those exposures.

In
      addition, CNA has instituted arbitration proceedings against John Hancock in
      which CNA is seeking rescission of the Treaties as well as access to and the
      right to inspect the books and records relating to the Treaties. Discovery
      is
      ongoing in that arbitration proceeding and a hearing is currently scheduled
      for
      April of 2007. Based on information known at this time, CNA believes it has
      strong grounds to successfully challenge its alleged exposure derived from
      John
      Hancock through the ongoing arbitration proceedings. CNA has also undertaken
      legal action seeking to avoid portions of the remaining exposure arising out
      of
      the IGI Program.

CNA
      has
      established reserves for its estimated exposure under the IGI Program, other
      than that derived from John Hancock, and an estimate for recoverables from
      retrocessionaires. CNA has not established any reserve for any exposure derived
      from John Hancock because, as indicated, CNA believes the contract will be
      rescinded. Although the results of CNA’s various loss mitigation strategies with
      respect to the entire IGI Program to date support the recorded reserves, the
      estimate of ultimate losses is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the
      complexities described above, and CNA’s inability to guarantee any outcome in
      the arbitration proceedings. As a result of these uncertainties, the results
      of
      operations in future periods may be adversely affected by potentially
      significant reserve additions. However, the extent of losses beyond any amounts
      that may be accrued are not readily determinable at this time. Management does
      not believe that any such reserve additions would be material to the equity
      of
      the

      Civil
      Action: 06-166, District Court of New Jersey (Trenton Division) is a purported
      class action and representative action brought on behalf of present and former
      CNA environmental claims analysts and workers’ compensation claims analysts
      asserting they worked hours for which they should have been compensated at
      a
      rate of one and one-half times their base hourly wage. The Complaint was filed
      on January 12, 2006. The claims are brought under both federal and New Jersey
      state wage and hour laws on the basis that the relevant jobs are not exempt
      from
      overtime pay because the duties performed are not exempt duties. Under federal
      law and New Jersey state law, plaintiff seeks to represent others similarly
      situated who opt in to the action and who also allege they are owed overtime
      pay
      for hours worked over eight hours per day and/or forty hours per workweek for
      the period January 5, 2003 to the entry of judgment. Plaintiff seeks “overtime
      compensation,” “compensatory, punitive and statutory damages, interest, costs
      and disbursements and attorneys’ fees” without specifying any particular amounts
      (as well as an injunction). Under New Jersey law, plaintiff seeks to represent
      an “opt out” class of employees and former employees holding the analysts jobs
      described above (a class alleged to be at least 300 individuals). CNA denies
      the
      material allegations of the Complaint and intends to vigorously contest the
      claims on numerous substantive and procedural grounds.

Voluntary
      Market Premium Litigation

CNA,
      along with dozens of other insurance companies, is currently a defendant in
      nine
      cases, including eight purported class actions, brought by large policyholders.
      The complaints differ in some respects, but generally allege that the
      defendants, as part of an industry-wide conspiracy, included improper charges
      in
      their retrospectively rated and other loss-sensitive insurance programs. Among
      the claims asserted are violations of state antitrust laws, breach of contract,
      fraud and unjust enrichment. CNA has denied the material allegations made in
      these cases and, based on facts and circumstances presently known, in the
      opinion of management the resolution of the cases will not materially affect
      the
      equity of the Company, although results of operations may be adversely
      affected.

Tobacco
      Related Product Liability Litigation

Approximately
      4,000 product liability cases are pending against cigarette manufacturers in
      the
      United States. Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 3,675 of these
      cases.

(Continued)

The
      pending product liability cases are composed of the following types of
      cases:

“Conventional
      product liability cases” are brought by individuals who allege cancer or other
      health effects caused by smoking cigarettes, by using smokeless tobacco
      products, by addiction to tobacco, or by exposure to environmental tobacco
      smoke. Approximately 1,300 cases are pending, including approximately 1,025
      cases against Lorillard. The 1,300 cases include approximately 975 cases pending
      in a single West Virginia court that have been consolidated for trial. Lorillard
      is a defendant in approximately 885 of the approximately 975 consolidated West
      Virginia cases.

“Flight
      Attendant cases” are brought by non-smoking flight attendants alleging injury
      from exposure to environmental smoke in the cabins of aircraft. Plaintiffs
      in
      these cases may not seek punitive damages for injuries that arose prior to
      January 15, 1997. Lorillard is a defendant in each of the approximately 2,625
      pending Flight Attendant cases.

“Class
      action cases” are purported to be brought on behalf of large numbers of
      individuals for damages allegedly caused by smoking. Eleven of these cases
      are
      pending against Lorillard. One of these cases,

Schwab v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
      is on
      behalf of a purported nationwide class composed of purchasers of “light”
cigarettes. Lorillard is not a defendant in approximately 35 additional “lights”
class actions that are pending against other cigarette
      manufacturers.

“Reimbursement
      cases” are brought by or on behalf of entities who seek reimbursement of
      expenses incurred in providing health care to individuals who allegedly were
      injured by smoking. Plaintiffs in these cases have included the U.S. federal
      government, U.S. state and local governments, foreign governmental entities,
      hospitals or hospital districts, American Indian tribes, labor unions, private
      companies and private citizens. Lorillard is a defendant in six of the seven
      Reimbursement cases pending against cigarette manufacturers in the United
      States. The Company is a defendant in two of the cases. Lorillard is a defendant
      in an additional case pending in Israel.

Included
      in this category is the suit filed by the federal government,

United States of America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
      that
      sought disgorgement and injunctive relief. During 2005, an appellate court
      ruled
      that the government may not seek disgorgement of profits. The U.S. Supreme
      Court
      denied the government’s application seeking review of this decision, although
      plaintiff could again seek appellate review of this issue following a verdict.
      A
      bench trial of this matter began during September of 2004. All evidence has
      been
      submitted and the parties made their final post-trial submissions during the
      fourth quarter of 2005. The court could issue its verdict at any time. See
      Reimbursement Cases below.

“Contribution
      cases” are brought by private companies, such as asbestos manufacturers or their
      insurers, who are seeking contribution or indemnity for court claims they
      incurred on behalf of individuals injured by their products but who also
      allegedly were injured by smoking cigarettes. One such case is pending against
      Lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers.

Excluding
      the flight attendant and the consolidated West Virginia suits, approximately
      product liability cases are pending against cigarette manufacturers in U.S.
      courts. Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 165 of the 385 cases. The
      Company, which is not a defendant in any of the flight attendant or the
      consolidated West Virginia matters, is a defendant in six of the
      actions.

In
      addition to the above, “Filter cases” are brought by smokers as well as former
      employees of Lorillard who seek damages resulting from alleged exposure to
      asbestos fibers that were incorporated into filter material used in one brand
      of
      cigarettes manufactured by Lorillard for a limited period of time ending almost
      50 years ago. Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 30 such
      cases.

Plaintiffs
      assert a broad range of legal theories in these cases, including, among others,
      theories of negligence, fraud, misrepresentation, strict liability, breach
      of
      warranty, enterprise liability (including claims asserted under the federal
      Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”)), civil
      conspiracy, intentional infliction of harm, violation of consumer protection
      statutes, violation of antitrust statutes, injunctive relief, indemnity,
      restitution, unjust enrichment, public nuisance, claims based on antitrust
      laws
      and state consumer protection acts, and claims based on failure to warn of
      the
      harmful or addictive nature of tobacco products.

Plaintiffs
      in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and
      punitive damages, although some seek damages ranging into the billions of
      dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages, statutory damages,
      disgorgement of profits, equitable and injunctive relief, and medical
      monitoring, among other damages.

CONVENTIONAL
      PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES - Approximately 1,300 cases are pending against
      cigarette manufacturers in the United States. Lorillard is a defendant in
      approximately 1,025 of these cases. The Company is a defendant in two of the
      pending cases.

Approximately
      975 of the 1,300 cases are pending in a single West Virginia court in a
      consolidated proceeding known as

West
      Virginia Individual Personal Injury Cases

or
“

IPIC

”.
      Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 885 of the 975

IPIC

cases.
      The Company is not a defendant in any of the

IPIC

cases.
      The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia has permitted the trial court
      to
      consider a consolidated trial plan for the

IPIC

cases,
      but whether the cases are to be consolidated for trial has not been
      determined.

Since
      January 1, 2004, verdicts have been returned in twelve cases. Lorillard was
      not
      a defendant in any of these cases. Defense verdicts were returned in eight
      of
      the twelve trials, while juries found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded
      damages in the four remaining cases. The defendants in each of these four cases
      are pursuing appeals. In rulings addressing cases tried in earlier years, some
      appellate courts have reversed verdicts returned in favor of the plaintiffs
      while other judgments that awarded damages to smokers have been affirmed on
      appeal. Philip Morris has informed the court that it will seek review of this
      case by the U.S. Supreme Court. Lorillard is not a party to

Williams

.
      Manufacturers have exhausted their appeals in six Individual cases in recent
      years and have been required to pay damages to plaintiffs. Punitive damages
      were
      paid to the smokers in two of the six cases. Lorillard was not a party to these
      six matters.

In
      addition to these cases, trial has been held against Lorillard in one case
      in
      which plaintiffs asserted both Conventional Product Liability claims and Filter
      claims, the case of

Gadaleta v. AC&S, Inc., et al.

(Supreme
      Court, New York County, New York). During October of 2004, the jury returned
      a
      verdict in favor of Lorillard, which was the only defendant in the case at
      trial. Plaintiffs did not seek review of the judgment and the matter is
      concluded. Also see Filter Cases below.

Some
      cases against U.S. cigarette manufacturers and manufacturers of smokeless
      tobacco products are scheduled for trial during 2006 and beyond. Lorillard
      is
      not a defendant in any of the cases scheduled for trial through the end of
      the
      first quarter of 2006. The Company is not a defendant in any of the cases
      scheduled for trial. The trial dates are subject to change.

FLIGHT
      ATTENDANT CASES - Approximately 2,625 Flight Attendant cases are pending.
      Lorillard and three other cigarette manufacturers are the defendants in each
      of
      these matters. The Company is not a defendant in any of these cases. These
      suits
      were filed as a result of a settlement agreement by the parties, including
      Lorillard, in

Broin v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc., et al.

(Circuit
      Court, Miami-Dade County, Florida, filed October 31, 1991), a class action
      brought on behalf of flight attendants claiming injury as a result of exposure
      to environmental tobacco smoke. The settlement agreement, among other things,
      permitted the plaintiff class members to file these individual suits. These
      individuals may not seek punitive damages for injuries that arose prior to
      January 15, 1997.

The
      judges that have presided over the cases that have been tried have relied upon
      an order entered during October of 2000 by the Circuit Court of Miami-Dade
      County, Florida. The October 2000 order has been construed by these judges
      as
      holding that the flight attendants are not required to prove the substantive
      liability elements of their claims for negligence, strict liability and breach
      of implied warranty in order to recover damages. The court further ruled that
      the trials of these suits are to address whether the plaintiffs’ alleged
      injuries were caused by their exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and,
      if
      so, the amount of damages to be awarded.

Lorillard
      has been a defendant in each of the seven flight attendant cases in which
      verdicts have been returned. Defendants have prevailed in six of the seven
      trials. In the single trial decided for the plaintiff, the jury awarded $5.5
      million in damages. The court, however, reduced this award to $500,000. This
      verdict, as reduced by the trial court, was affirmed on appeal and the
      defendants have paid the award. Lorillard’s share of the judgment in this
      matter,

including
      interest, was approximately $60,000. In one of the six cases in which a defense
      verdict was returned, the court granted plaintiff’s motion for new trial and,
      following appeal, the case has been returned to the trial court for a second
      trial that has not been scheduled. In another of the cases in which a defense
      verdict was returned, plaintiff has appealed.

No
      flight
      attendant cases are scheduled for trial. Trial dates are subject to
      change.

CLASS
      ACTION CASES - Lorillard is a defendant in eleven pending cases. The Company
      is
      a defendant in two of these cases. In most of the pending cases, plaintiffs
      purport to seek class certification on behalf of groups of cigarette smokers,
      or
      the estates of deceased cigarette smokers, who reside in the state in which
      the
      case was filed. One of the cases in which Lorillard is a defendant,

Schwab v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
      is a
      purported national class action on behalf of purchasers of “light” cigarettes in
      which plaintiffs’ claims are based on defendants’ alleged RICO violations.
      Neither Lorillard nor the Company are defendants in approximately 35 additional
      class action cases in which plaintiffs assert claims on behalf of smokers or
      purchasers of “light” cigarettes.

Cigarette
      manufacturers, including Lorillard, have defeated motions for class
      certification in a total of 35 cases, 13 of which were in state court and 22
      of
      which were in federal court. These 35 cases were filed in 17 states, the
      District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. One of these matters,
      known as

In
      re: Simon II Litigation

,
      was a
      purported nationwide class action on behalf of individuals with punitive damages
      claims against cigarette manufacturers, but this class was decertified by a
      federal court of appeals during 2005. In addition, a Nevada court granted
      motions to deny class certification in 20 separate cases in which the class
      definition asserted by the plaintiffs was identical to those in which the court
      had previously ruled in defendants’ favor. Motions for class certification have
      also been ruled upon in some of the “lights” cases or in other class actions to
      which Lorillard was not a party. In some of these cases, courts have denied
      class certification to the plaintiffs, while classes have been certified in
      other matters.

The

Engle

Case -
      One of the class actions pending against Lorillard is

Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al.

(Circuit
      Court, Miami-Dade County, Florida, filed May 5, 1994).

Engle

was
      certified as a class action on behalf of Florida residents, and survivors of
      Florida residents, who were injured or died from medical conditions allegedly
      caused by addiction to cigarettes. During 2000, a jury awarded approximately
      $16.3 billion in punitive damages against Lorillard as part of a $145.0 billion
      verdict against all of the defendants. The judgment also provided that the
      jury’s awards would bear interest at the rate of 10.0% per year. During May of
      2003, a Florida appellate court reversed the judgment and decertified the class.
      The court also held that the claims for punitive damages asserted by Florida
      smokers were barred as these claims are based on the same misconduct alleged
      in
      the case filed by the State of Florida against cigarette manufacturers,
      including Lorillard, which was concluded by a 1997 settlement agreement and
      judgment (see “Settlement of State Reimbursement Litigation” below). The court
      subsequently denied plaintiffs’ motion for rehearing. Plaintiffs appealed to the
      Florida Supreme Court which heard argument on November 3, 2004. Even if the
      Florida Supreme Court were to rule in favor of the defendants, plaintiffs will
      not have exhausted all of the appellate options available to them as they could
      seek review of the case by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Company and Lorillard
      believe that the Florida appellate court’s decision should be upheld upon
      further appeals.

Florida
      has enacted legislation that limits the amount of an appellate bond required
      to
      be posted in order to stay execution of a judgment for punitive damages in
      a
      certified class action. While Lorillard believes this legislation is valid
      and
      that any challenges to the possible application or constitutionality of this
      legislation would fail, Lorillard entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs
      during May of 2001 in which it contributed $200.0 million to a fund held for
      the
      benefit of the

Engle

plaintiffs (the “

Engle

Agreement”). The $200.0 million contribution included the $100.0 million that
      Lorillard posted as collateral for the appellate bond. Accordingly, Lorillard
      recorded a pretax charge of $200.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2001.
      Two other defendants executed agreements with the plaintiffs that were similar
      to Lorillard’s. As a result, the class agreed to a stay of execution, with
      respect to Lorillard and the two other defendants on its punitive damages
      judgment until appellate review is completed, including any review by the U.S.
      Supreme Court.

The

Engle

Agreement provides that in the event that Lorillard, Inc.’s balance sheet net
      worth falls below $921.2 million (as determined in accordance with generally
      accepted accounting principles in effect as of July 14, 2000), the stay granted
      in favor of Lorillard in the

Engle

Agreement would terminate and the class would be free to

(Continued)

challenge
      the Florida legislation. As of December 31, 2005, Lorillard, Inc. had a balance
      sheet net worth of approximately $1.3 billion. In addition, the

Engle

Agreement requires Lorillard to obtain the written consent of class counsel
      or
      the court prior to selling any trademark of or formula comprising a cigarette
      brand having a U.S. market share of 0.5% or more during the preceding calendar
      year. The

Engle

Agreement also requires Lorillard to obtain the written consent of the Engle
      class counsel or the court to license to a third party the right to manufacture
      or sell such a cigarette brand unless the cigarettes to be manufactured under
      the license will be sold by Lorillard. It is not clear how the

Engle

Agreement is affected by the Florida appellate court’s decertification of the
      class and its order vacating the judgment.

The

Scott

case -
      Another class action pending against Lorillard is

Scott v. The American Tobacco Company, et al.

(District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, filed May 24, 1996). During 1997,
      the court certified a class composed of certain cigarette smokers resident
      in
      the State of Louisiana who desire to participate in medical monitoring or
      smoking cessation programs and who began smoking prior to September 1, 1988,
      or
      who began smoking prior to May 24, 1996 and allege that defendants undermined
      compliance with the warnings on cigarette packages.

Trial
      in

Scott

was
      heard in two phases. While the jury in its July 2003 Phase I verdict rejected
      medical monitoring, the primary relief requested by plaintiffs, it returned
      sufficient findings in favor of the class to proceed to a Phase II trial on
      plaintiffs’ request for a state-wide smoking cessation program.

During
      May of 2004, the jury returned its verdict in the trial’s second phase and
      awarded approximately $591.0 million to fund cessation programs for Louisiana
      smokers. The court’s final judgment, entered during June of 2004, reflects the
      jury’s award of damages and also awarded judicial interest. The judicial
      interest award will continue to accrue until the judgment is paid or is vacated
      on appeal. As of February 15, 2006 judicial interest totaled an additional
      amount of approximately $395.0 million. Lorillard’s share of the judgment and
      the judicial interest has not been determined. Lorillard and the other
      defendants have initiated an appeal from the judgment to the Louisiana Court
      of
      Appeals. Oral argument in that matter has been scheduled for April 12, 2006.
      The
      parties filed a stipulation in the trial court agreeing that an article of
      the
      Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure, and a Louisiana statute governing the amount
      of appellate bonds in civil cases involving a signatory to the Master Settlement
      Agreement, required that the amount of the bond for the appeal be set at $50.0
      million for all defendants collectively. The parties further agreed that the
      plaintiffs have full reservations of rights to contest in the trial court,
      at a
      later date, the sufficiency or amount of the bond on any grounds. The trial
      court entered an order setting the amount of the bond at $50.0 million for
      all
      defendants. Defendants collectively posted a surety bond in that amount, of
      which Lorillard secured 25%, or $12.5 million. While Lorillard believes the
      limitation on the appeal bond amount is valid as required by Louisiana law,
      and
      that any challenges to the amount of the bond would fail, in the event of a
      successful challenge the amount of the appeal bond could be set as high as
      150%
      of the judgment and judicial interest combined. If such an event occurred,
      Lorillard’s share of the appeal bond has not been determined.

Other
      class action cases - Two additional cases are pending against Lorillard in
      which
      motions for class certification were granted. In one of them,

Brown
      v. The American Tobacco Company, Inc., et al.

(Superior Court, San Diego County, California, filed June 10, 1997), a
      California court granted defendants’ motion to decertify the class it had
      previously ordered. Plaintiffs are pursuing an appeal of this decertification
      ruling. The class originally certified in

Brown

was
      composed of residents of California who smoked at least one of defendants’
cigarettes between June 10, 1993 and April 23, 2001 and who were exposed to
      defendants’ marketing and advertising activities in California. In the second
      case,

Daniels
      v. Philip Morris, Incorporated, et al.

(Superior Court, San Diego County, California, filed August 2, 1998), the court
      granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment during 2002 and dismissed the
      case. Plaintiffs appealed, but the California Court of Appeal affirmed the
      dismissal during 2004. Plaintiffs are now pursuing an appeal to the California
      Supreme Court. Prior to granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the
      court had certified a class composed of California residents who, while minors,
      smoked at least one cigarette between April of 1994 and December 31, 1999 and
      were exposed to defendants’ marketing and advertising activities in California.
      It is possible that either or both of these class certification rulings could
      be
      reinstated as a result of the pending appeals.

As
      discussed above, other cigarette manufacturers are defendants in approximately
      35 cases in which plaintiffs’ claims are based on the allegedly fraudulent
      marketing of “lights” or “ultra-lights” cigarettes. One of these is the case
      of

Price v. Philip Morris USA

(Circuit
      Court, Madison County, Illinois, filed February 10, 2000) in which the court
      returned a verdict in favor of the class during March of 2003 and awarded it
      $7.1 billion in actual damages.

The
      court
      also awarded $3.0 billion in punitive damages to the State of Illinois, which
      was not a party to the suit, and awarded plaintiffs’ counsel approximately $1.8
      billion in fees and costs. Following trial, the Illinois Supreme Court permitted
      Philip Morris to post a reduced bond, and it assumed immediate jurisdiction
      of
      Philip Morris’ appeal. During December of 2005, the Illinois Supreme Court
      vacated the damages awards, decertified the class, and ordered that the case
      be
      dismissed. Plaintiffs have moved for reconsideration of this ruling.

Price

is the
      only “lights” class action to have been tried, although classes have been
      certified in some of the other pending matters. Lorillard is a defendant in
      one
“lights” class action,

Schwab v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

(U.S.
      District Court, Eastern District, New York), a purported national class action
      in which plaintiffs’ claims are based on defendants’ alleged RICO violations.
      The court heard plaintiffs’ motion for class certification during September of
      2005 but it has permitted plaintiffs to submit additional evidence and has
      not
      issued a ruling.

REIMBURSEMENT
      CASES - Although the cases settled by the State Settlement Agreements, as
      described below, are concluded, certain matters are pending against cigarette
      manufacturers. The pending cases include Reimbursement cases on file in U.S.
      courts, a Reimbursement case on file in Israel, and cases challenging the State
      Settlement Agreements. Lorillard is a defendant in six pending Reimbursement
      cases in the U.S. and has been named as a party to the case in Israel. The
      Company is a defendant in two of the Reimbursement cases in the U.S. The six
      pending cases are brought by two foreign governments; a city government and
      a
      group of hospitals; a group of taxpayers; an Indian tribe; and the U.S. federal
      government.

U.S.
      Federal Government Action - A verdict could be issued at any time in the U.S.
      federal government’s reimbursement and racketeering suit (

United
      States of America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
      U.S.
      District Court, District of Columbia, filed September 22, 1999). Lorillard,
      other cigarette manufacturers, two parent companies and two trade associations
      are defendants in the case. The Company is not a party to this action. At the
      time trial began during September of 2004, the government sought approximately
      $280.0 billion in disgorgement of profits from the defendants, including
      Lorillard, as well as injunctive relief. During 2005, a federal court of appeals
      ruled that the government is not permitted to recover disgorgement of profits.
      The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review this decision, although plaintiff
      could again seek appellate review of this issue following the entry of a
      verdict. The trial has concluded and the parties filed their final post-trial
      submissions during the fourth quarter of 2005. The court has not announced
      when
      it will issue its verdict.

In
      another of the cases, a private insurer in Israel, Clalit Health Services,
      seeks
      damages for providing treatment to individuals allegedly injured by cigarette
      smoking in Israel (

Clalit
      Health Services v. Philip Morris, Inc., et al.

,
      District Court of Jerusalem, Israel). The Company was dismissed from this suit
      during 2005, although the time for plaintiff to appeal this order has not
      expired. The case remains pending against Lorillard, other cigarette
      manufacturers, and other defendants.

SETTLEMENT
      OF STATE REIMBURSEMENT LITIGATION - On November 23, 1998, Lorillard, Philip
      Morris Incorporated, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J.
      Reynolds Tobacco Company, the “Original Participating Manufacturers,” entered
      into a Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”) with 46 states, the District of
      Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands,
      American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to settle
      the asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and certain other claims
      of those states. These settling entities are generally referred to as the
“Settling States.” The Original Participating Manufacturers had previously
      settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota,
      which together with the Master Settlement Agreement are generally referred
      to as
      the “State Settlement Agreements.”

The
      State
      Settlement Agreements provide that the agreements are not admissions,
      concessions or evidence of any liability or wrongdoing on the part of any party,
      and were entered into by the Original Participating Manufacturers to avoid
      the
      further expense, inconvenience, burden and uncertainty of
      litigation.

Lorillard
      recorded pretax charges of $876.4 million, $845.9 million and $785.2 million
      ($537.7 million, $522.6 million and $489.5 million after taxes) for the years
      ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, to accrue its obligations
      under the State Settlement Agreements. Lorillard’s portion of ongoing adjusted
      payments and legal fees is based on its share of domestic cigarette shipments
      in
      the year preceding that in which the payment is due. Accordingly, Lorillard
      records its portions of ongoing settlement payments as part of cost of
      manufactured products sold as the related sales occur.

(Continued)

The
      State
      Settlement Agreements require that the domestic tobacco industry make annual
      payments in the following amounts, subject to adjustment for several factors,
      including inflation, market share and industry volume: $8.4 billion through
      and $9.4 billion thereafter. In addition, the domestic tobacco industry is
      required to pay settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, subject to an annual cap
      of $500.0 million, as well as an additional amount of up to $125.0 million
      in
      each year through 2008. These payment obligations are the several and not joint
      obligations of each settling defendant.

The
      State
      Settlement Agreements also include provisions relating to significant
      advertising and marketing restrictions, public disclosure of certain industry
      documents, limitations on challenges to tobacco control and underage use laws,
      and other provisions. Lorillard and the other Original Participating
      Manufacturers have notified the States that they intend to seek an adjustment
      in
      the amount of payments made in 2003 pursuant to a provision in the MSA that
      permits such adjustment if the companies can prove that the MSA was a
      significant factor in their loss of market share to companies not participating
      in the MSA and that the States failed to diligently enforce certain statutes
      passed in connection with the MSA. If the Original Participating Manufacturers
      are ultimately successful, any adjustment would be reflected as a credit against
      future payments by the Original Participating Manufacturers under the
      agreement.

From
      time
      to time, lawsuits have been brought against Lorillard and other participating
      manufacturers to the MSA, or against one or more of the states, challenging
      the
      validity of that agreement on certain grounds, including as a violation of
      the
      antitrust laws. Lorillard is a defendant in one such case, which has been
      dismissed by the trial court but has been appealed by the plaintiffs. Lorillard
      understands that additional such cases are proceeding against other
      defendants.

In
      addition, in connection with the MSA, the Original Participating Manufacturers
      entered into an agreement to establish a $5.2 billion trust fund payable between
      1999 and 2010 to compensate the tobacco growing communities in 14 states (the
      “Trust”). Payments to the Trust will no longer be required as a result of an
      assessment imposed under a new federal law repealing the federal supply
      management program for tobacco growers, although the states of Maryland and
      Pennsylvania are contending that payments under the Trust should continue to
      growers in those states since the new federal law did not cover them, and the
      matter is being litigated. In 2005 other litigation was resolved over the
      Trust’s obligation to return payments made by the Original Participating
      Manufacturers in 2004 or withheld from payment to the Trust for the fourth
      quarter of 2004, when the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that such payments
      were due to the Trust. Lorillard’s share of payments into the Trust in 2004 was
      approximately $30.0 million and its share of the payment due for the last
      quarter of that year was approximately $10.0 million. Under the new law, enacted
      in October of 2004, tobacco quota holders and growers will be compensated with
      payments totaling $10.1 billion, funded by an assessment on tobacco
      manufacturers and importers. Payments to qualifying tobacco quota holders and
      growers commenced in 2005.

The
      Company believes that the State Settlement Agreements will materially adversely
      affect its cash flows and operating income in future years. The degree of the
      adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rates of decline in
      U.S.
      cigarette sales in the premium price and discount price segments, Lorillard’s
      share of the domestic premium price and discount price cigarette segments,
      and
      the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to
      significant payment obligations under the State Settlement
      Agreements.

CONTRIBUTION
      CLAIMS - Plaintiffs seek recovery of funds paid by them to individuals whose
      asbestos disease or illness was alleged to have been caused in whole or in
      part
      by smoking-related illnesses. One such case is pending against Lorillard and
      other cigarette manufacturers. The Company is not a defendant in this
      matter.

FILTER
      CASES - In addition to the above, claims have been brought against Lorillard
      by
      smokers as well as former employees of Lorillard seeking damages resulting
      from
      alleged exposure to asbestos fibers that were incorporated into filter material
      used in one brand of cigarettes manufactured by Lorillard for a limited period
      of time ending almost 50 years ago. Approximately 30 such matters are pending
      against Lorillard. The Company is not a defendant in any of these matters.
      Since
      January 1, 2004, Lorillard has paid, or has reached agreement to pay, a total
      of
      approximately $17.1 million in payments of judgments and settlements to finally
      resolve approximately 60 claims. In the only case with Filter claims to have
      been tried since January 1, 2004,

Gadaleta
      v. AC&S, Inc., et al.

(Supreme
      Court of New York, New York County) the jury returned a verdict in favor of
      Lorillard. Plaintiff did not appeal and

      RELATED ANTITRUST CASES - Indirect Purchaser Suits - Approximately 30 antitrust
      suits were filed on behalf of putative classes of consumers in various state
      courts against Lorillard and its major competitors. The suits allege that the
      defendants entered into agreements to fix the wholesale prices of cigarettes
      in
      violation of state antitrust laws which permit indirect purchasers, such as
      retailers and consumers, to sue under price fixing or consumer fraud statutes.
      Approximately 20 states permit such suits. Lorillard was a defendant in all
      but
      one of these indirect purchaser cases. The Company was also named as a defendant
      in most of these indirect purchaser cases but has been voluntarily dismissed
      without prejudice from all of them. Three indirect purchaser suits in New York,
      Florida and Michigan, were dismissed by courts in their entirety and plaintiffs
      have withdrawn their appeals, and the other actions in all states except for
      New
      Mexico and Kansas have been voluntarily dismissed. A decision granting class
      certification in New Mexico was affirmed by the New Mexico Court of Appeals
      on
      February 8, 2005. The defendants, including Lorillard, have filed motions for
      summary judgment and a response is to be served on or before February 20, 2006.
      As ordered by the Court, class notice was sent out by October 30, 2005. The
      New
      Mexico plaintiffs have been permitted to rely on discovery produced in the
      Kansas case. In the Kansas case, the District Court of Seward County certified
      a
      class of purchasers in Kansas in 2002. Discovery is proceeding in the Kansas
      case, and the parties are in the process of litigating certain privilege issues
      with no date having yet been set by the Court for dispositive motions and trial.
      Defendants filed a motion to enter a new case management order on January 18,
      2006, requesting that the court confirm that fact discovery is closed, set
      a
      schedule for expert discovery, and set a schedule for summary judgment
      motions.

Tobacco
      Growers Suit -

DeLoach v. Philip Morris Inc., et al.

(U.S.
      District Court, Middle District of North Carolina, filed February 16, 2000).
      On
      October 1, 2003, the Court approved a settlement by Lorillard with a class
      consisting of all persons holding a quota (the licenses that a farmer must
      either own or rent to sell the crop) to grow, and all domestic producers who
      sold flue-cured or burley tobacco at anytime from February 1996 to present.
      In
      addition to payments previously made, Lorillard committed to buy 20 million
      pounds of domestic tobacco for each crop year through 2012. Pursuant to the
      terms of the settlement agreement, that obligation was subsequently extended
      until crop year 2014 as a result of the enactment of the Fair and Equitable
      Tobacco Reform Act of 2004.

Lorillard
      has also committed to purchase at least 35% of its annual total requirements
      for
      flue-cured and burley tobacco domestically for the same period. The other major
      domestic tobacco companies and the major leaf buyers were also defendants,
      and
      all of the defendants with the exception of R.J. Reynolds were parties to the
      settlement agreement entered on October 1, 2003. R.J. Reynolds subsequently
      entered into a settlement agreement with the class and that agreement was
      approved by the Court. Lorillard contended that the R.J. Reynolds settlement
      agreement triggered a clause in Lorillard’s settlement agreement that would
      substantially reduce Lorillard’s commitments to buy domestic tobacco. After
      Lorillard prevailed on an appeal related to the claimed reduction, the trial
      court ruled that the leaf commitment will be reduced for Lorillard by
      approximately 60%, effective in 2006.

MSA
      Federal Antitrust Suit -

Sanders v. Lockyer, et al.

(U.S.
      District Court, Northern District of California, filed June 9, 2004). Lorillard
      and the other major cigarette manufacturers, along with the Attorney General
      of
      the State of California, have been sued by a consumer purchaser of cigarettes
      in
      a putative class action alleging violations of the Sherman Act and California
      state antitrust and unfair competition laws. The plaintiff seeks treble damages
      of an unstated amount for the putative class as well as declaratory and
      injunctive relief. All claims are based on the assertion that the Master
      Settlement Agreement that Lorillard and the other cigarette manufacturer
      defendants entered into with the State of California and more than forty other
      states, together with certain implementing legislation enacted by California,
      constitute unlawful restraints of trade. On March 28, 2005 the defendants’
motion to dismiss the suit was granted. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to
      the
      Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Briefing on the appeal was completed
      in
      December 2005, and no date has as yet been set for argument on the
      appeal.

Vending
      Machine Operators Antitrust Suit -

Genesee Vending, Inc., et al. v. Lorillard Tobacco Co.

(U.S.
      District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, filed May 14, 2004). More than
      cigarette vending machine operators instituted a suit against Lorillard
      individually and on behalf of a putative class of all domestic cigarette vending
      machine operators, claiming that Lorillard has violated the federal
      Robinson-Patman Act by allegedly discriminating

against
      them in price and with respect to advertising and promotional payments and
      services provided in connection with the sale of cigarettes to competing
      convenience stores, gasoline stations, mini-marts, kiosks and discount stores.
      Plaintiffs seek treble damages and injunctive relief. On November 2, 2004,
      the
      Court granted Lorillard’s motion to dismiss the action. Plaintiffs then filed a
      first amended complaint on December 10, 2004. Lorillard also moved to dismiss
      this Complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.
      The
      Court denied that motion on April 6, 2005. Lorillard filed an answer to the
      complaint on May 4, 2005. The Court heard argument on plaintiffs’ motion to
      certify the class on October 18, 2005. The suit was settled on December 6,
      2005,
      for a payment by Lorillard of $210,000, without admission of liability.
      Lorillard was provided a release on behalf of all plaintiffs with respect to
      all
      claims raised, or which could have been raised, in the suit.

REPARATION
      CASES - During 2002, the Company was named as a defendant in three cases in
      which plaintiffs seek reparations for the alleged financial benefits derived
      from the uncompensated use of slave labor. These three cases were transferred
      to
      the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and consolidated
      into a multi-district litigation proceeding. The Company was named as a
      defendant in these matters as a result of conduct purportedly engaged in by
      predecessors to Lorillard and various other entities. Plaintiffs in these suits
      sought various types of damages including disgorgement of profits, restitution
      and punitive damages. Plaintiffs were alleging class certification on behalf
      of
      the descendants of enslaved African Americans. During July of 2005, the Northern
      District of Illinois granted with prejudice the defendants’ motion to dismiss
      the cases. Plaintiffs have appealed.

Defenses

Lorillard
      believes that it has valid defenses to the cases pending against it. Lorillard
      also believes it has valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against
      it.
      To the extent the Company is a defendant in any of the lawsuits described in
      this section, the Company believes that it is not a proper defendant in these
      matters and has moved or plans to move for dismissal of all such claims against
      it. While Lorillard intends to defend vigorously all tobacco products liability
      litigation, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation.
      Litigation is subject to many uncertainties. Plaintiffs have prevailed in
      several cases, as noted above. It is possible that one or more of the pending
      actions could be decided unfavorably as to Lorillard or the other defendants.
      Lorillard may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases
      if
      it believes it is appropriate to do so.

Lorillard
      cannot predict the outcome of pending litigation. Jury awards in the billions
      of
      dollars have been returned against cigarette manufacturers in recent years.
      In
      addition, health issues related to tobacco products continue to receive media
      attention. These events could have an adverse affect on the ability of Lorillard
      to prevail in smoking and health litigation. Lorillard also cannot predict
      the
      type or extent of litigation that could be brought against it and other
      cigarette manufacturers in the future.

Except
      for the impact of the State Settlement Agreements as described above, management
      is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that
      could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation and, therefore,
      no provision has been made in the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
      for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible that the Company’s results of
      operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period or its
      financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable
      outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation.

OTHER
      LITIGATION

The
      Company and its subsidiaries are also parties to other litigation arising in
      the
      ordinary course of business. The outcome of this other litigation will not,
      in
      the opinion of management, materially affect the Company’s results of operations
      or equity.

Commitments
                and Contingencies

Guarantees

CNA
      holds
      an investment in a real estate joint venture. In the normal course of business,
      CNA, on a joint and several basis with other unrelated insurance company
      shareholders, has committed to continue funding the operating deficits of this
      joint venture. In addition, CNA and the other unrelated shareholders, on a
      joint
      and several basis, have guaranteed an operating lease for an office building,
      which expires in 2016.

The
      guarantee of the operating lease is a parallel guarantee to the commitment
      to
      fund operating deficits; consequently, the separate guarantee to the lessor
      is
      not expected to be triggered as long as the joint venture continues to be funded
      by its shareholders and continues to make its annual lease
      payments.

In
      the
      event that the other parties to the joint venture are unable to meet their
      commitments in funding the operations of this joint venture, CNA would be
      required to assume the obligation for the entire office building operating
      lease. The maximum potential future lease payments at December 31, 2005 that
      CNA
      could be required to pay under this guarantee are approximately $236.0 million.
      If CNA were required to assume the entire lease obligation, CNA would have
      the
      right to pursue reimbursement from the other shareholders and would have the
      right to all sublease revenues.

In
      the
      course of selling business entities and assets to third parties, CNA has agreed
      to indemnify purchasers for losses arising out of breaches of representation
      and
      warranties with respect to the business entities or assets being sold,
      including, in certain cases, losses arising from undisclosed liabilities or
      certain named litigation. Such indemnification provisions generally survive
      for
      periods ranging from nine months following the applicable closing date to the
      expiration of the relevant statutes of limitation. As of December 31, 2005,
      the
      aggregate amount of quantifiable indemnification agreements in effect for sales
      of business entities, assets and third party loans was $938.0
      million.

In
      addition, CNA has agreed to provide indemnification to third party purchasers
      for certain losses associated with sold business entities or assets that are
      not
      limited by a contractual monetary amount. As of December 31, 2005, CNA had
      outstanding unlimited indemnifications in connection with the sales of certain
      of its business entities or assets that included tax liabilities arising prior
      to a purchaser’s ownership of an entity or asset, defects in title at the time
      of sale, employee claims arising prior to closing and in some cases losses
      arising from certain litigation and undisclosed liabilities. These
      indemnification agreements survive until the applicable statutes of limitation
      expire, or until the agreed upon contract terms expire. As of December 31,
      2005,
      CNA has recorded approximately $65.0 million of liabilities related to these
      indemnification agreements.

In
      connection with the issuance of preferred securities by CNA Surety Capital
      Trust
      I, CNA Surety, a 63% owned and consolidated subsidiary of CNA, issued a
      guarantee of $75.0 million to guarantee the payment by CNA Surety Capital Trust
      I of annual dividends of $1.5 million over 30 years and redemption of $30.0
      million of preferred securities. See Note 12 for further description of
      debentures issued by CNA Surety, which are the sole assets of CNA Surety Capital
      Trust I.

CNA
      Surety

CNA
      Surety has provided significant surety bond protection for a large national
      contractor that undertakes projects for the construction of government and
      private facilities, a substantial portion of which have been reinsured by CCC.
      In order to help this contractor meet its liquidity needs and complete projects
      which had been bonded by CNA Surety, commencing in 2003 CNA provided loans
      to
      the contractor through a credit facility, up to an amended aggregate maximum
      of
      $126.0 million. The credit facility expires in March 2009 and the current
      interest rate is 5.0% per annum. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004,
      there was $124.0 million and $95.0 million of loans outstanding under the credit
      facility, and $8.0 million and $4.0 million of deferred or accrued and unpaid
      interest. The Company, through a participation agreement with CNA, has funded
      and owns a participation of $40.0 million and $29.0 million of the outstanding
      advances as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.

Loans
      under the credit facility are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the
      assets of the contractor and certain of its affiliates. In connection with
      the
      credit facility, CNA has also guaranteed or provided collateral for letters
      of
      credit which are charged against the maximum available line and, if drawn upon,
      would be treated as loans under the credit facility. As of December 31, 2005
      and
      December 31, 2004, these guarantees and collateral obligations aggregated $13.0
      million.

In
      the contractor implemented a restructuring plan intended to reduce costs and
      improve cash flow, resulting in the contractor substantially reducing the scope
      of its original business and concentrating on those segments determined to
      be
      potentially profitable. As a consequence, operating cash flow, and in turn
      the
      capacity to service debt, have been reduced below previous levels. In light
      of
      these developments, the Company recorded a pretax impairment charge of $80.5
      million in the fourth quarter of 2004 with respect to amounts loaned under
      the
      facility, and an additional pretax impairment charge of $20.0 million during
      the
      first quarter of 2005. In June of 2005, ongoing monitoring of the status of
      the
      contractor’s restructuring plan revealed deterioration in operations and cash
      flow. As a result, CNA determined that the contractor would likely be unable
      to
      meet its obligations under the surety bonds. Accordingly, in the second quarter
      of 2005, CNA Surety established $40.0 million of initial surety loss reserves
      in
      anticipation of future loss payments related to the national contractor and
      CNA
      determined not to provide additional liquidity to the contractor. Accordingly,
      during the second quarter of 2005 the Company took a pretax impairment charge
      of
      $27.0 million to write-off the remaining balance of the loan.

CNA
      Surety completed its evaluation of the contractor’s restructuring efforts and in
      the fourth quarter of 2005 established additional loss reserves of $70.0
      million, $50.0 million of which was ceded to CCC under the reinsurance
      agreements discussed below. This increased CNA’s estimate of the ultimate surety
      loss to $110.0 million. Possible changes to the restructuring strategy could
      result in higher loss estimates and trigger additional reserve actions. If
      any
      such reserve additions were taken, CCC would have all further surety bond
      exposure through the reinsurance arrangements discussed below. As of December
      31, 2005, CNA Surety has paid approximately $26.0 million to settle outstanding
      bonded obligations of the contractor.

CNA
      Surety intends to continue to provide surety bonds on a limited basis on behalf
      of the contractor to support its revised restructuring plan, subject to the
      contractor’s compliance with CNA Surety’s underwriting standards and ongoing
      management of CNA Surety’s exposure in relation to the contractor. All surety
      bonds written for the contractor are issued by CCC and its affiliates, other
      than CNA Surety, and are subject to underlying reinsurance treaties pursuant
      to
      which all bonds written on behalf of CNA Surety are 100% reinsured to one of
      CNA
      Surety’s insurance subsidiaries.

During
      the second quarter of 2005, CCC and CNA Surety executed amendments to existing
      treaties that provide reinsurance protection to CNA Surety for losses associated
      with the contractor. Coverage for all such losses in excess of an aggregate
      $60.0 million is now provided under one treaty. This treaty provides coverage
      for the life of bonds either in force or written during the term of the treaty,
      which runs from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005. CCC and CNA Surety agreed
      by addendum to extend this contract for twelve months, expiring on December
      31,
      2006.

CCC
      and
      CNA Surety continue to engage in periodic discussions with insurance regulatory
      authorities regarding the level of surety bonds provided for this contractor
      and
      will continue to apprise those authorities of the status of their ongoing
      exposure to this account.

Indemnification
      and subrogation rights, including rights to contract proceeds on construction
      projects in the event of default, exist that reduce CNA Surety’s and ultimately
      the Company’s exposure to loss. While CNA believes that the contractor’s
      continuing restructuring efforts may be successful, the contractor’s failure to
      ultimately achieve its extended restructuring plan or perform its contractual
      obligations under the credit facility or under CNA’s surety bonds could have a
      material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and/or equity. If
      such failures occur, CNA estimates the additional surety loss, net of
      indemnification and subrogation recoveries, but before the effects of minority
      interest, to be approximately $90.0 million pretax.

CCC
      provided an excess of loss reinsurance contract to the insurance subsidiaries
      of
      CNA Surety over a period that expired on December 31, 2000 (the “stop loss
      contract”). The stop loss contract limits the net loss ratios for CNA Surety
      with respect to certain accounts and lines of insurance business. In the event
      that CNA Surety’s

-

(Continued)

accident
      year net loss ratio exceeds 24.0% for 1997 through 2000 (the “contractual loss
      ratio”), the stop loss contract requires CCC to pay amounts equal to the amount,
      if any, by which CNA Surety’s actual accident year net loss ratio exceeds the
      contractual loss ratio multiplied by the applicable net earned premiums. The
      minority shareholders of CNA Surety do not share in any losses that apply to
      this contract. There were no reinsurance balances payable under this stop loss
      contract as of December 31, 2005.

Purchase
      Obligations

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, Diamond Offshore had purchase obligations aggregating
      approximately $411.0 million related to the major upgrade of the

Ocean
      Endeavor

and the
      construction of two new jack-up rigs, the

Ocean
      Scepter

and

Ocean
      Shield

.

Regulatory
      and Rate Matters

Boardwalk
      Pipeline’s natural gas pipeline operations are regulated by FERC whose
      regulatory policies govern the rates that each pipeline is permitted to charge
      customers for interstate transportation and storage of natural gas. From time
      to
      time, certain revenues collected may be subject to possible refunds upon final
      FERC orders. Accordingly, estimates of rate refund reserves are recorded
      considering regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and estimated
      risk-adjusted total exposure, as well as other risks. Texas Gas filed a general
      rate case with FERC on April 29, 2005 and implemented new rates on November
      1,
      2005, subject to refund. No assurances can be provided as to the financial
      outcome of Texas Gas’s 2005 rate case relative to its current rate structure. As
      of December 31, 2005, an estimated refund liability of approximately $5.0
      million related to Texas Gas’s open general rate case was recorded on the
      Consolidated Balance Sheet. Texas Gas anticipates that the general rate case
      will be settled, and all required refunds paid, during 2006.

Pipeline
      Expansion Projects

In February of 2006, Gulf South entered into long-term agreements with customers
        providing commitments for capacity on its 1.0 Bcf per day pipeline expansion
        projects in East Texas and Mississippi. Boardwalk Pipeline expects total
        cost
        for the 1.0 Bcf expansion to be approximately $575.0 million, and expects
        the
        new capacity to be in-service during the second half of 2007. These projects
        are
        subject to FERC approvals.

Other

In
      the
      normal course of business, CNA has obtained letters of credit in favor of
      various unaffiliated insurance companies, regulatory authorities and other
      entities. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were approximately $30.0 million
      and $35.0 million of outstanding letters of credit.

CNA
      has
      entered into a limited number of guaranteed payment contracts, primarily
      relating to telecommunication and software services, amounting to approximately
      $22.0 million at December 31, 2005. Estimated future minimum payments under
      these contracts are as follows: $15.0 million in 2006 and $7.0 million in
      2007.

          of 2003, Loews Hotels sold a New York City property, the Metropolitan Hotel,
          for
          approximately $109.0 million. The Company recorded a pretax gain of
          approximately $90.2 million ($56.7 million after taxes) in the third quarter
          of
          2003. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes
          $55.7 million related to the operating results and gain on sale of the
          Metropolitan Hotel.

CNA

CNA
          has
          discontinued operations which consist of run-off insurance operations acquired
          in its merger with The Continental Corporation in 1995. The business consists
          of
          facultative property and casualty, treaty excess casualty and treaty pro-rata
          reinsurance with underlying exposure to a diverse, multi-line domestic

CNA’s accounting and reporting for discontinued operations is in accordance with
        APB No. 30, “Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of
        Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
        Occurring Events and Transactions.” At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the insurance
        reserves are net of discount of $104.9 million and $112.4 million. The income
        (loss) reported above primarily represents the net investment income, realized
        investment gains and losses and foreign currency gains and losses reduced
        by the
        effects of the accretion of the loss reserve discount and re-estimation of
        the

Business
                    Segments

The
          Company’s reportable segments are primarily based on its individual operating
          subsidiaries. Each of the principal operating subsidiaries are headed by
          a chief
          executive officer who is responsible for the operation of its business
          and has
          the duties and authority commensurate with that position. Investment gains
          (losses) and the related income taxes, excluding those of CNA Financial,
          are
          included in the Corporate and other segment.

CNA
      manages its property and casualty operations in two operating segments which
      represent CNA’s core operations: Standard Lines and Specialty Lines. The
      non-core operations are managed in Life and Group Non-Core Segment and Other
      Insurance Segment. Standard Lines includes standard property and casualty
      coverages sold to small and middle market commercial businesses primarily
      through an independent agency distribution system, and excess and surplus lines,
      as well as insurance and risk management products sold to large corporations
      in
      the U.S. and globally. Specialty Lines provides professional, financial and
      specialty property and casualty products and services. Life and Group Non-Core
      primarily includes the results of the life and group lines of business sold
      or
      placed in run-off. Other Insurance primarily includes the results of certain
      property and casualty lines of business placed in run-off, including CNA Re.
      This segment also includes the results related to the centralized adjusting
      and
      settlement of APMT claims as well as the results of CNA’s participation in
      voluntary insurance pools, which are primarily in run-off and various other
      non-insurance operations.

Lorillard
      is engaged in the production and sale of cigarettes with its principal products
      marketed under the brand names of Newport, Kent, True, Maverick and Old Gold
      with substantially all of its sales in the United States.

Boardwalk
      Pipeline owns and operates two interstate natural gas pipeline systems, with
      approximately 13,470 miles of pipeline, directly serving customers in 11 states
      and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern
      United States through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines.
      In
      2004, its pipeline systems transported approximately 1,380 Bcf of gas. Average
      daily throughput on its pipeline systems during 2004 was approximately 3.8
      Bcf.
      Its natural gas storage facilities are comprised of 11 underground storage
      fields located in four states with aggregate certificated working gas capacity
      of approximately 135 Bcf.

Diamond
      Offshore’s business primarily consists of operating 44 offshore drilling rigs
      that are chartered on a contract basis for fixed terms by companies engaged
      in
      exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Offshore rigs are mobile units
      that
      can be relocated based on market demand. As of December 31, 2005, 23 of these
      rigs were located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, 4 were located in Brazil, 4 were
      located in Mexico and the remaining 13 were located in various foreign
      markets.

Loews
      Hotels owns and/or operates 17 hotels, 15 of which are in the United States
      and
      two are in Canada.

The
      Corporate and other segment consists primarily of corporate investment income,
      including investment gains (losses) from non-insurance subsidiaries, the
      operations of Bulova Corporation which distributes and sells watches and clocks,
      equity earnings from shipping operations, as well as corporate interest expenses
      and other corporate administrative costs.

The
      accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
      summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, CNA does not maintain
      a
      distinct investment portfolio for each of its insurance segments, and
      accordingly, allocation of assets to each segment is not performed. Therefore,
      net investment income and investment gains (losses) are allocated based on
      each
      segment’s carried insurance reserves, as adjusted.

Consolidating
                Financial Information

The
      following schedules present the Company’s consolidating balance sheet
      information at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and consolidating statements of
      operations information for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.
      These schedules present the individual subsidiaries of the Company and their
      contribution to the consolidated financial statements. Amounts presented will
      not necessarily be the same as those in the individual financial statements
      of
      the Company’s subsidiaries due to adjustments for purchase accounting, income
      taxes and minority interests. In addition, many of the Company’s subsidiaries
      use a classified balance sheet which also leads to differences in amounts
      reported for certain line items. This information also does not reflect the
      impact of the Company’s issuance of Carolina Group stock. Lorillard is reported
      as a 100% owned subsidiary and does not include any adjustments relating to
      the
      tracking stock structure. See Note 6 for consolidating information of the
      Carolina Group and Loews Group.

The
      Corporate and Other column primarily reflects the parent company’s investment in
      its subsidiaries, invested cash portfolio, corporate long-term debt and Bulova
      Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary. The elimination adjustments are for
      intercompany assets and liabilities, interest and dividends, the parent
      company’s investment in capital stocks of subsidiaries, and various reclasses of
      debit or credit balances to the amounts in consolidation. Purchase accounting
      adjustments have been pushed down to the appropriate subsidiary.

Restatement
                  for Discontinued Operations and Classification of Cash
                  Flows

The
        Company has restated its previously reported financial statements as of December
        31, 2004 and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 and all related
        disclosures, as well as its financial data for the first three interim periods
        in 2005 and all interim periods in 2004.

The
        restatement is to correct the accounting for discontinued operations acquired
        in
        CNA’s merger with The Continental Corporation in 1995 and to correct
        classification errors within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Discontinued
        Operations

A
        recent
        review of discontinued operations identified an overstatement of the net
        assets
        of these discontinued operations and errors in accounting for the periodic
        results of these operations. CNA did not have an effectively designed control
        process in place to ensure adequate oversight, analysis, reconciliation,
        documentation and periodic evaluation of the results and balances that comprise
        the net assets of businesses reported as discontinued operations. There was
        also
        a lack of understanding of subsidiary ledger detail which contributed to
        CNA’s
        failure to eliminate intercompany activity within discontinued operations
        and
        between continuing and discontinued operations. As a result, the balances
        related to discontinued operations were incorrectly established in CNA’s current
        general ledger system in 1997 in connection with a general ledger conversion,
        creating an overstatement of the reported net assets of discontinued operations.
        In addition, CNA’s evaluation of the periodic results of discontinued operations
        was ineffective.

The
        effect of the restatement on the Consolidated Financial Statements is included
        in the tables below.

Consolidated
        Statements of Cash Flows

The
        Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2004
        and
        2003 have been restated to reflect the following:

·

CNA’s
                  net purchases and sales of trading securities and changes in the
                  net
                  receivable/payable from unsettled investment purchases and sales
                  related
                  to trading securities, previously classified within investing activities,
                  have been reclassified to cash flows from operating
                  activities.

·

CNA’s
                  cash flows from equity method investees were reclassified to distinguish
                  between return on investments, which are reflected within operating
                  cash
                  flows, and return of investments, which are reflected within investing
                  cash flows. Previously all amounts were reflected within investing
                  cash
                  flows.

·

Deposits
                  and withdrawals related to investment contract products issued by CNA
                  have been reflected within financing cash flows. Previously, amounts
                  related to certain investment contracts were reflected within operating
                  cash flows.

·

The
                  impact of the cumulative translation adjustment related to CNA,
                  previously
                  reflected within investing activities, is now classified within
                  operating
                  activities.

As
        a
        result of the restatements, previously reported cash flows from continuing
        operations provided (used) by operating activities, investing activities
        and
        financing activities were increased or decreased for the years ended December
        31, 2004 and 2003 as follows:

        portions of the cash flows attributable to discontinued operations, as well
        as
        to include the cash balance related to discontinued operations in the
        Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The
        restatements related to cash flows had no impact on the total change in cash
        from continuing operations within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Disclosure
            Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures
            (as defined
            in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
            1934, as amended (the

“

Exchange
            Act

”

))
            which is
            designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
            in
            reports that it files or submits under the federal securities laws, including
            this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely
            basis.
            These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures
            designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
            under the federal securities laws is accumulated and communicated to
            the
            Company’s management on a timely basis to allow decisions regarding required
            disclosure.

The
            Company’s principal executive officer (“CEO”) and principal financial officer
            (“CFO”) evaluated the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of
            December 31, 2005 and concluded that as a result of the material weaknesses
            in
            internal control over financial reporting described below, the Company

’

s
            disclosure
            controls and procedures were ineffective.

Internal Control Over Financial
          Reporting

Pursuant
            to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the implementing
            rules of
            the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company included a report
            of
            management’s assessment of the design and effectiveness of its internal controls
            as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
            2005. The independent registered public accounting firm of the Company
            also reported on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal
            control over financial reporting. Management’s report and the independent
            registered public accounting firm’s report are included on pages 58
            to 61 under the captions entitled “Management’s Report on Internal
            Control Over Financial Reporting” and “Report of Independent Registered Public
            Accounting Firm” and are incorporated herein by reference.

The
            Company has restated its financial results for the years 2001 through
            2004, as
            well as its interim financial statements through September 30, 2005,
            to correct
            the accounting for discontinued operations acquired in CNA

’

s merger
            with
            The Continental Corporation in 1995. CNA’s recent review of discontinued
            operations identified an overstatement of the net assets of these discontinued
            operations and errors in accounting for the periodic results of these
            operations. Based on this review, CNA has determined that it did not
            have an
            effectively designed control process in place to ensure adequate oversight,
            analysis, reconciliation, documentation and periodic evaluation of the
            results
            and balances that comprise the net assets of businesses reported as discontinued
            operations. There was also a lack of understanding of subsidiary ledger
            detail
            which contributed to CNA’s failure to eliminate intercompany activity within
            discontinued operations and between continuing and discontinued operations.
            As a
            result, the balances related to discontinued operations were incorrectly
            established in CNA’s current general ledger system in 1997 in connection with a
            general ledger conversion, creating an overstatement of the reported
            net assets
            of discontinued operations. In addition, CNA’s evaluation of the periodic
            results of discontinued operations was ineffective.

CNA
            has
            also determined that it did not have an effectively designed control
            process in
            place to ensure correct classification of all elements of cash flow activity
            in
            its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The classification errors
            involved
            the treatment of certain components of trading securities, equity method
            investees, investment contracts and cumulative translation adjustments. As
            a result, the Company’s net cash flows from continuing operations
            for operating, investing and financing activities were increased
            or decreased. This deficiency had no impact on the Company’s total change in
            cash from continuing operations within the Consolidated Statements of
            Cash
            Flows.

Since
            CNA
            identified the material weaknesses in its internal control over
            financial reporting described above, it has engaged in a number of remediation
            efforts. CNA has completed a comprehensive analysis of the activity


historically
            recorded related to its discontinued operations as well as a complete
            analysis
            of the components of its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, which
            resulted
            in the above described restatement. The control processes surrounding
            its
            oversight of discontinued operations as well as the preparation of CNA’s
            Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have been redesigned and
            strengthened. CNA’s control deficiencies will be fully remediated when, in CNA’s
            and the Company’s opinions, the revised control processes have been operating
            for a sufficient period of time to provide reasonable assurance as to
            their
            effectiveness.

This
            matter and its resolution have been discussed with the Audit Committee
            of the
            Company’s Board of Directors.

There
            were no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
            (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
            identified
            in connection with the foregoing evaluation that occurred during the
            quarter
            ended December 31, 2005, that have materially affected or that are reasonably
            likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial
            reporting.
